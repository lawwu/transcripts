[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480]   The following is a conversation with Peter White,
[00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.760]   a theoretical physicist at Columbia,
[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.640]   outspoken critic of string theory,
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.040]   and the author of the popular physics
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.560]   and mathematics blog called "Not Even Wrong."
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.600]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.600]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.760]   in the description.
[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.400]   And now, here's my conversation with Peter White.
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.360]   You're both a physicist and a mathematician.
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.040]   So let me ask, what is the difference
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.720]   between physics and mathematics?
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.800]   - Well, there's kind of a conventional understanding
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.320]   of the subject that they're two quite different things.
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.600]   So that mathematics is about making rigorous statements
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.600]   about these abstract things, things of mathematics,
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.400]   and proving them rigorously.
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.040]   And physics is about doing experiments
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.960]   and testing various models and that.
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.920]   But I think the more interesting thing
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.280]   is that there's a wide variety
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.560]   of what people do as mathematics,
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.560]   what they do as physics,
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.080]   and there's a significant overlap.
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.040]   And that I think is actually a very interesting area.
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.640]   And if you go back kind of far enough in history
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.800]   and look at figures like Newton or something,
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.320]   at that point, you can't really tell
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.200]   was Newton a physicist or a mathematician.
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.760]   The mathematicians will tell you he was a mathematician,
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.400]   the physicists will tell you he was a physicist.
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.520]   But he would say he's a philosopher.
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.200]   (laughing)
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.920]   Yeah, that's interesting.
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.440]   But yeah, anyway, there was kind of no such distinction
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.040]   then that's more of a modern thing.
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.120]   But anyway, I think these days,
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.120]   there's a very interesting space in between the two.
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.840]   - So in the story of the 20th century
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.400]   and the early 21st century,
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.680]   what is the overlap between mathematics and physics,
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.000]   would you say?
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.840]   - Well, I think it's actually become very, very complicated.
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.880]   I think it's really interesting to see a lot
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.760]   of what my colleagues in the math department are doing.
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.920]   They, most of what they're doing,
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.160]   they're doing all sorts of different things,
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.400]   but most of them have some kind of overlap
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.400]   with physics or other.
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.880]   So, I mean, I'm personally interested
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.680]   in one particular aspect of this overlap,
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.520]   which I think has a lot to do
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.320]   with the most fundamental ideas about physics
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.080]   and about mathematics.
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.520]   But there's just, you kind of see this,
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.920]   this really, really everywhere at this point.
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.480]   - Which particular overlap are you looking at, group theory?
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.320]   - Yeah, so the, at least what the way it seems to me
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.160]   that if you look at physics and look at the,
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.880]   our most successful laws of fundamental physics,
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.520]   they're really, you know,
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.360]   they have a certain kind of mathematical structure.
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.200]   It's based upon certain kinds of mathematical objects
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.720]   and geometry connections and curvature,
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.820]   the spinners, the Dirac equation.
[00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.400]   And that, these, this very deep mathematics
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.880]   provides kind of a unifying set of ways of thinking
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.800]   that allow you to make a unified theory of physics.
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.600]   But the interesting thing is that if you go to mathematics
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.640]   and look at what's been going on in mathematics
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.780]   the last 1,500 years, and even especially recently,
[00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.760]   there's a similarly, some kind of unifying ideas
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.840]   which bring together different areas of mathematics
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.520]   and which have been especially powerful
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.680]   in number theory recently.
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.680]   And there's a book, for instance,
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.040]   by Edward Frankel about love and math.
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.320]   - Yeah, that book's great.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.320]   I recommend it highly.
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.160]   It's partially accessible.
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.800]   But it is a nice audio book that I listened to
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.920]   while running an exceptionally long distance,
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.500]   like across the San Francisco Bridge.
[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.960]   And there's something magic about the way he writes about it
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.520]   but some of the group theory in there
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.240]   is a little bit difficult.
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.000]   - Yeah, that's the problem with any of these things,
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.920]   to kind of really say what's going on
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.880]   and make it accessible is very hard.
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.920]   He, in this book and elsewhere, I think,
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.680]   takes the attitude that kinds of mathematics
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.000]   he's interested in and that he's talking about
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.280]   are provide kind of a grand unified theory of mathematics.
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.200]   They bring together geometry and number theory
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.880]   and representation theory, a lot of different ideas
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.760]   in a really unexpected way.
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.460]   But I think to me, the most fascinating thing
[00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.880]   is if you look at the kind of grand unified theory
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.480]   of mathematics he's talking about
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.560]   and you look at the physicist's kind of ideas
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.840]   about unification, it's more or less
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.600]   the same mathematical objects are appearing in both.
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.880]   So it's this, I think there's a really,
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.440]   we're seeing a really strong indication
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.240]   that the deepest ideas that we're discovering about physics
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.520]   and some of the deepest ideas
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.200]   that mathematicians are learning about
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.120]   are really, are intimately connected.
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.840]   - Is there something, like if I was five years old
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.600]   and you were trying to explain this to me,
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.440]   is there ways to try to sneak up
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.360]   to what this unified world of mathematics looks like?
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.160]   You said number theory, you said geometry,
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.480]   words like topology.
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.480]   What does this universe begin to look like?
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.480]   Are these, what should we imagine in our mind?
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.800]   Is it a three-dimensional surface?
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.200]   And we're trying to say something about it.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.280]   Is it triangles and squares and cubes?
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.440]   Like what are we supposed to imagine in our minds?
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.520]   Is this natural number?
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.840]   What's a good thing to try to,
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.760]   for people that don't know any of these tools
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.960]   except maybe some basic calculus and geometry
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.200]   from high school, that they should keep in their minds
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.840]   as to the unified world of mathematics
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.000]   that also allows us to explore
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.560]   the unified world of physics?
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.080]   - I mean, what I find kind of remarkable about this
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:38.080]   is the way in which these, we've discovered these ideas,
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.240]   but they're actually quite alien
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.240]   to our everyday understanding.
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.600]   You know, we grow up in this three-spatial dimensional world
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.480]   and we have intimate understanding
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.440]   of certain kinds of geometry and certain kinds of things,
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.520]   but these things that we've discovered
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.040]   in both math and physics are,
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.280]   that they're not at all close,
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.800]   have any obvious connection
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.640]   to kind of human everyday experience.
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.000]   They're really quite different.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   And I can say some of my initial fascination with this
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.360]   when I was young and starting to learn about it
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:13.360]   was actually exactly this kind of arcane nature
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.960]   of these things.
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.400]   It's a little bit like being told,
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.000]   well, there are these kind of semi-mystical experience
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.320]   that you can acquire by a long study and whatever,
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.720]   except that it was actually true
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.520]   and there's actually evidence that this actually works.
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.240]   So, I'm a little bit wary of trying to give people
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.160]   that kind of thing, 'cause I think it's mostly misleading.
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.440]   But one thing to say is that, you know,
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.840]   that geometry is a large part of it.
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.240]   And maybe one interesting thing to say
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.760]   that's about more recent, some of the most recent ideas
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.400]   is that when we think about the geometry
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.000]   of our space and time,
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.360]   it's kind of three spatial and one time dimension.
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.720]   It's a, physics is in some sense
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:00.760]   about something that's kind of four dimensional in a way.
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.680]   And a really interesting thing
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.120]   about some of the recent developments in number theory
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.920]   have been to realize that these ideas
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.720]   that we were looking at naturally fit into a context
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.840]   where your theory is kind of four dimensional.
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.800]   So, I mean, geometry is a big part of this
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.120]   and we know a lot and feel a lot about, you know,
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.600]   two, one, two, three dimensional geometry.
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.560]   - So, wait a minute.
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:30.280]   So, we can at least rely on the four dimensions
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.920]   of space and time and say that we can get pretty far
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.640]   by working that in those four dimensions?
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:36.720]   I thought you were gonna scare me
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.280]   that we're gonna have to go to many, many, many, many
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.080]   more dimensions than that.
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:44.160]   - My point of view, which goes against a lot of these ideas
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.480]   about unification is that, no, this is really,
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:50.600]   everything we know about really is about four dimensions
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:54.320]   that, and that you can actually understand
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.000]   a lot of these structures that we've been seeing
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.040]   in fundamental physics and in number theory,
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:01.480]   just in terms of four dimensions,
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.560]   that it's kind of, it's in some sense,
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:07.440]   I would claim has been a really,
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.800]   has been kind of a mistake that physicists have made
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.840]   in, for decades and decades, to try to,
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:16.560]   to try to go to higher dimensions,
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.040]   to try to formulate a theory in higher dimensions,
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.600]   and then you're stuck with the problem
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.400]   of how do you get rid of all these extra dimensions
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:26.440]   that you've created, 'cause we only ever see anything
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:27.440]   in four dimensions.
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.960]   - That kind of thing leads us astray, you think?
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.800]   So, creating all these extra dimensions just to get,
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:34.760]   give yourself extra degrees of freedom.
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.640]   - Yeah.
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.400]   - I mean, isn't that the process of mathematics,
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:41.320]   is to create all these trajectories for yourself,
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.440]   but eventually you have to end up at the,
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:47.040]   at like a final place, but it's okay to,
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:52.640]   it's okay to sort of create abstract objects
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.920]   on your path to proving something.
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.280]   - Yeah, yeah, certainly, but,
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:59.640]   and from a mathematician's point of view,
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:01.360]   I mean, the kinds of,
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.480]   mathematicians are also very different than physicists
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.080]   in that we like to develop very general theories.
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.240]   We like to, if we have an idea,
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.720]   we want to see what's the greatest generality
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.200]   in which you can talk about it.
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.760]   So, from the point of view of most of the ways
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:17.040]   geometry is formulated by mathematicians,
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:19.120]   it really doesn't matter, it works in any dimension.
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:22.120]   We can do one, two, three, four, any number.
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.840]   There's no particular, for most of geometry,
[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:28.240]   there's no particular special thing about four,
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:33.000]   but anyway, but what physicists have been trying
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.800]   to do over the years is try to understand
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.320]   these fundamental theories in a geometrical way,
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:41.960]   and it's very tempting to kind of just start bringing in
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:46.240]   extra dimensions and using them to explain the structure,
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:51.240]   but typically this attempt kind of founders
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:53.380]   because you just don't know,
[00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:57.160]   you end up not being able to explain why we only see four.
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:02.360]   - It is nice in the space of physics that,
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.560]   like if you look at Fermat's last theorem,
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.680]   it's much easier to prove that there's no solution
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:10.760]   for n equals three than it is for the general case,
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:16.360]   and so I guess that's the nice benefit of being a physicist
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.640]   is you don't have to worry about the general case
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:22.160]   'cause we live in a universe with n equals four,
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.440]   in this case.
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:27.880]   - Yeah, physicists are very interested in saying something
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:31.440]   about specific examples, and I find that interesting.
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.760]   When I'm trying to do things in mathematics,
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.320]   when I'm trying even teaching courses
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:36.920]   and to mathematics students,
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:40.200]   I find that I'm teaching them in a different way
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:43.880]   than most mathematicians because I'm very often
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:47.320]   very focused on examples, on what's kind of
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:51.760]   the crucial example that shows how this powerful
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.480]   new mathematical technique, how it works,
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.680]   and why you would want to do it,
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:00.040]   and I'm less interested in kind of proving a precise theorem
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:01.400]   about exactly when it's gonna work
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:02.440]   and when it's not gonna work.
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:05.160]   - Do you usually think about really simple examples,
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:09.080]   like both for teaching and when you try to solve
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.480]   a difficult problem?
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.040]   Are you, do you construct the simplest possible examples
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.840]   that captures the fundamentals of the problem
[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:15.720]   and try to solve it?
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.080]   - Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:20.080]   That's often a really fruitful way to,
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:23.920]   if you've got some idea, to just kind of try to boil it down
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:27.840]   to what's the simplest situation in which this kind of thing
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:30.440]   is gonna happen and then try to really understand that
[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.520]   and that is almost always a really good way
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:34.520]   to get insight into it.
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:37.760]   - Do you work with paper and pen or, like, for example,
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:41.600]   for me, coming from the programming side,
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.880]   if I look at a model, if I look at some kind
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:48.120]   of mathematical object, I like to mess around with it
[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.640]   sort of numerically.
[00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:51.680]   I just visualize different parts of it,
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:54.200]   visualize however I can, so most of the work
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.200]   is like with neural networks, for example,
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:59.400]   is you try to play with the simplest possible example
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:03.440]   and just to build up intuition by, you know,
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:05.880]   any kind of object has a bunch of variables in it.
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:09.040]   You start to mess around with them in different ways
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.960]   and visualize in different ways to start to build intuition.
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:16.960]   Or do you go the Einstein route and just imagine, like,
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:20.240]   everything inside your mind and sort of build, like,
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:24.840]   thought experiments and then work purely on paper and pen?
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:28.120]   - Well, the problem with this kind of stuff
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:31.880]   I'm interested in is you rarely can kind of,
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:34.800]   it's rarely something that is really kind of,
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:37.840]   or even the simplest example, you know,
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.200]   you can kind of see what's going on
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:42.280]   by looking at something happening in three dimensions.
[00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:44.920]   There's generally the structures involved are,
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:49.000]   either they're more abstract or if you try to kind of
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.440]   embed them in some kind of space where you could
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:55.200]   manipulate them in some kind of geometrical way,
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.320]   it's gonna be a much higher dimensional space.
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:00.120]   - So even simple examples,
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:02.080]   the embedding them into three dimensional space,
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:03.040]   you're losing a lot.
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:06.960]   - Yeah, but to capture what you're trying to understand
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:09.720]   about them, you have to go to four or more dimensions.
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.040]   So it starts to get to be hard to,
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:15.680]   and you can train yourself to try it as much as to kind of
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:18.200]   think about things in your mind.
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:21.000]   And, you know, I often use pad and paper
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.440]   and I'm often, in my office I often use the blackboard.
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:26.920]   And you are kind of drawing things,
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:29.600]   but they're really kind of more abstract representations
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.560]   of how things are supposed to fit together.
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:35.240]   And they're not really, unfortunately,
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:37.640]   not just kind of really living in three dimensions
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:39.200]   where you can understand.
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:41.600]   - Are we supposed to be sad or excited
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:44.120]   by the fact that our human minds can't fully comprehend
[00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:46.000]   the kind of mathematics you're talking about?
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.720]   I mean, what do we make of that?
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.720]   I mean, to me, that makes me quite sad.
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:52.680]   It makes me, it makes it seem like
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:53.960]   there's a giant mystery out there
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.320]   that we'll never truly get to experience directly.
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:01.720]   - It is kind of sad, you know, how difficult this is.
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:04.040]   I mean, or I would put it a different way that,
[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:07.440]   you know, most questions that people have about
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:10.680]   this kind of thing, you know, you can give them
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:13.080]   a really, a true answer and really understand it,
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:16.600]   but the problem is one more of time.
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.600]   It's like, yes, you know, I could explain to you
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.360]   how this works, but you'd have to be willing to
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:25.080]   sit down with me and, you know, work at this repeatedly
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:28.040]   for, you know, for hours and days and weeks.
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:30.920]   And you'd have, I mean, it's just gonna take that long
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:34.400]   for your mind to really wrap itself around what's going on.
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:38.480]   And that, so that does make things inaccessible,
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:43.040]   which is sad, but I mean, it's just kind of part of life
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:45.040]   that we all have a limited amount of time
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:47.720]   and we have to decide what we're gonna,
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.800]   what we're gonna spend our time doing.
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:52.320]   - Speaking of a limited amount of time,
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:55.640]   we only have a few hours, maybe a few days together
[00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:56.880]   here on this podcast.
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:02.320]   Let me ask you the question of amongst many of the ideas
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:05.240]   that you work on in mathematics and physics,
[00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:07.560]   what is the most beautiful idea,
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:11.200]   or one of the most beautiful ideas, maybe a surprising idea?
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:13.960]   And once again, unfortunately, the way life works,
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:15.680]   we only have a limited time together
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:18.440]   to try to convey such an idea.
[00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:21.760]   - Okay, well, actually, let me just tell you something,
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:25.240]   which I've attempted to kind of start trying to explain
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:26.960]   what I think is this most powerful idea
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.600]   that brings together math and physics,
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.040]   ideas about groups and representations
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:33.200]   and how it fits to quantum mechanics.
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.560]   But in some sense, I wrote a whole textbook about that,
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.440]   and I don't think we really have time
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.080]   to get very far into it, so.
[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:41.080]   - Well, can I actually, on a small tangent,
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:42.520]   you did write a paper towards
[00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:45.080]   the Grant Unified Theory of Mathematics and Physics.
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:47.840]   Maybe you could step there first.
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:49.520]   What is the key idea in that paper?
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:51.480]   - Well, I think we've kind of gone over that.
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:52.600]   I think that the key idea
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:54.040]   is what we were talking about earlier,
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:58.400]   that just kind of a claim that if you look
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.480]   and see what's the have been successful ideas
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:05.200]   of unification in physics over the last 50 years or so,
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:07.800]   and what has been happening in mathematics
[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:10.840]   and the kind of thing that Frankl's book is about,
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:13.040]   that these are very much the same kind of mathematics.
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:16.460]   And so it's kind of an argument that there really is,
[00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:19.760]   you shouldn't be looking to unify just math
[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:21.880]   or just fundamental physics,
[00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:24.640]   but taking inspiration for looking for new ideas
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:25.600]   in fundamental physics,
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:27.400]   that they are gonna be in the same direction
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:30.240]   of getting deeper into mathematics
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:33.320]   and looking for more inspiration in mathematics
[00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:37.340]   from these successful ideas about fundamental physics.
[00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:39.520]   - Could you put words to sort of the disciplines
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:40.440]   we're trying to unify?
[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:41.960]   So you said number theory.
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:43.160]   Are we literally talking about
[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.080]   all the major fields of mathematics?
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:48.320]   So it's like the number theory, geometry,
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:51.040]   so like differential geometry, topology?
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:55.240]   - Yeah, so the, I mean, one name for this,
[00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.640]   that this is acquired in mathematics
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:59.800]   is the so-called Langlands program.
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:02.000]   And so this started out in mathematics.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.160]   It's that, you know, Robert Langlands kind of realized
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.840]   that a lot of what people were doing in,
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:10.960]   that was starting to be really successful
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:13.640]   in number theory in the '60s.
[00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:17.820]   And so that this actually was,
[00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:21.160]   anyway, that this could be thought of
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:24.120]   in terms of these ideas about symmetry
[00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:26.120]   in groups and representations,
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:29.600]   and in a way that was also close
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:32.040]   to some ideas about geometry.
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:35.200]   And then more later on in the '80s and '90s,
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:38.120]   there was something called geometric Langlands
[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:40.480]   that people realized that you could take
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:43.120]   what people have been doing in number theory in Langlands
[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:45.560]   and get rid, just forget about the number theory
[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:47.960]   and ask, what is this telling you about geometry?
[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:49.960]   And you get a whole, some new insights
[00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:52.360]   into certain kinds of geometry that way.
[00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:55.560]   So it's, anyway, that's kind of the name for this area
[00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:58.080]   is Langlands and geometric Langlands.
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:59.680]   And just recently in the last few months,
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:02.760]   there's been, there's kind of a really major paper
[00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:06.660]   that appeared by Peter Schultze and Laurent Farg,
[00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:09.560]   where they, you know, made, you know,
[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:12.920]   some serious advance and try to understand
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:15.960]   very much kind of a local problem
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:17.960]   of what happens in number theory
[00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:19.720]   near a certain prime number.
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:22.000]   And they turned this into a problem
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   of exactly the kind that geometric Langlands people
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.840]   had been doing, this kind of pure geometry problem.
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:32.320]   And they found by generalizing the mathematics,
[00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.240]   they could actually reformulate it in that way,
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.640]   and it worked perfectly well.
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:40.600]   - One of the things that makes me sad is, you know,
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:44.880]   I'm a pretty knowledgeable person in the,
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:47.960]   what is it, at least I'm in the neighborhood
[00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.480]   of like theoretical computer science, right?
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.320]   And it's still way out of my reach.
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.920]   And so many people talk about, like Langlands, for example,
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:57.640]   is one of the most brilliant people in mathematics
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:59.960]   and just really admire his work.
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:03.720]   And I can't, it's like almost I can't hear the music
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.800]   that he composed, and it makes me sad.
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:09.000]   - Yeah, well, I mean, I think that, unfortunately,
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.200]   it's not just you, it's I think even most mathematicians
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.120]   have no, really don't actually understand
[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:15.960]   what this is about.
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:19.400]   I mean, the group of people who really understand
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:21.040]   all these ideas, and so for instance,
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:23.280]   this paper of Schultz and Farag,
[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:24.840]   that I was talking about, the number of people
[00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:28.320]   who really actually understand how that works is,
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:30.960]   anyway, very, very small.
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:34.080]   And so it's, so I think even you find,
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:35.840]   if you talk to mathematicians and physicists,
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:37.960]   even they will often feel that, you know,
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:40.280]   there's this really interesting sounding stuff going on,
[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:42.840]   and which I should be able to understand.
[00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:44.960]   It's kind of in my own field I have a PhD in,
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:48.340]   but it still seems pretty clearly far beyond me right now.
[00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:51.800]   - Well, if we can step into the,
[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:54.040]   back to the question of beauty,
[00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:58.480]   is there an idea that maybe is a little bit smaller
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:19:59.960]   that you find beautiful in the space
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.760]   of mathematics or physics?
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:03.320]   - There's an idea that, you know,
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:05.280]   I kind of went, got a physics PhD
[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:07.080]   and spent a lot of time learning about mathematics.
[00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:09.960]   And I guess it was embarrassing
[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:11.680]   that I hadn't really actually understood
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:14.480]   this very simple idea until,
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:15.560]   and kind of learned it
[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:18.120]   when I actually started teaching math classes,
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:21.440]   which is maybe that there,
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:23.760]   maybe there's a simple way to explain
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:26.080]   kind of the fundamental way in which algebra
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:28.040]   and geometry are connected.
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:29.960]   So you normally think of geometry
[00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:32.560]   as about these spaces and these points,
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:36.400]   and you think of algebra as this very abstract thing
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.760]   about these abstract objects
[00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:40.640]   that satisfy certain kinds of relations.
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:44.320]   You can multiply them and add them and do stuff,
[00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:45.960]   but it's completely abstract.
[00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:47.680]   It has nothing geometric about it.
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:51.640]   But the kind of really fundamental idea
[00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:54.640]   is that unifies algebra and geometry
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:57.200]   is to realize, is to think,
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:00.800]   whenever anybody gives you what you call an algebra,
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:04.280]   some abstract thing of things that you can multiply and add,
[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:06.400]   that you should ask yourself,
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:10.640]   is that algebra the space of functions on some geometry?
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:12.600]   So one of the most surprising examples of this,
[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:16.880]   for instance, is a standard kind of thing
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:18.680]   that seems to have nothing to do with geometry
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:22.000]   is the integers.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.800]   So you can multiply them and add them.
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:27.440]   It's an algebra,
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:31.040]   but it seems to have nothing to do with geometry.
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:32.200]   But what you can, it turns out,
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.760]   but if you ask yourself this question
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:36.280]   and ask, is our integers,
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:37.800]   can you think if somebody gives you an integer,
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:40.840]   can you think of it as a function on some space,
[00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:42.240]   on some geometry?
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:44.320]   And it turns out that yes, you can.
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:47.280]   And the space is the space of prime numbers.
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:48.640]   And so what you do is you just,
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.440]   if somebody gives you an integer,
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:53.160]   you can make a function on the prime numbers
[00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:55.360]   by just at each prime number,
[00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:58.920]   taking that integer modulo, that prime.
[00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:00.880]   So if, as you say, I don't know,
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:03.840]   if you're given 10, you know, 10,
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:05.600]   and you ask what is its value at two?
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:07.920]   Well, it's five times two.
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:09.680]   So mod two, it's zero.
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:10.680]   So it has zero one.
[00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:13.680]   What is its value at three?
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:15.240]   Well, it's nine plus one.
[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:17.440]   So it's one mod three.
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:19.960]   So it's zero at two, it's one at three,
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:21.920]   and you can kind of keep going.
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:26.920]   And so this is really kind of a truly fundamental idea.
[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:29.280]   It's at the basis of what's called algebraic geometry.
[00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:31.400]   And it just links these two parts of mathematics
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:32.920]   that look completely different.
[00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:35.120]   And it's just an incredibly powerful idea.
[00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:37.240]   And so much of mathematics emerges
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.760]   from this kind of simple relation.
[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:41.760]   - So you're talking about mapping
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:44.520]   from one discrete space to another.
[00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:49.600]   For a second, I thought perhaps mapping
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.600]   like a continuous space to a discrete space,
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:53.600]   like functions over a continuous space.
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:56.320]   'Cause, yeah.
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:00.000]   - Well, you can take, if somebody gives you a space,
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.200]   you can ask, you can say, well, let's,
[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:05.240]   and this is also, this is part of the same idea.
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:06.440]   The part of the same idea is that
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:08.160]   if you try and do geometry
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:10.560]   and somebody tells you here's a space,
[00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:11.920]   that what you should do is you should wait.
[00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:12.760]   So say, wait a minute,
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:15.760]   maybe I should be trying to solve this using algebra.
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:18.280]   And so if I do that, the way to start is
[00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:19.680]   you give me the space,
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:22.320]   I start to think about the functions of the space.
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:24.240]   Okay, so for each point in the space,
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:26.160]   I associate a number.
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:27.640]   I can take different kinds of functions
[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:29.120]   and different kinds of values,
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:31.600]   but basically functions on a space.
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:36.320]   So what this insight is telling you is that
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:37.320]   if you're a geometer,
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:41.200]   often the way to work is to change your problem
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:43.200]   into algebra by changing your space.
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:45.960]   Stop thinking about your space and the points in it
[00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:48.240]   and think about the functions on it.
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:49.800]   And if you're an algebraist
[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:52.260]   and you've got these abstract algebraic gadgets
[00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:54.040]   that you're multiplying and adding,
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:57.040]   say, wait a minute, are those gadgets,
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:59.720]   can I think of them in some way as a function on a space?
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:00.800]   What would that space be?
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:02.920]   And what kind of functions would they be?
[00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:06.780]   And that going back and forth really brings these two
[00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:09.640]   completely different looking areas of mathematics together.
[00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:12.360]   - Do you have particular examples
[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:15.040]   where it allowed to prove some difficult things
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:16.800]   by jumping from one to the other?
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:19.720]   Is that something that's a part of modern mathematics
[00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:21.720]   where such jumps are made?
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:23.440]   - Oh, yes, this is kind of all the time.
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.400]   A lot, much of modern number theory
[00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:27.220]   is kind of based on this idea.
[00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:29.940]   But, and when you start doing this,
[00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:31.680]   you start to realize that you need,
[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:37.560]   what simple things on one side of the algebra
[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:40.280]   start to require you to think about
[00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:42.400]   the other side about geometry in a new way.
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:44.160]   You have to kind of get a more sophisticated idea
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:45.000]   about geometry.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.140]   Or if you start thinking about the functions on a space,
[00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:52.040]   you may need a more sophisticated kind of algebra.
[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:53.980]   But in some sense, I mean,
[00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:55.580]   much or most of modern number theory
[00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:58.940]   is based upon this move to geometry.
[00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:01.260]   And there's also a lot of geometry
[00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:03.200]   and topology is also based upon.
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:05.060]   Yeah, change, change.
[00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:06.820]   If you wanna understand the topology of something,
[00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:09.500]   you look at the functions, you do Durham cohomology,
[00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:11.400]   and you get the topology.
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:13.660]   Anyway.
[00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:16.260]   - Well, let me ask you then the ridiculous question.
[00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:18.980]   You said that this idea is beautiful.
[00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:22.700]   Can you formalize the definition of the word beautiful?
[00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:24.300]   And why is this beautiful?
[00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:26.260]   Like, first, why is this beautiful?
[00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:29.740]   And second, what is beautiful?
[00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:32.340]   - Yeah, well, I think there are many different things
[00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:34.140]   you can find beautiful for different reasons.
[00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:36.300]   I mean, I think in this context,
[00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:40.180]   the notion of beauty, I think really is just kind of,
[00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:44.220]   an idea is beautiful if it packages a huge amount
[00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:48.820]   of kind of power and information into something very simple.
[00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:53.820]   So in some sense, you can almost kind of try and measure it
[00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:58.340]   in the sense of what are the implications of this idea?
[00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:00.900]   What non-trivial things does it tell you
[00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:05.900]   versus how simply can you express the idea?
[00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:08.560]   - So the level of compression,
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:12.420]   what is it, correlates with beauty?
[00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:15.020]   - Yeah, that's one aspect of it.
[00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:16.860]   And so you can start to tell that an idea
[00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:21.100]   is becoming uglier and uglier as you start kind of having to,
[00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:22.420]   you know, it doesn't quite do what you want,
[00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:24.580]   so you throw in something else to the idea
[00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:27.380]   and you keep doing that until you get what you want.
[00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:29.580]   But that's how you know you're doing something uglier
[00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:34.580]   and uglier, when you have to kind of keep adding in more,
[00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:38.540]   more into what was originally a fairly simple idea
[00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:40.420]   and making it more and more complicated
[00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:41.860]   to get what you want.
[00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:45.380]   - Okay, so let's put some philosophical words on the table
[00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:47.100]   and try to make some sense of them.
[00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:49.780]   One word is beauty, another one is simplicity,
[00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:52.240]   as you mentioned, another one is truth.
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:57.060]   So do you have a sense, if I give you two theories,
[00:26:57.060 --> 00:27:01.400]   one is simpler, one is more complicated.
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:05.820]   Do you have a sense of which one is more likely to be true
[00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:10.820]   to capture deeply the fabric of reality?
[00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:15.060]   The simple one or the more complicated one?
[00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:18.540]   - Yeah, I think all of our evidence,
[00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:20.100]   what we see in the history of the subject
[00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:24.460]   is the simpler one, though often it's a surprise,
[00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:26.300]   it's simpler in a surprising way,
[00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:29.840]   but yeah, that we just don't, we just,
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:34.140]   anyway, the kind of best theories we've been coming up with
[00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:37.500]   are ultimately, when properly understood,
[00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:40.220]   relatively simple and much, much simpler
[00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:41.860]   than you would expect them to be.
[00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:43.500]   - Do you have a good explanation why that is?
[00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:46.020]   Is it just 'cause humans want it to be that way?
[00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:47.540]   Are we just like ultra-biased
[00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:51.100]   and we just kinda convince ourselves
[00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:53.740]   that simple is better 'cause we find simplicity beautiful?
[00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:57.340]   Or is there something about our actual universe
[00:27:57.340 --> 00:28:00.060]   that at the core is simple?
[00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:02.500]   - My own belief is that there is something about
[00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:05.260]   a universe that's simple, and as I was trying to say,
[00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:07.260]   that there is some kind of fundamental thing
[00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:10.500]   about math, physics, and physics, and all this picture,
[00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:14.460]   which is in some sense simple.
[00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:18.580]   It's true that, it's of course true that our minds
[00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:22.340]   have certain, are very limited and can certainly do
[00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:26.500]   certain things and not others, so it's in principle possible
[00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:29.380]   that there's some great insight,
[00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:31.300]   there are a lot of insights into the way the world works,
[00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:32.700]   which just aren't accessible to us
[00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:35.540]   because that's not the way our minds work, we don't,
[00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:37.340]   and that what we're seeing, this kind of simplicity,
[00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:41.300]   is just because that's all we ever have any hope of seeing.
[00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:46.100]   - So there's a brilliant physicist
[00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:49.020]   by the name of Sabine Hasenfelder,
[00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:51.020]   who both agrees and disagrees with you,
[00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:56.020]   or I suppose agrees that the final answer will be simple.
[00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:58.300]   - Yeah.
[00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:01.580]   - But simplicity and beauty leads us astray
[00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:04.840]   in the local pockets of scientific progress.
[00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:08.700]   Do you agree with her disagreement,
[00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:11.140]   do you disagree with her agreement?
[00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:14.180]   And agree with the agreement, and so on.
[00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:17.700]   - Yes, I found it was really fascinating reading her book,
[00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:21.420]   and anyway, I was finding disagreeing with a lot,
[00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:23.340]   but then at the end when she says yes,
[00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:26.580]   when we find, when we actually figure this out,
[00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:31.220]   it will be simple, and okay, so we agree in the end.
[00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:32.860]   - But does beauty lead us astray,
[00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:37.620]   which is the core thesis of her work in that book?
[00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:41.140]   - I actually, I guess I do disagree with her on that so much.
[00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:42.620]   I don't think, and especially,
[00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:44.580]   and I actually fairly strongly disagree with her
[00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:47.180]   about sometimes the way she'll refer to math,
[00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:50.340]   and so the problem is, you know,
[00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:52.580]   physicists and people in general just refer to it as math,
[00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:56.140]   and they're often, they're often meaning
[00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:57.220]   not what I would call math,
[00:29:57.220 --> 00:29:59.160]   which is the interesting ideas of math,
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:02.580]   but just some complicated calculation,
[00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:07.580]   and so I guess my feeling about it is more that it's very,
[00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:11.140]   the problem with talking about simplicity
[00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:14.720]   and using simplicity as a guide is that it's very,
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:17.620]   it's very easy to fool yourself,
[00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:22.620]   and it's very easy to decide to fall in love with an idea,
[00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:26.020]   you have an idea, you think, oh, this is great,
[00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:26.940]   and you fall in love with it,
[00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:29.500]   and it's like any kind of love affair,
[00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:31.540]   it's very easy to believe that you're,
[00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:33.700]   the object of your affections is much more beautiful
[00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:36.660]   than the others might think, and that they really are,
[00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:39.380]   and that's very, very easy to do,
[00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:43.980]   so if you say I'm just gonna pursue ideas about beauty
[00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:46.460]   and this, and mathematics and this,
[00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:49.500]   it's extremely easy to just fool yourself, I think,
[00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:52.380]   and I think that's a lot of what,
[00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:54.940]   the story she was thinking of
[00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:56.260]   about where people have gone astray,
[00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:59.100]   that I think it's, I would argue that it's more people,
[00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:01.980]   it's not that there was some simple, powerful,
[00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:03.660]   wonderful idea which they'd found,
[00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:05.400]   and it turned out not to be,
[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:08.900]   not to be useful, but it was more
[00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:10.340]   that they kind of fooled themselves
[00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:13.060]   that this was actually a better idea than it really was,
[00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:15.180]   and that it was simpler and more beautiful
[00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:17.700]   than it really was, is a lot of the story.
[00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:20.300]   - I see, so it's not that the simplicity
[00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:22.380]   would be, leads us astray, is it just people,
[00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:25.100]   are people and they fall in love
[00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:27.180]   with whatever idea they have,
[00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:30.220]   and then they weave narratives around that idea,
[00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:31.500]   or they present it in such a way
[00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:36.500]   that emphasizes the simplicity and the beauty?
[00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:37.920]   - Yeah, that's part of it,
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:39.980]   but the thing about physics that you have
[00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:44.140]   is that you, what really can tell,
[00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:46.100]   if you can do an experiment and check
[00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:50.820]   and see if nature is really doing what your idea expects,
[00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:54.020]   then you do in principle have a way of really testing it,
[00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:56.140]   and it's certainly true that if you,
[00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:59.300]   you know, if you thought you had a simple idea
[00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:01.900]   and that doesn't work and you got into an experiment
[00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:04.120]   and what actually does work is some more,
[00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:05.900]   maybe some more complicated version of it,
[00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:10.780]   that can certainly happen, and that can be true.
[00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:13.140]   I think her emphasis is more,
[00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:14.580]   that I don't really disagree with,
[00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:19.380]   is that people should be concentrating on,
[00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:21.980]   when they're trying to develop better theories,
[00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:25.740]   on more on self-consistency, not so much on beauty,
[00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:28.300]   but, you know, not is this idea beautiful,
[00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:30.380]   but is there something about the theory
[00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:32.460]   which is not quite consistent,
[00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:35.340]   and use that as a guide,
[00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:37.980]   that there's something wrong there which needs fixing.
[00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:40.700]   And so I think that part of her argument,
[00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:43.380]   I think I was, we're on the same page about.
[00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:47.460]   - What is consistency and inconsistencies?
[00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:52.460]   What exactly, do you have examples in mind?
[00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:55.660]   - Well, it can be just simple inconsistency
[00:32:55.660 --> 00:32:57.820]   between theory and experiment,
[00:32:57.820 --> 00:33:00.960]   that if you, so we have this great fundamental theory,
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:02.940]   but there are some things that we see out there
[00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:04.180]   which don't seem to fit in it,
[00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:07.460]   like dark energy and dark matter, for instance.
[00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:08.280]   But if there's something
[00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:09.560]   which you can't test experimentally,
[00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:12.000]   I think she would argue, and I would agree,
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.100]   that for instance, if you're trying to think about gravity
[00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:17.380]   and how are you gonna have a quantum theory of gravity,
[00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:19.940]   you should kind of be, you know,
[00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:24.580]   test any of your ideas with kind of a thought experiment.
[00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:26.780]   Is, does this actually give a consistent picture
[00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:27.940]   of what's gonna happen,
[00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:31.080]   of what happens in this particular situation or not?
[00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:35.060]   - So this is a good example, you've written about this.
[00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:38.340]   You know, since quantum gravitational effects
[00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:43.340]   are really small, super small, arguably unobservably small,
[00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:46.480]   should we have hope to arrive
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:49.580]   at a theory of quantum gravity somehow?
[00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:51.540]   What are the different ways we can get there?
[00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:53.340]   You've mentioned that you're not as interested
[00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:56.940]   in that effort because basically, yes,
[00:33:56.940 --> 00:34:01.940]   you cannot have ways to scientifically validate
[00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:04.160]   given the tools of today.
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:05.580]   - Yeah, I've actually, you know,
[00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:07.340]   I've over the years certainly spent a lot of time
[00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:10.300]   learning about gravity and about attempts to quantize it,
[00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:13.580]   but it hasn't been that much in the past
[00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:16.020]   the focus of what I've been thinking about.
[00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:18.740]   But I mean, my feeling was always, you know,
[00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:21.260]   as I think Spina would agree,
[00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:24.140]   that the, you know, one way you can pursue this
[00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:27.380]   if you can't do experiments is just
[00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:29.100]   this kind of search for consistency.
[00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:31.260]   You know, it can be remarkably hard
[00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:34.980]   to come up with a completely consistent model of this
[00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:37.420]   and a way that brings together quantum mechanics
[00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:39.540]   and general relativity.
[00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:42.700]   And that's, I think, kind of been the traditional way
[00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:44.440]   that people who have pursued quantum gravity
[00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:46.340]   have often pursued, you know,
[00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:52.180]   we have the best route to finding a consistent
[00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:53.260]   theory of quantum gravity.
[00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:55.780]   And string theorists will tell you this,
[00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:58.060]   other people will tell you that it's,
[00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:00.300]   it's kind of what people argue about.
[00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:03.340]   But the problem with all of that is that you end up,
[00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:07.180]   the danger is that you end up with,
[00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:10.100]   that everybody could be successful.
[00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:14.180]   Everybody's program for how to find
[00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:15.540]   a theory of quantum gravity, you know,
[00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:18.500]   ends up with something that is consistent.
[00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:20.740]   And so, and in some sense, you could argue
[00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:22.420]   this is what happened to the string theorists.
[00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:25.380]   They solved their problem of finding
[00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:27.020]   a consistent theory of quantum gravity,
[00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:30.260]   and they ended up, but they found 10 of the 500 solutions.
[00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:34.620]   So you, you know, if you believe that everything
[00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:35.940]   that they would like to be true is true,
[00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:38.340]   well, okay, you've got a theory,
[00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:41.080]   but it ends up being kind of useless
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:43.820]   because it's just one of an infinite,
[00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:46.020]   essentially infinite number of things
[00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:48.300]   which you have no way to experimentally distinguish.
[00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:51.280]   And so this is just a depressing situation.
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:55.060]   But I do think that there is a,
[00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:57.740]   so again, I think pursuing ideas about what,
[00:35:57.740 --> 00:36:01.340]   more about beauty and how can you integrate
[00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:04.300]   and unify these issues about gravity
[00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:06.000]   with other things we know about physics.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.380]   And can you find a theory which,
[00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:10.440]   where these fit together in a way that makes sense
[00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:12.300]   and hopefully predicts something
[00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:13.980]   that's much more promising.
[00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:15.580]   - Well, it makes sense and hopefully,
[00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:19.580]   I mean, we'll sneak up onto this question a bunch of times
[00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:22.460]   'cause you kind of said a few slightly
[00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:24.380]   contradictory things, which is like,
[00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:27.180]   it's nice to have a theory that's consistent,
[00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:29.940]   but then if the theory is consistent,
[00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:31.740]   it doesn't necessarily mean anything.
[00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:32.820]   (laughs)
[00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:33.660]   So like--
[00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:35.180]   - It's not enough, it's not enough.
[00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:36.760]   - It's not enough, and that's the problem.
[00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:39.420]   So it's like it keeps coming back to,
[00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:42.020]   okay, there should be some experimental validation.
[00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:46.980]   So, okay, let's talk a little bit about string theory.
[00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:51.280]   You've been a bit of an outspoken critic of string theory.
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:56.660]   Maybe one question first to ask is what is string theory?
[00:36:56.660 --> 00:37:01.660]   And beyond that, why is it wrong,
[00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:04.500]   or rather, as the title of your blog says,
[00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:06.500]   not even wrong?
[00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:07.840]   - Okay.
[00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:09.500]   Well, one interesting thing about the current state
[00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:11.220]   of string theory is that I think it,
[00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:13.860]   I'd argue it's actually very, very difficult to,
[00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:15.860]   at this point, to say what string theory means.
[00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:17.340]   If people say they're string theorists,
[00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:20.120]   what they mean and what they're doing is,
[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:22.100]   it's kind of hard,
[00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:24.100]   it's hard to pin down the meaning of the term.
[00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:26.780]   But the initial meaning, I think, goes back to,
[00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:30.660]   there was kind of a series of developments
[00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:34.380]   starting in 1984 in which people felt that they
[00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:39.380]   had found a unified theory of our so-called standard model
[00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:42.440]   of all the standard, well-known kind of
[00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:44.580]   particle interactions and gravity,
[00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:46.680]   and it all fit together in a quantum theory,
[00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:49.920]   and that you could do this in a very specific way
[00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:54.880]   by, instead of thinking about having a quantum theory
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:57.160]   of particles moving around in space-time,
[00:37:57.160 --> 00:38:00.360]   think about a quantum theory of kind of one-dimensional
[00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:03.400]   loops moving around in space-time, so-called strings.
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:06.540]   And so, instead of one degree of freedom,
[00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:08.180]   these have an infinite number of degrees of freedom,
[00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:09.940]   it's a much more complicated theory.
[00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:11.020]   But you can imagine,
[00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:14.380]   okay, we're gonna quantize this theory of
[00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:16.740]   loops moving around in space-time,
[00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:19.300]   and what they found is that they,
[00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:21.140]   is that you could make, you could do this,
[00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:23.380]   and you could fairly, relatively straightforwardly
[00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:26.860]   make sense of such a quantum theory,
[00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:30.620]   but only if space and time together were 10-dimensional.
[00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:32.940]   And so then you had this problem,
[00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:34.800]   again, the problem I referred to at the beginning of,
[00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:37.240]   okay, now, once you make that move,
[00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:39.600]   you gotta get rid of six dimensions.
[00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:42.320]   And so the hope was that you could get rid of
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:44.800]   the six dimensions by making them very small,
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:47.440]   and that consistency of the theory would require
[00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:52.840]   that these six dimensions satisfy a very specific condition
[00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:55.160]   called being a Calabi-Yau manifold,
[00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:58.280]   and that we knew very, very few examples of this.
[00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:02.280]   So what got a lot of people very excited back in 84, 85,
[00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:05.720]   was the hope that you could just take this
[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:07.560]   10-dimensional string theory and
[00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:10.880]   find one of a limited number of possible ways
[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:14.580]   of getting rid of six dimensions by making them small,
[00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:16.080]   and then you would end up with
[00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:17.560]   an effective four-dimensional theory
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:18.760]   which looked like the real world.
[00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:20.000]   This was the hope.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.720]   So then, there's a very long story about
[00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:24.860]   what happened to that hope over the years.
[00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:28.740]   I mean, I would argue, and part of the point of the book
[00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:33.740]   and its title was that this ultimately was a failure
[00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:36.440]   that you ended up, that this idea just didn't,
[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:41.020]   there ended up being just too many ways of doing this,
[00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:44.060]   and you didn't know how to do this consistently,
[00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:46.820]   that it was kind of not even wrong in the sense that
[00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:49.580]   you never could pin it down well enough
[00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:53.920]   to actually get a real falsifiable prediction out of it
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:55.180]   that would tell you it was wrong,
[00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:59.300]   but it was kind of in the realm of ideas
[00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:00.380]   which initially looked good,
[00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:02.080]   but the more you look at them,
[00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:05.420]   they just don't work out the way you want,
[00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:07.740]   and they don't actually end up carrying the power
[00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:10.180]   or that you originally had this vision of.
[00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:14.180]   - And yes, the book title is not even wrong.
[00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:17.760]   Your blog, your excellent blog title is not even wrong.
[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:20.860]   Okay, but there's nevertheless been a lot of excitement
[00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:24.140]   about string theory through the decades, as you mentioned.
[00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:27.820]   What are the different flavors of ideas that came,
[00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:31.300]   like that branched out?
[00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:32.660]   You mentioned 10 dimensions,
[00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:36.500]   you mentioned loops with infinite degrees of freedom.
[00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:38.740]   What are the interesting ideas to you
[00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:41.020]   that kind of emerged from this world?
[00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:42.560]   - Well, yeah, I mean, the problem in talking about
[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:45.740]   the whole subject, and part of the reason I wrote the book
[00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:48.740]   is that it gets very, very complicated.
[00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:50.400]   I mean, there's a huge amount,
[00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:54.460]   a lot of people got very interested in this,
[00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:55.740]   a lot of people worked on it,
[00:40:55.740 --> 00:40:58.380]   and in some sense, I think what happened is
[00:40:58.380 --> 00:41:01.340]   exactly because the idea didn't really work,
[00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:03.560]   that this caused people to,
[00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:06.180]   instead of focusing on this one idea
[00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:08.220]   and digging in and working on that,
[00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:11.060]   they just kind of kept trying new things.
[00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:14.040]   And so people, I think, ended up wandering around
[00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:15.900]   in a very, very rich space of ideas
[00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:17.700]   about mathematics and physics
[00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:20.000]   and discovering all sorts of really interesting things.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.220]   It's just, the problem is there tended to be
[00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:24.860]   an inverse relationship between how interesting
[00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:27.540]   and beautiful and fruitful this new idea
[00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:28.860]   that they were trying to pursue was
[00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:31.860]   and how much it looked like the real world.
[00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:34.540]   So there's a lot of beautiful mathematics came out of it.
[00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:36.060]   I think one of the most spectacular
[00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:38.380]   is what the physicists call
[00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:40.660]   two-dimensional conformal field theory.
[00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:44.660]   And so these are basically quantum field theories
[00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:47.800]   and kind of think of it as one space and one time dimension,
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:51.240]   which have just this huge amount of symmetry
[00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:53.660]   and a huge amount of structure,
[00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:58.060]   which just some totally fantastic mathematics behind it.
[00:41:58.060 --> 00:42:00.380]   And again, and some of that mathematics
[00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:03.280]   is exactly also what appears in the Langlands program.
[00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:07.760]   So a lot of the first interaction between math and physics
[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:08.860]   around the Langlands program
[00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:10.340]   has been around these two-dimensional
[00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:11.580]   conformal field theories.
[00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:15.220]   - Is there something you could say
[00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:17.180]   about what are the major problems are
[00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:18.980]   with string theory?
[00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:20.240]   So like,
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:25.800]   besides that there's no experimental validation,
[00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:30.400]   you've written that a big hole in string theory
[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:33.600]   has been its perturbative definition.
[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:34.480]   - Yeah.
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:35.340]   - Perhaps that's one.
[00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:36.920]   Can you explain what that means?
[00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:38.040]   - Well, maybe to begin with,
[00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:40.740]   I think the simplest thing to say is,
[00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:45.200]   the initial idea really was that,
[00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:47.000]   okay, we have this,
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.040]   instead of what's great is we have this thing
[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:50.720]   that only works,
[00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:54.160]   that's very structured and has to work in a certain way
[00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:55.540]   for it to make sense.
[00:42:55.540 --> 00:43:01.700]   But then you ended up in 10 space-time dimensions.
[00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:03.620]   And so to get back to physics,
[00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:05.380]   you had to get rid of five of the dimensions,
[00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:06.880]   six of the dimensions.
[00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:08.600]   And the bottom line, I would say,
[00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:09.600]   in some sense, is very simple.
[00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:11.680]   That what people just discovered is just,
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:15.640]   there's kind of no particularly nice way of doing this.
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:17.480]   There's an infinite number of ways of doing it
[00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:18.720]   and you can get whatever you want
[00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:20.160]   depending on how you do it.
[00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:21.840]   So you end up,
[00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:24.040]   the whole program of starting at 10 dimensions
[00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:25.520]   and getting to four,
[00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:28.560]   just kind of collapses out of a lack of any way
[00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:29.760]   to kind of get to where you want
[00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:31.560]   'cause you can get anything.
[00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:34.720]   The hope around that problem has always been that
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:38.960]   the standard formulation that we have of string theory,
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:42.560]   which is, you can go in by the name perturbative,
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:43.580]   but it's kind of,
[00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:46.320]   there's a standard way we know
[00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:48.960]   of given a classical theory of constructing
[00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:52.880]   a quantum theory and working with it,
[00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:56.960]   which is the so-called perturbation theory.
[00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:59.240]   That we know how to do.
[00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:04.240]   And that by itself just doesn't give you any hint
[00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:06.660]   as to what to do about the six dimensions.
[00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:09.200]   So actual perturbed string theory by itself
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:11.340]   really only works in 10 dimensions.
[00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:14.360]   So you have to start making some kinds of assumptions
[00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:17.360]   about how I'm gonna go beyond
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:20.960]   this formulation that we really understand
[00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:24.040]   of string theory and get rid of these six dimensions.
[00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:29.040]   So kind of the simplest one was the Clavier-Postulate.
[00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:31.820]   But when that didn't really work out,
[00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:33.920]   people have tried more and more different things.
[00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:35.720]   And the hope has always been that
[00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:39.520]   the solution to this problem would be
[00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:42.640]   that you would find a deeper and better understanding
[00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:44.220]   of what string theory is
[00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:47.880]   that would actually go beyond this perturbative expansion
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:51.820]   and which would generalize this.
[00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:53.220]   And that once you had that,
[00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:57.220]   it would solve this problem of,
[00:44:57.220 --> 00:44:59.600]   it would pick out what to do with the six dimensions.
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:01.140]   - How difficult is this problem?
[00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:05.100]   So if I could restate the problem,
[00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:09.860]   it seems like there's a very consistent physical world
[00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:11.740]   operating in four dimensions.
[00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:16.700]   And how do you map a consistent physical world
[00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:19.240]   in 10 dimensions to a consistent physical world
[00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:21.180]   in four dimensions?
[00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:23.100]   And how difficult is this problem?
[00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:25.320]   Is that something you can even answer?
[00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:30.340]   Just in terms of physics intuition,
[00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:32.260]   in terms of mathematics,
[00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:35.100]   mapping from 10 dimensions to four dimensions.
[00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:36.580]   - Well, basically, I mean, you have to get rid
[00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:38.260]   of the six of the dimensions.
[00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:41.620]   So there's kind of two ways of doing it.
[00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:44.020]   One is what we call compactification.
[00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:46.880]   You say that there really are 10 dimensions,
[00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:48.240]   but for whatever reason,
[00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:51.900]   six of them are really are so, so small, we can't see them.
[00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:54.680]   So you basically start out with 10 dimensions
[00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:59.020]   and what we call, make six of them not go out to infinity,
[00:45:59.020 --> 00:46:00.820]   but just kind of a finite extent
[00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:02.520]   and then make that size go down.
[00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:05.500]   So small, it's unobservable.
[00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:08.340]   - But that's like, that's a math trick.
[00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:11.460]   So can you also help me build an intuition
[00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:15.580]   about how rich and interesting the world
[00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:17.860]   in those six dimensions is?
[00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:20.100]   So compactification seems to imply
[00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:22.660]   that it's not very interesting.
[00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:24.700]   - Well, no, but the problem is that what you learn
[00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:26.780]   if you start doing mathematics
[00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:28.900]   and looking at geometry and topology
[00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:31.620]   and more and more dimensions is that,
[00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:34.220]   I mean, asking the question like,
[00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:36.540]   what are all possible six dimensional spaces?
[00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:38.580]   It's just, it's kind of an unanswerable question.
[00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:39.620]   It's just, I mean,
[00:46:39.620 --> 00:46:42.020]   it's even kind of technically undecidable in some way.
[00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:46.180]   There are too many things you can do with all these.
[00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:49.540]   If you start trying to make one dimensional spaces,
[00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:52.140]   it's like, well, you got a line, you can make a circle,
[00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:55.180]   you can make graphs, you can kind of see what you can do.
[00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:58.260]   But as you go to higher and higher dimensions,
[00:46:58.260 --> 00:47:02.140]   there are just so many ways you can put things together
[00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:05.460]   and get something of that dimensionality.
[00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:09.820]   And so unless you have some very, very strong principle,
[00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:12.900]   we're just gonna pick out some very specific ones
[00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:15.400]   of these six dimensional spaces.
[00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:17.340]   And there are just too many of them
[00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:19.500]   and you can get anything you want.
[00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:21.620]   - So if you have 10 dimensions,
[00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:24.420]   the kind of things that happen,
[00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:26.700]   say that's actually the way,
[00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:29.740]   that's actually the fabric of our reality is 10 dimensions.
[00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:33.100]   There's a limited set of behaviors of objects,
[00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:36.060]   I don't even know what the right terminology to use
[00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:40.620]   that can occur within those dimensions, like in reality.
[00:47:40.620 --> 00:47:44.500]   And so what I'm getting at is like,
[00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:47.260]   is there some consistent constraints?
[00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:51.060]   So if you have some constraints that map to reality,
[00:47:51.060 --> 00:47:53.460]   then you can start saying like,
[00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:56.260]   dimension number seven is kind of boring.
[00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:58.900]   All the excitement happens in the spatial dimensions,
[00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:00.380]   one, two, three.
[00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:02.220]   And time is also kind of boring.
[00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:05.380]   Some are more exciting than others,
[00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:08.100]   or we can use our metric of beauty.
[00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:10.260]   Some dimensions are more beautiful than others.
[00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:12.240]   Once you have an actual understanding
[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:15.260]   of what actually happens in those dimensions
[00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:16.500]   in our physical world,
[00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:18.620]   as opposed to sort of all the possible things
[00:48:18.620 --> 00:48:19.580]   that could happen.
[00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:21.460]   - In some sense, I mean, just the basic fact
[00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:22.980]   is you need to get rid of them, we don't see them.
[00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:25.580]   So you need to somehow explain them.
[00:48:25.580 --> 00:48:26.580]   The main thing you're trying to do
[00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:28.820]   is to explain why we're not seeing them.
[00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:32.540]   And so you have to come up with some theory
[00:48:32.540 --> 00:48:35.420]   of these extra dimensions and how they're gonna behave.
[00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:38.980]   And string theory gives you some ideas about how to do that.
[00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:43.580]   But the bottom line is where you're trying to go
[00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:45.660]   with this whole theory you're creating
[00:48:45.660 --> 00:48:49.540]   is to just make all of its effects essentially unobservable.
[00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:51.500]   So it's not a really,
[00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:57.300]   it's an inherently kind of dubious and worrisome thing
[00:48:57.300 --> 00:48:58.300]   that you're trying to do there.
[00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:00.580]   Why are you just adding in all this stuff
[00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:02.220]   and then trying to explain why we don't see it?
[00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:03.060]   I mean, it just--
[00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:04.220]   - This may be a dumb question,
[00:49:04.220 --> 00:49:07.740]   but is this an obvious thing to state
[00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:11.540]   that those six dimensions are unobservable
[00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:14.680]   or anything beyond four dimensions is unobservable?
[00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:20.900]   Or do you leave a little door open to saying
[00:49:20.900 --> 00:49:23.140]   the current tools of physics,
[00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:26.940]   and obviously our brains are unable to observe them,
[00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:29.900]   but we may need to come up with methodologies
[00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:30.740]   for observing them.
[00:49:30.740 --> 00:49:33.100]   So as opposed to collapsing your mathematical theory
[00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:34.980]   into four dimensions,
[00:49:34.980 --> 00:49:37.100]   leaving the door open a little bit to
[00:49:37.100 --> 00:49:38.720]   maybe we need to come up with tools
[00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:42.660]   that actually allow us to directly measure those dimensions.
[00:49:42.660 --> 00:49:45.180]   - Yes, I mean, you can certainly ask,
[00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:48.940]   assume that we've got model,
[00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:50.700]   look at models with more dimensions
[00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:52.620]   and ask what would be observable effects?
[00:49:52.620 --> 00:49:54.140]   How would we know this?
[00:49:54.140 --> 00:49:55.460]   And you go out and do experiments.
[00:49:55.460 --> 00:49:58.740]   So for instance, you have a,
[00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:02.460]   like gravitationally you have an inverse square law forces.
[00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:04.060]   Okay, if you had more dimensions,
[00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:06.580]   that inverse square law would change to something else.
[00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:09.500]   So you can go and start measuring the inverse square law
[00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:12.020]   and say, okay, inverse square law is working,
[00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:14.620]   but maybe if I get,
[00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:16.500]   and it turns out to be actually kind of very, very hard
[00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:18.100]   to measure gravitational effects
[00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:21.900]   at even kind of somewhat macroscopic distances
[00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:23.260]   because they're so small.
[00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:26.220]   So you can start looking at the inverse square law
[00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:27.980]   and say, start trying to measure it
[00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:29.340]   at shorter and shorter distances
[00:50:29.340 --> 00:50:33.140]   and see if there were extra dimensions
[00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:34.420]   at those distance scales,
[00:50:34.420 --> 00:50:36.740]   you would start to see the inverse square law fail.
[00:50:36.740 --> 00:50:38.620]   And so people look for that.
[00:50:38.620 --> 00:50:40.500]   And again, you don't see it,
[00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:42.100]   but you can, I mean,
[00:50:42.100 --> 00:50:43.580]   there's all sorts of experiments of this kind.
[00:50:43.580 --> 00:50:48.380]   You can imagine which test for effects of extra dimensions
[00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:50.740]   at different distance scales,
[00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:55.740]   but none of them, I mean, they all just don't work.
[00:50:55.740 --> 00:50:58.100]   - Nothing yet.
[00:50:58.100 --> 00:50:59.180]   - Nothing yet, but you can say,
[00:50:59.180 --> 00:51:02.860]   ah, but it's just much, much smaller.
[00:51:02.860 --> 00:51:03.700]   You can say that.
[00:51:03.700 --> 00:51:06.860]   - Which by the way, makes LIGO
[00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:09.940]   and the detection of gravitational waves
[00:51:09.940 --> 00:51:11.620]   quite an incredible project.
[00:51:11.620 --> 00:51:15.660]   Ed Witten is often brought up
[00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:17.380]   as one of the most brilliant mathematicians
[00:51:17.380 --> 00:51:19.100]   and physicists ever.
[00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:24.420]   What do you make of him and his work on string theory?
[00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:26.780]   - Well, I think he's a truly remarkable figure.
[00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:30.100]   I've had the pleasure of meeting him first
[00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:31.060]   when he was a postdoc.
[00:51:31.060 --> 00:51:34.740]   And I mean, he's just completely amazing
[00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:37.980]   mathematician and physicist.
[00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:41.420]   And he's quite a bit smarter
[00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:43.340]   than just about any of the rest of us
[00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:44.540]   and also more hardworking.
[00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:46.740]   And it's a kind of frightening combination
[00:51:46.740 --> 00:51:49.140]   to see how much he's been able to do.
[00:51:49.140 --> 00:51:53.500]   But I would actually argue that his greatest work,
[00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:55.780]   the things that he's done that have been of
[00:51:55.780 --> 00:51:58.620]   just this mind blowing significance of giving us,
[00:51:58.620 --> 00:52:00.060]   I mean, he's completely revolutionized
[00:52:00.060 --> 00:52:02.140]   some areas of mathematics.
[00:52:02.140 --> 00:52:04.180]   He's totally revolutionized the way we understand
[00:52:04.180 --> 00:52:07.140]   the relations between mathematics and physics.
[00:52:07.140 --> 00:52:10.660]   And most of those, his greatest work
[00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:13.660]   is stuff that has little or nothing
[00:52:13.660 --> 00:52:15.100]   to do with string theory.
[00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:16.620]   I mean, for instance, he,
[00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:19.140]   so he was actually one of fields.
[00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:20.860]   The very strange thing about him in some sense
[00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:23.620]   is that he doesn't have a Nobel prize.
[00:52:23.620 --> 00:52:25.860]   So there's a very large number of people
[00:52:25.860 --> 00:52:28.220]   who are nowhere near as smart as he is
[00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:30.100]   and don't work anywhere near as hard
[00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:31.700]   who have Nobel prizes.
[00:52:31.700 --> 00:52:33.900]   I think he just had the misfortune of
[00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:35.780]   coming into the field at a time
[00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:37.700]   when things had gotten much, much, much tougher
[00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:41.380]   and nobody really had, no matter how smart you were,
[00:52:41.380 --> 00:52:43.980]   it was very hard to come up with a new idea
[00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:47.700]   that was gonna work physically and get you a Nobel prize.
[00:52:47.700 --> 00:52:51.220]   But he got a Fields Medal for
[00:52:51.220 --> 00:52:54.580]   a certain work he did in mathematics.
[00:52:54.580 --> 00:52:56.500]   And that's just completely unheard of
[00:52:56.500 --> 00:52:58.340]   for mathematicians to give a Fields Medal
[00:52:58.340 --> 00:52:59.860]   to someone outside their field.
[00:52:59.860 --> 00:53:01.620]   And physics is really,
[00:53:01.620 --> 00:53:05.580]   you wouldn't have before he came around.
[00:53:05.580 --> 00:53:06.660]   I don't think anybody would have thought
[00:53:06.660 --> 00:53:07.980]   that was even conceivable.
[00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:10.980]   - So you're saying he came into the field
[00:53:10.980 --> 00:53:13.180]   of theoretical physics at a time
[00:53:13.180 --> 00:53:16.820]   when, and still to today,
[00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:20.180]   is you can't get a Nobel prize for purely theoretical work.
[00:53:20.180 --> 00:53:22.300]   - The specific problem of trying to do better
[00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:24.860]   than the standard model is just
[00:53:24.860 --> 00:53:26.620]   this insanely successful thing.
[00:53:26.620 --> 00:53:30.580]   And it kind of came together in 1973, pretty much.
[00:53:30.580 --> 00:53:34.300]   And all of the people who kind of were involved
[00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:36.300]   in that coming together,
[00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:39.140]   many of them ended up with Nobel prizes for that.
[00:53:39.140 --> 00:53:43.580]   But if you look post 1973, pretty much,
[00:53:43.580 --> 00:53:44.860]   it's a little bit more,
[00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:47.580]   there's some edge cases, if you like.
[00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:51.860]   But if you look post 1973 at what people have done
[00:53:51.860 --> 00:53:54.460]   to try to do better than the standard model
[00:53:54.460 --> 00:53:56.140]   and to get a better, you know, idea,
[00:53:56.140 --> 00:53:58.420]   it really hasn't, it's been too hard a problem.
[00:53:58.420 --> 00:53:59.940]   It hasn't worked, the theory's too good.
[00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:03.300]   And so it's not that other people went out there
[00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:06.220]   and did it and not him,
[00:54:06.220 --> 00:54:07.780]   and that they got Nobel prizes for doing it.
[00:54:07.780 --> 00:54:08.980]   It's just that no one really,
[00:54:08.980 --> 00:54:10.500]   the kind of thing he's been trying to do
[00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:12.300]   with string theory is not,
[00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:14.740]   no one has been able to do since 1973.
[00:54:14.740 --> 00:54:17.420]   - Is there something you could say about the standard model?
[00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:20.740]   So the four laws of physics that seems to work very well,
[00:54:20.740 --> 00:54:25.020]   and yet people are striving to do more,
[00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:27.620]   talking about unification and so on, why?
[00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:30.940]   What's wrong, what's broken about the standard model?
[00:54:30.940 --> 00:54:33.140]   Why does it need to be improved?
[00:54:33.140 --> 00:54:34.940]   - I mean, the thing that gets most attention
[00:54:34.940 --> 00:54:38.240]   is gravity that we have trouble.
[00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:40.820]   So you wanna, in some sense,
[00:54:40.820 --> 00:54:45.740]   integrate what we know about the gravitational force
[00:54:45.740 --> 00:54:48.700]   with it and have a unified quantum field theory
[00:54:48.700 --> 00:54:50.380]   that has gravitational interactions also.
[00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:52.780]   So that's the big problem everybody talks about.
[00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:55.340]   I mean, but it's also true
[00:54:55.340 --> 00:54:57.060]   that if you look at the standard model,
[00:54:57.060 --> 00:54:59.260]   it has these very, very deep, beautiful ideas,
[00:54:59.260 --> 00:55:02.720]   but there's certain aspects of it that are very,
[00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:08.240]   let's just say that they're not beautiful.
[00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:11.440]   They're not, you have to, to make the thing work,
[00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:14.240]   you have to throw in lots and lots of extra parameters
[00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:15.360]   at various points.
[00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:18.540]   And a lot of this has to do with the so-called,
[00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:21.960]   the so-called Higgs mechanism and the Higgs field.
[00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:25.960]   That if you look at the theory, it's everything is,
[00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:28.960]   if you forget about the Higgs field and what it needs to do,
[00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:33.520]   the rest of the theory is very, very constrained
[00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:35.320]   and has very, very few free parameters,
[00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:36.400]   really a very small number.
[00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:38.040]   There's a very small number of parameters
[00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:40.900]   and a few integers which tell you what the theory is.
[00:55:40.900 --> 00:55:42.940]   To make this work as a theory of the real world,
[00:55:42.940 --> 00:55:45.480]   you need a Higgs field and you need to,
[00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:48.080]   it needs to do something.
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:50.840]   And once you introduce that Higgs field,
[00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:54.440]   all sorts of parameters make an appearance.
[00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:58.760]   So now when we've got 20 or 30 or whatever parameters
[00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:00.880]   that are gonna tell you what all the masses of things are
[00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:02.160]   and what's gonna happen.
[00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:05.520]   So you've gone from a very tightly constrained thing
[00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:09.000]   with a couple of parameters to this thing,
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:11.120]   which the minute you put it in,
[00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:13.220]   you had to add all this extra,
[00:56:13.220 --> 00:56:15.320]   all these extra parameters to make things work.
[00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:19.120]   And so that, it may be one argument as well,
[00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:20.480]   that's just the way the world is.
[00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:24.160]   And the fact that you don't find that aesthetically pleasing
[00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:25.200]   is just your problem.
[00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:27.320]   Or maybe we live in a multiverse
[00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:30.080]   and those numbers are just different in every universe.
[00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:33.600]   But another reasonable conjecture is just that,
[00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:35.420]   well, this is just telling us
[00:56:35.420 --> 00:56:36.940]   that there's something we don't understand
[00:56:36.940 --> 00:56:40.200]   about what's going on in a deeper way,
[00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:41.680]   which would explain those numbers.
[00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:44.240]   And there's some kind of deeper idea
[00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:47.240]   about where the Higgs field comes from and what's going on,
[00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:49.040]   which we haven't figured out yet.
[00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:52.840]   And that's what we should look for.
[00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:55.960]   - But to stick on string theory a little bit longer,
[00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:57.520]   could you play devil's advocate
[00:56:57.520 --> 00:57:01.880]   and try to argue for string theory,
[00:57:01.880 --> 00:57:06.880]   why it is something that deserved the effort that it got
[00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:10.420]   and still, like if you think of it as a flame,
[00:57:10.420 --> 00:57:14.160]   still should be a little flame that keeps burning?
[00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:16.240]   - Well, I think the, I mean,
[00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:18.820]   the most positive argument for it is all the,
[00:57:18.820 --> 00:57:22.120]   all sorts of new ideas about mathematics
[00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:24.800]   and about parts of physics really emerged from it.
[00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:28.440]   So it was very a fruitful source of ideas.
[00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:30.760]   And I think this is actually one argument you'll definitely,
[00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:31.640]   which I kind of agree with,
[00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:34.360]   I'll hear from Witten and from other string theorists
[00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:39.000]   say that this is just such a fruitful and inspiring idea.
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:41.360]   And it's led to so many other different things
[00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:43.720]   coming out of it that there must be something
[00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:45.200]   right about this.
[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:47.920]   And that's, okay, that, anyway,
[00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:50.240]   I think that that's probably the strongest thing
[00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:52.800]   that they've got.
[00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:55.840]   But you don't think there's aspects to it
[00:57:55.840 --> 00:58:00.480]   that could be neighboring to a theory
[00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:03.200]   that does unify everything, to a theory of everything.
[00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:05.760]   Like it could, it may not be exactly,
[00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:11.280]   exactly the theory, but sticking on it longer
[00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:14.400]   might get us closer to the theory of everything.
[00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:15.440]   - Well, the problem with it now really
[00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:17.320]   is that you really don't know what it is now.
[00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:19.920]   You've never, nobody has ever kind of come up
[00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:23.400]   with this non-perturbative theory.
[00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:27.440]   So it's become more and more frustrating
[00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:29.480]   and an odd activity to try to argue
[00:58:29.480 --> 00:58:32.200]   with a string theorist about string theory,
[00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:37.200]   because it's become less and less well-defined what it is.
[00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:40.100]   And it's become actually more and more kind of a,
[00:58:40.100 --> 00:58:42.320]   whether you have this weird phenomenon
[00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:44.800]   of people calling themselves string theorists
[00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:47.520]   when they've never actually worked on any theory
[00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:49.560]   where there are any strings anywhere.
[00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:52.600]   So what has actually happened kind of sociologically
[00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:55.080]   is that you started out with this fairly
[00:58:55.080 --> 00:58:58.400]   well-defined proposal, and then I would argue
[00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:00.700]   because that didn't work, people then branched out
[00:59:00.700 --> 00:59:02.840]   in all sorts of directions doing all sorts of things
[00:59:02.840 --> 00:59:05.560]   that became farther and farther removed from that.
[00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:09.360]   And for sociological reasons, the ones who kind of
[00:59:09.360 --> 00:59:14.280]   started out or now, or were trained by the people
[00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:18.920]   who worked on that have now become the string theorists.
[00:59:18.920 --> 00:59:23.920]   And, but it's become almost more kind of a tribal denominator
[00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:29.040]   than a, so it's very hard to know what you're arguing about
[00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:30.680]   when you're arguing about string theory these days.
[00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:32.120]   - Well, to push back on that a little bit,
[00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:34.560]   I mean, string theory, it's just a term, right?
[00:59:34.560 --> 00:59:37.720]   It doesn't, like you could, like this is the way
[00:59:37.720 --> 00:59:41.020]   language evolves, is it could start to represent
[00:59:41.020 --> 00:59:43.440]   something more than just the theory that involves strings.
[00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:48.440]   It could represent the effort to unify the laws of physics.
[00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:50.000]   Right? - Yeah.
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:54.680]   - At high dimensions with these super tiny objects, right?
[00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:56.120]   Or something like that.
[00:59:56.120 --> 00:59:59.320]   I mean, we can sort of put string theory aside.
[00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:01.400]   So for example, neural networks in the space
[01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:04.480]   of machine learning, there was a time when they were
[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:07.180]   extremely popular, they became much, much less popular
[01:00:07.180 --> 01:00:08.960]   to a point where if you mention neural networks
[01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:12.600]   to gain no funding, and you're not going to be respected
[01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:16.080]   at conferences, and then once again, neural networks
[01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:20.720]   became all the rage about 10, 15 years ago.
[01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:23.040]   And as it goes up and down, and a lot of people
[01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:26.660]   would argue that using terminology like machine learning
[01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:31.660]   and deep learning is often misused over general.
[01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:35.160]   Everything that works is deep learning,
[01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:36.960]   everything that doesn't isn't.
[01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:38.240]   - Yeah. - Something like that.
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:40.800]   That's just the way, again, we're back
[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:42.920]   to sociological things. - Yeah.
[01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:45.280]   - But I guess what I'm trying to get at is
[01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:48.600]   if we leave the sociological mess aside,
[01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:53.120]   do we throw out the baby with the bathwater?
[01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:57.120]   Is there some, besides the side effects of nice ideas
[01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:59.160]   from the Edwittons of the world,
[01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:04.160]   is there some core truths there that we should stick by
[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:08.200]   in the full, beautiful mess of a space
[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:11.400]   that we call string theory, that people call string theory?
[01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:14.320]   - You're right, it is kind of a common problem
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:19.320]   that how what you call some field changes and evolves
[01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:22.720]   in interesting ways as the field changes.
[01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:27.720]   But I mean, I guess what I would argue
[01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:30.440]   is the initial understanding of string theory
[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:33.160]   that was quite specific, we're talking about a specific idea,
[01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:36.460]   10-dimensional superstrings compactified in six dimensions.
[01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:41.240]   To my mind, the really bad thing that's happened
[01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:45.800]   to the subject is that it's hard to get people to admit,
[01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:48.120]   at least publicly, that that was a failure,
[01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:49.760]   that this really didn't work.
[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:53.240]   And so de facto, what people do is people stop doing that
[01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:55.400]   and they start doing more interesting things,
[01:01:55.400 --> 01:02:00.400]   but they keep talking to the public about string theory
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:04.040]   and referring back to that idea and using that
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:07.840]   as kind of the starting point and as kind of the place
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:12.840]   where the whole tribe starts and everything comes from.
[01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:17.960]   So the problem with this is that having as your initial name
[01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:20.480]   and what everything points back to,
[01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:25.480]   something which really didn't work out,
[01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:28.280]   it kind of makes everybody, it makes everything,
[01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:31.040]   you've created this potentially very, very interesting field
[01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:32.080]   with interesting things happening,
[01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:37.080]   but people in graduate school take courses on string theory
[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:40.160]   and everything kind of, and this is what you tell the public
[01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:41.680]   in which you're continually pointing back.
[01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:43.520]   So you're continually pointing back to this idea
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:48.520]   which never worked out as your guiding inspiration.
[01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:51.580]   And it really kind of deforms your whole way
[01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:54.100]   of your hopes of making progress.
[01:02:54.100 --> 01:02:57.360]   And that's, to me, I think the kind of worst thing
[01:02:57.360 --> 01:02:59.200]   that's happened in this field.
[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:01.400]   - 'Cause sure, so there's a lack of transparency
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:03.680]   and sort of authenticity about communicating
[01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:07.120]   the things that failed in the past.
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:10.920]   And so you don't have a clear picture of firm ground
[01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:12.080]   that you're standing on.
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:14.120]   But again, those are sociological things.
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:14.960]   - Yeah.
[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:18.720]   - There's a bunch of questions I wanna ask you.
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:22.160]   So one, what's your intuition about
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:26.640]   why the original idea failed?
[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:30.760]   So what can you say about why you're pretty sure
[01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:31.740]   it has failed?
[01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:35.360]   - And the initial idea was, as I tried to explain it,
[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:39.040]   it was quite seductive in that you could see why Witten
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:40.600]   and others got excited by it.
[01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:45.720]   At the time, it looked like there were only a few
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:47.640]   these possible clobby hours that would work.
[01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:50.000]   And it looked like, okay, we just have to understand
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.240]   this very specific model
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:54.100]   and these very specific six dimensional spaces
[01:03:54.100 --> 01:03:55.760]   and we're gonna get everything.
[01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:57.260]   And so it was a very seductive idea.
[01:03:57.260 --> 01:04:02.260]   But it just, as people learned, worked more and more
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:06.840]   about it, it just didn't, they just kind of realized
[01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:08.320]   that there are just more and more things you can do
[01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:10.200]   with these six dimensions and you can't,
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:12.760]   and this is just not going to work.
[01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:17.760]   - Meaning like it's, I mean, what was the failure
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:21.280]   mode here?
[01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:24.240]   Is you could just have an infinite number of possibilities
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:26.800]   that you could do so you can come up with any theory
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:28.440]   you want, you can fit quantum mechanics,
[01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:31.600]   you can explain gravity, you can explain anything
[01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:32.920]   you want with it.
[01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:34.320]   Is that the basic failure mode?
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:37.160]   - Yeah, so it's a failure mode of kind of that this idea
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:39.960]   ended up being essentially empty,
[01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:42.880]   that it just didn't, doesn't, ends up not telling you
[01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:47.360]   anything because it's consistent with just about anything.
[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:50.800]   And so I mean, there's a complex, if you try and talk
[01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:52.320]   with strength areas about this now, I mean,
[01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:54.760]   there's an argument, there's a long argument over this
[01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:58.840]   about whether, you know, oh, no, no, no, maybe there still
[01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:01.320]   are constraints coming out of this idea or not.
[01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:05.280]   And, or maybe we live in a multiverse and, you know,
[01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:06.680]   everything is true anyway.
[01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:10.280]   So you can, there are various ways you can kind of,
[01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:12.600]   that strength areas have kind of react to this kind of
[01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:15.580]   argument that I'm making, try to hold on to it.
[01:05:15.580 --> 01:05:18.960]   - What about experimental validation?
[01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:23.960]   Is that a fair standard to hold before a theory
[01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:28.120]   of everything that's trying to unify quantum mechanics
[01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:29.000]   and gravity?
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.400]   - Yeah, I mean, ultimately to be really convinced
[01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:36.160]   that, you know, that on some new idea about unification
[01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:39.080]   really works, you need some kind of, you need to look
[01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:42.080]   at the real world and see that this is telling you something,
[01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:44.240]   something true about it.
[01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:48.980]   I mean, you know, either telling you that if you do
[01:05:48.980 --> 01:05:51.320]   some experiment and go out and do it, you'll get some
[01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:54.840]   unexpected result and that's the kind of gold standard,
[01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:58.840]   or it may be just that like all those numbers that are,
[01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:01.000]   we don't know how to explain, it will show you how
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.200]   to calculate them.
[01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:05.240]   I mean, it can be various kinds of experimental validation,
[01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:08.640]   but that's certainly ideally what you're looking for.
[01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:10.560]   - How tough is this, do you think, for a theory
[01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:12.880]   of everything, not just strength theory?
[01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:15.000]   For something that unifies gravity and quantum mechanics,
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:18.180]   so the very big and the very small, is this,
[01:06:18.180 --> 01:06:24.240]   let me ask it one way, is it a physics problem,
[01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:27.940]   a math problem, or an engineering problem?
[01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:30.400]   - My guess is it's a combination of a physics
[01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:32.700]   and a math problem that you really need.
[01:06:32.700 --> 01:06:36.280]   It's not really engineering, it's not like there's some
[01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:39.400]   kind of well-defined thing you can write down
[01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:41.540]   and we just don't have enough computer power
[01:06:41.540 --> 01:06:43.240]   to do the calculation.
[01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:45.440]   That's not the kind of problem it is at all.
[01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:49.040]   But the question is, you know, what mathematical tools
[01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:53.440]   you need to properly formulate the problem is unclear.
[01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:56.400]   So one reasonable conjecture is the way, the reason
[01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:59.460]   that we haven't had any success yet is just that
[01:06:59.460 --> 01:07:04.240]   we're missing, either we're missing certain physical ideas
[01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:06.260]   or we're missing certain mathematical tools,
[01:07:06.260 --> 01:07:08.940]   which are some combination of them, which would,
[01:07:08.940 --> 01:07:12.720]   which we need to kind of properly formulate the problem
[01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:15.720]   and see that it has a solution
[01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:17.240]   that looks like the real world.
[01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:19.340]   - But don't you need, I guess you don't,
[01:07:19.340 --> 01:07:24.340]   but there's a sense that you need both gravity,
[01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:27.320]   like all the laws of physics to be operating
[01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:30.720]   on the same level, so it feels like you need an object
[01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:32.720]   like a black hole or something like that
[01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:38.080]   in order to make predictions about,
[01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:40.320]   otherwise you're always making predictions
[01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:42.700]   about disjoint phenomena.
[01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:46.920]   Or can you do that as long as the theory is consistent
[01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:48.800]   and doesn't have special cases for each of the phenomena?
[01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:50.560]   - Well, your theory should, I mean,
[01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:52.120]   if your theory is gonna include gravity,
[01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:54.080]   our current understanding of gravity is that you should
[01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:57.840]   have, there should be black hole states in it,
[01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:00.000]   you should be able to describe black holes in this theory.
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:04.280]   And just one aspect that people concentrate a lot on
[01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:08.040]   is just this kind of questions about if your theory
[01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:09.840]   includes black holes like it's supposed to
[01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:11.840]   and it includes quantum mechanics,
[01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:13.880]   then there's certain kind of paradoxes which come up.
[01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:16.120]   And so that's been a huge focus of kind of
[01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:19.320]   quantum gravity work has been just those paradoxes.
[01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:23.240]   - So stepping outside of string theory,
[01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:26.520]   can you just say first at a high level,
[01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:28.560]   what is the theory of everything?
[01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:31.320]   What does the theory of everything seek to accomplish?
[01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:34.760]   - Well, I mean, this is very much a kind of reductionist
[01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:38.080]   point of view in the sense that, so it's not a theory,
[01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:42.280]   this is not gonna explain to you anything,
[01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:45.600]   it doesn't really, this kind of theory of everything
[01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:48.320]   we're talking about doesn't say anything interesting,
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:50.240]   particularly about like macroscopic objects,
[01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:52.320]   about what the weather's gonna be tomorrow
[01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:54.800]   or things are happening at this scale.
[01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:58.360]   But just what we've discovered is that as you look at
[01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:04.400]   the universe, it kind of, if you kind of start,
[01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:06.320]   you can start breaking it apart into,
[01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:08.440]   and you end up with some fairly simple pieces,
[01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:11.160]   quanta if you like, and which are doing,
[01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:14.480]   which are interacting in some fairly simple way.
[01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:18.520]   And it's, so what we mean by the theory of everything
[01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:23.520]   is a theory that describes all the correct objects
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:27.840]   you need to describe what's happening in the world
[01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:30.200]   and describes how they're interacting with each other
[01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:31.920]   at a most fundamental level.
[01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:35.520]   How you get from that theory to describing
[01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:38.240]   some macroscopic, incredibly complicated thing
[01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:41.200]   is there that becomes, again, more of an engineering problem
[01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:42.680]   and you may need machine learning
[01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:45.240]   or you may, a lot of very different things to do it.
[01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:48.760]   - Well, I don't even think it's just engineering,
[01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:50.400]   it's also science.
[01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:55.200]   One thing that I find kind of interesting
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:59.240]   talking to physicists is a little bit,
[01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:07.200]   there's a little bit of hubris.
[01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:09.760]   So some of the most brilliant people I know are physicists,
[01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:12.340]   both philosophy and just in terms of mathematics,
[01:10:12.340 --> 01:10:14.280]   in terms of understanding the world.
[01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:16.480]   But there's a kind of either a hubris
[01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:18.060]   or what would I call it,
[01:10:18.060 --> 01:10:22.720]   like a confidence that if we have a theory of everything,
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:24.520]   we will understand everything.
[01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:26.760]   Like this is the deepest thing to understand.
[01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:29.820]   And I would say, and like the rest is details, right?
[01:10:29.820 --> 01:10:31.600]   That's the old Rutherford thing.
[01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:37.960]   But to me, there's like, this is like a cake or something.
[01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:39.160]   There's layers to this thing
[01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:42.040]   and each one has a theory of everything.
[01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:46.600]   Like at every level from biology,
[01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:48.660]   like how life originates,
[01:10:48.660 --> 01:10:52.440]   that itself, like complex systems.
[01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:54.440]   - Yeah. - Like that in itself
[01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:56.840]   is like this gigantic thing
[01:10:56.840 --> 01:10:58.840]   that requires a theory of everything.
[01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:01.640]   And then there's the, in the space of humans,
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:04.680]   psychology, like intelligence, collective intelligence,
[01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:07.140]   the way it emerges among species,
[01:11:07.140 --> 01:11:09.200]   that feels like a complex system
[01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:11.520]   that requires its own theory of everything.
[01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:15.420]   On top of that is things like in the computing space,
[01:11:15.420 --> 01:11:16.800]   artificial intelligence systems,
[01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:19.440]   like that feels like it needs a theory of everything.
[01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:24.440]   And it's almost like once we solve,
[01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:26.640]   once we come up with a theory of everything
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:28.500]   that explains the basic laws of physics
[01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:30.320]   that gave us the universe,
[01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:32.620]   even stuff that's super complex,
[01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:37.120]   like how the universe might be able to originate,
[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:39.440]   even explaining something that you're not a big fan of,
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:40.920]   like multiverses or stuff
[01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:42.880]   that we don't have any evidence of yet,
[01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:47.600]   still we won't be able to have a strong explanation
[01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:52.640]   of why food tastes delicious.
[01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:53.640]   - Oh yeah, yeah, no.
[01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:55.560]   No, anyway, yeah, I agree completely.
[01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:58.680]   I mean, there is something kind of completely wrong
[01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:00.840]   with this terminology of theory of everything.
[01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:04.040]   It's not, it's really in some sense a very bad term,
[01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:07.780]   very hubristic and bad terminology because it's not,
[01:12:07.780 --> 01:12:11.880]   this is explaining, this is a purely
[01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:13.120]   kind of reductionist point of view
[01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:14.720]   that you're trying to understand
[01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:17.880]   a certain very specific kind of things,
[01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:22.880]   which in principle other things emerge from,
[01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:27.640]   but to actually understand how anything emerges from this
[01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:30.760]   is it can't be understood in terms of
[01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:35.720]   this underlying Feynman theory is gonna be hopeless
[01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:37.960]   in terms of kind of telling you what about
[01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:40.940]   this various emergent behavior.
[01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:43.040]   And as you go to different levels of explanation,
[01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:44.460]   you're gonna need to develop new,
[01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:46.060]   you know, different, completely different ideas,
[01:12:46.060 --> 01:12:47.340]   completely different ways of thinking.
[01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:51.960]   And I guess there's a famous kind of Phil Anderson's
[01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:54.200]   slogan is that, you know, more is different.
[01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:57.780]   And so it's just, you know,
[01:12:57.780 --> 01:13:00.340]   even once you understand how, what a couple of things,
[01:13:00.340 --> 01:13:01.900]   well, if you have a collection of stuff
[01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:03.180]   and you understand perfectly well
[01:13:03.180 --> 01:13:05.240]   how each thing is interacting with it,
[01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:08.580]   with the others, what the whole thing is gonna do
[01:13:08.580 --> 01:13:10.140]   is just a completely different problem.
[01:13:10.140 --> 01:13:12.240]   It's just not, and you need completely different ways
[01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:13.500]   of thinking about it.
[01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:15.100]   - What do you think about this?
[01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:17.380]   I gotta ask you, at a few different attempts
[01:13:17.380 --> 01:13:20.040]   at a theory of everything, especially recently.
[01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:23.660]   So I've been for many years a big fan
[01:13:23.660 --> 01:13:25.580]   of cellular automata of complex systems.
[01:13:25.580 --> 01:13:28.100]   And obviously because of that,
[01:13:28.100 --> 01:13:31.460]   a fan of Stephen Wolfram's work in that space.
[01:13:31.460 --> 01:13:34.420]   But he's recently been talking about a theory
[01:13:34.420 --> 01:13:37.820]   of everything through his physics project, essentially.
[01:13:37.820 --> 01:13:40.300]   What do you think about this kind of discreet
[01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:45.100]   theory of everything, like from simple rules
[01:13:45.100 --> 01:13:47.620]   and simple objects on the hypergraphs
[01:13:47.620 --> 01:13:49.300]   emerges all of our reality,
[01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:51.460]   where time and space are emergent.
[01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:53.940]   Basically everything we see around us is emergent.
[01:13:53.940 --> 01:13:55.380]   - Yeah, I have to say, unfortunately,
[01:13:55.380 --> 01:13:58.400]   I have kind of pretty much zero sympathy for that.
[01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:01.100]   I mean, I don't, I spent a little time
[01:14:01.100 --> 01:14:03.060]   looking at it and I just don't see,
[01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:04.900]   it doesn't seem to me to get anywhere.
[01:14:04.900 --> 01:14:08.740]   And it really is, just really, really doesn't agree at all
[01:14:08.740 --> 01:14:12.300]   with what I'm seeing, this kind of unification
[01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:14.380]   of math and physics that I'm kind of talking about
[01:14:14.380 --> 01:14:16.660]   around certain kinds of very deep ideas
[01:14:16.660 --> 01:14:17.980]   about geometry and stuff.
[01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:22.360]   If you wanna believe that your things
[01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:25.100]   are really coming out of cellular automata
[01:14:25.100 --> 01:14:26.740]   at the most fundamental level,
[01:14:26.740 --> 01:14:28.780]   you have to believe that everything
[01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:31.140]   that I've seen my whole career
[01:14:31.140 --> 01:14:34.300]   and as beautiful, powerful ideas,
[01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:35.700]   that that's all just kind of a mirage,
[01:14:35.700 --> 01:14:38.180]   which just kind of randomly is emerging
[01:14:38.180 --> 01:14:41.460]   from these more basic, very, very simple-minded things.
[01:14:41.460 --> 01:14:44.940]   And you have to give me some serious evidence for that
[01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:46.220]   and I'm saying nothing.
[01:14:46.220 --> 01:14:50.380]   - So a mirage, you don't think there could be a consistency
[01:14:50.380 --> 01:14:53.860]   where things like quantum mechanics
[01:14:53.860 --> 01:14:57.620]   could emerge from much, much, much smaller, discreet,
[01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:00.060]   like computational-type systems?
[01:15:00.060 --> 01:15:01.720]   - Well, I think from the point of view of,
[01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:03.260]   certain mathematical point of view,
[01:15:03.260 --> 01:15:06.380]   quantum mechanics is already mathematically
[01:15:06.380 --> 01:15:07.380]   as simple as it gets.
[01:15:07.380 --> 01:15:12.380]   It really is a story about really the fundamental objects
[01:15:12.380 --> 01:15:16.380]   that you work with when you write down a quantum theory
[01:15:16.380 --> 01:15:18.460]   are in some point of view,
[01:15:18.460 --> 01:15:20.140]   precisely the fundamental objects
[01:15:20.140 --> 01:15:22.860]   at the deepest levels of mathematics
[01:15:22.860 --> 01:15:25.060]   that you're working with, they're exactly the same.
[01:15:25.060 --> 01:15:28.420]   So, and cellular automata are something completely different
[01:15:28.420 --> 01:15:29.980]   which don't fit into these structures.
[01:15:29.980 --> 01:15:32.500]   And so, I just don't see why, anyway,
[01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:37.300]   I don't see it as a promising thing to do.
[01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:38.540]   And then just looking at it and saying,
[01:15:38.540 --> 01:15:39.460]   does this go anywhere?
[01:15:39.460 --> 01:15:42.400]   Does this solve any problem that I've ever,
[01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:45.260]   that I didn't, does this solve any problem of any kind?
[01:15:45.260 --> 01:15:46.700]   I just don't see it.
[01:15:46.700 --> 01:15:50.560]   - Yeah, to me, cellular automata and these hypergraphs,
[01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:55.260]   I'm not sure solving a problem is even the standard
[01:15:55.260 --> 01:15:57.660]   to apply here at this moment.
[01:15:57.660 --> 01:16:00.540]   To me, the fascinating thing is that the question it asks
[01:16:00.540 --> 01:16:01.980]   have no good answers.
[01:16:01.980 --> 01:16:04.540]   So, there's not good math explaining,
[01:16:04.540 --> 01:16:06.000]   forget the physics of it,
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:09.160]   math explaining the behavior of complex systems.
[01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:12.300]   And that to me is both exciting and paralyzing.
[01:16:12.300 --> 01:16:15.380]   Like we're at the very early days of understanding
[01:16:15.380 --> 01:16:19.940]   how complicated and fascinating things emerge
[01:16:19.940 --> 01:16:21.260]   from simple rules.
[01:16:21.260 --> 01:16:22.700]   - Yeah, I agree.
[01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:25.420]   I think that is a truly great problem.
[01:16:25.420 --> 01:16:28.120]   And depending where it goes, it may be,
[01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:33.600]   it may start to develop some kind of connections
[01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:36.740]   to the things that I've kind of found more fruitful
[01:16:36.740 --> 01:16:38.700]   and hard to know.
[01:16:38.700 --> 01:16:41.420]   It just, I think a lot of that area,
[01:16:41.420 --> 01:16:45.740]   I kind of strongly feel I best not say too much about it
[01:16:45.740 --> 01:16:48.200]   'cause I just, I don't know too much about it.
[01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:51.580]   And I mean, again, we're back to this original problem
[01:16:51.580 --> 01:16:54.340]   that your time in life is limited.
[01:16:54.340 --> 01:16:55.740]   You have to figure out what you're gonna spend
[01:16:55.740 --> 01:16:56.780]   your time thinking about.
[01:16:56.780 --> 01:16:59.020]   And that's something I just never seen enough
[01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:01.420]   to convince me to spend more time thinking about.
[01:17:01.420 --> 01:17:02.340]   - Well, also timing.
[01:17:02.340 --> 01:17:03.920]   It's not just that our time is limited,
[01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:06.900]   but the timing of the kind of things you think about.
[01:17:06.900 --> 01:17:09.740]   There's some aspect to cellular automata,
[01:17:09.740 --> 01:17:12.820]   these kinds of objects that it feels like
[01:17:12.820 --> 01:17:17.820]   we're very many years away from having big breakthroughs on.
[01:17:17.820 --> 01:17:20.420]   And so, it's like you have to pick the problems
[01:17:20.420 --> 01:17:21.780]   that are solvable today.
[01:17:21.820 --> 01:17:26.420]   In fact, my intuition, again, perhaps biased,
[01:17:26.420 --> 01:17:30.180]   is it feels like the kind of systems that,
[01:17:30.180 --> 01:17:32.860]   complex systems that cellular automata are
[01:17:32.860 --> 01:17:35.120]   would not be solved by human brains.
[01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:40.300]   It feels like something post-human
[01:17:40.300 --> 01:17:41.820]   that will solve that problem.
[01:17:41.820 --> 01:17:45.020]   Or like significantly enhanced humans,
[01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:47.700]   meaning like using computational tools,
[01:17:47.700 --> 01:17:50.820]   very powerful computational tools to us,
[01:17:50.820 --> 01:17:53.140]   to crack these problems open.
[01:17:53.140 --> 01:17:58.140]   That's if our approach to science,
[01:17:58.140 --> 01:17:59.740]   our ability to understand science,
[01:17:59.740 --> 01:18:01.620]   our ability to understand physics
[01:18:01.620 --> 01:18:03.500]   will become more and more computational,
[01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:06.300]   or there'll be a whole field that's computational in nature,
[01:18:06.300 --> 01:18:07.740]   which currently is not the case.
[01:18:07.740 --> 01:18:10.780]   Currently, computation is the thing that sort of
[01:18:10.780 --> 01:18:14.660]   assists us in understanding science
[01:18:14.660 --> 01:18:16.720]   the way we've been doing it all along.
[01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:17.980]   But if there's a whole new,
[01:18:17.980 --> 01:18:20.540]   I mean, we're from new kind of science, right?
[01:18:20.540 --> 01:18:22.180]   It's a little bit dramatic.
[01:18:22.180 --> 01:18:27.180]   But, you know, if computers could do science
[01:18:27.180 --> 01:18:30.060]   on their own, computational systems,
[01:18:30.060 --> 01:18:35.560]   perhaps that's the way they would do the science.
[01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:37.740]   They would try to understand the cellular automata.
[01:18:37.740 --> 01:18:39.940]   And that feels like we're decades away.
[01:18:39.940 --> 01:18:43.940]   So, perhaps it'll crack open some interesting facets
[01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:46.300]   of this physics problem, but it's very far away.
[01:18:46.300 --> 01:18:48.180]   So, timing is everything.
[01:18:48.180 --> 01:18:50.060]   - That's perfectly possible, yeah.
[01:18:50.060 --> 01:18:53.720]   - Well, let me ask you then, in the space of geometry,
[01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:57.260]   I don't know how well you know Eric Weinstein.
[01:18:57.260 --> 01:18:58.460]   - Oh, quite well, yeah.
[01:18:58.460 --> 01:19:03.560]   - What are your thoughts about his geometric unity
[01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:05.820]   and the space of ideas that he's playing with
[01:19:05.820 --> 01:19:09.740]   in his proposal for a theory of everything?
[01:19:09.740 --> 01:19:12.420]   - Well, I think that he has,
[01:19:12.420 --> 01:19:14.380]   he fundamentally has, I think,
[01:19:14.380 --> 01:19:18.660]   the same problems that everybody has had trying to do this.
[01:19:18.660 --> 01:19:19.860]   And, you know, they're various,
[01:19:19.860 --> 01:19:21.620]   they're really versions of the same problem
[01:19:21.620 --> 01:19:26.100]   that you try to get unity
[01:19:26.100 --> 01:19:28.780]   by putting everything into some bigger structure.
[01:19:28.780 --> 01:19:33.420]   So, he has some other ones that are not so conventional
[01:19:33.420 --> 01:19:35.020]   that he's trying to work with.
[01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:39.580]   But he has the same problem that even if he can,
[01:19:39.580 --> 01:19:43.620]   if he can get a lot farther in terms of having
[01:19:43.620 --> 01:19:45.860]   a really well-defined, well-understood,
[01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:50.300]   clear picture of these things he's working with,
[01:19:50.300 --> 01:19:53.220]   they're really kind of large geometrical structures
[01:19:53.220 --> 01:19:55.180]   with many dimensions, many kinds.
[01:19:55.180 --> 01:19:57.380]   And I just don't see any way
[01:19:57.380 --> 01:19:59.500]   he's gonna have the same problem the string theorists have.
[01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:02.700]   How do you get back down to the structures
[01:20:02.700 --> 01:20:04.020]   of the standard model?
[01:20:04.020 --> 01:20:08.440]   And how do you, yeah, so I just,
[01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:10.740]   anyway, it's the same.
[01:20:10.740 --> 01:20:13.300]   And there's another interesting example
[01:20:13.300 --> 01:20:16.500]   of some similar kind of thing is Garrett Leasy's
[01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:17.380]   theory of everything.
[01:20:17.380 --> 01:20:20.580]   Again, it's a little bit more specific than Eric's.
[01:20:20.580 --> 01:20:24.620]   He's working with this E8, but again,
[01:20:24.620 --> 01:20:26.900]   I think all these things founder at the same point
[01:20:26.900 --> 01:20:30.780]   that you don't, you create this unity,
[01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:34.900]   but then you have no, you don't actually have a good idea
[01:20:34.900 --> 01:20:37.880]   how you're gonna get back to the actual,
[01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:42.060]   to the objects we've seen.
[01:20:42.060 --> 01:20:43.900]   How are you gonna, you create these big symmetries,
[01:20:43.900 --> 01:20:45.340]   how are you gonna break them?
[01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:48.580]   And 'cause we don't see those symmetries in the real world.
[01:20:48.580 --> 01:20:53.580]   And so ultimately there would need to be a simple process
[01:20:53.580 --> 01:20:56.300]   for collapsing it to four dimensions.
[01:20:56.300 --> 01:20:57.140]   - You'd have to explain it.
[01:20:57.140 --> 01:20:59.460]   Well, yeah, and I forget in his case,
[01:20:59.460 --> 01:21:01.020]   but it's not just four dimensions.
[01:21:01.020 --> 01:21:05.380]   It's also these structures you see in the standard model.
[01:21:05.380 --> 01:21:09.180]   There's certain very small dimensional groups of symmetries
[01:21:09.180 --> 01:21:11.380]   called U1, SU2 and SU3.
[01:21:11.380 --> 01:21:13.820]   And the problem with,
[01:21:13.820 --> 01:21:15.260]   and this has been a problem since the beginning,
[01:21:15.260 --> 01:21:18.900]   almost immediately after 1973, about a year later,
[01:21:18.900 --> 01:21:20.380]   two years later, people started talking
[01:21:20.380 --> 01:21:22.180]   about grand unified theories.
[01:21:22.180 --> 01:21:26.180]   So you take the U1, the SU2 and the SU3,
[01:21:26.180 --> 01:21:28.300]   and you put them in together into this bigger structure
[01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:31.560]   called SU5 or SO10.
[01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:33.580]   But then you're stuck with this problem that,
[01:21:33.580 --> 01:21:36.460]   wait a minute, now how, why does the world not look,
[01:21:36.460 --> 01:21:41.020]   why do I not see these SU5 symmetries in the world?
[01:21:41.020 --> 01:21:42.500]   I only see these.
[01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:47.240]   And so, and I think those,
[01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:49.900]   the kind of thing that Eric and also in Garrett
[01:21:49.900 --> 01:21:51.020]   and lots of people will try to do,
[01:21:51.020 --> 01:21:55.220]   they all kind of founder in that same way
[01:21:55.220 --> 01:21:57.700]   that they don't have a good answer to that.
[01:21:57.700 --> 01:22:01.300]   - Are there lessons, ideas to be learned
[01:22:01.300 --> 01:22:04.200]   from theories like that, from Garrett Leases, from Eric's?
[01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:06.220]   - I don't know, it depends.
[01:22:06.220 --> 01:22:11.020]   I have to confess, I haven't looked that closely at Eric's.
[01:22:11.020 --> 01:22:14.220]   I mean, he explained to this to me personally a few times
[01:22:14.220 --> 01:22:16.420]   and I've looked a bit at his paper, but it's,
[01:22:16.420 --> 01:22:19.220]   again, we're back to the problem
[01:22:19.220 --> 01:22:21.020]   of a limited amount of time in life.
[01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:24.840]   - Yeah, I mean, it's an interesting effect, right?
[01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:28.800]   Why don't more physicists look at it?
[01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:35.820]   I mean, I'm in this position that somehow
[01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:40.820]   I've, people write me emails for whatever reason
[01:22:40.820 --> 01:22:47.420]   and I worked in the space of AI
[01:22:47.420 --> 01:22:49.140]   and so there's a lot of people,
[01:22:49.140 --> 01:22:52.260]   perhaps AI is even way more accessible than physics
[01:22:52.260 --> 01:22:53.420]   in a certain sense.
[01:22:53.420 --> 01:22:54.940]   And so a lot of people write to me
[01:22:54.940 --> 01:22:56.680]   with different theories about what they have
[01:22:56.680 --> 01:22:59.980]   for how to create general intelligence.
[01:22:59.980 --> 01:23:03.340]   And it's, again, a little bit of an excuse I say to myself,
[01:23:03.340 --> 01:23:05.380]   like, well, I only have a limited amount of time,
[01:23:05.380 --> 01:23:07.900]   so that's why I'm not investigating it.
[01:23:07.900 --> 01:23:11.580]   But I wonder if there's ideas out there
[01:23:11.580 --> 01:23:14.660]   that are still powerful, they're still fascinating,
[01:23:14.660 --> 01:23:19.660]   and that I'm missing because I'm dismissing them
[01:23:19.660 --> 01:23:24.700]   because they're outside of the sort of the usual process
[01:23:24.700 --> 01:23:26.740]   of academic research.
[01:23:26.740 --> 01:23:29.340]   - Yeah, well, I mean, the same thing pretty much every day
[01:23:29.340 --> 01:23:32.620]   in my email, there's a, somebody's got a theory
[01:23:32.620 --> 01:23:35.420]   or everything about why all of what physicists are doing.
[01:23:35.420 --> 01:23:38.940]   Perhaps the most disturbing thing I should say
[01:23:38.940 --> 01:23:41.740]   about my critique, being a critic of string theory
[01:23:41.740 --> 01:23:44.700]   is that when you realize who your fans are,
[01:23:44.700 --> 01:23:47.060]   that they, every day I hear from somebody who says,
[01:23:47.060 --> 01:23:48.620]   oh, well, since you don't like string theory,
[01:23:48.620 --> 01:23:49.980]   you must of course agree with me
[01:23:49.980 --> 01:23:52.240]   that this is the right way to think about everything.
[01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:53.980]   Oh no, oh no.
[01:23:53.980 --> 01:23:58.980]   And most of these are, you quickly can see this is,
[01:23:58.980 --> 01:24:00.820]   person doesn't know very much
[01:24:00.820 --> 01:24:02.500]   and doesn't know what they're doing,
[01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:05.380]   but there's a whole continuum to people
[01:24:05.380 --> 01:24:08.020]   who are quite serious physicists and mathematicians
[01:24:08.020 --> 01:24:10.340]   who are making a fairly serious attempt
[01:24:10.340 --> 01:24:14.580]   to try to do something like Garrett and Eric.
[01:24:14.580 --> 01:24:19.580]   And then your problem is, you do try to spend more time
[01:24:19.580 --> 01:24:22.540]   looking at it and trying to figure out
[01:24:22.540 --> 01:24:23.620]   what they're really doing,
[01:24:23.620 --> 01:24:26.940]   but then at some point you just realize, wait a minute,
[01:24:26.940 --> 01:24:28.580]   for me to really, really understand exactly
[01:24:28.580 --> 01:24:32.300]   what's going on here would just take time.
[01:24:32.300 --> 01:24:33.580]   I just don't have.
[01:24:33.580 --> 01:24:34.660]   - Yeah, it takes a long time.
[01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:36.980]   Which is the nice thing about AI
[01:24:36.980 --> 01:24:41.140]   is unlike the kind of physics we're talking about,
[01:24:41.140 --> 01:24:46.140]   if your idea is good, that should quite naturally lead
[01:24:46.140 --> 01:24:49.820]   to you being able to build a system that's intelligent.
[01:24:49.820 --> 01:24:52.280]   So you don't need to get approval from somebody
[01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:54.480]   that's saying you have a good idea here.
[01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:56.940]   You can just utilize that idea in an engineer system.
[01:24:56.940 --> 01:24:58.860]   Like naturally leads to engineering.
[01:24:58.860 --> 01:25:01.940]   With physics here, if you have a perfect theory
[01:25:01.940 --> 01:25:03.220]   that explains everything,
[01:25:03.220 --> 01:25:06.020]   that still doesn't obviously lead,
[01:25:06.020 --> 01:25:11.020]   one, to scientific experiments that can validate that theory,
[01:25:11.020 --> 01:25:17.780]   and two, to trinkets you can build and sell at a store
[01:25:17.780 --> 01:25:19.820]   for $5. - You can't make money off of it.
[01:25:19.820 --> 01:25:21.180]   (laughing)
[01:25:21.180 --> 01:25:23.620]   - So that makes it much more challenging.
[01:25:23.620 --> 01:25:28.540]   Well, let me also ask you about something that you found,
[01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:30.520]   especially recently, appealing,
[01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:32.800]   which is Roger Penrose's twister theory.
[01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:35.140]   What is it?
[01:25:35.140 --> 01:25:37.780]   What kind of questions might it allow us to answer?
[01:25:37.780 --> 01:25:39.860]   What will the answers look like?
[01:25:39.860 --> 01:25:41.580]   - It's only in the last couple years
[01:25:41.580 --> 01:25:43.960]   that I really, really kind of come to really, I think,
[01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:46.100]   to appreciate it and to see how to really,
[01:25:46.100 --> 01:25:48.460]   I believe, to see how to really do something with it.
[01:25:48.460 --> 01:25:51.180]   And I've gotten very excited about that the last year or two.
[01:25:51.180 --> 01:25:54.780]   I mean, one way of saying, one idea of twister theory
[01:25:54.780 --> 01:25:58.220]   is that it's a different way of thinking
[01:25:58.220 --> 01:26:00.800]   about what space and time are
[01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:03.240]   and about what points in space and time are,
[01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:05.100]   but which is very interesting
[01:26:05.100 --> 01:26:07.400]   that it only really works in four dimensions.
[01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:09.700]   So four dimensions behaves very, very specially
[01:26:09.700 --> 01:26:11.200]   unlike other dimensions.
[01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:13.420]   And in four dimensions, there's certain,
[01:26:13.420 --> 01:26:16.560]   there is a way of thinking about space and time geometry
[01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:19.680]   where, as well as just thinking about points
[01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:24.300]   in space and time, you can also think
[01:26:24.300 --> 01:26:26.240]   about different objects, these so-called twisters.
[01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:28.600]   And then when you do that, you end up
[01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:30.920]   with a kind of a really interesting insight
[01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:35.320]   that you can formulate a theory,
[01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:38.380]   and you can formulate a very, take a standard theory
[01:26:38.380 --> 01:26:41.680]   that we formulate in terms of points of space and time,
[01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:44.520]   and you can reformulate in this twister language.
[01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:46.760]   And in this twister language, it's the,
[01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:51.340]   the fundamental objects are actually, are more kind of the,
[01:26:51.340 --> 01:26:54.140]   are actually spheres in some sense, kind of the light cone.
[01:26:54.140 --> 01:26:58.160]   So maybe one way to say it, which actually I think
[01:26:58.160 --> 01:27:03.160]   is really, is quite amazing, is if you ask yourself,
[01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:05.160]   what do we know about the world?
[01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:08.720]   We have this idea that the world out there is this,
[01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:11.360]   all these different points and these points of time.
[01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:13.220]   Well, that's kind of a derived quantity.
[01:27:13.220 --> 01:27:16.300]   What we really know about the world is when we open our eyes,
[01:27:16.300 --> 01:27:17.480]   what do you see?
[01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:19.600]   You see a sphere.
[01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:23.120]   And that what you're looking at is you're looking at,
[01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:26.520]   a sphere is worth of light rays coming into your eyes.
[01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:29.160]   And what Penrose says is that,
[01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:33.800]   well, what a point in space time is, is that sphere,
[01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:36.600]   that sphere of all the light rays coming in.
[01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:39.200]   And he says, and you should formulate your,
[01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:40.720]   instead of thinking about points,
[01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:43.080]   you should think about the space of those spheres,
[01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:46.840]   if you like, and formulate the degrees of freedom
[01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:50.020]   as physics as living on those spheres, living on,
[01:27:50.020 --> 01:27:51.940]   so you're kind of living on,
[01:27:51.940 --> 01:27:53.640]   your degrees of freedom are living on light rays,
[01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:55.200]   not on points.
[01:27:55.200 --> 01:28:00.200]   And it's a very different way of thinking about physics.
[01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:03.740]   And he and others working with him developed a,
[01:28:03.740 --> 01:28:07.120]   a beautiful mathematical,
[01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:08.440]   beautiful mathematical formalism
[01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:10.680]   and a way to go back from forth between our kind of,
[01:28:10.680 --> 01:28:14.240]   some aspects of our standard way we write these things down
[01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:17.440]   and work in the so-called twister space.
[01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:20.440]   And they, certain things worked out very well,
[01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:23.800]   but they ended up, I think kind of stuck
[01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:25.720]   by the 80s or 90s that they weren't,
[01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:29.680]   a little bit like string theory, that they,
[01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:31.280]   by using these ideas about twisters,
[01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:33.120]   they could develop them in different directions
[01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:34.840]   and find all sorts of other interesting things,
[01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:36.960]   but they were getting,
[01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:38.620]   they weren't finding any way of doing that
[01:28:38.620 --> 01:28:43.200]   that brought them back to kind of new insights into physics.
[01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:46.480]   And my own, I mean, what's kind of gotten me excited really
[01:28:46.480 --> 01:28:49.760]   is what I think I have an idea about
[01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:51.640]   that I think does actually,
[01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:54.200]   does actually work that goes more in that direction.
[01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:56.800]   And I can go on about that endlessly
[01:28:56.800 --> 01:28:59.100]   or talk a little bit about it, but that's the,
[01:28:59.100 --> 01:29:03.200]   I think that that's the one kind of easy to explain
[01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:05.240]   inside about twister theory.
[01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:07.200]   There are some more technical ones I should,
[01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:09.360]   I mean, I think it's also very convincing
[01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:11.280]   what it tells you about spinners, for instance,
[01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:12.960]   but that's a more technical.
[01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:15.000]   - Well, first let's like linger on the spheres
[01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:16.120]   and the light cones.
[01:29:17.480 --> 01:29:21.000]   You're saying twister theory allows you to make that
[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.760]   the fundamental object with which you're operating.
[01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:24.600]   - Yeah.
[01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:27.360]   - I mean, first of all, like philosophically,
[01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:30.840]   that's weird and beautiful.
[01:29:30.840 --> 01:29:34.520]   Maybe because it maps,
[01:29:34.520 --> 01:29:37.000]   it feels like it moves us so much closer
[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:40.760]   to the way human brains perceive reality.
[01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:41.960]   So it's almost like,
[01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:46.440]   our perception is,
[01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:51.480]   like the content of our perception
[01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:54.520]   is the fundamental object of reality.
[01:29:54.520 --> 01:29:55.880]   That's very appealing.
[01:29:55.880 --> 01:29:57.200]   - Yeah.
[01:29:57.200 --> 01:30:00.600]   - Is it mathematically powerful?
[01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:03.760]   Is there something you can say,
[01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:05.800]   can you say a little bit more
[01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:08.360]   about what the heck that even means for,
[01:30:08.360 --> 01:30:11.240]   'cause it's much easier to think about mathematically
[01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:13.520]   like a point in space-time.
[01:30:13.520 --> 01:30:16.880]   Like what does it mean to be operating on the light cone?
[01:30:16.880 --> 01:30:19.360]   - It uses a kind of mathematics that's relative,
[01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:22.040]   that was, kind of goes back to the 19th century
[01:30:22.040 --> 01:30:23.040]   among mathematicians.
[01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:26.400]   It's not, anyway, it's a bit of a long story,
[01:30:26.400 --> 01:30:28.840]   but the one problem is that you have to start,
[01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:31.720]   it's crucial that you think in terms of complex numbers
[01:30:31.720 --> 01:30:32.880]   and not just real numbers.
[01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:36.320]   And this, for most people, that makes it harder to,
[01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:37.600]   for mathematicians, that's fine.
[01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:38.440]   We love doing that.
[01:30:38.440 --> 01:30:40.840]   But for most people, that makes it harder to think about.
[01:30:40.840 --> 01:30:43.080]   But I think perhaps the most,
[01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:45.520]   the way that there is something you can say
[01:30:45.520 --> 01:30:49.080]   very specifically about it, in terms of spinners,
[01:30:49.080 --> 01:30:50.040]   which I don't know if you wanna,
[01:30:50.040 --> 01:30:51.760]   I think at some point you wanna talk.
[01:30:51.760 --> 01:30:53.360]   So maybe again-- - What are spinners?
[01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:54.200]   - Let's start with spinner,
[01:30:54.200 --> 01:30:56.000]   'cause I think that if we can introduce that,
[01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.520]   then I can say-- - By the way,
[01:30:58.520 --> 01:31:01.000]   twister is spelled with an O,
[01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.720]   and spinner is spelled with an O as well.
[01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:05.240]   - Yes, okay.
[01:31:05.240 --> 01:31:06.800]   So-- - In case you wanna Google it
[01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:09.680]   and look it up, there's very nice Wikipedia pages
[01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:10.920]   as a starting point.
[01:31:10.920 --> 01:31:12.400]   I don't know what is a good starting point
[01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:14.520]   for twister theory. (laughs)
[01:31:14.520 --> 01:31:16.080]   - Well, one thing I say about Penrose,
[01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:18.120]   I mean, Penrose is actually a very good writer
[01:31:18.120 --> 01:31:19.400]   and also a very good draftsman.
[01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:20.480]   He's a draftsman.
[01:31:20.480 --> 01:31:22.040]   To the extent this is visualizable,
[01:31:22.040 --> 01:31:23.680]   he actually has done some very nice drawings.
[01:31:23.680 --> 01:31:26.480]   So I mean, almost any kind of expository thing
[01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:29.840]   you can find him writing is a very good place to start.
[01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:32.560]   He's a remarkable person.
[01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:36.040]   But the, so spinners are something
[01:31:36.040 --> 01:31:38.360]   that independently came out of mathematics
[01:31:38.360 --> 01:31:40.080]   and out of physics.
[01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:42.640]   And to say where they came out of physics,
[01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:44.640]   I mean, what people realized when they started looking
[01:31:44.640 --> 01:31:47.600]   at elementary particles like electrons or whatever,
[01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:51.680]   that there seemed to be some kind of doubling
[01:31:51.680 --> 01:31:53.160]   of the degrees of freedom going on.
[01:31:53.160 --> 01:31:57.120]   If you counted what was there in some sense
[01:31:57.120 --> 01:31:58.200]   in the way you would expect it,
[01:31:58.200 --> 01:32:00.080]   and when you started doing quantum mechanics
[01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:01.800]   and started looking at elementary particles,
[01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:03.760]   there were seem to be two degrees of freedom.
[01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:04.920]   There are not one.
[01:32:04.920 --> 01:32:08.800]   And one way of seeing it was that if you put
[01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:11.920]   your electron in a strong magnetic field
[01:32:11.920 --> 01:32:14.120]   and asked what was the energy of it,
[01:32:14.120 --> 01:32:15.520]   instead of it having one energy,
[01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:16.760]   it would have two energies.
[01:32:16.760 --> 01:32:17.920]   There'd be two energy levels.
[01:32:17.920 --> 01:32:20.480]   And as you increase magnetic field,
[01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:22.080]   the splitting would increase.
[01:32:22.080 --> 01:32:24.960]   So physicists kind of realized that, wait a minute.
[01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:27.000]   So we thought when we were doing,
[01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:28.200]   first started doing quantum mechanics,
[01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:31.120]   that the way to describe particles
[01:32:31.120 --> 01:32:32.560]   was in terms of wave functions.
[01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:35.840]   And these wave functions were complex to complex values.
[01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:38.080]   Well, if we actually look at particles,
[01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:38.920]   that's not right.
[01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:42.080]   They're pairs of complex numbers.
[01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:44.120]   They're pairs of complex numbers.
[01:32:44.120 --> 01:32:46.920]   So one of the kind of fundamental,
[01:32:46.920 --> 01:32:47.840]   from the physics point of view,
[01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:49.080]   the fundamental question is,
[01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:51.720]   why are all our kind of fundamental particles
[01:32:51.720 --> 01:32:55.760]   described by pairs of complex numbers?
[01:32:55.760 --> 01:32:56.600]   Just weird.
[01:32:56.600 --> 01:33:01.600]   And then you can ask, well, what happens if you
[01:33:01.600 --> 01:33:03.200]   take an electron and rotate it?
[01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:07.760]   So how do things move in this pair of complex numbers?
[01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:10.920]   Well, now, if you go back to mathematics,
[01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:13.840]   what had been understood in mathematics
[01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:16.360]   some years earlier, not that many years earlier,
[01:33:16.360 --> 01:33:20.440]   was that if you ask very, very generally,
[01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:24.240]   think about geometry of three dimensions and ask,
[01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:25.800]   and if you think about things that are happening
[01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:28.240]   in three dimensions in the standard way,
[01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:30.480]   everything, the standard way of doing geometry,
[01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:32.520]   everything is about vectors, right?
[01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:35.160]   So if you take any mathematics classes,
[01:33:35.160 --> 01:33:36.680]   you probably see vectors at some point.
[01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:39.400]   They're just triplets of numbers tell you
[01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:41.600]   what a direction is or how far you're going
[01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:42.960]   in three-dimensional space.
[01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:46.240]   And most of everything we teach in most standard courses
[01:33:46.240 --> 01:33:49.680]   in mathematics is about vectors
[01:33:49.680 --> 01:33:51.400]   and things you build out of vectors.
[01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:53.040]   So you express everything about geometry
[01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:55.400]   in terms of vectors or how they're changing
[01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:57.600]   or how you put two of them together
[01:33:57.600 --> 01:34:00.920]   and get planes and whatever.
[01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:03.880]   But what had been realized early on
[01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:05.800]   is that if you ask very, very generally,
[01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:10.800]   what are the things that you can kind of consistently think
[01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:13.040]   about rotating?
[01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:16.360]   And so you ask a technical question,
[01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:18.640]   what are the representations of the rotation group?
[01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:22.240]   Well, you find that one answer is they're vectors
[01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:24.720]   and everything you build out of vectors.
[01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:26.440]   But then people found, but wait a minute,
[01:34:26.440 --> 01:34:28.400]   there's also these other things
[01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:31.840]   which you can't build out of vectors,
[01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:34.440]   but which you can consistently rotate.
[01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:37.040]   And they're described by pairs of complex numbers,
[01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:38.440]   by two complex numbers.
[01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:40.360]   And they're the spinners also.
[01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:45.080]   And you can think of spinners in some sense
[01:34:45.080 --> 01:34:46.640]   as more fundamental than vectors
[01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:48.840]   because you can build vectors out of spinners.
[01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:51.160]   You can take two spinners and make a vector,
[01:34:51.160 --> 01:34:56.160]   but if you only have vectors, you can't get spinners.
[01:34:56.160 --> 01:34:58.160]   So they're in some sense,
[01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:00.980]   there's some kind of lower level of geometry
[01:35:00.980 --> 01:35:02.160]   beyond what we thought it was,
[01:35:02.160 --> 01:35:04.240]   which was kind of spinner geometry.
[01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:07.360]   And this is something which even to this day
[01:35:07.360 --> 01:35:09.440]   when we teach graduate courses in geometry,
[01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:11.720]   we mostly don't talk about this
[01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:15.360]   because it's a bit hard to do correctly.
[01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:17.560]   If you start with your whole setup
[01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:18.880]   is in terms of vectors,
[01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:22.000]   describing things in terms of spinners
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000]   is a whole different ball game.
[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:28.760]   But anyway, it was just this amazing fact
[01:35:28.760 --> 01:35:33.000]   that this kind of more fundamental piece of geometry
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.440]   of spinners and what we were actually seeing,
[01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:37.920]   if you look at electron are one in the same.
[01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:41.340]   So I think it's kind of a mind blowing thing,
[01:35:41.340 --> 01:35:44.920]   but it's very counterintuitive.
[01:35:44.920 --> 01:35:47.080]   - What are some weird properties of spinners
[01:35:47.080 --> 01:35:50.260]   that are counterintuitive?
[01:35:50.260 --> 01:35:51.560]   - That there are some things that they do.
[01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:56.320]   For instance, if you rotate a spinner around 360 degrees,
[01:35:56.320 --> 01:35:58.000]   it doesn't come back towards,
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.020]   it becomes minus what it was.
[01:36:01.300 --> 01:36:04.700]   So it's, anyway, so the way rotations work,
[01:36:04.700 --> 01:36:05.960]   there's a kind of a funny sign
[01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:08.220]   you have to keep track of in some sense.
[01:36:08.220 --> 01:36:11.080]   So they're kind of too valued in another weird way.
[01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:14.760]   But the fundamental problem is that it's just not,
[01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:17.620]   if you're used to visualizing vectors,
[01:36:17.620 --> 01:36:20.620]   there's nothing you can do visualizing in terms of vectors
[01:36:20.620 --> 01:36:21.900]   that will ever give you a spinner.
[01:36:21.900 --> 01:36:23.900]   It just is not gonna ever work.
[01:36:23.900 --> 01:36:26.660]   - As you were saying that I was visualizing a vector
[01:36:26.660 --> 01:36:28.900]   walking along a Mobius strip
[01:36:28.900 --> 01:36:30.900]   and it ends up being upside down.
[01:36:31.900 --> 01:36:34.820]   But you're saying that doesn't really capture.
[01:36:34.820 --> 01:36:36.860]   - So what really captures it,
[01:36:36.860 --> 01:36:39.500]   the problem is that it's really,
[01:36:39.500 --> 01:36:41.220]   the simplest way to describe it
[01:36:41.220 --> 01:36:43.420]   is in terms of two complex numbers.
[01:36:43.420 --> 01:36:45.060]   And your problem with two complex numbers
[01:36:45.060 --> 01:36:46.820]   is that's four real numbers.
[01:36:46.820 --> 01:36:50.540]   So your spinner kind of lies in a four dimensional space.
[01:36:50.540 --> 01:36:53.820]   So that makes it hard to visualize.
[01:36:53.820 --> 01:36:57.540]   And it's crucial that it's not just any four dimensions,
[01:36:57.540 --> 01:36:59.340]   it's just, it's actually complex numbers.
[01:36:59.340 --> 01:37:01.780]   You're really gonna use the fact that
[01:37:01.780 --> 01:37:03.220]   these are two complex numbers.
[01:37:03.220 --> 01:37:06.180]   So it's very hard to visualize.
[01:37:06.180 --> 01:37:09.340]   But to get back to what I think is mind blowing
[01:37:09.340 --> 01:37:12.020]   about twisters is that the,
[01:37:12.020 --> 01:37:15.820]   another way of saying this idea about talking about spheres,
[01:37:15.820 --> 01:37:17.380]   another way of saying the fundamental idea
[01:37:17.380 --> 01:37:19.460]   of twister theory is,
[01:37:19.460 --> 01:37:21.580]   in some sense the fundamental idea of twister theory
[01:37:21.580 --> 01:37:26.580]   is that a point is a two complex dimensional space.
[01:37:28.740 --> 01:37:32.060]   So that every, and that it lives inside,
[01:37:32.060 --> 01:37:34.580]   the space that it lies inside is twister space.
[01:37:34.580 --> 01:37:36.740]   So in the simplest case, it's four,
[01:37:36.740 --> 01:37:38.500]   twister space is four dimensional.
[01:37:38.500 --> 01:37:43.060]   And a point in space time is a two complex dimensional
[01:37:43.060 --> 01:37:47.500]   subspace of all the four complex dimensions.
[01:37:47.500 --> 01:37:49.020]   And as you move around in space time,
[01:37:49.020 --> 01:37:51.660]   you're just moving, your planes are just moving around.
[01:37:51.660 --> 01:37:52.500]   Okay.
[01:37:52.500 --> 01:37:54.820]   And that, but then the--
[01:37:54.820 --> 01:37:57.020]   - So it's a plane in a four dimensional space.
[01:37:57.020 --> 01:37:58.700]   - It's a, yeah, a plane--
[01:37:58.700 --> 01:37:59.540]   - Complex.
[01:37:59.540 --> 01:38:00.380]   - Complex plane.
[01:38:00.380 --> 01:38:03.100]   So it's two complex dimensions in four complex.
[01:38:03.100 --> 01:38:03.940]   - Got it.
[01:38:03.940 --> 01:38:05.820]   - But then to me, the mind blowing thing about this
[01:38:05.820 --> 01:38:09.420]   is this then kind of tautologically answers the question
[01:38:09.420 --> 01:38:10.420]   is what is a spinner?
[01:38:10.420 --> 01:38:14.140]   Well, a spinner is a point.
[01:38:14.140 --> 01:38:17.940]   I mean, the space of spinners at a point is the point.
[01:38:17.940 --> 01:38:21.540]   In twister theory, the points are the complex two planes.
[01:38:21.540 --> 01:38:24.660]   And you want me to, and you're asking what a spinner is.
[01:38:24.660 --> 01:38:28.300]   Well, a spinner, the space of spinners is that two plane.
[01:38:28.300 --> 01:38:31.820]   So it's just your whole definition
[01:38:31.820 --> 01:38:33.380]   of what a point in space time was
[01:38:33.380 --> 01:38:35.220]   just told you what a spinner was.
[01:38:35.220 --> 01:38:37.220]   It's the same thing.
[01:38:37.220 --> 01:38:38.500]   - Yeah, well, we're trying to project that
[01:38:38.500 --> 01:38:41.340]   into a three dimensional space and trying to intuit,
[01:38:41.340 --> 01:38:42.260]   but you can't.
[01:38:42.260 --> 01:38:44.140]   - Yeah, so the intuition becomes very difficult,
[01:38:44.140 --> 01:38:49.140]   but from, if you don't, not using twister theory,
[01:38:49.140 --> 01:38:51.340]   you have to kind of go through a certain
[01:38:51.340 --> 01:38:54.580]   fairly complicated rigmarole to even describe spinners,
[01:38:54.580 --> 01:38:55.980]   to describe electrons.
[01:38:55.980 --> 01:38:57.220]   Whereas using twister theory,
[01:38:57.220 --> 01:38:58.820]   it's just completely tautological.
[01:38:58.820 --> 01:39:03.100]   They're just what you want to describe.
[01:39:03.100 --> 01:39:05.980]   The electron is fundamentally the way
[01:39:05.980 --> 01:39:08.180]   you're describing the point in space time already.
[01:39:08.180 --> 01:39:09.120]   It's just there.
[01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:11.580]   - Do you have a hope?
[01:39:11.580 --> 01:39:13.260]   You mentioned that you've been,
[01:39:13.260 --> 01:39:14.940]   you found it appealing recently.
[01:39:14.940 --> 01:39:17.260]   Is it just because of certain aspects
[01:39:17.260 --> 01:39:18.500]   of its mathematical beauty,
[01:39:18.500 --> 01:39:20.460]   or do you actually have a hope that this might lead
[01:39:20.460 --> 01:39:22.580]   to a theory of everything?
[01:39:22.580 --> 01:39:25.100]   - Yeah, I mean, I certainly do have such a hope
[01:39:25.100 --> 01:39:26.500]   'cause what I've found,
[01:39:26.500 --> 01:39:27.980]   I think the thing which I've done,
[01:39:27.980 --> 01:39:29.740]   which I don't think, as far as I can tell,
[01:39:29.740 --> 01:39:33.380]   no one had really looked at from this point of view before,
[01:39:33.380 --> 01:39:38.380]   is, has to do with this question of how do you treat time
[01:39:38.380 --> 01:39:40.820]   in your quantum theory?
[01:39:40.820 --> 01:39:44.420]   And so there's another long story
[01:39:44.420 --> 01:39:46.660]   about how we do quantum theories
[01:39:46.660 --> 01:39:48.700]   and about how we treat time in quantum theories,
[01:39:48.700 --> 01:39:51.780]   which is a long story.
[01:39:51.780 --> 01:39:54.500]   But to me, the short version of it is that
[01:39:54.500 --> 01:39:56.620]   what people have found when you try and write down
[01:39:56.620 --> 01:39:58.500]   a quantum theory,
[01:39:58.500 --> 01:40:03.500]   that it's often a good idea to take your time coordinate,
[01:40:03.500 --> 01:40:07.140]   whatever you're using to your time coordinate,
[01:40:07.140 --> 01:40:09.980]   and multiply it by the square root of minus one
[01:40:09.980 --> 01:40:12.020]   and to make it purely imaginary.
[01:40:12.020 --> 01:40:14.500]   And so all these formulas which you have
[01:40:14.500 --> 01:40:18.460]   in your standard theory,
[01:40:18.460 --> 01:40:19.900]   if you do that to those,
[01:40:19.900 --> 01:40:23.660]   I mean, those formulas have some very strange behavior
[01:40:23.660 --> 01:40:25.380]   and they're kind of singular.
[01:40:25.380 --> 01:40:27.800]   If you ask even some simple questions,
[01:40:27.800 --> 01:40:31.020]   you have to take very delicate singular limits
[01:40:31.020 --> 01:40:33.260]   in order to get the correct answer.
[01:40:33.260 --> 01:40:35.060]   And you have to take them from the right direction,
[01:40:35.060 --> 01:40:36.980]   otherwise it doesn't work.
[01:40:36.980 --> 01:40:39.980]   Whereas if you just take time,
[01:40:39.980 --> 01:40:42.140]   and if you just put a factor of square root of minus one,
[01:40:42.140 --> 01:40:44.260]   wherever you see the time coordinate,
[01:40:44.260 --> 01:40:47.340]   you end up with much simpler formulas,
[01:40:47.340 --> 01:40:49.900]   which are much better behaved mathematically.
[01:40:49.900 --> 01:40:52.900]   And what I hadn't really appreciated until fairly recently
[01:40:52.900 --> 01:40:55.500]   is also how dramatically that changes
[01:40:55.500 --> 01:40:57.260]   the whole structure of the theory.
[01:40:57.260 --> 01:40:59.780]   You end up with a consistent way of talking
[01:40:59.780 --> 01:41:01.600]   about these quantum theories,
[01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:04.300]   but it has some very different flavor
[01:41:04.300 --> 01:41:07.380]   and very different aspects that I hadn't really appreciated.
[01:41:07.380 --> 01:41:10.900]   And in particular, the way symmetries act on it
[01:41:10.900 --> 01:41:15.060]   is not at all what I originally had expected.
[01:41:15.060 --> 01:41:17.660]   And so that's the new thing that I've,
[01:41:17.660 --> 01:41:21.820]   or I think gives you something is to do this move,
[01:41:21.820 --> 01:41:24.220]   which people often think of as just kind of a,
[01:41:24.220 --> 01:41:27.380]   kind of a mathematical trick that you're doing
[01:41:27.380 --> 01:41:29.780]   to make some formulas work out nicely,
[01:41:29.780 --> 01:41:33.180]   but to take that mathematical trick as really fundamental.
[01:41:33.180 --> 01:41:35.940]   And it turns out in twister theory,
[01:41:35.940 --> 01:41:39.540]   allows you to simultaneously talk about your usual time
[01:41:39.540 --> 01:41:41.900]   and the time times the square root of minus one.
[01:41:41.900 --> 01:41:45.500]   They both fit very nicely into twister theory.
[01:41:45.500 --> 01:41:48.380]   And you end up with some structures,
[01:41:48.380 --> 01:41:50.480]   which look a lot like the standard models.
[01:41:51.480 --> 01:41:54.120]   - Well, let me ask you about some Nobel prizes.
[01:41:54.120 --> 01:41:55.280]   - Okay.
[01:41:55.280 --> 01:41:56.720]   - Do you think there will be,
[01:41:56.720 --> 01:42:03.360]   there was a bet between Michio Kaku and somebody else.
[01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:05.040]   - John Horgan.
[01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:07.760]   - John Horgan about, by the way,
[01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:11.160]   maybe discover a cool website, longbets.com or .org.
[01:42:11.160 --> 01:42:12.120]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:42:12.120 --> 01:42:12.960]   - It's cool.
[01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:15.160]   It's cool that you can make a bet with people
[01:42:15.160 --> 01:42:18.360]   and then check in 20 years later.
[01:42:18.360 --> 01:42:19.480]   That's, I really love it.
[01:42:19.480 --> 01:42:21.120]   There's a lot of interesting bets on there.
[01:42:21.120 --> 01:42:21.960]   - Yeah.
[01:42:21.960 --> 01:42:23.840]   - I would love to participate, but it's interesting to see,
[01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:25.160]   you know, time flies.
[01:42:25.160 --> 01:42:26.160]   - Yeah.
[01:42:26.160 --> 01:42:28.880]   - And you make a bet about what's going to happen 20 years.
[01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:31.040]   You don't realize 20 years just goes like this.
[01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:31.880]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:42:31.880 --> 01:42:35.520]   - And then you get to face, and you get to wonder,
[01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:40.520]   like, what was that person, what was I thinking?
[01:42:40.520 --> 01:42:43.840]   That person 20 years ago is almost like a different person.
[01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:46.320]   What was I thinking back then to think that?
[01:42:46.320 --> 01:42:47.200]   It's interesting.
[01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:49.600]   But, so let me ask you this, on record,
[01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:54.000]   you know, 20 years from now or some number of years from now,
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:55.780]   do you think there'll be a Nobel Prize given
[01:42:55.780 --> 01:42:58.280]   for something directly connected
[01:42:58.280 --> 01:43:01.720]   to a first broadly theory of everything?
[01:43:01.720 --> 01:43:05.960]   And second, of course, one of the possibilities,
[01:43:05.960 --> 01:43:08.240]   one of them, string theory?
[01:43:08.240 --> 01:43:13.040]   - String theory, definitely not.
[01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:16.200]   The things have gone, yeah.
[01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:18.120]   - So if you were giving financial advice,
[01:43:18.120 --> 01:43:19.120]   you would say not to bet on it?
[01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:20.320]   - No, do not bet on it.
[01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:23.600]   And even, I actually suspect if you ask string theorists
[01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:24.840]   that question, these days,
[01:43:24.840 --> 01:43:27.480]   you're gonna get few of them saying,
[01:43:27.480 --> 01:43:29.560]   I mean, if you'd asked them that question 20 years ago,
[01:43:29.560 --> 01:43:32.120]   again, when Kaku was making this bet or whatever,
[01:43:32.120 --> 01:43:34.480]   I think some of them would have taken you up on it.
[01:43:34.480 --> 01:43:36.960]   But, and certainly back in 1984,
[01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:38.960]   a bunch of them would have said, oh, sure, yeah.
[01:43:38.960 --> 01:43:43.000]   But now, I get the impression that they've,
[01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.640]   even they realize that things are not looking good
[01:43:45.640 --> 01:43:46.840]   for that particular idea.
[01:43:46.840 --> 01:43:48.580]   Again, it depends what you mean by string theory,
[01:43:48.580 --> 01:43:51.880]   whether maybe the term will evolve to mean something else,
[01:43:51.880 --> 01:43:53.760]   which will work out.
[01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:57.360]   But yeah, I don't think that's not gonna like it to work out
[01:43:57.360 --> 01:43:59.200]   whether something else, I mean,
[01:43:59.200 --> 01:44:01.200]   I still think it's relatively unlikely
[01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:04.920]   that you'll have any really successful theory of everything.
[01:44:04.920 --> 01:44:07.460]   And the main problem is just the,
[01:44:07.460 --> 01:44:11.080]   it's become so difficult to do experiments
[01:44:11.080 --> 01:44:13.560]   at higher energy that we've really lost this ability
[01:44:13.560 --> 01:44:18.560]   to kind of get unexpected input from experiment.
[01:44:18.560 --> 01:44:22.220]   And you can, while it may be hard to figure out
[01:44:22.220 --> 01:44:24.860]   what people's thinking is gonna be 20 years from now,
[01:44:24.860 --> 01:44:28.760]   looking at high energy particle,
[01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:30.920]   high energy colliders and their technology,
[01:44:30.920 --> 01:44:33.560]   it's actually pretty easy to make a pretty accurate guess
[01:44:33.560 --> 01:44:34.400]   what it's gonna look,
[01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:37.280]   what you're gonna be doing 20 years from now.
[01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:42.280]   And I think actually, I would actually claim that
[01:44:42.400 --> 01:44:44.560]   it's pretty clear where you're gonna be 20 years from now.
[01:44:44.560 --> 01:44:46.960]   And what it's gonna be is you're gonna have the,
[01:44:46.960 --> 01:44:50.080]   you're gonna have the LHC,
[01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:51.520]   you're gonna have a lot more data,
[01:44:51.520 --> 01:44:56.120]   an order of magnitude or more data from the LHC,
[01:44:56.120 --> 01:44:57.600]   but at the same energy.
[01:44:57.600 --> 01:45:01.960]   You're not gonna see a higher energy accelerator
[01:45:01.960 --> 01:45:05.360]   operating successfully in the next 20 years.
[01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:08.160]   - And like maybe machine learning
[01:45:08.160 --> 01:45:10.280]   or great sort of data science methodologies
[01:45:10.280 --> 01:45:14.800]   that process that data will not reveal any major
[01:45:14.800 --> 01:45:17.400]   like shift in our understanding
[01:45:17.400 --> 01:45:19.200]   of the underlying physics, you think?
[01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:20.040]   - I don't think so.
[01:45:20.040 --> 01:45:22.480]   I mean, I think that field,
[01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:25.280]   my understanding is that they're starting
[01:45:25.280 --> 01:45:26.960]   to make a great use of those techniques,
[01:45:26.960 --> 01:45:29.560]   but it seems to look like it will help them
[01:45:29.560 --> 01:45:31.040]   solve certain technical problems
[01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:32.560]   and be able to do things somewhat better,
[01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:35.480]   but not completely change
[01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:36.640]   the way they're looking at things.
[01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:39.600]   - What do you think about the potential quantum computers
[01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:41.280]   simulating quantum mechanical systems
[01:45:41.280 --> 01:45:44.760]   and through that sneak up to sort of,
[01:45:44.760 --> 01:45:48.280]   through simulation sneak up to a deep understanding
[01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:51.560]   of the fundamental physics?
[01:45:51.560 --> 01:45:55.360]   - The problem there is that's promising more for this,
[01:45:55.360 --> 01:46:01.520]   for Phil Anderson's problem that if you wanna,
[01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:03.080]   there's lots and lots of,
[01:46:03.080 --> 01:46:08.600]   you start putting together lots and lots of things
[01:46:08.600 --> 01:46:11.080]   and we think we know that are pair by pair interactions,
[01:46:11.080 --> 01:46:13.360]   but what this thing is gonna do,
[01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:16.320]   we don't have any good calculational techniques.
[01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:19.520]   You know, quantum computers may very well give you those.
[01:46:19.520 --> 01:46:21.640]   And so they may, what we think of
[01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:23.240]   as kind of a strong coupling behavior,
[01:46:23.240 --> 01:46:25.240]   we have no good way to calculate.
[01:46:25.240 --> 01:46:28.280]   You know, even though we can write down the theory,
[01:46:28.280 --> 01:46:30.640]   we don't know how to calculate anything
[01:46:30.640 --> 01:46:32.080]   with any accuracy in it.
[01:46:32.080 --> 01:46:34.640]   The quantum computers may solve that problem.
[01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:35.800]   But the problem is that they,
[01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:38.160]   I don't think that they're gonna solve the problem
[01:46:38.160 --> 01:46:41.080]   that they help you with the problem of not having the,
[01:46:41.080 --> 01:46:44.200]   of knowing what the right underlying theory is.
[01:46:44.200 --> 01:46:48.520]   - As somebody who likes experimental validation,
[01:46:48.520 --> 01:46:51.280]   let me ask you the perhaps ridiculous sounding,
[01:46:51.280 --> 01:46:54.520]   but I don't think it's actually a ridiculous question of,
[01:46:54.520 --> 01:46:56.680]   do you think we live in a simulation?
[01:46:56.680 --> 01:46:58.320]   Do you find that thought experiment
[01:46:58.320 --> 01:47:00.200]   at all useful or interesting?
[01:47:00.200 --> 01:47:03.640]   - Not really, I don't, it just doesn't,
[01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:08.680]   yeah, anyway, to me, it doesn't actually lead
[01:47:08.680 --> 01:47:11.960]   to any kind of interesting, lead anywhere interesting.
[01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:15.540]   - Yeah, to me, so maybe I'll throw a wrench into your thing.
[01:47:15.540 --> 01:47:17.880]   To me, it's super interesting
[01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:19.620]   from an engineering perspective.
[01:47:19.620 --> 01:47:21.860]   So if you look at virtual reality systems,
[01:47:21.860 --> 01:47:28.160]   the actual question is, how much computation
[01:47:28.160 --> 01:47:32.960]   and how difficult is it to construct a world
[01:47:32.960 --> 01:47:35.760]   that, like there are several levels here.
[01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:39.720]   One is you won't know the difference,
[01:47:39.720 --> 01:47:41.360]   our human perception systems,
[01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:43.040]   and maybe even the tools of physics won't know
[01:47:43.040 --> 01:47:44.920]   the difference between the simulated world
[01:47:44.920 --> 01:47:45.880]   and the real world.
[01:47:45.880 --> 01:47:51.000]   That's sort of more of a physics question.
[01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.780]   The most interesting question to me has more to do
[01:47:53.780 --> 01:47:55.720]   with why food tastes delicious,
[01:47:55.720 --> 01:47:59.920]   which is create how difficult and how much computation
[01:47:59.920 --> 01:48:02.840]   is required to construct a simulation
[01:48:02.840 --> 01:48:06.080]   where you kind of know it's a simulation at first,
[01:48:06.080 --> 01:48:07.840]   but you wanna stay there anyway.
[01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:12.840]   And over time, you don't even remember.
[01:48:12.840 --> 01:48:15.840]   - Yeah, well, anyway, I agree,
[01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:18.320]   these are kind of fascinating questions
[01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:20.000]   and they may be very, very relevant
[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:21.880]   to our future as a species,
[01:48:21.880 --> 01:48:24.760]   but yeah, they're just very far from anything.
[01:48:24.760 --> 01:48:27.560]   - But so from a physics perspective,
[01:48:27.560 --> 01:48:29.360]   it's not useful to you to think,
[01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:32.320]   taking a computational perspective to our universe,
[01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:35.120]   thinking of it as an information processing system,
[01:48:35.120 --> 01:48:37.400]   and then think of it as doing computation,
[01:48:37.400 --> 01:48:39.400]   and then you think about the resources required
[01:48:39.400 --> 01:48:42.240]   to do that kind of computation and all that kind of stuff.
[01:48:42.240 --> 01:48:43.760]   You could just look at the basic physics
[01:48:43.760 --> 01:48:46.680]   and who cares what the computer it's running on is.
[01:48:46.680 --> 01:48:47.960]   - Yeah, it just, I mean, the kinds of,
[01:48:47.960 --> 01:48:50.560]   I mean, I'm willing to agree that you can get
[01:48:50.560 --> 01:48:52.760]   into interesting kinds of questions going down that road,
[01:48:52.760 --> 01:48:55.200]   but they're just so different from anything,
[01:48:55.200 --> 01:48:56.280]   from what I've found interesting.
[01:48:56.280 --> 01:49:00.320]   And I just, again, I just have to kind of go back to,
[01:49:00.320 --> 01:49:02.320]   life is too short and I'm very glad
[01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:03.680]   other people are thinking about this,
[01:49:03.680 --> 01:49:07.500]   but I just don't see anything I can do with it.
[01:49:07.500 --> 01:49:11.440]   - What about space itself?
[01:49:11.440 --> 01:49:13.140]   So I have to ask you about aliens.
[01:49:13.140 --> 01:49:17.640]   Again, something, since you emphasize evidence,
[01:49:17.640 --> 01:49:20.800]   do you think there is, how many,
[01:49:20.800 --> 01:49:22.960]   do you think there are and how many
[01:49:22.960 --> 01:49:25.880]   intelligent alien civilizations are out there?
[01:49:25.880 --> 01:49:28.520]   - Yeah, I have no idea, but I've certainly,
[01:49:28.520 --> 01:49:30.680]   as far as I know, unless the government's covering it up
[01:49:30.680 --> 01:49:32.960]   or something, we haven't heard from,
[01:49:32.960 --> 01:49:35.720]   we don't have any evidence for such things yet,
[01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:37.520]   but there seems to be no,
[01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:42.040]   there's no particular obstruction why there shouldn't be.
[01:49:42.040 --> 01:49:47.440]   - I mean, do you, you work on some fundamental questions
[01:49:47.440 --> 01:49:49.120]   about the physics of reality.
[01:49:49.120 --> 01:49:51.600]   When you look up to the stars,
[01:49:51.600 --> 01:49:55.200]   do you think about whether somebody's looking back at us?
[01:49:55.200 --> 01:49:56.120]   - Yes, yeah, well, actually,
[01:49:56.120 --> 01:49:58.080]   I originally got interested in physics.
[01:49:58.080 --> 01:50:00.160]   I actually started out as a kid interested in astronomy,
[01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:02.280]   exactly that, and telescope and whatever that,
[01:50:02.280 --> 01:50:05.600]   and certainly read a lot of science fiction
[01:50:05.600 --> 01:50:08.320]   and thought about that.
[01:50:08.320 --> 01:50:12.000]   I find over the years, I find myself kind of less,
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:15.080]   anyway, less and less interested in that,
[01:50:15.080 --> 01:50:18.080]   just because I don't really know what to do with them.
[01:50:18.080 --> 01:50:21.400]   I also kind of at some point kind of stopped
[01:50:21.400 --> 01:50:23.040]   reading science fiction that much,
[01:50:23.040 --> 01:50:25.080]   kind of feeling that there was just too,
[01:50:25.080 --> 01:50:27.080]   that the actual science I was kind of learning about
[01:50:27.080 --> 01:50:29.880]   was perfectly kind of weird and fascinating
[01:50:29.880 --> 01:50:33.120]   and unusual enough and better than any of the stuff
[01:50:33.120 --> 01:50:36.600]   that Isaac Asimov, so why shouldn't I?
[01:50:36.600 --> 01:50:39.720]   - Yeah, and you can mess with the science
[01:50:39.720 --> 01:50:42.300]   much more than the distant science fiction,
[01:50:42.300 --> 01:50:45.400]   the one that exists in our imagination
[01:50:45.400 --> 01:50:48.320]   or the one that exists out there among the stars.
[01:50:48.320 --> 01:50:51.200]   Well, you mentioned science fiction.
[01:50:51.200 --> 01:50:54.080]   You've written quite a few book reviews.
[01:50:54.080 --> 01:50:56.440]   I gotta ask you about some books, perhaps,
[01:50:56.440 --> 01:50:57.540]   if you don't mind.
[01:50:57.540 --> 01:51:02.920]   Is there one or two books that you would recommend
[01:51:02.920 --> 01:51:05.260]   to others, and maybe if you can,
[01:51:05.260 --> 01:51:07.020]   what ideas you drew from them?
[01:51:07.020 --> 01:51:12.680]   Either negative recommendations or positive recommendations.
[01:51:12.680 --> 01:51:15.200]   Do not read this book for sure.
[01:51:15.200 --> 01:51:17.480]   - Well, I must say, I mean, unfortunately,
[01:51:17.480 --> 01:51:19.880]   yeah, well, you can go to my website
[01:51:19.880 --> 01:51:21.680]   and you can click on book reviews
[01:51:21.680 --> 01:51:24.080]   and you can see I've written, read a lot of,
[01:51:24.080 --> 01:51:27.880]   I mean, as you can tell from my views about string theory,
[01:51:27.880 --> 01:51:31.000]   I'm not a fan of a lot of the kind of popular books
[01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:32.720]   about, oh, isn't string theory great?
[01:51:32.720 --> 01:51:37.720]   And yes, I'm not a fan of a lot of things of that kind.
[01:51:37.720 --> 01:51:40.520]   - Can I ask you a quick question on this, a small tangent?
[01:51:40.520 --> 01:51:46.400]   Are you a fan, can you explore the pros and cons
[01:51:46.400 --> 01:51:50.680]   of, forget string theory, sort of science communication,
[01:51:51.600 --> 01:51:56.600]   sort of cosmos style communication of concepts
[01:51:56.600 --> 01:51:59.040]   to people that are outside of physics,
[01:51:59.040 --> 01:52:02.240]   outside of mathematics, outside of even the sciences,
[01:52:02.240 --> 01:52:04.800]   and helping people to sort of dream
[01:52:04.800 --> 01:52:08.160]   and fill them with awe about the full range of mysteries
[01:52:08.160 --> 01:52:09.080]   in our universe?
[01:52:09.080 --> 01:52:11.260]   - That's a complicated issue.
[01:52:11.260 --> 01:52:13.680]   You know, I think, you know, I certainly go back
[01:52:13.680 --> 01:52:15.680]   and go back to like what inspired me
[01:52:15.680 --> 01:52:18.440]   and maybe to connect it a little bit
[01:52:18.440 --> 01:52:19.340]   to this question about books.
[01:52:19.340 --> 01:52:21.560]   I mean, certainly when the books that,
[01:52:21.560 --> 01:52:24.000]   some books that I remember reading when I was a kid
[01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.300]   were about the early history of quantum mechanics,
[01:52:26.300 --> 01:52:29.060]   like Heisenberg's books that he wrote about, you know,
[01:52:29.060 --> 01:52:31.100]   kind of looking back at telling the history
[01:52:31.100 --> 01:52:32.940]   of what happened when he developed quantum mechanics.
[01:52:32.940 --> 01:52:36.620]   It's just kind of a totally fascinating, romantic,
[01:52:36.620 --> 01:52:40.020]   great story, and those were very inspirational to me.
[01:52:40.020 --> 01:52:41.820]   And I would think maybe that other people
[01:52:41.820 --> 01:52:44.240]   might also find them.
[01:52:44.240 --> 01:52:45.080]   But the--
[01:52:45.080 --> 01:52:47.220]   - And that's almost like the human story
[01:52:47.220 --> 01:52:49.100]   of the development of the ideas.
[01:52:49.100 --> 01:52:50.100]   - Yeah, the human story.
[01:52:50.100 --> 01:52:51.820]   But yeah, just also how, you know,
[01:52:51.820 --> 01:52:53.780]   they have these very, very weird ideas
[01:52:53.780 --> 01:52:54.980]   that didn't seem to make sense,
[01:52:54.980 --> 01:52:56.300]   how they were struggling with them,
[01:52:56.300 --> 01:52:58.860]   and how, you know, they actually, anyway.
[01:52:58.860 --> 01:53:03.700]   It's, I think it's the period of physics kind of beginning,
[01:53:03.700 --> 01:53:06.060]   you know, in 1905, with Planck and Einstein,
[01:53:06.060 --> 01:53:09.900]   and ending up with the war when these things are,
[01:53:09.900 --> 01:53:14.060]   get used to, you know, make massively destructive weapons.
[01:53:14.060 --> 01:53:15.740]   It's just that totally amazing.
[01:53:15.740 --> 01:53:17.580]   - So many, so many new ideas.
[01:53:17.580 --> 01:53:19.780]   Let me, on another, a tangent on top of a tangent
[01:53:19.780 --> 01:53:24.780]   on top of a tangent, ask, if we didn't have Einstein,
[01:53:24.780 --> 01:53:26.700]   so how does science progress?
[01:53:26.700 --> 01:53:31.700]   Is it the lone geniuses, or is it some kind of weird
[01:53:31.700 --> 01:53:33.820]   network of ideas swimming in the air,
[01:53:33.820 --> 01:53:37.740]   and just kind of the geniuses pop up to catch them,
[01:53:37.740 --> 01:53:39.220]   and others would anyway?
[01:53:39.220 --> 01:53:42.540]   Without Einstein, would we have special relativity,
[01:53:42.540 --> 01:53:43.700]   general relativity?
[01:53:43.700 --> 01:53:47.220]   - I mean, it's an interesting, on a case-to-case basis,
[01:53:47.220 --> 01:53:51.820]   I mean, special relativity, I think we would have had,
[01:53:51.820 --> 01:53:54.820]   I mean, there are other people, anyway,
[01:53:54.820 --> 01:53:56.700]   you could even argue that it was already there
[01:53:56.700 --> 01:53:59.420]   in some form, in some ways, but I think special relativity
[01:53:59.420 --> 01:54:03.300]   you would have had without Einstein fairly quickly.
[01:54:03.300 --> 01:54:07.180]   General relativity, that was a much, much harder thing
[01:54:07.180 --> 01:54:10.900]   to do, and required much more effort,
[01:54:10.900 --> 01:54:11.740]   and much more sophisticated.
[01:54:11.740 --> 01:54:13.960]   That, I think you would have had sooner or later,
[01:54:13.960 --> 01:54:16.820]   but it would have taken quite a bit longer.
[01:54:16.820 --> 01:54:17.940]   - Other thing-- - That took a bunch
[01:54:17.940 --> 01:54:21.700]   of years to validate scientifically, the general relativity.
[01:54:21.700 --> 01:54:24.540]   - But even for Einstein, from the point where he had
[01:54:24.540 --> 01:54:26.820]   kind of a general idea of what he was trying to do,
[01:54:26.820 --> 01:54:29.900]   to the point where he actually had a well-defined theory
[01:54:29.900 --> 01:54:31.820]   that you could actually compare to the real world,
[01:54:31.820 --> 01:54:35.340]   that was, I forget the number, but the order of magnitude,
[01:54:35.340 --> 01:54:39.180]   10 years of very serious work, and if he hadn't been around
[01:54:39.180 --> 01:54:40.580]   to do that, it would have taken a while
[01:54:40.580 --> 01:54:43.060]   before anyone else got around to it.
[01:54:43.060 --> 01:54:45.020]   On the other hand, there are things like,
[01:54:45.020 --> 01:54:48.820]   with quantum mechanics, you have Heisenberg
[01:54:48.820 --> 01:54:52.560]   and Schrodinger came up with two,
[01:54:52.560 --> 01:54:57.240]   which ultimately equivalent, but two different approaches
[01:54:57.240 --> 01:54:59.620]   to it within months of each other.
[01:54:59.620 --> 01:55:02.380]   And so if Heisenberg hadn't been there,
[01:55:02.380 --> 01:55:03.980]   you already would have had Schrodinger or whatever,
[01:55:03.980 --> 01:55:05.180]   and if neither of them had been there,
[01:55:05.180 --> 01:55:07.580]   it would have been somebody else a few months later.
[01:55:07.580 --> 01:55:12.420]   So there are times when the, just the,
[01:55:12.420 --> 01:55:16.520]   a lot often is the combination of the right ideas
[01:55:16.520 --> 01:55:19.580]   are in place and the right experimental data is in place
[01:55:19.580 --> 01:55:20.740]   to point in the right direction,
[01:55:20.740 --> 01:55:24.100]   and it's just waiting for somebody who's gonna find it.
[01:55:24.100 --> 01:55:28.340]   Maybe to go back to your aliens,
[01:55:28.340 --> 01:55:30.740]   I guess the one thing I often wonder about aliens is,
[01:55:30.740 --> 01:55:33.620]   would they have the same fundamental physics ideas
[01:55:33.620 --> 01:55:35.580]   as we have in mathematics?
[01:55:35.580 --> 01:55:37.500]   Would their math, would they,
[01:55:37.500 --> 01:55:42.100]   how much is this really intrinsic to our minds?
[01:55:42.100 --> 01:55:43.780]   If you start out with a different kind of mind,
[01:55:43.780 --> 01:55:46.140]   wouldn't you end up with a different ideas
[01:55:46.140 --> 01:55:47.340]   of what fundamental physics is
[01:55:47.340 --> 01:55:49.860]   or what the structure of mathematics is?
[01:55:49.860 --> 01:55:52.400]   - So this is why, if I was,
[01:55:52.400 --> 01:55:55.260]   I like video games.
[01:55:55.260 --> 01:55:57.740]   The way I would do it as a curious being,
[01:55:57.740 --> 01:56:00.380]   so first experiment I'd like to do is run Earth
[01:56:00.380 --> 01:56:04.440]   over many thousands of times and see if our particular,
[01:56:04.440 --> 01:56:06.700]   no, you know what?
[01:56:06.700 --> 01:56:08.140]   I wouldn't do the full evolution.
[01:56:08.140 --> 01:56:10.180]   I would start at Homo sapiens first
[01:56:10.260 --> 01:56:13.860]   and then see the evolution of Homo sapiens millions of times
[01:56:13.860 --> 01:56:16.540]   and see how the ideas of science would evolve.
[01:56:16.540 --> 01:56:19.740]   Like, would you get, like how would physics evolve?
[01:56:19.740 --> 01:56:21.380]   How would math evolve?
[01:56:21.380 --> 01:56:22.740]   I would particularly just be curious
[01:56:22.740 --> 01:56:24.800]   about the notation they come up with.
[01:56:24.800 --> 01:56:28.820]   Every once in a while, I would like throw miracles at them
[01:56:28.820 --> 01:56:31.220]   to mess with them and stuff.
[01:56:31.220 --> 01:56:33.300]   And then I would also like to run Earth
[01:56:33.300 --> 01:56:35.500]   from the very beginning to see if evolution
[01:56:35.500 --> 01:56:37.260]   will produce different kinds of brains
[01:56:37.260 --> 01:56:38.840]   that would then produce different kinds
[01:56:38.840 --> 01:56:40.180]   of mathematics and physics.
[01:56:40.180 --> 01:56:43.500]   And then finally, I would probably millions of times
[01:56:43.500 --> 01:56:47.000]   run the universe over to see what kind of,
[01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:52.300]   what kind of environments and what kind of life
[01:56:52.300 --> 01:56:55.420]   would be created to then lead to intelligent life,
[01:56:55.420 --> 01:56:59.140]   to then lead to theories of mathematics and physics
[01:56:59.140 --> 01:57:00.880]   and to see the full range.
[01:57:00.880 --> 01:57:04.080]   And like sort of like Darwin kind of mark,
[01:57:04.080 --> 01:57:08.080]   okay, it took them, what is it?
[01:57:08.900 --> 01:57:13.900]   Several hundred million years to come up with calculus.
[01:57:13.900 --> 01:57:16.060]   I would just like keep noting how long it took
[01:57:16.060 --> 01:57:19.060]   and get an average and see which ideas are difficult,
[01:57:19.060 --> 01:57:23.460]   which are not, and then conclusively sort of figure out
[01:57:23.460 --> 01:57:27.380]   if it's more collective intelligence
[01:57:27.380 --> 01:57:30.220]   or singular intelligence that's responsible for shifts
[01:57:30.220 --> 01:57:33.860]   and for big phase shifts and breakthroughs in science.
[01:57:33.860 --> 01:57:36.340]   If I was playing a video game and ran the thing,
[01:57:36.340 --> 01:57:38.280]   I got a chance to run this whole thing.
[01:57:38.280 --> 01:57:40.160]   - Yeah, but--
[01:57:40.160 --> 01:57:42.520]   - We're talking about books before I distract us.
[01:57:42.520 --> 01:57:44.440]   - Books, okay, so books, yeah, go back, books.
[01:57:44.440 --> 01:57:47.200]   Yeah, so, and then, yeah, so that's one thing I'd recommend
[01:57:47.200 --> 01:57:50.700]   is the books about the, from the original people,
[01:57:50.700 --> 01:57:53.680]   especially Heisenberg about the, how that happened.
[01:57:53.680 --> 01:57:55.760]   And there's also a very, very good kind of history
[01:57:55.760 --> 01:58:00.520]   of the kind of what happened during this 20th century
[01:58:00.520 --> 01:58:05.320]   in physics and up to the time of the Standard Model in 1973,
[01:58:05.320 --> 01:58:10.320]   it's called "The Second Creation" by Bob Crease and Mann.
[01:58:10.320 --> 01:58:12.900]   That's one of the best ones, I know that's,
[01:58:12.900 --> 01:58:14.760]   but the one thing that I can say is that,
[01:58:14.760 --> 01:58:17.060]   so that book, I think, forget when it was,
[01:58:17.060 --> 01:58:21.840]   late '80s, '90s, the problem is that there just hasn't been
[01:58:21.840 --> 01:58:24.060]   much that's actually worked out since then.
[01:58:24.060 --> 01:58:26.680]   So most of the books that are kind of trying to tell you
[01:58:26.680 --> 01:58:30.300]   about all the glorious things that have happened since 1973
[01:58:30.300 --> 01:58:33.720]   are, they're mostly telling you about how glorious things
[01:58:33.720 --> 01:58:35.260]   are, which actually don't really work.
[01:58:35.260 --> 01:58:38.600]   And it's really, the argument people sometimes make
[01:58:38.600 --> 01:58:40.640]   in favor of these books as well, oh, you know,
[01:58:40.640 --> 01:58:42.440]   they're really great because you want to do something
[01:58:42.440 --> 01:58:43.780]   that will get kids excited.
[01:58:43.780 --> 01:58:45.360]   And then, you know, so they're getting excited
[01:58:45.360 --> 01:58:47.680]   about things, something that's not really quite working.
[01:58:47.680 --> 01:58:48.720]   It's, doesn't really matter.
[01:58:48.720 --> 01:58:50.720]   The main thing is get them excited.
[01:58:50.720 --> 01:58:53.600]   The other argument is, you know, wait a minute,
[01:58:53.600 --> 01:58:56.720]   if you're getting people excited about ideas that are wrong,
[01:58:56.720 --> 01:58:59.000]   you're really kind of, you're actually kind of discrediting
[01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:02.200]   the whole scientific enterprise in a not really good way.
[01:59:02.200 --> 01:59:04.640]   So there's, there's problems.
[01:59:04.640 --> 01:59:07.920]   So my general feeling about expository stuff is, yeah,
[01:59:07.920 --> 01:59:10.680]   it's to the extent you can do it kind of honestly
[01:59:10.680 --> 01:59:12.760]   and well, that's great.
[01:59:12.760 --> 01:59:14.720]   There are a lot of people doing that now,
[01:59:14.720 --> 01:59:19.040]   but to the extent that you're just trying to get people
[01:59:19.040 --> 01:59:22.920]   excited and enthusiastic by kind of telling them stuff,
[01:59:22.920 --> 01:59:24.400]   which isn't really true, this is,
[01:59:24.400 --> 01:59:26.520]   you really shouldn't be doing that.
[01:59:26.520 --> 01:59:28.920]   - You obviously have a much better intuition about physics.
[01:59:28.920 --> 01:59:32.640]   I tend to, in the space of AI, for example,
[01:59:32.640 --> 01:59:37.600]   you could use certain kinds of language,
[01:59:37.600 --> 01:59:41.280]   like calling things intelligent,
[01:59:41.280 --> 01:59:43.320]   that could rub people the wrong way.
[01:59:43.320 --> 01:59:45.680]   But I never had a problem with that kind of thing.
[01:59:45.680 --> 01:59:48.320]   You know, saying that a program can learn its way
[01:59:48.320 --> 01:59:52.160]   without any human supervision as AlphaZero does
[01:59:52.160 --> 01:59:53.680]   to play chess.
[01:59:53.680 --> 01:59:57.800]   To me, that may not be intelligence,
[01:59:57.800 --> 02:00:02.760]   but it sure as heck seems like a few steps down the path
[02:00:02.760 --> 02:00:04.480]   towards intelligence.
[02:00:04.480 --> 02:00:09.080]   And so like, I think that's a very peculiar property
[02:00:09.080 --> 02:00:10.840]   of systems that can be engineered.
[02:00:10.840 --> 02:00:12.480]   So even if the idea is fuzzy,
[02:00:12.480 --> 02:00:15.160]   even if you're not really sure what intelligence is,
[02:00:15.160 --> 02:00:19.500]   or like if you don't have a deep fundamental understanding
[02:00:19.500 --> 02:00:21.600]   or even a model of what intelligence is,
[02:00:21.600 --> 02:00:24.520]   if you build a system that sure as heck is impressive
[02:00:24.520 --> 02:00:26.760]   and showing some of the signs
[02:00:26.760 --> 02:00:29.720]   of what previously thought impossible
[02:00:29.720 --> 02:00:32.960]   for a non-intelligent system,
[02:00:32.960 --> 02:00:34.880]   then that's impressive and that's inspiring
[02:00:34.880 --> 02:00:36.680]   and that's okay to celebrate.
[02:00:36.680 --> 02:00:39.880]   In physics, because you're not engineering anything,
[02:00:39.880 --> 02:00:41.800]   you're just now swimming in the space,
[02:00:41.800 --> 02:00:43.960]   directly when you do theoretical physics,
[02:00:43.960 --> 02:00:45.440]   that it could be more dangerous.
[02:00:45.440 --> 02:00:48.720]   You could be out too far away from shore.
[02:00:48.720 --> 02:00:52.840]   - Yeah, well the problem, I think physics is,
[02:00:52.840 --> 02:00:54.400]   I think it's actually hard for people,
[02:00:54.400 --> 02:00:57.080]   even to believe or really understand
[02:00:57.080 --> 02:01:00.560]   how that this particular kind of physics
[02:01:00.560 --> 02:01:03.640]   has gotten itself into a really unusual and strange
[02:01:03.640 --> 02:01:06.680]   and historically unusual state, which is not really,
[02:01:06.680 --> 02:01:09.480]   I mean, I spent half my life among mathematicians
[02:01:09.480 --> 02:01:10.640]   and half among physicists,
[02:01:10.640 --> 02:01:12.880]   and you know, mathematics is kind of doing fine.
[02:01:12.880 --> 02:01:14.160]   People are making progress
[02:01:14.160 --> 02:01:16.120]   and it has all the usual problems,
[02:01:16.120 --> 02:01:19.360]   but also so you could have a,
[02:01:19.360 --> 02:01:21.080]   but I just, I don't know,
[02:01:21.080 --> 02:01:23.800]   I've never seen anything at all happening in mathematics
[02:01:23.800 --> 02:01:26.360]   like what's happened in this specific area in physics.
[02:01:26.360 --> 02:01:29.840]   It's just the kind of sociology of this,
[02:01:29.840 --> 02:01:32.920]   the way this field works,
[02:01:32.920 --> 02:01:35.360]   banging up against this hard a problem
[02:01:35.360 --> 02:01:38.560]   without anything from experiment to help it.
[02:01:38.560 --> 02:01:41.640]   It's really, it's led to some really
[02:01:41.640 --> 02:01:43.320]   kind of problematic things.
[02:01:43.320 --> 02:01:47.080]   And those, so it's one thing to kind of, you know,
[02:01:47.080 --> 02:01:49.720]   oversimplify or to slightly misrepresent,
[02:01:49.720 --> 02:01:52.400]   to try to explain things in a way that's not quite right.
[02:01:52.400 --> 02:01:55.800]   But it's another thing to start promoting to people
[02:01:55.800 --> 02:02:00.280]   as a success as ideas, which really completely failed.
[02:02:00.280 --> 02:02:03.600]   And so, I mean, I've kind of a very, very specific,
[02:02:03.600 --> 02:02:05.160]   if you start to have people,
[02:02:05.160 --> 02:02:07.880]   won't name any names, for instance,
[02:02:07.880 --> 02:02:09.480]   coming on certain podcasts like yours,
[02:02:09.480 --> 02:02:12.560]   telling the world, you know, this is a huge success
[02:02:12.560 --> 02:02:16.520]   and this is really wonderful, and it's just not true.
[02:02:16.520 --> 02:02:19.640]   And this is really problematic
[02:02:19.640 --> 02:02:22.920]   and it carries a serious danger of, you know,
[02:02:22.920 --> 02:02:27.040]   once when people realize that this is what's going on,
[02:02:27.040 --> 02:02:32.040]   you know, the loss of credibility of science
[02:02:32.040 --> 02:02:34.760]   is a real, real problem for our society.
[02:02:34.760 --> 02:02:39.760]   And you don't want people to have an all too good reason
[02:02:39.760 --> 02:02:44.440]   to think that what they're being told
[02:02:44.440 --> 02:02:46.880]   by kind of some of the best institutions
[02:02:46.880 --> 02:02:49.160]   in our country and our authorities is not true.
[02:02:49.160 --> 02:02:52.320]   It's a problem.
[02:02:52.320 --> 02:02:55.880]   - That's obviously a characteristic of not just physics,
[02:02:55.880 --> 02:02:58.960]   it's sociology.
[02:02:58.960 --> 02:03:02.960]   And it's, I mean, obviously in the space of politics,
[02:03:02.960 --> 02:03:07.960]   it's the history of politics is you sell ideas to people
[02:03:07.960 --> 02:03:14.080]   even when you don't have any proof
[02:03:14.080 --> 02:03:15.600]   that those ideas actually work.
[02:03:15.600 --> 02:03:17.760]   You speak as if they've worked
[02:03:17.760 --> 02:03:20.560]   and that that seems to be the case throughout history.
[02:03:20.560 --> 02:03:26.080]   And just like you said, it's human beings
[02:03:26.080 --> 02:03:28.520]   running up against a really hard problem.
[02:03:28.520 --> 02:03:34.440]   I'm not sure if this is like a particular, like,
[02:03:34.440 --> 02:03:37.040]   trajectory through the progress of physics
[02:03:37.040 --> 02:03:38.400]   that we're dealing with now
[02:03:38.400 --> 02:03:40.240]   or is this just a natural progress of science?
[02:03:40.240 --> 02:03:44.800]   You run up against a really difficult stage of a field
[02:03:44.800 --> 02:03:49.800]   and different people behave differently
[02:03:49.800 --> 02:03:53.080]   in the face of that.
[02:03:53.080 --> 02:03:56.160]   Some sell books and sort of tell narratives
[02:03:56.160 --> 02:03:57.840]   that are beautiful and so on.
[02:03:57.840 --> 02:04:01.000]   They're not necessarily grounded in solutions
[02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:02.720]   that have proven themselves.
[02:04:02.720 --> 02:04:05.480]   Others kind of put their head down quietly,
[02:04:05.480 --> 02:04:06.320]   keep doing the work.
[02:04:06.320 --> 02:04:08.200]   Others sort of pivot to different fields.
[02:04:08.200 --> 02:04:11.600]   And that's kind of like, yeah, ants scattering.
[02:04:11.600 --> 02:04:14.520]   And then you have fields like machine learning,
[02:04:14.520 --> 02:04:17.080]   which there's a few folks mostly scattered away
[02:04:17.080 --> 02:04:19.560]   from machine learning in the '90s
[02:04:19.560 --> 02:04:23.000]   in the winter of AI, AI winter, as they call it.
[02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:24.760]   But a few people kept their head down
[02:04:24.760 --> 02:04:27.320]   and now they're called the fathers of deep learning.
[02:04:27.320 --> 02:04:28.160]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:04:28.160 --> 02:04:30.240]   - And they didn't think of it that way.
[02:04:30.240 --> 02:04:33.320]   And in fact, if there's another AI winter,
[02:04:33.320 --> 02:04:35.560]   they'll just probably keep working on it anyway,
[02:04:35.560 --> 02:04:39.280]   sort of like loyal ants to a particular--
[02:04:39.280 --> 02:04:40.400]   - Sure, yeah, yeah.
[02:04:40.400 --> 02:04:43.120]   - So it's interesting, but you're sort of saying
[02:04:43.120 --> 02:04:46.640]   that we should be careful over hyping things
[02:04:46.640 --> 02:04:48.360]   that have not proven themselves
[02:04:48.360 --> 02:04:53.360]   because people will lose trust in the scientific process.
[02:04:53.360 --> 02:04:57.800]   But unfortunately, there's been other ways
[02:04:57.800 --> 02:05:00.760]   in which people have lost trust in the scientific process.
[02:05:00.760 --> 02:05:02.200]   That ultimately has to do actually
[02:05:02.200 --> 02:05:05.100]   with all the same kind of behaviors you're highlighting,
[02:05:05.100 --> 02:05:08.360]   which is not being honest and transparent
[02:05:08.360 --> 02:05:11.600]   about the flaws of mistakes of the past.
[02:05:11.600 --> 02:05:13.120]   - Yeah, I mean, that's always a problem.
[02:05:13.120 --> 02:05:15.720]   But this particular field is kind of fun.
[02:05:15.720 --> 02:05:18.840]   It's always a strange one.
[02:05:18.840 --> 02:05:20.520]   I mean, I think in the sense that
[02:05:20.520 --> 02:05:23.280]   there's a lot of public fascination with it
[02:05:23.280 --> 02:05:25.840]   that it seems to speak to kind of our deepest questions
[02:05:25.840 --> 02:05:28.520]   about what is this physical reality,
[02:05:28.520 --> 02:05:31.320]   where do we come from, and these kind of deep issues.
[02:05:31.320 --> 02:05:33.960]   So there's this unusual fascination with it.
[02:05:33.960 --> 02:05:35.880]   Mathematics, for instance, is very different.
[02:05:35.880 --> 02:05:37.560]   Nobody's that interested in mathematics.
[02:05:37.560 --> 02:05:41.560]   Nobody really kind of expects to learn really great,
[02:05:41.560 --> 02:05:43.600]   deep things about the world from mathematics that much.
[02:05:43.600 --> 02:05:45.400]   They don't ask mathematicians that.
[02:05:45.400 --> 02:05:47.720]   So it's a very unusual,
[02:05:47.720 --> 02:05:51.160]   it draws this kind of unusual amount of attention.
[02:05:51.160 --> 02:05:54.920]   And it really is historically in a really unusual state.
[02:05:54.920 --> 02:05:58.680]   It's kind of, it's gotten itself way kind of down
[02:05:58.680 --> 02:06:03.640]   a blind alley in a way which,
[02:06:03.640 --> 02:06:06.560]   it's hard to find other historical parallels to.
[02:06:06.560 --> 02:06:08.480]   - But sort of to push back a little bit,
[02:06:08.480 --> 02:06:10.720]   there's power to inspiring people.
[02:06:10.720 --> 02:06:13.240]   And if I just empirically look,
[02:06:13.240 --> 02:06:18.000]   physicists are really good
[02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:23.000]   at combining science and philosophy and communicating it.
[02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:26.240]   Like there's something about physics often
[02:06:26.240 --> 02:06:28.960]   that forces you to build a strong intuition
[02:06:28.960 --> 02:06:31.320]   about the way reality works, right?
[02:06:31.320 --> 02:06:33.920]   And that allows you to think through
[02:06:33.920 --> 02:06:37.360]   sort of and communicate about all kinds of questions.
[02:06:37.360 --> 02:06:40.000]   Like if you see physicists, it's always fascinating
[02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.080]   to take on problems that have nothing to do
[02:06:42.080 --> 02:06:43.520]   with their particular discipline.
[02:06:43.520 --> 02:06:45.960]   They think in interesting ways
[02:06:45.960 --> 02:06:47.680]   and are able to communicate their thinking
[02:06:47.680 --> 02:06:48.680]   in interesting ways.
[02:06:48.680 --> 02:06:52.200]   And so in some sense, they have a responsibility
[02:06:52.200 --> 02:06:54.800]   not just to do science, but to inspire.
[02:06:54.800 --> 02:06:58.080]   And not responsibility, but the opportunity.
[02:06:58.080 --> 02:07:02.680]   And thereby I would say a little bit of a responsibility.
[02:07:02.680 --> 02:07:05.000]   - Yeah, yeah, and sometimes, but I don't know.
[02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.920]   Anyway, it's hard to say 'cause different,
[02:07:07.920 --> 02:07:10.680]   there's many, many people doing this kind of thing
[02:07:10.680 --> 02:07:15.600]   with different degrees of success and whatever.
[02:07:15.600 --> 02:07:16.520]   I guess one thing,
[02:07:16.520 --> 02:07:21.200]   but I mean, what's kind of front and center for me
[02:07:21.200 --> 02:07:22.920]   is kind of a more parochial interest,
[02:07:22.920 --> 02:07:27.920]   is just kind of what damage do you do to the subject itself?
[02:07:27.920 --> 02:07:32.360]   Ignoring, misrepresenting,
[02:07:32.360 --> 02:07:34.320]   what high school students think about string theory
[02:07:34.320 --> 02:07:36.560]   and not that it doesn't matter much,
[02:07:36.560 --> 02:07:40.280]   but what the smartest undergraduates
[02:07:40.280 --> 02:07:42.160]   or the smartest graduate students in the world
[02:07:42.160 --> 02:07:45.200]   think about it and what paths you're leading them down
[02:07:45.200 --> 02:07:47.120]   and what story you're telling them
[02:07:47.120 --> 02:07:49.680]   and what textbooks you're making them read
[02:07:49.680 --> 02:07:50.880]   and what they're hearing.
[02:07:50.880 --> 02:07:53.080]   And so a lot of what's motivated me
[02:07:53.080 --> 02:07:57.440]   is more to try to speak to kind of a specific population
[02:07:57.440 --> 02:08:00.140]   of people to make sure that, look, people,
[02:08:01.720 --> 02:08:04.160]   it doesn't matter so much what the rest,
[02:08:04.160 --> 02:08:06.040]   what the average person on the street
[02:08:06.040 --> 02:08:07.040]   thinks about string theory,
[02:08:07.040 --> 02:08:12.040]   but what the best students at Columbia or Harvard
[02:08:12.040 --> 02:08:14.960]   or Princeton or whatever who really wanna change,
[02:08:14.960 --> 02:08:16.720]   work in this field and wanna work that way,
[02:08:16.720 --> 02:08:19.400]   what they know about it, what they think about it,
[02:08:19.400 --> 02:08:22.120]   and that they not be going to the field being misled
[02:08:22.120 --> 02:08:23.880]   and believing that a certain story,
[02:08:23.880 --> 02:08:27.160]   this is where this is all going, this is what I gotta do,
[02:08:27.160 --> 02:08:29.120]   is what's important to me.
[02:08:29.120 --> 02:08:31.480]   - Well, in general, for graduate students,
[02:08:31.480 --> 02:08:34.280]   for people who seek to be experts in the field,
[02:08:34.280 --> 02:08:36.560]   diversity of ideas is really powerful.
[02:08:36.560 --> 02:08:40.760]   And is getting into this local pocket of ideas
[02:08:40.760 --> 02:08:43.920]   that people hold onto for several decades is not good,
[02:08:43.920 --> 02:08:44.940]   no matter what the idea.
[02:08:44.940 --> 02:08:47.920]   I would say no matter if the idea is right or wrong,
[02:08:47.920 --> 02:08:51.600]   because there's no such thing as right in the long-term.
[02:08:51.600 --> 02:08:56.440]   Like it's right for now until somebody builds on
[02:08:56.440 --> 02:08:58.160]   something much bigger on top of it.
[02:08:58.160 --> 02:09:00.120]   It might end up being right,
[02:09:00.120 --> 02:09:03.600]   but being a tiny subset of a much bigger thing.
[02:09:03.600 --> 02:09:07.520]   So you always should question sort of the ways of the past.
[02:09:07.520 --> 02:09:08.440]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:09:08.440 --> 02:09:12.760]   So how to kind of achieve that kind of diversity of thought
[02:09:12.760 --> 02:09:15.120]   and within kind of the sociology
[02:09:15.120 --> 02:09:17.720]   of how we organize scientific research is,
[02:09:17.720 --> 02:09:19.560]   I know this is one thing that I think it's very interesting
[02:09:19.560 --> 02:09:22.760]   that Sabina Hassenfelder has very interesting things
[02:09:22.760 --> 02:09:23.600]   to say about it.
[02:09:23.600 --> 02:09:25.600]   And I think also at least Smolin in his book,
[02:09:25.600 --> 02:09:27.040]   which is also about that,
[02:09:27.040 --> 02:09:30.800]   very much in agreement with them that there's,
[02:09:30.800 --> 02:09:36.800]   anyway, there's a really kind of important questions
[02:09:36.800 --> 02:09:41.480]   about how research in this field is organized
[02:09:41.480 --> 02:09:45.240]   and how people, what can you do to kind of get
[02:09:45.240 --> 02:09:47.200]   and get more diversity of thought and get more,
[02:09:47.200 --> 02:09:51.200]   and get people thinking about a wider range of ideas.
[02:09:53.160 --> 02:09:56.040]   At the bottom, I think humility always helps.
[02:09:56.040 --> 02:09:57.280]   (Lex laughing)
[02:09:57.280 --> 02:09:59.880]   - Well, the problem is that it's also,
[02:09:59.880 --> 02:10:02.760]   it's a combination of humility to know when you're wrong
[02:10:02.760 --> 02:10:05.600]   and also, but also you have to have a,
[02:10:05.600 --> 02:10:08.160]   you have to have a certain, very serious lack of humility
[02:10:08.160 --> 02:10:09.680]   to believe that you're gonna make progress
[02:10:09.680 --> 02:10:11.160]   on some of these problems.
[02:10:11.160 --> 02:10:13.240]   - I think you have to have like both modes
[02:10:13.240 --> 02:10:15.600]   and switch between them when needed.
[02:10:15.600 --> 02:10:19.440]   Let me ask you a question
[02:10:19.440 --> 02:10:21.240]   you're probably not gonna wanna answer
[02:10:21.240 --> 02:10:25.480]   because you're focused on the mathematics of things
[02:10:25.480 --> 02:10:27.720]   and mathematics can't answer the why questions,
[02:10:27.720 --> 02:10:30.640]   but let me ask you anyway,
[02:10:30.640 --> 02:10:33.400]   do you think there's meaning to this whole thing?
[02:10:33.400 --> 02:10:35.000]   What do you think is the meaning of life?
[02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:36.880]   Why are we here?
[02:10:36.880 --> 02:10:37.720]   - I don't know.
[02:10:37.720 --> 02:10:39.600]   Yeah, I was thinking about this.
[02:10:39.600 --> 02:10:42.280]   So the, it did occur to me,
[02:10:42.280 --> 02:10:45.640]   one interesting thing about that question
[02:10:45.640 --> 02:10:47.200]   is that you don't,
[02:10:47.200 --> 02:10:51.040]   yes, I have this life in mathematics
[02:10:51.040 --> 02:10:52.040]   and this life in physics
[02:10:52.040 --> 02:10:55.880]   and I see some of my physicist colleagues,
[02:10:55.880 --> 02:10:58.640]   kind of seem to be,
[02:10:58.640 --> 02:10:59.760]   people are often asking them,
[02:10:59.760 --> 02:11:00.600]   what's the meaning of life?
[02:11:00.600 --> 02:11:02.280]   And they're writing books about the meaning of life
[02:11:02.280 --> 02:11:04.600]   and teaching courses about the meaning of life.
[02:11:04.600 --> 02:11:06.480]   But then I realized that no one ever asked
[02:11:06.480 --> 02:11:07.920]   my mathematician colleagues.
[02:11:07.920 --> 02:11:08.960]   (both laughing)
[02:11:08.960 --> 02:11:10.640]   Nobody ever asked mathematicians.
[02:11:10.640 --> 02:11:11.480]   - Yeah, that's funny.
[02:11:11.480 --> 02:11:13.760]   - So I, yeah.
[02:11:13.760 --> 02:11:15.040]   Everybody just kind of assumes,
[02:11:15.040 --> 02:11:16.640]   okay, well, you people are studying mathematics.
[02:11:16.640 --> 02:11:19.360]   Whatever you're doing, it's maybe very interesting,
[02:11:19.360 --> 02:11:21.160]   but it's clearly not gonna tell you anything useful
[02:11:21.160 --> 02:11:22.480]   about the meaning of my life.
[02:11:22.480 --> 02:11:24.840]   And I'm afraid a lot of my point of view
[02:11:24.840 --> 02:11:28.160]   is that if people realized how little difference there was
[02:11:28.160 --> 02:11:29.680]   between what the mathematicians are doing
[02:11:29.680 --> 02:11:31.480]   and what a lot of these theoretical physicists are doing,
[02:11:31.480 --> 02:11:34.120]   they would, they might understand that
[02:11:34.120 --> 02:11:38.160]   it's a bit misguided to look for deep insight
[02:11:38.160 --> 02:11:42.520]   into the meaning of life from many theoretical physicists.
[02:11:42.520 --> 02:11:44.320]   It's not a, they, you know,
[02:11:44.320 --> 02:11:46.520]   there are people and they may have interesting things
[02:11:46.520 --> 02:11:47.360]   to say about this.
[02:11:47.360 --> 02:11:48.200]   You're right.
[02:11:48.200 --> 02:11:50.160]   They know a lot about physical reality
[02:11:50.160 --> 02:11:53.920]   and about, in some sense, about metaphysics,
[02:11:53.920 --> 02:11:56.760]   about what is real of this kind.
[02:11:56.760 --> 02:12:01.760]   But you're also, to my mind,
[02:12:01.760 --> 02:12:03.760]   I think you're also making a bit of a mistake
[02:12:03.760 --> 02:12:07.920]   that you're looking to, I mean, I'm very, very aware
[02:12:07.920 --> 02:12:10.600]   that I've led a very pleasant
[02:12:10.600 --> 02:12:12.000]   and fairly privileged existence
[02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:15.240]   and were fairly without many challenges of different kinds
[02:12:15.240 --> 02:12:16.680]   and of a certain kind.
[02:12:16.680 --> 02:12:21.440]   And I'm really not, in no way, the kind of person
[02:12:21.440 --> 02:12:24.200]   that a lot of people who are looking for,
[02:12:24.200 --> 02:12:27.400]   to try to understand, in some sense, the meaning of life
[02:12:27.400 --> 02:12:30.280]   in the sense of the challenges that they're facing in life.
[02:12:30.280 --> 02:12:32.640]   I can't really, I'm really the wrong person
[02:12:32.640 --> 02:12:33.960]   for you to be asking about this.
[02:12:33.960 --> 02:12:37.860]   - Well, if struggle is somehow a thing
[02:12:37.860 --> 02:12:39.640]   that's core to meaning,
[02:12:39.640 --> 02:12:42.440]   perhaps mathematicians are just quietly the ones
[02:12:42.440 --> 02:12:45.100]   who are most equipped to answer that question
[02:12:45.100 --> 02:12:50.040]   if, in fact, the creation, or at least experiencing beauty,
[02:12:50.040 --> 02:12:55.800]   is at the core of the meaning of life.
[02:12:55.800 --> 02:12:59.360]   Because it seems like mathematics is the methodology
[02:12:59.360 --> 02:13:04.040]   by which you can most purely explore beautiful things, right?
[02:13:04.040 --> 02:13:05.240]   - Yeah, mm-hmm.
[02:13:05.240 --> 02:13:06.200]   - So in some sense,
[02:13:06.200 --> 02:13:08.880]   maybe we should talk to mathematicians more.
[02:13:08.880 --> 02:13:10.560]   - Yeah, yeah, maybe.
[02:13:10.560 --> 02:13:13.440]   But unfortunately, I think people do have
[02:13:13.440 --> 02:13:14.860]   a somewhat correct perception
[02:13:14.860 --> 02:13:17.040]   that what these people are doing every day,
[02:13:17.040 --> 02:13:19.680]   or whatever, is pretty far removed from anything.
[02:13:19.680 --> 02:13:26.080]   Yeah, from what's kind of close to what I do every day
[02:13:26.080 --> 02:13:28.000]   and what my typical concerns are.
[02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:29.720]   So you may learn something very interesting
[02:13:29.720 --> 02:13:31.020]   by talking to mathematicians,
[02:13:31.020 --> 02:13:33.840]   but it's probably not gonna be,
[02:13:33.840 --> 02:13:37.080]   you're probably not gonna get what you were hoping.
[02:13:37.080 --> 02:13:39.520]   - So when you put the pen and paper down,
[02:13:39.520 --> 02:13:41.440]   and you're not thinking about physics,
[02:13:41.440 --> 02:13:43.320]   and you're not thinking about mathematics,
[02:13:43.320 --> 02:13:45.480]   and you just get to breathe in the air,
[02:13:45.480 --> 02:13:46.840]   and look around you,
[02:13:46.840 --> 02:13:49.240]   and realize that you're going to die one day.
[02:13:49.240 --> 02:13:51.440]   - Yeah, mm-hmm. - Do you think about that?
[02:13:51.440 --> 02:13:56.960]   Your ideas will live on, but you, the human.
[02:13:56.960 --> 02:13:58.320]   - Not especially much,
[02:13:58.320 --> 02:14:00.160]   but certainly I've been getting older.
[02:14:00.160 --> 02:14:01.900]   I'm now 64 years old.
[02:14:01.900 --> 02:14:02.740]   You start to realize, well,
[02:14:02.740 --> 02:14:05.680]   there's probably less ahead than there was behind.
[02:14:05.680 --> 02:14:09.480]   And so you start to, that starts to become,
[02:14:09.480 --> 02:14:10.320]   "Wait a minute, what do I think about that?
[02:14:10.440 --> 02:14:13.400]   Maybe I should actually get serious
[02:14:13.400 --> 02:14:14.720]   about getting some things done,
[02:14:14.720 --> 02:14:17.000]   which I may not have,
[02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:18.720]   which I may otherwise not have time to do,
[02:14:18.720 --> 02:14:20.320]   which I didn't see,
[02:14:20.320 --> 02:14:22.200]   and this didn't seem to be a problem when I was younger."
[02:14:22.200 --> 02:14:24.080]   But that's the main,
[02:14:24.080 --> 02:14:26.840]   I think the main way in which that thought occurred.
[02:14:26.840 --> 02:14:28.640]   - But it doesn't, you know,
[02:14:28.640 --> 02:14:32.080]   the Stoics are big on this, meditating on mortality.
[02:14:32.080 --> 02:14:36.560]   Helps you more intensely appreciate the beauty
[02:14:36.560 --> 02:14:38.020]   when you do experience it.
[02:14:39.720 --> 02:14:41.600]   - I suppose that's true, but it's not, yeah,
[02:14:41.600 --> 02:14:45.920]   it's not something I spend a lot of time trying,
[02:14:45.920 --> 02:14:47.200]   but yeah.
[02:14:47.200 --> 02:14:49.840]   - Day to day, you just enjoy the puzzles, the mathematics.
[02:14:49.840 --> 02:14:52.480]   - Just enjoy, yeah, or life in general.
[02:14:52.480 --> 02:14:55.760]   Life is, I have a perfectly pleasant life
[02:14:55.760 --> 02:14:59.080]   and enjoy it and often think,
[02:14:59.080 --> 02:15:01.680]   "Wow, this is, I think things are,
[02:15:01.680 --> 02:15:04.360]   I'm really enjoying this, things are going well."
[02:15:04.360 --> 02:15:06.560]   - Yeah, life is pretty amazing.
[02:15:06.560 --> 02:15:08.200]   I think you and I are pretty lucky.
[02:15:08.200 --> 02:15:10.760]   We get to live on this nice little earth
[02:15:10.760 --> 02:15:13.360]   with a nice little comfortable climate
[02:15:13.360 --> 02:15:17.160]   and we get to have this nice little podcast conversation.
[02:15:17.160 --> 02:15:19.120]   Thank you so much for spending your valuable time
[02:15:19.120 --> 02:15:21.200]   with me today and having this conversation.
[02:15:21.200 --> 02:15:22.040]   Thank you.
[02:15:22.040 --> 02:15:22.880]   - Thank you.
[02:15:22.880 --> 02:15:23.700]   - Thank you.
[02:15:23.700 --> 02:15:26.680]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[02:15:26.680 --> 02:15:27.960]   with Peter White.
[02:15:27.960 --> 02:15:29.240]   To support this podcast,
[02:15:29.240 --> 02:15:32.080]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[02:15:32.080 --> 02:15:34.080]   And now let me leave you with some words
[02:15:34.080 --> 02:15:36.120]   from Richard Feynman.
[02:15:36.120 --> 02:15:40.200]   The first principle is that you must not fool yourself
[02:15:40.200 --> 02:15:43.080]   and you are the easiest person to fool.
[02:15:43.080 --> 02:15:47.160]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
[02:15:47.160 --> 02:15:49.740]   (upbeat music)
[02:15:49.740 --> 02:15:52.320]   (upbeat music)
