[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.760]   Michael in St. Paul, Minnesota asks, "Pastor John, are you aware of the influence your
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.680]   ministry has had and is having on the Christian hip-hop scene?"
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:21.720]   I have seen some of my words show up.
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.720]   I doubt that I could say I'm aware in any kind of formal way of any extent of influence,
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:36.520]   I don't really know, but what I've seen, I saw, for example, in Tadashi's "Make War,"
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.800]   I knew that was my voice I just heard, and yes, that was my phrase, and then I watched
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.560]   what he did with it and I thought, "Whoa, that's pretty powerful."
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:51.840]   I know that Lecrae's "Don't Waste Your Life" video was related to the book "Don't Waste
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.320]   Your Life," and I'm honored by that.
[00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.800]   I've listened to those and many, many others.
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.920]   So here's just a few thoughts, mostly positive and a couple of cautions.
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:13.720]   I just rejoice that so much truth in our day from evangelical guys, I guess it's mainly
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:20.800]   guys, I don't know if I've ever heard a woman do rap, are pouring so much truth into this
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:21.800]   form.
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:29.840]   I just love it when glorious truth gets poured into different cultural forms, because I care
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.540]   about the truth way more than I care about the forms, even though I know we can't be
[00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.520]   indifferent to forms.
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:45.040]   There's something about this form that enables it to be very dense with the Bible.
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.080]   And it has the advantage of being, in large part, narrative.
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.760]   A lot of hip-hop lyrics are stories.
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:58.880]   They move with a narrative, which gives it an advantage of telling a story about someone's
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:05.840]   experience or the movement of the history of redemption.
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:12.360]   Another factor about it that gives it remarkable clout, I think, is that I would call it almost
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.920]   linguistic energy.
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:23.520]   At least all the hip-hop I see or listen to is phenomenally energetic.
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.400]   It's just drivenly energetic.
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:33.280]   And when I think about that, I think, "Well, life is war, and that sounds like the kind
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.880]   of energy that it's going to take to push back the enemy."
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.080]   And I have thought, I'll just stick this in, because I thought of this a little while ago,
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.880]   it may be that one of the limitations is that particular energy.
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:03:00.240]   I would like to challenge hip-hop artists to record a rap lullaby to help their child
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.240]   go to sleep.
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.240]   See what that would sound like.
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.920]   My guess is it's doable.
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.120]   I've just never heard anything like it.
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.240]   So there's my little challenge to throw out there.
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.440]   And you might try one for the funeral as well.
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.000]   Try a rap for the death of your seven-year-old.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.960]   And what would change about the drivenness of it, the loudness of it, the forcefulness
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:33.280]   of it, if you're trying to put your baby to sleep with the truth of Jesus and you're laying
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.040]   your baby in the ground with the truth of Jesus?
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.120]   That's not a criticism.
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.120]   It's just saying, "Is the form adaptable to that?"
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.160]   And if it is, let's do it.
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.120]   And if it's not, we just own that.
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.080]   There are lots of other kinds of music you don't play at a funeral too, besides rap,
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.680]   and you don't use for lullabies.
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:01.360]   It's an interesting kind of test to see what's the nature of the form.
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.240]   I would also say this.
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:11.760]   At its best, there is a poetic effort going on in hip-hop that sometimes is remarkably
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:12.760]   shrewd.
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:13.760]   It's good.
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:14.760]   It's striking.
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:15.760]   It's smart.
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:16.760]   It's awakening.
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:17.760]   It's surprising.
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.280]   And that's the way I think we should do language.
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.080]   We should surprise people with turns of phrase.
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:31.320]   And rap artists, it seems to me, are doing that pretty much all the time at their best.
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.520]   Just a couple of cautions and dangers, and everybody's thought of these.
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:40.680]   There's nothing fresh or new here, but I find the words hard to understand regularly, which
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.520]   is why I don't listen to much of it.
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.360]   I'm 67 years old, and I just can't understand it.
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.440]   I need the words written in front of me in order to know where they're going, because
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.760]   it goes by so fast and so complicated that I usually miss three-fourths of it, and then
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.960]   it's not helping me very much.
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.120]   That's one downside for me personally.
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.560]   Second is, of course, the associations are bleak.
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:12.880]   The origins, I suppose, I don't know this with anything other than anecdotal evidence,
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:19.760]   the associations and the origins of rap are pretty ugly, and a lot of foul stuff has been
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.680]   sung to that medium.
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:28.480]   And that means for a lot of people, it's probably going to be hard for them to get over that
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:35.760]   while pouring the purity of the sinless Christ into a medium that for them might be very,
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:41.720]   very associated with something utterly inimical to the purity of Christ.
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:49.400]   And the third thing is that, will it for those who are being drawn to Christ through it,
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:57.400]   will it lead them on to a fuller, richer, wider experience of forms and music?
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.480]   We would hope that that's the case, because all of us come in somewhere, right?
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:08.240]   We come into the faith through some cultural medium, and all of us want, I hope we want,
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:15.680]   to broaden our experience and not limit ourselves to one form of art.
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.520]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening to this podcast.
