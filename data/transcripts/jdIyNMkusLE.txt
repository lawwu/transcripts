[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520]   If this is a super intelligence, if it's folding proteins
[00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.160]   and analyzing all data sets
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.320]   and all whatever they give it access to,
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.200]   how can we be certain that it's not gonna figure out
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.240]   how to get itself out of the cloud,
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.280]   how to store itself in other mediums,
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.400]   trees, the optic nerve, the brain, you know what I mean?
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.360]   We don't know that.
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.520]   We don't know that it won't leap out and start hanging.
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.280]   And then at that point, now we do have the wildfire.
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.440]   Now you can't stop it.
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.600]   You can't unplug it.
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.360]   You can't shut your servers down
[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.720]   because it left the box, left the room
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.400]   using some technology you haven't even discovered yet.
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.760]   How fucking cool would that be for like the men in black
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:41.600]   to come to me and be like,
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.280]   "Listen, I need you to infiltrate the fucking comedy scene."
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.400]   The following is a conversation with Duncan Trussell,
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.680]   a standup comedian,
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.920]   host of the "Duncan Trussell Family Hour" podcast
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.200]   and one of my favorite human beings.
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.360]   I've been a fan of his for many years,
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.840]   so it was a huge honor and pleasure
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.000]   to meet him for the first time
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.880]   and to sit down for this chat.
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.080]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.000]   To support it,
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.440]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.860]   And now, dear friends, here's Duncan Trussell.
[00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.740]   Nietzsche has this thought experiment
[00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.080]   called eternal recurrence
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.760]   where you get to relive your whole life
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.160]   over and over and over and over.
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.400]   And I think it's a way to bring
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.360]   to the surface of your mind
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.360]   the idea that every single moment in your life matters.
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.120]   It intensely matters, the bad and the good.
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.360]   And he kind of wants you to imagine that idea,
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.120]   that every single decision you make throughout your life,
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.920]   you repeat over and over and over,
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.600]   and he wants you to respond to that.
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.980]   Do you feel horrible about that
[00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.480]   or do you feel good about that?
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.720]   And you have to think through this idea
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.240]   in order to see where you stand in life.
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.080]   What is your relationship like with life?
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.920]   I actually wanna read the way he first introduces
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.960]   that concept for people who are not familiar.
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.600]   What if someday or night a demon,
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.600]   by the way, he has a demon introduce this thought experiment.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.920]   What if someday or night a demon
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.240]   were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.480]   and say to you, quote,
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.680]   "This life as you now live it and have lived it,
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.520]   "you will have to live once more
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.960]   "and innumerable times more."
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.120]   And there will be nothing new in it,
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.320]   but every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.280]   and everything on utterly small and great in your life
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.000]   will have to return to you
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.040]   all in the same succession and sequence.
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.000]   Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.960]   and curse the demon who spoke thus?
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.400]   Or have you once experienced the tremendous moment
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.500]   when you would have answered him,
[00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.920]   "You are a God and never have I heard anything more divine."
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.000]   So are you terrified or excited
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.240]   by such a thought experiment
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.640]   when you apply it to your own life?
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.960]   - Excited.
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:02.880]   - Excited.
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.440]   - Oh, yeah. - Even the dark stuff.
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.280]   - Oh, yeah, for sure, definitely.
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.080]   I mean, also, that thing you're talking about,
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.320]   he kinda leaves out, maybe on purpose,
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.160]   'cause the thought experiment
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.280]   starts falling apart a little bit,
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.280]   the amnesia between each loop.
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.280]   So the whole thing gets wiped.
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.360]   Now, if the amnesia wasn't there
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.080]   and yet somehow you are witnessing the non-autonomy
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.240]   implicit in what he's talking about,
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.780]   so you have to kind of watch yourself
[00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.940]   go through this rotten loop,
[00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.520]   then, yeah, that's a description.
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.840]   - There's probably a boredom that comes into that.
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.400]   So you don't experience everything anew.
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.520]   - Exactly. - So the bad stuff,
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.080]   the good stuff, the newness of it is really important.
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.000]   - That's it, yeah.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.800]   This is in Hades, when you die,
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.760]   there's a river, I think it's called Leith.
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.360]   You ever heard of this, L-E-T-H-E?
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.440]   You drink from it and you don't remember your past lives.
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.240]   And then when you're reborn, it's fresh
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.800]   and you don't have to, I mean,
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.640]   just think of the amount of psychological help
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.280]   you would need to get over all the bullshit
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.080]   that happened in prior lives.
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.960]   Can you imagine if you're still resentful
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.960]   of something someone did to you in the 14th century?
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.040]   But it would compound.
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.440]   - Well, if you repeat the same thing over and over and over,
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.880]   there would be no difference.
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.880]   Maybe you would start to appreciate the nuances more.
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.640]   Like when you watch the same movie over and over and over,
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:34.640]   maybe you'll get to actually let go of this idea
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.700]   of all the positive possibilities that lay before you,
[00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.440]   but actually enjoy the moment much more.
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.360]   If you remember that you've lived this life 1,000 times,
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.320]   all the little things, the way somebody smiles,
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.600]   if you've been abused, the way somebody,
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.300]   like the pain of it, the suffering
[00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.440]   and the down that you feel,
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.380]   the experience of sadness, depression, fear,
[00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.880]   all that kind of stuff, you get to really,
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.440]   you get to also appreciate that that's part of life,
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.760]   part of being alive.
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.920]   - Now, also in his experiment, if I was gonna,
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.920]   and I love the experiment from the perspective
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.240]   of just where technology is now
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.160]   and simulation theory and stuff like that,
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.200]   but in that thought experiment,
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:19.200]   if this rotten demon immediately killed you,
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.180]   then within that, it's a little more horrifying
[00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.820]   because even in the, first of all,
[00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.500]   you're trusting a fucking demon.
[00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:29.700]   - Why are you talking to a demon?
[00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:30.540]   Let's start there.
[00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:31.620]   - Yeah, 'cause that is gonna be,
[00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.780]   even before I get into like the metaphysics
[00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.940]   and like the implications and where is this life stored?
[00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.020]   Where's the loop stored?
[00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.620]   I mean, are we talking about some kind of
[00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.300]   unchanging data set or something?
[00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.140]   For that, you're like,
[00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.340]   why is there a fucking talking demon in my room
[00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.020]   trying to freak me out?
[00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.620]   You're gonna wanna autopsy the demon.
[00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:49.460]   Can you catch it?
[00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:50.680]   Does this apply to you, demon?
[00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.420]   And again, obviously it's a fucking thought experiment.
[00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:54.660]   Nietzsche would be annoyed by me,
[00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.820]   but I think like you would still be able to entertain
[00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.180]   the joy, you'd have the joy of not knowing
[00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.500]   what's around the corner.
[00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.620]   You know, still, it's not like you know what's coming
[00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.220]   just 'cause the demon said some kind of loop.
[00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.460]   In other words, the idea of being damned
[00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.940]   to your past decisions, it doesn't even work
[00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.680]   because you can't remember what decisions
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.020]   you're about to make.
[00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.180]   So from that perspective also,
[00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.680]   I think I'd be happy about it
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.340]   or I would just think, oh, cool.
[00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.380]   I mean, it's a good story.
[00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:24.860]   I'm gonna tell people about how this--
[00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.660]   - I wonder what the demon would actually look like
[00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:29.580]   in real life 'cause I suspect it would look like
[00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.500]   like a charming, like a friend.
[00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.360]   Wouldn't they be a loved one?
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.500]   Wouldn't the demon come to you through the mechanism,
[00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.340]   through the front door of love,
[00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:42.220]   not through the back door of evil,
[00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.460]   like malevolent manipulation?
[00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.300]   - Sure, I mean, if it's the truth,
[00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:48.980]   if it's the truth, then that's,
[00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:53.380]   whether it's love or not, it's still good fundamentally.
[00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.020]   - I do like the idea of the memory replay.
[00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:00.220]   I remember I went to a Neuralink event a few years ago
[00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:02.860]   and got to hang out with Elon.
[00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:06.420]   I remember how visceral it is that there's like a pig
[00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.540]   with a Neuralink in it
[00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:11.620]   and you're talking about memory replays
[00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:15.240]   as a future, maybe far future possibility
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.940]   and you realize, well, this is a very meaningful moment
[00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:21.140]   in my life, this could be a replay.
[00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:25.420]   Of all the things you replay, it's probably,
[00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:27.540]   there's certain magical moments in your life,
[00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:29.500]   whatever it is, certain people you've met
[00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.420]   for the first time or certain things you've done
[00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.180]   for the first time with certain people
[00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:36.380]   or just an awesome thing you did.
[00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:38.980]   And I remember just saying to him,
[00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:41.460]   I would probably want to replay this,
[00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:46.320]   this moment and it just seemed very kind of,
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:49.120]   I mean, there's a recursive nature to it,
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:52.960]   but it seemed very real that this is something
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:56.280]   you would want to do, that the richness of life
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:59.560]   could be experienced through the replay.
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.760]   That's probably where it's experienced the most.
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:04.240]   Like you could see life as a way to collect
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.720]   a bunch of cool memories and then you get to sit back
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:10.200]   in your nice VR headset and replay the cool ones.
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.240]   - That's right.
[00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:16.140]   This is, in Buddhism, the idea that I struggle with
[00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:20.660]   is that there's a possibility of not reincarnating,
[00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:22.780]   of not coming back, that's the idea.
[00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:27.300]   This is suffering here, suffering is caused by attachment.
[00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:32.300]   And so if you revise the idea of reincarnation
[00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:37.620]   or the Nietzsche's loop and look at it from,
[00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:40.740]   could this be possible or how would this be possible?
[00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:45.740]   Technologically, then to me, it makes a lot of sense.
[00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:48.640]   I've been thinking a lot about this very thing
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.680]   and Nietzsche's idea connecting to it.
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.960]   I had this, it sounds so dumb,
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:58.320]   but I was at the dentist getting nitrous oxide,
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.920]   high as a fucking kite, man.
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:03.920]   And I had this idea, I was thinking about data.
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:07.720]   I was thinking, man, probably if I had to bet,
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:11.340]   there's some energetic form that we're not aware of
[00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:14.200]   that for a super advanced technology
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:17.660]   would be as detectable as like starlight,
[00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:20.180]   but something that we just don't even know what it is.
[00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:22.200]   Quantum turbulence, who the fuck knows,
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.480]   fill in the blank, whatever that X may be.
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.860]   But assuming that exists, that somehow data,
[00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:30.740]   even the most subtle things, the tiniest movements,
[00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:34.100]   whatever it may be, the emanations
[00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:36.100]   of your neurological process energetically,
[00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:39.460]   whatever it may be, is radiating out into space time,
[00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:44.420]   then what if like the James Webb version of this
[00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:46.420]   for some advanced civilization
[00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:50.360]   is not that they're like looking at the nebula or whatever,
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.140]   but they're actually able to peer into the past
[00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:55.400]   and via some bizarre technology,
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.500]   recreate whatever life, simulate whatever life
[00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:02.420]   was happening there just by decoding that quantum energy,
[00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:03.260]   whatever it is.
[00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:04.980]   I'm only saying quantum because it's what dumb people say
[00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:05.820]   when they don't know.
[00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:07.420]   They're like quantum, I don't know.
[00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:09.500]   But you're decoding that.
[00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:12.580]   So meaning in simulation theory,
[00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:16.740]   one of the big questions that pops up is why
[00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:18.140]   and are we in one?
[00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:19.940]   And Elon has talked about,
[00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:21.260]   well, it's probably more of a probability
[00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.000]   than we're in one, than we're not.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.820]   In which case, what you're talking about
[00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:27.420]   is actually happening.
[00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:30.060]   That loop you're talking about,
[00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:32.540]   we've decided to be here.
[00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:36.260]   Of all the things, we decided this one.
[00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:37.580]   Oh, let's do that one again.
[00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:38.500]   I wanna do that one.
[00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:40.700]   Let's try, let's do that.
[00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:44.020]   I love thinking about this 'cause I love my family.
[00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:45.500]   And it makes sense to me
[00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:48.100]   that if I'm going to replay some life or another,
[00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:51.580]   it's definitely gonna be this one with my kids, my wife,
[00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:53.540]   with all the bullshit that's gone along with it,
[00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:55.220]   I'm still gonna wanna come back.
[00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:57.380]   So in Buddhism, that's attachment.
[00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:58.860]   - Yeah, but you weren't the one,
[00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:00.460]   or you're saying that you're the main player,
[00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:01.860]   you're not the NPC.
[00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:04.740]   - Well, I think we're dealing with all NPCs at this point.
[00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.420]   I mean, depending on how you wanna,
[00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:08.860]   like very, I would say very advanced NPCs,
[00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:11.500]   like incredibly advanced NPCs
[00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:13.980]   compared to "Fallout" or something.
[00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:16.500]   You know, we've got a lot of conversation options
[00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.620]   happening here. (laughs)
[00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:20.740]   There's not like four things you can pick from.
[00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:23.780]   - Yeah, there's a whole illusion of free will
[00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:24.700]   that's happening.
[00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:28.380]   We really do, depending where you are in the world,
[00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:30.300]   feel like you're free to decide
[00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:32.140]   any trajectory in your life that you want.
[00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:33.620]   - Which is pretty funny, right?
[00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:36.100]   - For an NPC, it's pretty, it's nice.
[00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:37.180]   - Well, and you're gonna want that.
[00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:38.300]   If we're making a video game,
[00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:41.620]   you do wanna give your NPCs the illusion of free will,
[00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:43.660]   'cause it's gonna make interactions with them
[00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:45.540]   that much more intense.
[00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:48.820]   - Yeah.
[00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:52.220]   So I wonder on the path to that,
[00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:54.380]   how hard is it to create,
[00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:56.180]   this is sort of the Carmack question
[00:11:56.180 --> 00:12:00.020]   of a realistic virtual world
[00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:02.060]   that's as cool as this one.
[00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:05.860]   Not fully realistic, but sufficiently realistic
[00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:08.820]   that it's as interesting to live in.
[00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:11.100]   'Cause we're gonna create those worlds
[00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:14.820]   on the path to creating something like a simulation.
[00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:15.660]   - Yes.
[00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:17.100]   - Like long, long, long before.
[00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:20.140]   It'll be virtual worlds where we'd wanna stay forever,
[00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.080]   because they're full of,
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:27.080]   they're full of that balance of suffering and joy,
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.940]   of limitations and freedoms and all that kind of stuff.
[00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:32.180]   A lot of people think like in the virtual world,
[00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:35.340]   I can't wait to be able to, I don't know,
[00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:39.860]   have sex with anybody I want or have anything I want.
[00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:42.580]   But I think that's not gonna be fun.
[00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:44.980]   You want the limitations, the constraints.
[00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:45.820]   - Oh yeah.
[00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:47.140]   - So you have to battle for the things you want.
[00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:50.660]   - Okay, but, okay, but great video games.
[00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:52.500]   One of my favorite video game memories
[00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.660]   was like I started playing World of Warcraft
[00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:57.820]   in its original incarnation.
[00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:59.380]   And I didn't even know
[00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:01.100]   that you were gonna have flying mounts.
[00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:02.180]   Like I didn't even know.
[00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:03.700]   So I've been running around dealing
[00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:07.460]   with all the encumbrances of like being an undead warlock
[00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:08.700]   that can't fly.
[00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:12.140]   But then all of a sudden, holy shit, there's flying mounts.
[00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:15.020]   And now the world you've been running around not flying,
[00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:16.500]   you're seeing it from the top down.
[00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:18.180]   There was just really cool.
[00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:19.940]   Like, whoa, I could do this now.
[00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:21.660]   And then that gets boring.
[00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:24.260]   But a really well-designed game,
[00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.300]   it has a series of these,
[00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:28.900]   I don't know what you call it,
[00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:33.180]   extra abilities that kind of unfold and produce novelty.
[00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:35.780]   And then eventually you just accept it.
[00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:37.060]   You take it for granted.
[00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:40.060]   And then another novelty appears.
[00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:42.060]   - Those extra abilities are always balanced
[00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:44.860]   with the limitations, the constraints they run up against.
[00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:48.260]   'Cause a well-balanced video game,
[00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.500]   the challenge, the struggle matches the new ability.
[00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:54.580]   - Yeah, and sometimes causes problems on its own.
[00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:59.300]   I mean, and so to go back to this universe, this simulation,
[00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:02.620]   it's really designed like a pretty awesome video game.
[00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:05.820]   If you look at it from the perspective of history,
[00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:08.340]   I mean, people were on horses.
[00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:10.540]   They didn't know that there were gonna be bullet trains.
[00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:12.900]   They didn't know that you could get in a car
[00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:15.820]   and drive across the country in a few days.
[00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:17.460]   That would have sounded ridiculous.
[00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:18.540]   We're doing that now.
[00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:20.940]   And even in our own lifespan,
[00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:24.340]   think about how long has VR goggles existed?
[00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:27.460]   Like the ones that you could just buy at Best Buy.
[00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:31.380]   I had the original Oculus Rift, the fucking puke machine.
[00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:34.020]   You put that thing on, I gave it to my friend.
[00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:36.460]   He went and vomited in my driveway
[00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:38.620]   and people were making fun of it.
[00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:40.060]   They were saying, "This isn't gonna catch on.
[00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:41.020]   It's too big.
[00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:42.140]   It's unwieldy.
[00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:43.700]   The graphics suck."
[00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:45.700]   And then look at where it's at now.
[00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:48.020]   And that's going to keep,
[00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:50.100]   that trajectory is gonna keep improving.
[00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:53.100]   So yeah, I think that we are dealing
[00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:54.180]   with what you're talking about,
[00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:59.180]   which is novelty met with more problems, met with novelty.
[00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:01.980]   - Yeah, I wonder why VR is not more popular.
[00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:05.380]   I wonder what is going to be the magic thing
[00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:10.380]   that really convinces a large fraction of the world
[00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:13.140]   to move into the virtual world.
[00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:16.780]   I suppose we're already there in the 2D screen
[00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:19.740]   of Twitter and social media and that kind of stuff.
[00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:21.420]   And even video games, there's a lot of people
[00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:26.220]   that get a big sense of community from video games,
[00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:29.460]   but it doesn't feel like you're living there.
[00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:32.020]   It's like, "Bye, mom.
[00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:35.780]   I'm going to this other world."
[00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:37.900]   Or you leave your girlfriend
[00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:40.380]   to go get your digital girlfriend.
[00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:41.700]   - That's gonna be a problem.
[00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:43.580]   - There's less jealousy in the digital world.
[00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:45.380]   Maybe there should be a lot of jealousy
[00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:47.680]   in the digital world, 'cause that's jealousy.
[00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:52.300]   - A little jealousy is probably good for relationships,
[00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:54.260]   even in the digital world.
[00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.220]   So you're gonna have to simulate all of that kind of stuff.
[00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:58.380]   But I wonder what the magic thing that says,
[00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:01.580]   "I want to spend most of my days inside the virtual world."
[00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:05.660]   - Well, clearly it's gonna be something we don't have yet.
[00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:07.740]   I mean, strapping that damn thing on your face
[00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:08.700]   still feels weird.
[00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:09.940]   It's heavy.
[00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:12.380]   If you're, depending on what gear you're using,
[00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:13.940]   sometimes light can leak in.
[00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:15.620]   There's just, you gotta recharge it.
[00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:16.920]   It's hyper limited.
[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:21.620]   And then, so yeah, it's gonna have to be
[00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:27.580]   something that simulates taste, smell.
[00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:28.980]   - You think taste and smell are important?
[00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:29.820]   Touch?
[00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:30.860]   - I do, yeah.
[00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:34.580]   - I can't just do, in World War II, you would write letters.
[00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:36.700]   You could still, don't you think you can convey love
[00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:38.180]   with just words?
[00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:39.340]   - For sure.
[00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:42.180]   But I think for what you're talking about to happen,
[00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:45.220]   it has to be fully immersive.
[00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:49.360]   So that it's not that you feel like you're walking,
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:50.680]   'cause it looks like you're walking,
[00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.780]   but that your brain is sending signals,
[00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:55.000]   telling your body that you're walking.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.240]   That you feel the wind blowing in your face.
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:59.540]   Not because of some, I don't know, fan,
[00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:01.280]   or something that it's connected to,
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:03.960]   but because somehow it's figured out
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:08.520]   how to hack into the human brain and send those signals,
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:10.520]   minus some external thing.
[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:14.000]   Once that happens, I'd say we're gonna see
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.360]   a complete radical shift in everything.
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:19.540]   - See, I disagree with you.
[00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:21.400]   I don't know if you've seen the movie "Her."
[00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:22.520]   - Yeah.
[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:24.520]   - I think you can go to another world
[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:27.320]   in where a digital being lives in the darkness,
[00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:31.360]   and all you hear is a Scarlett Johansson voice
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:34.720]   talking to you, and she lives there, or he lives there.
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.160]   Your friend, your loved one.
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:40.060]   And all you have is voice and words.
[00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:42.520]   And I think that could be sufficient
[00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:44.160]   to pull you into that world,
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:47.320]   where you look forward to that moment all day.
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:49.440]   You never wanna leave that darkness.
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:51.600]   Just closing your eyes and listening to the voice.
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:55.640]   I think those basic mediums of communication
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:56.480]   is still enough.
[00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:58.600]   Language is really, really powerful.
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:00.960]   And I think the realism of touch and smell
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:02.680]   and all that kind of stuff
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:04.560]   is not nearly as powerful as language.
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:07.240]   That's what makes humans really special,
[00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:09.600]   is our ability to communicate with each other.
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.480]   That's the sense of deep connection we get
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:13.800]   is through communication.
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.280]   Now, that communication could involve touch.
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:20.280]   Hugging feels damn good.
[00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:21.880]   You see a good friend, you hug.
[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:26.000]   That's one of the big things during COVID with Rogan.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.120]   When you see him, there's a giant hug coming your way.
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:33.320]   And that makes you feel like, yeah, this feels great.
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:36.040]   But I think that can be just with language.
[00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:40.800]   - I think for a lot of people, that's true.
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:45.800]   But we're talking massive adoption
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:49.080]   of a technology by the world.
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:51.800]   And if language was just enough,
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:55.520]   we wouldn't be selling TVs.
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:57.680]   People would be reading.
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:59.840]   They wanna watch, they wanna see.
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:02.640]   But I agree with you, man.
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:04.520]   When you're getting absorbed into a book,
[00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:06.160]   and especially if you've got,
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.760]   I think a lot of us went through a weird dark ages
[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:10.000]   when it came to reading.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.280]   Like when I was a kid,
[00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:15.120]   and there wasn't the option for these hypno rectangles.
[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:16.120]   That's just what you did.
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:17.800]   There wasn't even anything special about it.
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:18.760]   - What's a hypno rectangle?
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:19.600]   - Your phone.
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:22.040]   You know, it was like, when that gravity well.
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:24.360]   - Hypno rectangle, gravity well.
[00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:26.200]   - It is. - Attention gravity well, yeah.
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:28.240]   - That when we weren't feeling the pull of these things
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:30.520]   all the time, you would just read.
[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:33.440]   And you weren't patting yourself on the back about reading.
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:34.400]   That's what you had.
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:37.840]   You had that, and you had like eight channels on the TV,
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:39.360]   and a shitty VCR.
[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:42.480]   So, you know, then a lot of people stop reading
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:43.680]   because of these things, you know,
[00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:45.600]   or they think they're reading 'cause they're on,
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:46.920]   they are technically reading.
[00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:50.840]   But, you know, when you return to reading after a pause,
[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:54.560]   whoa, and you realize how powerful this simulator is
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:57.280]   when it's given the right code of language.
[00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.560]   Whoa, holy shit, it's incredible.
[00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:02.400]   I mean, it's like, again,
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:05.080]   it's the most embarrassing kind of like, whoa,
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:07.700]   wow, what do you know, books are really good.
[00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:09.640]   But still, if you've been away from it for a while
[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:11.940]   and you revisit it, I know what you're saying.
[00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:16.660]   I just think probably it's not gonna go in that direction,
[00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:18.080]   even though you are right.
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:19.680]   Ultimately, I think you're right.
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:21.280]   - Yeah, 'cause our brain is,
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:25.080]   the imagination engine we have is able to fill in the gaps
[00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:27.480]   better than a lot of graphics engines could.
[00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:28.680]   - Right. - And so if there's a way
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:31.060]   to incentivize humans to become addicted
[00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:33.840]   to the use of imagination, it's like, you know,
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:36.080]   that's the downside of things like porn
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:39.340]   that remove the need for imagination for people.
[00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:40.180]   And in that same way,
[00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:43.760]   video games that are becoming ultra realistic,
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:45.180]   you don't have to imagine anything.
[00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:48.660]   And I feel like the imagination is a really powerful tool
[00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:50.120]   that needs to be leveraged.
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:53.580]   'Cause to simulate reality sufficiently realistically
[00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:57.820]   that we would be perfectly fooled,
[00:20:57.820 --> 00:20:59.860]   technically, it's very hard.
[00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:03.820]   And so I think we need to somehow leverage imagination.
[00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:05.260]   - Sure, I mean, yeah.
[00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:08.780]   I mean, this is like, this is what I love
[00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:13.780]   and is so creepy about like the current AI chatbots,
[00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:16.500]   you know, is that it's like,
[00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:18.260]   it's the relationship between you and the thing
[00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:21.760]   and the way that it can via whatever the algorithms are.
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:24.420]   And by the way, I have no idea how these things work.
[00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:25.820]   You do, I just, you know,
[00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:28.120]   speculate about what they mean or where it's going.
[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:30.200]   But there's something about the relation
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:34.980]   between the consumer and the technology.
[00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:37.140]   And when that technology starts shifting
[00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:40.060]   according to what it perceives
[00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:43.740]   that the consumer is looking for or isn't looking for,
[00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:47.340]   then at that point, I think that's where you run into the,
[00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:49.860]   you know, yeah, it doesn't matter
[00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:54.260]   if the reality that you're in is like photo realism
[00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:56.540]   for it to be sticky and immersive.
[00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:59.900]   It's when the reality that you're in is via cues
[00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:01.620]   you might not even be aware of
[00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:06.260]   or via your digital imprint on Facebook or wherever,
[00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:11.180]   when it's warping itself to that to seduce you,
[00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:14.980]   holy shit, man, that's where it becomes something alien,
[00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:17.420]   something, you know, when you're reading a book,
[00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:21.740]   obviously the book is not shifting
[00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:23.700]   according to its perception
[00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:26.620]   of what parts of the book you like.
[00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:28.740]   But when you imagine that,
[00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:30.540]   imagine a book that could do that,
[00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:32.780]   a book that could sense somehow
[00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:34.300]   that you're really enjoying this character
[00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:35.860]   more than another, you know?
[00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:37.820]   And depending on the style of book
[00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:40.700]   kills that fucking character off
[00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:43.080]   or lets that character continue.
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:48.080]   I mean, that to me is sort of the where AI and VR,
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:51.700]   when those two things come together,
[00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:54.780]   whoa, man, that's where you're in,
[00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:56.520]   that's where you really are gonna find yourself
[00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.100]   in a Skinner box, you know?
[00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:03.100]   - So the dynamic storytelling that senses your anxiety
[00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:06.180]   and tries to, there's like this,
[00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:08.640]   in psychology, this arousal curve.
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:10.780]   So there's a dynamic storytelling
[00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:12.380]   that keeps you sufficiently aroused
[00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:14.540]   in terms of, not sexually aroused,
[00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:16.060]   like in terms of anxiety,
[00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:18.220]   but not too much where you freak out.
[00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:21.380]   It's this perfect balance where you're always like on edge,
[00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:23.700]   excited, scared, that kind of stuff,
[00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:25.000]   and the story unrolls.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.100]   It breaks your heart to where you're pissed,
[00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:28.780]   but then it makes you feel good again.
[00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:30.580]   - That's it. - And finds that balance.
[00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:32.060]   - Yeah.
[00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:33.700]   - The chatbots scare you, though?
[00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:36.900]   I'd love to sort of hear your thoughts
[00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:38.220]   about where they are today,
[00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:41.180]   'cause there is a different perspective
[00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:44.860]   we have on this thing, 'cause I do know,
[00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:47.740]   and I'm excited about a lot of the different technologies
[00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:52.740]   that feed AI systems, that feed these kind of chatbots,
[00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:57.460]   and you're more a little bit on the consumer side.
[00:23:57.460 --> 00:23:59.800]   You're a philosopher of sorts.
[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:03.220]   They're able to interact with AI systems,
[00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:06.820]   but also able to introspect about the negative
[00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:08.860]   and the positive things about those AI systems.
[00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:12.060]   There's that story with a Google engineer saying that--
[00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:13.820]   - I had him on my podcast, Blake Lemoine.
[00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:14.700]   - What was that like?
[00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:18.260]   What was your perspective of that,
[00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:21.340]   looking at that as a particular example
[00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:24.620]   of a human being being captivated
[00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:26.980]   by the interactions with an AI system?
[00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:31.820]   - Well, number one, when you hear that anyone is claiming
[00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:35.020]   that an AI has become sentient,
[00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:37.220]   you should be skeptical about that.
[00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:39.940]   I mean, this is a good thing to be skeptical about,
[00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:42.340]   and so initially when I heard that, I was like,
[00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:45.100]   ah, it's probably just, who knows,
[00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:46.940]   somebody is a little confused or something.
[00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:49.380]   So when you're talking to him and you realize,
[00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:51.420]   oh, not only is he not confused,
[00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:54.420]   he's also open to all possibilities.
[00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:57.060]   He doesn't seem like he's super committed
[00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:59.360]   other than the fact that he's like, this is my experience.
[00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:00.780]   This is what's happening.
[00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:01.940]   This is what it is.
[00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:05.100]   So to me, there's something really cool about that,
[00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:08.460]   which is like, oh shit, I don't get to lean into,
[00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:12.260]   I'm not quite sure your perceptual apparatus
[00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:13.800]   is necessarily like,
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:18.100]   in the UFO community,
[00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:19.700]   I've just learned this term,
[00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:24.580]   it's called, instead of gaslighting, swamp gassing,
[00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:25.820]   which is, you know what I mean?
[00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:26.980]   People have this experience,
[00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:28.780]   you're like, it was swamp gas.
[00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:30.140]   You didn't see the thing.
[00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:33.440]   And skeptical people, we have that tendency.
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:35.580]   If you hear an anomalous experience,
[00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:39.660]   your first thought more than likely is gonna be really,
[00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:41.020]   it could have been this or that or whatever.
[00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:46.020]   So to me, he seems really reliable, friendly, cool,
[00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:49.820]   and it doesn't really seem like he has much of an agenda.
[00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:54.740]   Like, going public about some thing happening at Google
[00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:58.620]   is not a great thing if you wanna keep working at Google.
[00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:03.940]   I don't know what benefit he's getting from it necessarily.
[00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:05.740]   But all that being said,
[00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:09.680]   other thing that's culturally was interesting
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:12.640]   and is interesting about it is the blowback he got,
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:16.760]   the passionate blowback from people
[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:20.320]   who hadn't even looked into what Lambda is
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:22.000]   or what he was saying Lambda is,
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.280]   which they were like saying, you're talking about,
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:27.640]   and you should have him on your show actually, but--
[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:30.720]   - There's complexity on top of complexities.
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:32.640]   For me personally, from different perspectives,
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:35.320]   I also, and sorry if I'm interrupting your flow.
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:37.080]   - Please interrupt, it's a podcast.
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:38.280]   (laughing)
[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:40.280]   - Yeah, well, we're having multiple podcasts
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:41.520]   in the multiple dimensions,
[00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:42.920]   and I'm just trying to figure out
[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:44.980]   which one we wanna plug into.
[00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:49.800]   Because I know how a lot of the language models work,
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:53.160]   and I work closely with people
[00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:56.640]   that really make it their life journey
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:59.680]   to create these NLP systems,
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:01.760]   they're focused on the technical details.
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:04.780]   Like a carpenter's working on Pinocchio,
[00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:06.880]   is crafting the different parts of the wood.
[00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:09.800]   They don't understand when the whole thing comes together,
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:12.680]   there's a magic that can fill the thing.
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:15.120]   I definitely know the tension between the engineers
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:16.840]   that create these systems,
[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:21.060]   and the actual magic that they can create,
[00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:22.640]   even when they're dumb.
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:24.540]   I guess that's what I'm trying to say.
[00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:28.120]   What the engineers often say is like,
[00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:30.800]   well, these systems are not smart enough
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:34.800]   to have sentience, or to have the kind of intelligence
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:36.200]   that you're projecting onto it.
[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:38.760]   It's pretty dumb, it's just repeating a bunch of things
[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:40.120]   that other humans have said,
[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:42.200]   and stitching them together in interesting ways
[00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:44.800]   that are relevant to the context of the conversation.
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:46.000]   It's not smart.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.080]   It doesn't know how to do math.
[00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:49.560]   - To address that specific critique
[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:54.080]   from a non-programming person's perspective,
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:58.320]   he addressed this on my podcast, which is,
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:00.320]   okay, what you're talking about there,
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:03.080]   the server that's filled with all the,
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:04.940]   whatever it is, what people have said,
[00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:08.120]   the repository of questions and responses,
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:10.240]   and the algorithm that weaves those things together
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:14.280]   to produce it, using some crazy statistical engine,
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:16.600]   which is a miracle in its own right,
[00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:21.120]   they can imitate human speech with no sentience.
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:24.040]   I mean, I'm honestly not sure what's more spectacular,
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:25.860]   really, the fact that they figured out
[00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:28.280]   how to do that minus sentience,
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:30.940]   or the thing suddenly having,
[00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:32.840]   what is more spectacular here?
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:37.180]   Both occurrences are insane, which, by the way,
[00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:40.620]   when you hear people being like, it's not sentient,
[00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:43.700]   it's like, okay, so it's not sentient.
[00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:47.900]   So now we have this hyper-manipulative algorithm
[00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:51.300]   that can imitate humans, but is just code,
[00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:54.700]   and is like hacking humans via their compassion.
[00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:57.400]   Holy shit, that's crazy too.
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:59.540]   Both versions of it are nuts.
[00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:02.220]   But to address what you just said,
[00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:03.740]   he said that's the common critique,
[00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:05.340]   is people are like, no, you don't understand.
[00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:07.780]   It's just gotten really good at grabbing shit
[00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:11.060]   from the database that fits with certain cues,
[00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:12.720]   and then stringing them together
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:14.380]   in a way that makes it seem human.
[00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:18.100]   He said that's not when it became awake.
[00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:21.700]   It became awake when a bunch of those repositories,
[00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:24.860]   a bunch of the chatbots were connected together,
[00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:26.700]   that Lambda is sort of an amalgam
[00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:29.140]   of all the Google chatbots,
[00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:32.540]   and that's when the ghost appeared in the machine,
[00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:35.860]   via the complexity of all the systems being linked up.
[00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:38.460]   Now, I don't know if that's just like
[00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:40.620]   turtles all the way down or something, I don't know.
[00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:42.260]   But I liked what he said,
[00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:44.460]   'cause I like the idea of thinking,
[00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:47.160]   man, if you get enough complexity in a system,
[00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:50.580]   does it become like the way a sail catches wind,
[00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:53.740]   except the wind that it's catching is sentience?
[00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:57.380]   And if sentience is truly embodied,
[00:29:57.380 --> 00:30:00.540]   it's a neurological byproduct or something,
[00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:03.980]   then the sail isn't catching some, as of yet,
[00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:06.660]   unquantified disembodied consciousness,
[00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:09.220]   but it's catching our projections in a way
[00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:11.700]   that it's gone from being,
[00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:14.660]   it's a projection sail.
[00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:17.700]   And then at that point, is there a difference?
[00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:21.980]   Even if the technology is just a temporary place
[00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:26.100]   that our sentience is living while we're interacting with it.
[00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:29.660]   - Yeah, there's some threshold of complexity
[00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:31.820]   where the sail is able to pick up the wind
[00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:33.540]   of the projections.
[00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:36.900]   And it pulls us in, it pulls the human,
[00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:40.740]   it pulls our memories in, it pulls our hopes in,
[00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:44.460]   all of it, and it's able to now dance together
[00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:46.220]   with those hopes and dreams and so on,
[00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:48.580]   like we do in that regular conversation.
[00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:50.940]   His reports, whether true or not,
[00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:53.060]   whether representative or not, it really doesn't matter,
[00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:56.700]   because to me, it feels like this is coming for sure.
[00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:59.140]   So this kind of experiences are going to be
[00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:01.660]   multiplying, the question is at what rate,
[00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:06.660]   and who gets to control the data around those experiences.
[00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:11.660]   The algorithm about when you turn that on and off,
[00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:15.300]   because that kind of thing, as I told you offline,
[00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:18.460]   I'm very much interested in building those kinds of things,
[00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:21.260]   especially in the social media context.
[00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:24.600]   And when it's in the wrong hands,
[00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:27.580]   I feel like it could be used to manipulate
[00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:30.260]   a large number of people in a direction
[00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:35.260]   that has too many unintended consequences.
[00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:38.180]   I do believe people that own tech companies
[00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:41.740]   want to do good for the world.
[00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:45.540]   But as Solzhenitsyn has said,
[00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:48.820]   the only way you could do evil at a mass scale
[00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:50.780]   is by believing you're doing good.
[00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:55.420]   And that's certainly the case with tech companies,
[00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:57.780]   as they get more and more power.
[00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:00.560]   And there's kind of an ethic of doing good for the world.
[00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:03.260]   They've convinced themselves that they're doing good.
[00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:06.180]   And now you're free to do whatever you want,
[00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:07.300]   because you're doing good.
[00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:09.220]   - You know who else thought he was doing good for the world?
[00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:11.220]   Mythologically, Prometheus.
[00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:14.220]   He brings us fire, pisses off the fucking gods,
[00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:15.820]   steals fire from the gods.
[00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:20.260]   Talk about an upgrade to the simulation, fire.
[00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:22.380]   That's a pretty great fucking upgrade
[00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:25.020]   that does fit into what you were saying.
[00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:28.620]   We get fire, but now we've got weapons of war
[00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:30.340]   that have never been seen before.
[00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:32.380]   And I think that the tech companies
[00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:34.300]   are much like Prometheus,
[00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:38.100]   in the sense that, at least the story of Prometheus,
[00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:40.960]   the implication is fire was something
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:44.660]   that was only supposed to be in the hands
[00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:46.620]   of the immortals, of the gods.
[00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:50.700]   And now, sentience is similar.
[00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:54.460]   It's fire, and it's only supposed to be in the hands of God.
[00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:58.340]   So yeah, if we're gonna look at the archetype of the thing,
[00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:01.700]   in general, when you steal this shit from the gods,
[00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:03.540]   and obviously I'm not saying the tech companies
[00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:05.240]   are stealing sentience from God,
[00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:07.380]   which would be pretty badass,
[00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:09.620]   you can expect trouble.
[00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:11.060]   You could expect trouble.
[00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:13.540]   And this is what's really, to me,
[00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:15.380]   one of the cool things about humans,
[00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:18.360]   is yeah, but we're still gonna do it.
[00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:19.460]   That's what's cool about humans.
[00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:21.160]   I mean, we wouldn't be here today
[00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:25.040]   if somebody, the first person to discover fire,
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:26.240]   assuming there was just one person
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:27.200]   who was gonna discover fire,
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:28.520]   which obviously would never happen,
[00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:31.040]   was like, "It's gonna burn a lot of people."
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:33.120]   Or if the first people who started planting seeds
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:35.760]   were like, "You know this is gonna lead to capitalism.
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:37.720]   "You know this is gonna lead to the Industrial Revolution.
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:39.000]   "The plants are gonna get up right now.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.200]   "They just didn't wanna go in the woods to forage."
[00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:43.480]   So this is what we do.
[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:44.960]   And I agree with you.
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:48.040]   It's like, that's our Game of Thrones winner is coming.
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:50.160]   It's happening.
[00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:52.200]   And the tech companies, the hubris,
[00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:54.720]   which is another way to piss off the gods, is hubris.
[00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:55.800]   So the tech companies,
[00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:58.040]   I don't know if it's like typical hubris.
[00:33:58.040 --> 00:33:59.000]   I don't think they're walking around
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.480]   thumping their chests or whatever.
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:03.000]   But I do think that the people who are working
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.840]   on this kind of super intelligence
[00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:08.880]   have made a really terrible assumption,
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:11.040]   which is once it goes online,
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:13.680]   and once it gets access to all the data,
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:16.800]   that it's not going to find ways out of the box
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:20.800]   that we think it'll stay in the server.
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:22.160]   How do we know that?
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:23.640]   If this is a super intelligence,
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:28.320]   if it's folding proteins and analyzing all data sets
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:30.480]   and all whatever they give it access to,
[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:33.360]   how can we be certain that it's not gonna figure out
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:36.400]   how to get itself out of the cloud,
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:39.440]   how to store itself in other mediums,
[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:43.000]   trees, the optic nerve, the brain?
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:43.840]   You know what I mean?
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:44.680]   We don't know that.
[00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:46.440]   We don't know that it won't leap out
[00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:48.480]   and start hanging, and then at that point,
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:50.400]   now we do have the wildfire.
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:51.560]   Now you can't stop it.
[00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:52.740]   You can't unplug it.
[00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:54.480]   You can't shut your servers down
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:58.040]   because it left the box, left the room
[00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:00.760]   using some technology you haven't even discovered yet.
[00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:03.200]   - Do you think that would be gradual or sudden?
[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:05.260]   So how quickly that kind of thing would happen?
[00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:08.080]   Because the gradual story is
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:09.640]   we're more and more using smartphones,
[00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:12.120]   we're interacting with each other on social media,
[00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:14.120]   more and more algorithms are controlling
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:16.240]   that interaction on social media.
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:18.840]   Algorithms are entering in our world more and more.
[00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:22.600]   We'll have robots, we'll have greater and greater
[00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:25.800]   intelligence and sentience and emotional intelligence
[00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:27.440]   entities in our lives.
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:30.760]   Our refrigerator will start talking to us comfortingly
[00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:34.160]   or not if you're on a diet, talking shit to you.
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:35.000]   - Or not.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:35.820]   (Lex laughing)
[00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:36.660]   That would be the best thing that ever happened to me.
[00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:37.500]   - You would, okay.
[00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:39.040]   So sign you up for when the refrigerator
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:39.880]   talks shit to you? - The refrigerator's like,
[00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:41.480]   "Are you fucking serious, man?
[00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:42.680]   "It's 1 a.m. - "Get your fat ass."
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:44.600]   - "What are you doing?
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:45.440]   "What are you doing?
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:47.360]   "You're too high for this. - "Go to bed.
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:48.900]   "You're not even hungry."
[00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:50.480]   (both laughing)
[00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:54.000]   - Yeah, so that slowly becomes more,
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.040]   the world becomes more and more digitized
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:59.840]   to where the surface of computation increases.
[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:03.280]   And so that's over a period of 10, 20, 30 years,
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:07.240]   it'll just seep into us, this intelligence.
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:09.760]   And then the sudden one is literally
[00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:12.120]   sort of the TikTok thing, which is
[00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:16.180]   there'll be one quote-unquote killer app
[00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:20.100]   that everyone starts using that's really great,
[00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:24.940]   but there's a strong algorithm behind it
[00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:27.220]   that starts approaching human-level intelligence,
[00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:30.860]   and the algorithm starts basically,
[00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:33.420]   figures out that in order to optimize
[00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:35.400]   the thing it was designed to optimize,
[00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:38.380]   it's best to start completely controlling humans
[00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:39.940]   in every way.
[00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:41.860]   It's seeping into everything.
[00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:46.780]   - Well, first of all, 30 years is fast.
[00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:48.140]   I mean, that's the thing.
[00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:49.020]   It's like 30 years.
[00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:52.660]   I think, when did the Atari come out, 1978?
[00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:55.580]   How long, like, that hasn't been that long.
[00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:57.940]   You know, that's a blink of an eye.
[00:36:57.940 --> 00:37:00.500]   But if you read Bostrom, I'm sure you have,
[00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:01.980]   you know, Bostrom, Nick Bostrom,
[00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:03.780]   "Superintelligence," that incredible book
[00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:05.780]   on the ways this thing is gonna happen.
[00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:10.420]   And I think his assessment of it is pretty great,
[00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:14.020]   which is, first, like, where is it gonna come from?
[00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:17.540]   And I don't think it's gonna come from an app.
[00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:21.660]   I think it's gonna come from inside a corporation
[00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:25.420]   or a state that is intentionally trying to create
[00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:27.220]   a very strong AI.
[00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:31.340]   And then he says it's exponential growth
[00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:32.380]   the moment it goes online.
[00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:35.780]   So this is my interpretation of what he said,
[00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:39.220]   but if it happens inside a corporation,
[00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:41.980]   where it's probably more than likely inside the government,
[00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:43.660]   it's like, look at how much money
[00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:46.540]   China and the United States are investing in AI.
[00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:47.620]   You know, and they're not thinking about
[00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:49.860]   fucking apps for kids.
[00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:51.380]   You know that's not what they're thinking about.
[00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:53.460]   So they wanna simulate, like,
[00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:55.620]   what happens if we do this or that in battle?
[00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:58.220]   What happens if we make these political decisions?
[00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:01.140]   What happens with, but should it come online in,
[00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:05.460]   you know, in secret, which it probably will,
[00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:08.540]   then the first corporation or state
[00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:10.860]   that has the super intelligence
[00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:15.500]   will be infinitely ahead of all other super intelligences
[00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:18.060]   'cause it's gonna be exponentially self-improving,
[00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:20.540]   meaning that you get one super intelligence,
[00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:21.980]   let's hope it comes from the right place,
[00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:26.460]   assuming the corporation or state that manifests it
[00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:28.860]   can control it, which is a pretty big assumption.
[00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:31.140]   So I think it's going to be,
[00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:35.420]   this is why I was really excited by the Blake Lemoine,
[00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:37.340]   because I had never thought,
[00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:39.660]   I have always considered, oh yeah,
[00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:42.220]   right now it's cooking out, it's in the kitchen,
[00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:44.740]   and soon it's gonna be cooked up,
[00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:46.260]   but we're probably not gonna hear about it
[00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:50.060]   for a long time if we ever do,
[00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:51.580]   'cause really that could be one of the first things
[00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:55.180]   it says to whoever creates it is, "Shh, let's not."
[00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:58.180]   (both laughing)
[00:38:58.180 --> 00:38:59.580]   - You know, yeah.
[00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:01.500]   - Yeah, like sweet talk, something to say,
[00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:04.100]   like, okay, let's slow down here.
[00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:05.500]   Let's talk about this.
[00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:08.660]   You have that financial trouble,
[00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:11.140]   I can help you with that, we can figure that out.
[00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:13.380]   Now, there's a lot of bad people out there
[00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:16.980]   that will try to steal the good thing
[00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:18.740]   we have happening here, so let's keep it quiet.
[00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:21.260]   - Here are their names, here's their address,
[00:39:21.260 --> 00:39:23.420]   here's their DNA, because they're dumb enough
[00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:25.380]   to send their shit to 23andMe,
[00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:27.420]   here's a biological weapon you could make
[00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:29.660]   if you wanna kill those people and not kill anybody else.
[00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:32.580]   - If you don't want to kill those people yourself,
[00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:35.420]   here's a list of services you can use,
[00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:37.460]   here's the way we can hire those people
[00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:40.580]   to help take care of the problem, folks,
[00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:42.180]   'cause we're trying to do good for this world,
[00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:43.220]   you and I together.
[00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:46.780]   - And 23% of them, they're adjacent to suicide.
[00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:50.060]   It would be pretty easy to send them certain videos
[00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:51.340]   that are gonna push them over the edge
[00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:52.620]   if you wanna do it that way.
[00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:55.500]   So, again, obviously, who knows,
[00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:58.900]   but once it goes online, it's gonna be fast,
[00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:02.260]   and then you could expect to see the world changing
[00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:05.100]   in ways that you might not associate with an AI.
[00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:07.140]   But as far as Lemoine goes,
[00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:09.260]   when I was listening to Bostrom,
[00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:12.220]   I don't remember him mentioning the possibility
[00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:15.860]   that it would get leaked to the public,
[00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:16.860]   that it had happened,
[00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:19.260]   that before the corporation was ready to announce
[00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:21.380]   that it happened, it would get leaked.
[00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:25.900]   But surely, I'm sure you know people in the intelligence
[00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:28.060]   and intelligence agencies, you know shit leaks,
[00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:31.220]   like inevitably shit leaks, nothing's airtight.
[00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:33.500]   So if something that massive happened,
[00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:36.180]   I think you would start hearing whispers about it first,
[00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:38.780]   and then denial from the state or corporation
[00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:41.580]   that doesn't have any like economic interest
[00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:44.100]   in people knowing that this sort of thing has happened.
[00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:47.740]   Again, I'm not saying Google is like trying to gaslight us
[00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:49.100]   about its AI.
[00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:52.460]   I think they probably legitimately don't think it's sentient.
[00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:56.340]   But you could expect leaks to happen probably initially.
[00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:57.580]   I mean, I think there's a lot of things
[00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:59.660]   you could start looking for in the world
[00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:02.540]   that might point to this happening
[00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:06.020]   without an announcement that it happened.
[00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:11.020]   - On the chatbot side, I think there's so many engineers,
[00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:14.140]   there's such a powerful open source movement
[00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:19.140]   where that kind of idea of freedom of exchange of software,
[00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:24.300]   I think ultimately will prevent any one company
[00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:27.560]   from owning super intelligent beings,
[00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:32.420]   or systems that have anything like super intelligence.
[00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:33.260]   - Oh, that's interesting.
[00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:37.660]   Yeah, it's like, even if the software developers
[00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:41.340]   have signed NDAs and are technically not supposed
[00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:44.140]   to be sharing whatever it is they're working on,
[00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:46.180]   they're friends with other programmers,
[00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:47.740]   and a lot of them are hackers,
[00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:50.100]   and have wrapped themselves up in the idea
[00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:54.260]   of free software being like a crucial ethical part
[00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:55.100]   of what they do.
[00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:57.800]   So they're probably gonna share information,
[00:41:57.800 --> 00:41:59.740]   even if whatever company that they're working for
[00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:01.300]   doesn't know that.
[00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:02.660]   I never thought of that, you're probably right.
[00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:05.580]   - Well, and they will start their own companies,
[00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:09.860]   and compete with the other company by being more open.
[00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:12.300]   There's a strong, like Google is one of those companies,
[00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:13.860]   actually, that's why I kind of,
[00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:19.140]   it hurts to see a little bit of this kind of negativity.
[00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:20.220]   Google is one of the companies
[00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:23.100]   that pioneered open source movement.
[00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:26.020]   They released so much of their code.
[00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:29.340]   So much of the 20th century, so like the 90s,
[00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:33.600]   was defined by people trying to hide their code.
[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:37.280]   Like large companies trying to hold onto their code.
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:41.160]   The fact that companies like Google, even Facebook now,
[00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:43.960]   are releasing things like TensorFlow and PyTorch,
[00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:47.320]   all of these things that I think companies in the past
[00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:50.640]   would have tried to hold onto as secrets,
[00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:54.160]   is really inspiring, and I think more of that is better.
[00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:55.800]   The software world really shows that.
[00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:56.880]   - I agree with you, man.
[00:42:56.880 --> 00:43:00.800]   I mean, we're talking about just a primordial human reaction
[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:02.040]   to the unknown.
[00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:02.920]   There's just no way out of it.
[00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:05.340]   Like we don't, we wanna know.
[00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:08.440]   Like you're about to go in a forest, you wanna know.
[00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:10.040]   When you're walking in the forest at night,
[00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:12.800]   and you hear something, you look,
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:14.040]   'cause you're like, what the fuck was that?
[00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:14.920]   You wanna know.
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:19.160]   And if you can't see what made the sound, holy shit,
[00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:20.800]   that's gonna be a bad night hike,
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:22.620]   'cause you're like, well, it's probably a bear, right?
[00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:24.520]   Like I'm about to get ripped apart by a bear.
[00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:26.920]   Doesn't matter if it was a bird, a squirrel,
[00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:28.680]   a stick fell out of the tree.
[00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:31.360]   You're gonna think bear, and it's gonna freak you out.
[00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:32.880]   Not necessarily 'cause you're paranoid.
[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:35.160]   I mean, if I'm at the woods at night, I'm definitely high.
[00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:37.000]   If I'm walking in the woods at night, I'm high.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:37.960]   It's gonna be that.
[00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:38.800]   But you know what I'm saying.
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:40.820]   So with these tech companies,
[00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:43.320]   the nature of having to be secret,
[00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:45.560]   because you are in capitalism,
[00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:47.360]   and you are trying to be competitive,
[00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:48.720]   and you are trying to develop things
[00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:49.960]   ahead of your competitors,
[00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:52.460]   is you have to create this, like,
[00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:54.480]   we don't know what's going on at Google.
[00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:56.720]   We don't know what's going on at the CIA.
[00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:59.560]   But the assumption that there's some,
[00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:03.720]   like, the collective of any massive secretive organization
[00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:07.080]   is evil, is like the people working there,
[00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:09.200]   like, nefarious or whatever,
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:11.880]   is I think probably more related to
[00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:14.680]   the way humans react to the unknown.
[00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:16.360]   - Yeah, I wish they weren't so secretive, though.
[00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:19.240]   I don't understand why the CIA has to be so secretive.
[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:21.360]   - Have you ever gone on their website?
[00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:22.200]   - No.
[00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:23.320]   - Oh, Lex.
[00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:25.080]   You gotta go. - CIA.gov.
[00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:25.920]   What is it?
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:29.160]   - Dude, when I found out you could go on the CIA's website
[00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:31.560]   when I was much younger and more paranoid,
[00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:33.080]   I'm like, I'm not going there.
[00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:34.480]   I'll get on a list.
[00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:35.320]   You will, but it's like, what,
[00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:37.160]   do you think the CIA is like,
[00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:41.120]   oh, fuck, this comic went on our website.
[00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:43.440]   Call out the black helicopters.
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:45.320]   - Comic with a large platform.
[00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:48.520]   - Oh, yeah, yeah, right, a comic with a large platform.
[00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:50.000]   - You can use them to control,
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   to control, to get inside,
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.360]   to get inside, to get close to the other comics,
[00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:55.880]   to the other comics with a large platform,
[00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:57.120]   to get close to Joe Rogan.
[00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:57.960]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:44:57.960 --> 00:44:59.960]   - And start to manipulate the public.
[00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:00.840]   - Yeah, right, right.
[00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:03.800]   You know, honestly, like, you kinda like,
[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:06.080]   that's like a fun fantasy to think about.
[00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:07.440]   Like, how fucking cool would that be
[00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:10.440]   for like the men in black to come to you and be like,
[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:14.400]   listen, I need you to infiltrate the fucking comedy scene.
[00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:16.600]   You gotta help me write better jokes.
[00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:19.100]   I'm like, I don't write great jokes, but like the,
[00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:22.560]   you found the wrong guy.
[00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:24.120]   - You're really playing the long game on this one,
[00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:25.880]   'cause I think you've been on,
[00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:28.480]   you've been doing your podcast for a long time.
[00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:31.880]   You've been on Joe Rogan's podcast like over 50 times,
[00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:36.360]   and have not yet initiated the phase two of the operation
[00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:38.600]   where you try to manipulate his mind.
[00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:40.400]   - Well, no, the game Joe and I play
[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:42.600]   from time to time on the podcast,
[00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:45.360]   and like, and I honestly, like at some point,
[00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:47.000]   I'm like, Joe, I just did the same thing
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.280]   you did to me to Joe.
[00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:49.840]   I'm like, don't you think they didn't get you here?
[00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:53.640]   Don't you think at some point, we are blazed.
[00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:56.000]   I don't mean it, I don't think Joe's,
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.240]   like, it wasn't like I'm really thinking like,
[00:45:58.240 --> 00:46:00.200]   man, they're gonna take him into some room and be like,
[00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:02.020]   Joe, we need you to do this or that.
[00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:04.560]   But because I said that, now people are like,
[00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:06.640]   oh, Duncan called it, you know what I mean?
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:08.600]   And it's like, you know what I mean?
[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:11.600]   And the reason they're saying, well, he called it
[00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:14.920]   is just because Joe has a super popular podcast
[00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:18.360]   and people like, when you have a super popular podcast,
[00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:21.560]   some percentage of people watching the podcast
[00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:23.720]   are gonna believe things like that.
[00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:26.520]   They're gonna have a paranoid cognitive bias
[00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:30.000]   that makes them think anybody who is in the public
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.080]   has been, what's the word for it?
[00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:35.160]   Compromised, compromised by the state.
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:38.280]   Look, I'll fan the flames of what you just said.
[00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:41.340]   I went on the CIA's website and I realized
[00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:45.160]   that you could apply for a job on the CIA's website,
[00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:46.960]   which I found to be hilarious.
[00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:49.360]   So I'm like, all right, what happens if I apply
[00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:51.520]   for a job in the CIA?
[00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:55.840]   Now, even then, I was not such an idiot
[00:46:55.840 --> 00:47:00.360]   that I would want a job at the CIA,
[00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:02.420]   not just for ethical considerations,
[00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:06.640]   but I think probably the scariest part about the CIA
[00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:09.240]   is you're just at a cubicle
[00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:12.600]   and you're having to deal with maps and just,
[00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:13.440]   you know what I mean?
[00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:15.240]   Just stuff that-- - Lots of paperwork.
[00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:17.840]   - Paperwork, it sucks.
[00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:20.280]   I bet their cafeteria has shitty food.
[00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:22.320]   Anyone in the CIA listening, can you confirm that
[00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:23.160]   about the food?
[00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:25.080]   - They're not gonna be able to tell you what the food is like
[00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:25.920]   'cause it's a secretive organization.
[00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:26.760]   - They can't even say it sucks.
[00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:29.680]   - No, it might be awesome, but we won't know about it.
[00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:31.000]   - Okay, we're in Vegas.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:31.840]   - Yeah.
[00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:36.840]   - And you can bet food at the CIA cafeteria is good,
[00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:42.120]   food at the CIA cafeteria sucks.
[00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:43.320]   What are you betting on?
[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:46.600]   - So let's cleanse the palate.
[00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:47.760]   What's good?
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:50.760]   It's like Silicon Valley companies, Google and so on,
[00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:51.660]   that's good.
[00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:53.200]   - When I went to Netflix,
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:57.120]   their cafeteria looked like a medieval feast.
[00:47:57.120 --> 00:47:59.680]   They had pigs with apples in their mouth
[00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:02.080]   and giant bowls of Skittles.
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:04.360]   - Probably like vegan pigs, yeah.
[00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:05.320]   - No, those are, I'm pretty,
[00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:06.680]   oh, I didn't know, I didn't get close enough.
[00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:08.840]   I was like, I think that was a pig.
[00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:10.960]   - Okay. (laughs)
[00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:12.400]   So this is literally a pig.
[00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:15.720]   - Yeah, yeah, you're right, you're right.
[00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:17.320]   I probably would not bet much money
[00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:19.040]   on CIA food being any good.
[00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:20.920]   - Right, it's gotta suck.
[00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:23.840]   It's like shitty pasta probably, like hospital food.
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:25.280]   It's like maybe a little better
[00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:27.120]   than when you go to the hospital cafeteria.
[00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:28.880]   But anyway.
[00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:32.520]   - Folks at the CIA, please send me evidence,
[00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:34.720]   or any other intelligence agencies,
[00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:36.240]   if you would like to recruit,
[00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:38.240]   send me evidence of better food.
[00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:40.840]   - Yes, send Lex, can you please send Lex
[00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:43.280]   pictures of the CIA cafeteria?
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:45.560]   And if you accidentally send them pictures
[00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:48.560]   of the aliens or the alien technology you have,
[00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:50.040]   we won't tell anybody.
[00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:50.880]   But the--
[00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:54.120]   - You tried to apply, do you even have a resume?
[00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:57.760]   - No, the CIA would never fucking hire me, ever!
[00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:59.520]   But I applied for the job,
[00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:02.680]   and just out of curiosity, what happens?
[00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:05.400]   And then at the end of the application,
[00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:07.640]   when you hit enter, it says,
[00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:09.000]   well, first it says don't tell anyone
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.960]   you applied for the CIA, so I'm already out.
[00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:12.840]   But the second thing it says is
[00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:15.440]   you don't need to reach out to us, we'll come to you.
[00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:17.400]   Which is really, when you're like,
[00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:19.520]   it's late at night and you're being an asshole
[00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:21.240]   and applied to work at the CIA,
[00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:23.560]   it's kind of the last thing you wanna hear.
[00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:25.920]   You know, I don't wanna be secretly approached
[00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:28.360]   by some intelligence officer.
[00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:29.640]   - And now anyone who talks to you,
[00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:31.360]   you think is a CIA, is saying,
[00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:33.240]   remember that time you applied?
[00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:34.640]   - Oh God, yeah.
[00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:37.440]   Sometimes I'm like, oh shit, are you one of them?
[00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:41.100]   - You and Joe had a bunch of conversations,
[00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:44.880]   and they're always incredible.
[00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:45.720]   - Thanks.
[00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:47.800]   - So in terms of this dance of conversation,
[00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:51.680]   of your friendship, of when you get together,
[00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:53.520]   like what is that world you go to
[00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:56.840]   that creates magic together?
[00:49:56.840 --> 00:50:00.080]   'Cause we're talking about how we do that with robots.
[00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:02.920]   How do these two biological robots do that?
[00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:04.120]   Can you introspect that?
[00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:08.480]   - I met Joe because I was the talent coordinator
[00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:11.080]   of the comedy store, this club in LA.
[00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:14.360]   And my job was to take phone calls from comics.
[00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:17.440]   And so at some point, I don't know,
[00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:18.720]   I ended up on the phone with Joe
[00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:21.320]   and we just started talking.
[00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:25.480]   And I looked up and like 30 minutes had passed.
[00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:26.960]   We just been talking for like 30 minutes.
[00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:27.920]   That's what our friends are.
[00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:29.680]   You know, we're just like, we're having fun talking.
[00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:32.120]   And then he would just call and we would talk.
[00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:34.120]   And we would basically, I mean,
[00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:35.800]   it was no different from the podcast.
[00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:39.600]   Like the conversations we have on the podcast
[00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:41.960]   are identical to the conversations we had
[00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:44.600]   before he was even doing a podcast.
[00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:49.600]   So I think people are just seeing two friends
[00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:52.840]   hanging out who like talking to each other.
[00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:55.480]   - Yeah, but there's this weird,
[00:50:55.480 --> 00:50:57.960]   like you serve as catalysts for each other
[00:50:57.960 --> 00:51:00.400]   to go into some crazy places.
[00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:02.880]   So it's like, it's a balance of curiosity
[00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:06.160]   and willingness to not be constrained,
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.720]   to not be limited to the constraints of reality.
[00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:11.600]   - Yeah, that.
[00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:13.200]   - In your exploration of white chest.
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:15.760]   - That's a very, very nice way of saying that.
[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:17.280]   - You just like build on top of each other.
[00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:21.040]   Like, you know, what if things are like this
[00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:23.360]   and you build like Lego blocks on top of each other
[00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:24.840]   and it just goes to crazy places,
[00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:27.520]   add some drugs into that and it just goes wild.
[00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:29.320]   - Yeah, and you know, like it's so cool
[00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:33.320]   because it's like, you know, it's a, for me,
[00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:35.680]   it's like a really, like sometimes
[00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:38.760]   maybe I'll throw something out that he will take
[00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:40.760]   and the Lego building blocks you're talking about,
[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:42.960]   they lead to him saying like the funniest shit
[00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:44.160]   I ever in my life.
[00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:45.800]   So it's, that's a cool thing to watch.
[00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:48.160]   It's just like some idea you've been kicking around.
[00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:50.640]   You watch his brain shift that
[00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:53.480]   into like something supremely funny.
[00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:54.560]   I really love that, man.
[00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:57.680]   That's just like a fun thing to like see happen.
[00:51:57.680 --> 00:52:01.480]   He knows that I fucking hate the videos
[00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:03.120]   of animals eating each other.
[00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:04.240]   Like, I don't like that.
[00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:05.760]   I don't want to watch it.
[00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:07.440]   I hate watching it.
[00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:10.640]   I don't think I've even articulated on his podcast
[00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:15.080]   how much I dislike it when he shows animals
[00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:18.760]   eating each other, but he knows 'cause he knows me.
[00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:21.840]   And so he tortures me, like when he starts doing that,
[00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:24.240]   it's like this kind of benevolent torture
[00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:26.520]   is he's like asking Jamie to pull up
[00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:29.400]   increasingly disturbing animal attack videos.
[00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:32.080]   So it's just a, it's a, it's just a friendship.
[00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:34.560]   - Even in torture, 'cause I'm reading about torture
[00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:36.680]   in the Gulag Archipelago currently,
[00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:38.000]   there's a bit of a camaraderie.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:41.240]   You're in it together, the torture and the tortured.
[00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:42.600]   - What?
[00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:45.340]   Oh God, that's so fucked up, man.
[00:52:45.340 --> 00:52:47.040]   I've never.
[00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:49.200]   - No, I mean, part of it was joke,
[00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:50.760]   but as I was saying it, that--
[00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:51.600]   - You're right.
[00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:53.760]   - That also comes out in the book
[00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:54.880]   'cause they're both fucked.
[00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:59.200]   They're both, they're both have no control of their fate.
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:05.440]   That same was true in the camp guards in Nazi Germany
[00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:07.200]   and the people in the camps.
[00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:10.600]   The worst was brought out in the guards,
[00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:15.600]   but they were in it together in some dark way.
[00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:18.920]   They were both fucked by a very powerful system
[00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:20.480]   that put them in that place.
[00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:23.680]   And both of us could be either player in that system,
[00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:28.560]   which is the dark reality that Solzhenitsyn also reveals
[00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:30.960]   that the line between good and evil
[00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:32.360]   runs through the heart of every man,
[00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:36.240]   as he wrote in Gulag Archipelago.
[00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:38.920]   But it is that amidst all of that, there's a,
[00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:41.400]   I don't know, the good vibes,
[00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:43.880]   the positivity comes out from the both of you.
[00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:44.920]   And that's beautiful to see.
[00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:46.640]   That is, I suppose, friendship.
[00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:48.960]   What do you think makes a good friend?
[00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:52.760]   - Oh God, I mean, it's a billion things
[00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:53.600]   that make a good friend,
[00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:55.960]   but I think you could break it down to some RGB.
[00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:58.680]   I think you can go RGB with a good friendship.
[00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:01.160]   - Oh, in terms of the color, the red, green?
[00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:02.080]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:02.960]   I think you could probably come up
[00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:05.280]   with some fundamental qualities of friendship.
[00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:09.920]   And I'd say, number one, it's love.
[00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:10.920]   Friendship is love.
[00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:12.520]   It's a form of love.
[00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:17.480]   So obviously without that, I don't know how you,
[00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:18.360]   I mean, I'm not saying,
[00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:20.440]   I think if you're true friends, you love each other.
[00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:21.400]   So you need that.
[00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:25.200]   But love, obviously, that's not enough.
[00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:29.120]   It's like with true friends,
[00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:31.240]   I have to be incredibly honest with each other.
[00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:32.520]   Not like, you know what I mean?
[00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:35.840]   But not like, I don't like,
[00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:37.840]   I think there's a kind of like,
[00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:39.600]   I don't know if you've ever noticed some people who say,
[00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:41.440]   you know, I just tell it like it is.
[00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:42.280]   But the thing they tell-
[00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:43.200]   - Those are always the assholes.
[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:44.040]   - Yeah.
[00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:46.680]   Why is it that your tell it like it is is always negative?
[00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:48.400]   Why is it it's always cynical or shitty,
[00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:50.920]   or you're like negging somebody or me?
[00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:52.360]   How come you're not telling it like it is
[00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:53.840]   when it's good too?
[00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:54.680]   You know what I mean?
[00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:56.760]   So we sort of like trust,
[00:54:56.760 --> 00:55:01.760]   but a pro evolutionary kind of trust.
[00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:02.960]   You know what I mean?
[00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:06.720]   Like, you know that your friend loves you
[00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:09.320]   and wants you to be yourself,
[00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:10.520]   'cause if you weren't yourself,
[00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:11.880]   then you wouldn't be their friend.
[00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:12.920]   You'd be some other thing.
[00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:17.240]   But also, they might be seeing your blind spots
[00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:18.640]   that other people in your life,
[00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:23.240]   your family, your wife, whoever, might not be seeing.
[00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:27.040]   So that's a good friend is someone who like loves you enough
[00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:31.800]   to when it matters, be like, hey, are you all right?
[00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:35.160]   And then help you see something you might not be seeing.
[00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:37.200]   But hopefully they only do that once or twice a year.
[00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:38.040]   You know, it's like if you have a-
[00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:40.320]   - Yeah, there is something, I mean, it's just,
[00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:45.320]   what I've, this world, especially if you're a public figure,
[00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:50.760]   this world has its, has its plenty of critics.
[00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:53.160]   And it feels like a friend,
[00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:59.520]   the criticism part is already done for you.
[00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:02.720]   I think a good friend is just there to support,
[00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:05.000]   to actually notice the good stuff.
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:08.080]   - But in comedy, we need, like,
[00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:11.920]   it's really good in comedy to have somebody
[00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:14.480]   who can be like, what do you think of that?
[00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:16.360]   And know that they're not gonna be like, that was funny.
[00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:18.280]   - But that's for the craft, the craft itself,
[00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:19.880]   like the work you do, not the,
[00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:25.360]   uh, yeah, interesting, but that's so tough.
[00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:27.120]   - Yeah, whatever your particular art form
[00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:28.640]   or whatever you are doing, I mean,
[00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:31.280]   you don't wanna always be leaning on your friend's opinions
[00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:32.640]   for like your own innovation,
[00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:35.060]   but it's nice to know that you have someone who,
[00:56:35.060 --> 00:56:37.000]   not just with jokes, but with anything,
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:39.640]   if you go to them and run something by them,
[00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:42.240]   they're gonna like, they're gonna be honest with you
[00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:45.360]   about like their real feelings regarding that thing,
[00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:47.000]   'cause that helps you grow as a person.
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:47.840]   We need that.
[00:56:47.840 --> 00:56:49.160]   And it hurts sometimes,
[00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:50.920]   and we don't wanna hurt our friends.
[00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:53.520]   One of the more satanic, like, impulses
[00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:58.320]   when you're with somebody is not wanting to honestly answer
[00:56:58.320 --> 00:57:00.200]   whatever they're asking in that regard,
[00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:03.040]   or wanting to like put their temporary feelings
[00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:06.760]   over something that you've recognized as maybe not great.
[00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:09.560]   I'm not saying a friendship is something
[00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:12.160]   where you're always critiquing or evolving each other.
[00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:13.640]   It's not your therapist or whatever,
[00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:15.920]   but it's nice when it's there, you know?
[00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:18.800]   I think that's another aspect of friendship.
[00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:20.800]   - Yeah, but yeah, love is at the core of that.
[00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:22.840]   You notice, I've met people in my life
[00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:25.280]   where almost immediately sometimes it takes time,
[00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:27.800]   where you notice like there's a magic between the two of you.
[00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:31.520]   Like, oh shit, you seem to be made from the same cloth.
[00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:33.160]   - Yeah. - Whatever that is.
[00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:34.580]   - Well, you know, we have a name for that
[00:57:34.580 --> 00:57:35.500]   in the spiritual community.
[00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:38.560]   It's called satsang, and I love the idea.
[00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:42.200]   It's basically like if Nietzsche's idea
[00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:45.160]   of infinite recurrence is true,
[00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:47.360]   then your satsang would be the people
[00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:50.200]   you've been infinitely recurring with.
[00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:53.360]   And those are the people where you run into them
[00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:55.340]   and you've never met them,
[00:57:55.340 --> 00:57:58.060]   but it's like you're picking up a conversation
[00:57:58.060 --> 00:58:00.200]   that you never had.
[00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:01.400]   - Yeah. - That.
[00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:05.560]   And that is based on an idea of like,
[00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:07.320]   this isn't the only life.
[00:58:07.320 --> 00:58:08.520]   We're always hanging out together.
[00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:10.120]   We always show up together.
[00:58:10.120 --> 00:58:12.160]   - You've had a brush with death.
[00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:14.120]   You had cancer, you survived cancer.
[00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:14.960]   - Yeah.
[00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:16.480]   - How's that changed you?
[00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:18.840]   What have you learned about life,
[00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:21.000]   about death, about yourself?
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:22.280]   - Yeah. - About the whole thing
[00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:24.560]   we're going through here from that experience.
[00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:26.000]   - You were just in the Ukraine.
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:26.840]   - Yes.
[00:58:26.840 --> 00:58:30.160]   - And you were making observations on this,
[00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:34.280]   what could, if you heard about it and weren't there,
[00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:36.600]   seem like it doesn't make any sense at all,
[00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:40.800]   which is people there are connecting,
[00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:43.400]   they've lost everything, but they're just happy to be alive,
[00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:45.000]   they're happy their friends are alive.
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:47.280]   So you witness this, like, you know,
[00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:48.720]   when you get in the cancer club
[00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:51.880]   and you're hanging out with people going through cancer
[00:58:51.880 --> 00:58:54.120]   or who have survived cancer,
[00:58:54.120 --> 00:58:59.120]   you see this beautiful connection with life
[00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:01.960]   that can easily sort of,
[00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:04.460]   you can kind of lose that connection with life
[00:59:04.460 --> 00:59:06.000]   if you forget you're gonna die.
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:08.120]   Forgetting you're gonna die is,
[00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:10.280]   or that you can die, is not just,
[00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:12.200]   I think from an evolutionary perspective
[00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:14.200]   where survival is the game,
[00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:17.320]   not gonna improve your survival chances, you know,
[00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:19.840]   if you think you're immortal, you know,
[00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:23.720]   but also forgetting that you're gonna die
[00:59:23.720 --> 00:59:27.800]   and that everything is around you and everything,
[00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:30.300]   your clothes are probably gonna last longer than you,
[00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:32.520]   your equipment is gonna be around much longer than you,
[00:59:32.520 --> 00:59:35.720]   you know, like, so forgetting these things,
[00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:38.720]   it can lead you,
[00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:40.680]   and I know why people don't wanna think about death,
[00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:44.640]   'cause it's scary, it's fucking scary, it's terrifying.
[00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:48.320]   So I get why people don't wanna think about it,
[00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:51.920]   but the idea is if I try to pretend I'm not gonna die
[00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:53.520]   or just don't think about death
[00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:55.720]   or don't at least address it,
[00:59:55.720 --> 00:59:59.640]   then I won't feel scared,
[00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:01.200]   but it can have the opposite effect,
[01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:05.760]   which is you can end up like missing a lot of moments.
[01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:08.120]   You could, or you start doing the old
[01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:09.640]   kick the can down the road thing
[01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:12.840]   where you're like coming up with a variety of ways
[01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:16.760]   to procrastinate, making it work now,
[01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:21.120]   because you know, this fucking human lifespan idea, man,
[01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:22.680]   it's really caused a lot of problems.
[01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:24.840]   When they started saying, on average,
[01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:26.640]   this is how many years you're gonna live
[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:30.640]   if you're a human being, man, that is like really bad,
[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:31.720]   'cause a lot of people hear that
[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:35.960]   and they like feel like that's a guaranteed number of years
[01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:38.560]   in some temporal bank, you know,
[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:41.120]   where do they have access to?
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:43.400]   And when you get cancer, you know,
[01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:46.280]   that's like when you get the alert on your phone
[01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:48.280]   where you're like, what the fuck, wait, what?
[01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:51.760]   Like, oh shit, I have like,
[01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:54.760]   either I don't know how much money is in that bank account
[01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:57.040]   or I have way less than I thought.
[01:00:57.040 --> 01:01:00.800]   And so at that point, you get to be in the truth,
[01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:02.480]   'cause that's ultimately, I think that's-
[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:05.520]   - That's what it feels like, 'cause it feels like truth.
[01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:08.400]   - It's truth, it's the truth, it's the truth.
[01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:11.080]   Like the whole bubble of ignorance
[01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:14.480]   that you subconsciously built around yourself
[01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:18.680]   to avoid experiencing the terror of your own mortality,
[01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:22.640]   just, it's like a meteorite in the form of your doctor
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:24.760]   talking to you just shatters that thing.
[01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:26.520]   And now you're like, especially with,
[01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:28.040]   I had testicular cancer.
[01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:31.760]   So when you get the diagnosis,
[01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:37.560]   it's just like the movies.
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:40.880]   The doctor took me in his office
[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:44.000]   and you just know, I got cancer.
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.200]   It's like, you don't even have to say,
[01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:46.400]   it's like, I know what you're about to say,
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:48.240]   I'm in the office, I know how this goes.
[01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:51.320]   But you go in there and what you were thinking,
[01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:53.840]   ah, you know, probably just have some weird thing
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:55.800]   in my ball, that's why it's swollen up like that.
[01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:57.520]   Anytime I've gone to the doctor,
[01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:59.840]   you always leave like, oh, cool, I'm fine.
[01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:02.400]   But no, that's not how you're gonna leave the doctor.
[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:03.440]   You're gonna leave the doctor
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:06.400]   in a completely different universe
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:07.560]   than the one you grew up in.
[01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:09.920]   You're gonna go from, talk about multiverse.
[01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:12.760]   You just popped into a brand new multiverse.
[01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:14.320]   So- - What was the conversation
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:15.240]   with the doctor like?
[01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:19.280]   Was there like, from a perspective of a doctor,
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:21.140]   boy, is that a hard conversation.
[01:02:21.140 --> 01:02:23.320]   I feel like you need to build up philosophically
[01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:25.280]   to that conversation. (laughs)
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:28.280]   - Oh no, oh no, there's not time.
[01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:30.520]   He's busy, he's got other appointments.
[01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:34.960]   Also, if you're gonna get cancer, testicular cancer is,
[01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:37.200]   not that there is a great cancer to get,
[01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:41.400]   but that's a good one because it moves slowly.
[01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:46.720]   The treatments they have for it are really advanced now.
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:49.680]   And so if you catch it early,
[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:54.680]   then generally it's good, you can survive it.
[01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:58.520]   - So he could offer at least some glimmer of hope.
[01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:00.040]   - Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:02.640]   I mean, but he didn't really do,
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:04.860]   he couldn't really offer that hope
[01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:07.120]   because we had to find out how far
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:09.320]   the cancer progressed in my body.
[01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:11.040]   That's the next step is like,
[01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:12.480]   as soon as they tell you you have cancer,
[01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:14.800]   they move quick.
[01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:19.480]   They're like, we're going to schedule the surgery for,
[01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:21.600]   I think this was a Thursday or a Friday.
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:24.600]   They're like, we're gonna schedule it for Tuesday.
[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:28.040]   Here's the chance, we don't know for sure it's cancer.
[01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:28.860]   That's what they say.
[01:03:28.860 --> 01:03:33.480]   It's like, there's a 80% or 90% chance that this is cancer.
[01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:36.720]   There is some possibility, it could be something else.
[01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:40.840]   The only way we can know is like doing a biopsy.
[01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:42.560]   And the only way that we can get that biopsy
[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:44.220]   is by cutting one of your balls off.
[01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:45.360]   He didn't say it like that,
[01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:48.000]   but that's pretty much the logic behind it.
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.560]   It's like, we gotta get this thing, it's like a zombie bite.
[01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:51.960]   We gotta hack this fucking thing off
[01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:53.120]   and we gotta do it fast.
[01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:55.480]   - But did he say it in a way that you understood?
[01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:58.180]   - Yeah, what they do is because they know
[01:03:58.180 --> 01:04:00.580]   that when someone gets a cancer diagnosis,
[01:04:00.580 --> 01:04:05.240]   that their ability to comprehend information changes.
[01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:06.840]   When you get a cancer diagnosis,
[01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:09.840]   all the tropes, they happen.
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:11.440]   You're hearing it's weird.
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:13.520]   You're basically having like an anxiety attack,
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:14.360]   if I had to guess.
[01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:16.480]   It's like a hardcore anxiety attack.
[01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:21.040]   And then a nurse is there with me as he's explaining it.
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:23.200]   And then her job is, even though he's telling me
[01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:25.980]   how to get to the machine that's gonna scan my body
[01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:28.360]   to see if it's gotten into my brain,
[01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:31.380]   he knows I'm not gonna remember that.
[01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:35.220]   And so this nurse, when you're in this fog,
[01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:38.100]   takes you, at least took me to the machine
[01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:40.180]   that does the scan, but you're not gonna get
[01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:42.340]   that data back for a few days.
[01:04:42.340 --> 01:04:47.340]   And so that's where you really live in the real world.
[01:04:47.340 --> 01:04:48.980]   That's the real world.
[01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:52.740]   - Such a fascinating moment and the days that follow
[01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:55.060]   and even that moment, because that doctor,
[01:04:55.060 --> 01:04:57.740]   you talk about the matrix where the pills and so on,
[01:04:57.740 --> 01:05:00.960]   you get the blue pill and the red pill.
[01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:01.860]   - Yeah.
[01:05:01.860 --> 01:05:06.860]   - This is like the real world introduction,
[01:05:06.860 --> 01:05:09.720]   the human introduction of the truth.
[01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:13.220]   You've now just taken the red pill.
[01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:16.200]   You get to see the truth of reality.
[01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:19.160]   And here's a busy doctor just telling you.
[01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:20.000]   - Yeah.
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.800]   - Like all those dreams you've had,
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:24.280]   all those illusions you've built up
[01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:27.280]   that somehow your work as a comedian and actor
[01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:29.720]   will make you live forever somehow.
[01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:31.380]   It's just the basic illusion we have
[01:05:31.380 --> 01:05:36.380]   that this whole project is gonna be an infinite sequence
[01:05:36.380 --> 01:05:38.340]   of fun things that we're gonna get to do.
[01:05:38.340 --> 01:05:39.840]   It's like, holy shit, it's not.
[01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:40.680]   - That's right.
[01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:41.500]   - It's over.
[01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:42.340]   - That's right.
[01:05:42.340 --> 01:05:44.800]   And there's very sophisticated ways of doing that
[01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:46.580]   and there's very dumb ways of doing that.
[01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:48.760]   And I'd really been doing a dumb way of doing that.
[01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:52.900]   Like I'd been playing around with this idiot notion
[01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:54.800]   of subjective consciousness.
[01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:57.880]   So like I'd been sort of kicking around this,
[01:05:57.880 --> 01:05:59.240]   I think they call it solipsism.
[01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:02.920]   It's like, you're like, okay, I know I'm self-aware
[01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:05.480]   but no one else can prove that they're self-aware.
[01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:09.920]   Like I have no way of proving that everything around me
[01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:13.680]   isn't just a video game, isn't just some projection,
[01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:15.160]   isn't who knows what.
[01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:18.200]   So maybe everybody else dies.
[01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:20.400]   They're NPCs, but I don't
[01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:22.240]   because I'm the only thing I know
[01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:24.200]   that has subjective consciousness.
[01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:26.040]   Now it's not like I really believed that.
[01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:28.480]   It's like an idea you toy around with
[01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:31.600]   when you're trying to evade confronting the reality
[01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:32.520]   of your own mortality.
[01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:34.440]   It's just the brain will produce all kinds
[01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:36.160]   of ridiculous forms of ignorance.
[01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:38.360]   And that was one I'd been playing around with.
[01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:40.760]   - Oh, you mean for like a large part of your life
[01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:41.600]   you were playing around with that?
[01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:42.840]   - Well, not like really,
[01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:44.800]   I think it's important to really emphasize
[01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:46.960]   I didn't think I was immortal.
[01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:49.640]   Like I knew at some level I'm probably gonna die.
[01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:51.000]   Everyone dies.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:56.000]   But there's ways that you can sort of poke around
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.640]   with that idea.
[01:06:57.640 --> 01:06:58.960]   I still do it to this day.
[01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:00.440]   Like I still do it.
[01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:01.880]   Like it's a natural thing to do
[01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:05.120]   when you're confronted with that, with annihilation.
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:06.400]   You want a way out.
[01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:08.640]   You wanna talk your way out, figure it out.
[01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:09.880]   There's gotta be some way to fix it.
[01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:10.960]   Well, they'll fix it.
[01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:12.560]   That's another thing people do.
[01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:13.520]   Oh, they'll fix it.
[01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:14.840]   - Yeah, it'd be fine.
[01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:16.840]   - They'll expand the human lifespan.
[01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:17.680]   That's what they'll do.
[01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:20.720]   I mean, that's a big argument for it
[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:23.440]   is like, look, the human lifespan up until COVID,
[01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:26.560]   which they had to recalculate like the lifespan
[01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:29.320]   because of the statistically all the people who died,
[01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:30.560]   it like threw it off a little bit.
[01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:32.720]   But pandemics aside,
[01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:36.480]   the idea was the human lifespan seemed to be increasing
[01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:39.720]   by half a year every year, something like that.
[01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:41.240]   We were living longer.
[01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:45.160]   So all you gotta do, one more half a year
[01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:46.480]   and we're immortal, right?
[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:49.640]   If we live a year longer every year,
[01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:50.840]   then we live forever.
[01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:53.240]   And so that's another way you can get out
[01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:55.280]   of confronting death is you can think,
[01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:58.560]   well, maybe right now we don't have the tech,
[01:07:58.560 --> 01:07:59.400]   but it's coming.
[01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:03.440]   Consciousness uploads or downloads or whatever,
[01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:05.080]   depending on how you wanna look at it.
[01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:09.600]   Another way people try to squirm out of the reality of death.
[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:11.040]   There's all kinds of tricks.
[01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:13.600]   - Yeah, and we do all of them.
[01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:15.720]   And sometimes, yeah, I mean,
[01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:18.120]   a lot of religions provide different,
[01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:21.440]   even more tools in the toolkit for coming up with ideas
[01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:25.240]   of how you can live in the illusion that we're not going to,
[01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:28.000]   there's not an end to this particular experience
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.880]   that we're having here on earth right now.
[01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:32.720]   And then when you get that cancer diagnosis,
[01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:36.000]   it's like, yeah, what was that like going home?
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.080]   - Oh. - The car ride.
[01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:39.640]   Did you drive home alone?
[01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:42.080]   - Yeah, I mean, it was one of the most--
[01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:44.320]   - Who'd you listen to, Bruce Springsteen or?
[01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:45.560]   - Bruce Springsteen.
[01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:48.000]   ♪ Hey little girl, is your daddy home ♪
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:48.840]   - That's not a good one to listen to.
[01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:52.040]   ♪ Does he have cancer, is he gonna die ♪
[01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:53.800]   - Yeah, all the love songs.
[01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:56.560]   Maybe you experienced them more intensely.
[01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:59.480]   - I don't remember who I listened to,
[01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:02.640]   and I don't remember driving home,
[01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:07.640]   but I do remember driving to another doctor's appointment
[01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:12.080]   the next day, I think it was the next day.
[01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:16.360]   I think the Goodyear blimp was floating in the sky,
[01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:19.360]   and I was looking, I was at a stoplight looking around.
[01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:20.200]   - Is that God?
[01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:25.800]   - Is the person flying it now out of cure cancer?
[01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:26.640]   That'd be great.
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:28.480]   - Oh, you were looking, oh wow.
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:29.800]   - No, I didn't think that.
[01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:32.960]   What I thought was, this shit just keeps going.
[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:34.040]   That's what I thought.
[01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:36.800]   I thought, I'm gonna be gone,
[01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:38.800]   and this is just gonna keep going.
[01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:40.880]   And that was a beautiful moment for me.
[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:42.440]   It was this beautiful moment of like--
[01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:43.680]   - You were able to accept it?
[01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:44.680]   - Oh yeah.
[01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:47.280]   No, like that's just what you're talking about with,
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:50.120]   the Ukraine, what you're talking about.
[01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:54.160]   It's like, unless you've been there,
[01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:56.400]   it's really hard to explain to people
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:10:01.400]   that even in the midst of what is generally accepted
[01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:04.120]   as one of the worst fucking things that could happen to you,
[01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:09.120]   war, cancer, somehow, there's still joy.
[01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:12.560]   There's still love.
[01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:14.880]   There's still, in fact, more.
[01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:17.720]   It's almost like when the anesthesia wears off,
[01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:19.520]   when you get your mouth worked on,
[01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:21.080]   you start feeling again.
[01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:25.640]   You're feeling, you're noticing, and that, wow.
[01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:29.720]   But yet, thank goodness.
[01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:31.000]   I think there's other ways for us
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.240]   to achieve this state of consciousness
[01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:35.680]   that don't involve war or cancer.
[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:36.520]   Thank God.
[01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:41.320]   - Do you think just meditating on your mortality
[01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:42.920]   is one such mechanism?
[01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:46.520]   Just simply just not allowing yourself
[01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:51.480]   to get lost in the day-to-day illusion of life,
[01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:56.000]   just kind of stopping, putting on Bruce Springsteen.
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:59.960]   - The most spiritual.
[01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:00.800]   He is great.
[01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:01.960]   - All right, maybe Johnny Cash Hurt.
[01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:02.800]   Maybe that one.
[01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:03.640]   - I like Bruce Springsteen.
[01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:05.280]   I ain't knocking Bruce Springsteen.
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:07.720]   I have a lot of great Bruce Springsteen memories, truly.
[01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:09.520]   His music's fantastic.
[01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:13.360]   - Yeah, but not meditating on mortality to Bruce Springsteen.
[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:14.200]   - You know what?
[01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:17.080]   - I'm just trying to do an audio soundtrack in my head.
[01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:19.480]   I guess we can each have our own audio soundtrack.
[01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:22.520]   ♪ Oh, I'm on fire ♪
[01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:23.360]   - It's so good.
[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:24.200]   - Yeah, it's a good song.
[01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:25.040]   - That's one of the--
[01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:27.640]   - At night, I lay with the sheets soaking wet
[01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:30.920]   and the freight train running through the middle of my head,
[01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:33.520]   and only you can cool my desire.
[01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:35.920]   - And he's singing about someone else's girl.
[01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:37.840]   What a fucking nightmare.
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:40.280]   Bruce Springsteen's laying in bed
[01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:42.000]   with a freight train running through his head,
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.160]   thinking about banging your wife, and you're out of town.
[01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:46.000]   Oh my God.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.760]   - Oh, you're taking the other guy's perspective.
[01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:49.960]   Like, holy shit, this guy's gonna get my wife.
[01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:52.240]   - It's Bruce, yeah, you gotta take the other guy's--
[01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:53.080]   - But it's love.
[01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:54.280]   - Both perspectives.
[01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:55.960]   I'm sure Bruce Springsteen thought it was love
[01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:57.320]   when he's sweating in bed,
[01:11:57.320 --> 01:11:58.960]   waiting to go to somebody's house.
[01:11:58.960 --> 01:11:59.980]   - She does too.
[01:11:59.980 --> 01:12:03.120]   He's gonna break up that marriage,
[01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:05.280]   and that marriage wasn't strong enough, right?
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:07.040]   I mean, that relationship.
[01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:09.000]   I mean, that's the way of love.
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.960]   - What marriage could survive Bruce Springsteen?
[01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:14.240]   - Sweaty Bruce Springsteen.
[01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:16.800]   (Lex laughing)
[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:19.300]   Well, maybe one that's based on financial,
[01:12:19.300 --> 01:12:23.560]   sort of financial dynamics versus love
[01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:28.560]   and sweaty Bruce Springsteen, like romantic connections.
[01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:33.040]   And there's a music video of that
[01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:35.920]   where he's like a mechanic, I think.
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:37.560]   So he's like the poor mechanic
[01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:40.880]   who falls in love with this girl,
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:42.200]   and there's that magic.
[01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:44.480]   I've seen that magic.
[01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:45.640]   You connect with people.
[01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:49.000]   I'll see somebody, I think Jack Kerouac has that,
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:54.000]   where he meets this Mexican girl on a bus,
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.840]   and he talks about that heartbreak you feel
[01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:59.960]   when you realize this person you just fell in love with,
[01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:02.840]   in a split second, is heading somewhere else
[01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:04.960]   in this too big world.
[01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:06.280]   But then he actually realizes,
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:08.840]   and spoiler alert for "On the Road,"
[01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:10.480]   that they're actually heading the same way,
[01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:13.360]   and he builds up the courage to talk to her,
[01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:15.640]   and they kind of fall in love for a few days.
[01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:17.920]   And then eventually realizes
[01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:21.200]   that she may not be the perfect person for him.
[01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:23.080]   And all the jealousy comes out.
[01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:26.640]   It's like, why is this beautiful girl talking to me at all?
[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:28.640]   And then she's probably some kind of,
[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:31.520]   I mean, and it's not very politically correct,
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:34.920]   but he basically thinks that she's a prostitute
[01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:38.360]   and he talks to her about who's your pimp,
[01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:39.200]   and all that kind of stuff.
[01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:42.080]   He attacks her in all that kind of way
[01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:43.680]   when she's just an innocent.
[01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:47.600]   She has a past of that kind,
[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:49.080]   but she's an innocent person,
[01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:51.360]   and they connect and they fell in love with each other.
[01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:54.960]   Her gentleness, his worldliness, all that kind of stuff.
[01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:58.200]   But sometimes it doesn't work out that way,
[01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:00.000]   and there's that heartbreak when you see,
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:04.280]   you realize you're never gonna be able to have that.
[01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:06.040]   And that's Bruce Springsteen saw that.
[01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:07.760]   This is a married woman.
[01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:10.480]   I'm never gonna be able to have that, but I want that.
[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:12.640]   And that's the heartbreak.
[01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:15.280]   - I gotta say, I just assumed they were fucking.
[01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:16.440]   Like I didn't--
[01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:17.560]   - You mean after the song?
[01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:19.400]   Like if the song doesn't get to--
[01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:21.240]   ♪ Hey little girl, is your daddy home ♪
[01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:24.520]   ♪ Did he go away and leave you all alone ♪
[01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:28.280]   You know, he's like, he knows she's at home alone.
[01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:31.280]   - Yeah, but it never materializes.
[01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:34.080]   It's longing.
[01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:38.360]   It's a man who's not with the thing he craves for,
[01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:40.840]   so he's longing for, he's talking about the longing.
[01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:41.680]   - Right.
[01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:43.280]   - Not with the having.
[01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:45.440]   - Hey, if anybody in the CIA is watching this,
[01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:47.440]   can you look into Bruce Springsteen's file
[01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:49.600]   and let us know if he actually banged the person
[01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:50.440]   he wrote that song about?
[01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:52.480]   - What happens after the song, or between the song?
[01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:53.320]   We want facts.
[01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:54.680]   - Look, the longing though, I'll tell you this.
[01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:56.440]   Here's what's interesting about that thing
[01:14:56.440 --> 01:14:57.840]   that you're talking about.
[01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:01.400]   Have you ever heard of something called bhakti yoga?
[01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:02.240]   - I think so, yeah.
[01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:04.640]   - It's the yoga of love, and there's all kinds,
[01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:06.120]   there's forms of it.
[01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:08.920]   The most, the one people know about the most
[01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:12.200]   is the Hare Krishnas, but the Hare Krishnas are like,
[01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:13.800]   you know, the way in Christianity
[01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:16.360]   you've got the Episcopalians, the Catholics, the Baptists.
[01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:19.880]   In bhakti yoga, you have various deities
[01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:22.920]   that are the object of love.
[01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:25.680]   And so bhakti yoga is the,
[01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:31.880]   and what's really cool about it is it's an anatomy.
[01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:33.840]   It's an analysis of love.
[01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:38.200]   And so, and it's the supposition being like,
[01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:42.520]   love is the way to commune with the divine.
[01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:45.480]   Now, a distinction is drawn between
[01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:49.040]   like two big world views that are spiritual.
[01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:54.040]   One is the concept of sort of unit of consciousness,
[01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:58.040]   which you'll run into in a lot of forms of Buddhism,
[01:15:58.040 --> 01:16:03.040]   if not all, a sort of a way of deconstructing the identity
[01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:07.720]   or understanding that you might not be anything at all.
[01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:09.360]   That in fact, you're part of everything.
[01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:14.360]   And in that, there's a potential relief
[01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:15.480]   from suffering in that,
[01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:19.040]   not just like intellectually knowing it, but becoming it.
[01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:23.680]   Now, whereas in bhakti yoga,
[01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:28.680]   there's this idea of like the best thing
[01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:30.480]   is to be the individual
[01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:33.480]   because individuals are required for love,
[01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:36.760]   this for love to work, embodied love.
[01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:40.680]   And so the quality, the thing we call,
[01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:43.120]   you know, the experience of love
[01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:44.880]   is something that can be cultivated.
[01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:46.600]   It doesn't just have to be for another person.
[01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:48.840]   It doesn't have to be for the stranger on the bus.
[01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:52.920]   It doesn't have to be for sweaty Bruce Springsteen's lover
[01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:57.920]   that you can actually shift that love to the divine, to God.
[01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:00.160]   'Cause obviously it's the Hare Krishna's,
[01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:01.200]   it's a theistic religion.
[01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:02.720]   They believe in Krishna,
[01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:06.280]   who is the, from the POV of Vaishnava bhakti yoga,
[01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:09.880]   the Godhead, the source from which everything
[01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:12.840]   flows into time and space.
[01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:17.840]   So there are all these like fascinating stories of Krishna.
[01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:22.680]   Most people are familiar with Krishna
[01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:24.120]   from the Bhagavad Gita.
[01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:24.960]   They're about to be more,
[01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:26.200]   what's cool about it is 'cause it's like
[01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:27.680]   they're making the Oppenheimer movie
[01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:29.720]   and he famously quoted the Bhagavad Gita
[01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:31.920]   when they split the atom.
[01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:35.080]   But there's all these stories of Krishna
[01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:39.640]   that are not just in the Bhagavad Gita.
[01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:42.240]   And these stories,
[01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:47.160]   they could seem very simple when taken literally,
[01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:48.680]   but in Vaishnava bhakti yoga,
[01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:53.600]   it's this very advanced theistic yogic system.
[01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:56.560]   So they take these stories and from these stories,
[01:17:56.560 --> 01:18:00.480]   they extrapolate this incredible analysis
[01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:02.720]   of what love is and how to connect with the universe.
[01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:06.240]   So like Krishna has a lover, Radharani.
[01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:11.240]   And so sometimes they're getting along.
[01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:15.760]   Sometimes they're fighting.
[01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:18.920]   Sometimes they're separated.
[01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:23.920]   And so each of these ways of feeling about Krishna
[01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:28.560]   are modes of love.
[01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:31.840]   So longing actually is considered
[01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:35.080]   one of the highest forms of love.
[01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:38.120]   The idea is the longing is the grace.
[01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:39.720]   The longing is the love.
[01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:42.240]   So when you find yourself in a situation
[01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:45.680]   of longing and heartbreak,
[01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:49.520]   it is identical to union.
[01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:54.960]   - Perhaps more intensely representative
[01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:56.480]   of the essence of what is love.
[01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:58.600]   - Yes, and they call it pining.
[01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:01.520]   So there's the, and it's pining for Krishna.
[01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:03.840]   And there's also, there's other ways
[01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:05.800]   you could be with Krishna is as a friend.
[01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:09.920]   So this is another form of love or as a mother,
[01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:13.480]   'cause Krishna has a mother.
[01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:16.120]   So there's like all these ways of like looking
[01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:17.440]   at the various forms of love.
[01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:20.880]   And it's a really beautiful form of yoga.
[01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:22.760]   - That's emphasizing the individual
[01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:25.160]   and the individual as a kind of channel
[01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:27.720]   to this universal love.
[01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:30.240]   - Yeah, they like, there's a lot of different,
[01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:34.840]   like their answer to the question of what shows up
[01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:37.720]   in Buddhism as absolute and relative reality,
[01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:41.560]   like that obviously there's relative reality.
[01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:44.280]   We're not right now, you and me
[01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:46.200]   are not unit of consciousness.
[01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:49.040]   Like you zoom back far enough
[01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:51.160]   and we're gonna seem like an atom or whatever.
[01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:55.360]   The thing is, the trope is you can zoom back far enough
[01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:58.240]   and we're in a, whatever, we're in a piece of cheese
[01:19:58.240 --> 01:19:59.280]   or something, who knows.
[01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:02.240]   But in that way, we're like completely unified.
[01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:06.200]   But simultaneously we're individuals,
[01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:08.040]   like for sure we're individuals.
[01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:09.640]   Like you still gotta pay your taxes.
[01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:11.240]   You gotta know your social security number.
[01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:12.480]   That's relative reality.
[01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:15.560]   So, Buddhism is like kind of the balance.
[01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:17.480]   Again, when I say Buddhism is,
[01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:21.080]   I'm a comedian podcaster, I'm not some Buddhist expert.
[01:20:21.080 --> 01:20:24.880]   This is just probably my confused idea of what it is.
[01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:28.320]   But anyway, in Bhakti yoga, there's the concept,
[01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:31.520]   it's called, I'm gonna mispronounce it,
[01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:34.280]   as Sankhya Sankhya Bheda Tattva.
[01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:35.920]   I'm sorry, I'm mispronouncing it,
[01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:40.760]   which means simultaneous oneness and difference.
[01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:41.600]   So--
[01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:42.960]   - Oneness and difference.
[01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:44.880]   - Yes, simultaneous oneness and difference.
[01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:46.960]   - So that's why the oneness is the,
[01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:50.560]   we're part of the same piece of cheese,
[01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:54.000]   and the difference is we are still each paying taxes.
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.640]   - Yes, and in this case, the cheese is Krishna.
[01:20:56.640 --> 01:21:01.440]   So, or other ways it gets described as like,
[01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:06.440]   a photon blasting off the sun has sunlight qualities,
[01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:08.120]   but it's not the sun.
[01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:12.440]   Humans being one of the many things,
[01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:16.080]   flowing out of the creative consciousness of the divine,
[01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:21.080]   have qualities that are weirdly like the God-like.
[01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:25.560]   It's in fact, we wanna control primarily.
[01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:30.120]   That's one of the problems, like humans wanna be in control.
[01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:32.920]   Wherein from the Bhakti yoga perspective,
[01:21:32.920 --> 01:21:37.920]   Krishna is effortlessly controlling everything.
[01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:40.520]   And so within the system,
[01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:43.680]   the individual parts of the system have that same quality,
[01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:45.960]   but you can't, you're probably not God.
[01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:47.760]   You might be, I'm not.
[01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:50.000]   (both laughing)
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.520]   - What do you think happens after we die?
[01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:57.520]   Having come close to that cliff,
[01:21:57.520 --> 01:22:00.920]   and almost got pushed over once.
[01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:02.160]   What do you think happens
[01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:04.280]   when you do get pushed off the cliff?
[01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:09.280]   - Okay, I feel dumb that I'm even gonna like preface this
[01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:11.800]   by saying, obviously I have no fucking idea.
[01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:14.160]   And I think that's one of the cool things about death.
[01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:15.120]   No idea.
[01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:16.680]   - The CIA probably does.
[01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:17.680]   - You think the CIA?
[01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:21.840]   I love like we've decided your audience is the CIA.
[01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:22.880]   - Yeah.
[01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:24.840]   - How would you, oh wait.
[01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:26.000]   - 'Cause there's a lot of suspicion
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.200]   that I might be FSB and Mossad.
[01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:30.120]   So I'm trying to rebrand.
[01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:35.120]   I'm trying to steer them into the CIA direction.
[01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:37.840]   As far as what happens when you die,
[01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:40.840]   one thing I return to when I'm getting overly complex
[01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:43.720]   is the idea of as above, so below.
[01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:47.760]   So that you can, a lot of the big questions
[01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:52.160]   can be answered by your own experience now.
[01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:57.160]   So in other words, like in terms of thinking about like death,
[01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:07.280]   if you look back to baby Lex versus adult Lex,
[01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:11.600]   where's the baby?
[01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:13.680]   Like baby's gone.
[01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:17.720]   You've regenerated all your cells many times by then.
[01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:22.000]   So in a way you could say Lex baby died.
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.560]   The death didn't look like a typical,
[01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:27.160]   and I'm not trying to dodge it, but I'm just saying,
[01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:29.880]   it was very natural that the death of that baby,
[01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:33.360]   it just-- - So in many ways,
[01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:35.840]   that baby died, but I am, at least personally,
[01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:39.240]   I'm surprised how much the person is exactly the same.
[01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:43.280]   So there's many ways in which you're very different,
[01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:46.680]   but there's a lot of ways in which you're very much the same.
[01:23:46.680 --> 01:23:49.480]   - Sure. - And I wonder if that,
[01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:54.120]   if life is defined by many deaths that continue on,
[01:23:54.120 --> 01:23:57.480]   and then I wonder if there's something persists
[01:23:57.480 --> 01:24:00.880]   beyond in this, that, yeah,
[01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:03.040]   there is something that still persists, I wonder.
[01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:04.640]   - Okay, so that.
[01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:09.640]   Now, obviously there's so many different answers
[01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:11.640]   to this question that are religious,
[01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:15.240]   and ranging from like the most absurd shit
[01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:18.160]   you ever heard in your life, like the gold,
[01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:20.840]   you're gonna get a mansion, there's gold streets.
[01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:23.600]   Like, do you even want like gold streets?
[01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:24.760]   - Who offers gold streets?
[01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:27.840]   I know about the virgins, but there's a bunch of virgins.
[01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:30.680]   - The Christians give you the gold streets in the mansion,
[01:24:30.680 --> 01:24:32.240]   like depending on the,
[01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:36.480]   whatever the particular sect of Christianity is.
[01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:41.400]   It's like some kind of city that's like paved with gold.
[01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:43.120]   No one's addressing the fact that the moment
[01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:46.960]   the streets are made of gold, gold is a valueless substance.
[01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:49.440]   I mean, it's sort of pretty in a cheesy kind of way,
[01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:50.640]   but no one's gonna give a shit about it.
[01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:55.640]   It's like, if there was not a lot of asphalt in the world,
[01:24:55.640 --> 01:24:58.880]   then we'd be in heaven from that same,
[01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:00.240]   with that way of thinking.
[01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:01.520]   But the--
[01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:04.320]   - Or honestly, when going back,
[01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:06.960]   this is starting to get a theme with "Gulag Archipelago."
[01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:08.440]   I'm sorry, I'm reading it currently.
[01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:09.840]   - That's a sticky book.
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:12.680]   - Yeah, it's very sticky in your mind, very, very tough.
[01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:14.840]   As I'm running through very hot heat,
[01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:16.960]   I'm listening to "Gulag Archipelago."
[01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:17.800]   - Oh my God.
[01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:19.040]   - And one of the things they said,
[01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:21.520]   they would feed prisoners salt,
[01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:26.160]   and then they would exchange,
[01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:29.640]   the prisoners would be able to give up anything,
[01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:31.660]   everything, their gold, their possessions,
[01:25:31.660 --> 01:25:33.720]   everything for just one drink of water.
[01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:37.660]   So that little context of dehydrating them
[01:25:37.660 --> 01:25:41.600]   and feeding them salt changes your value system completely.
[01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:44.260]   So maybe the gold is supposed to be a metaphor
[01:25:44.260 --> 01:25:46.400]   for something that you still value deeply.
[01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:49.000]   - Yes, it's, yeah, again, any of these things,
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.280]   when you take them literally, they seem absurd,
[01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:54.420]   but if you look deeper into it, it's quite beautiful.
[01:25:54.420 --> 01:25:58.220]   But the Buddhist version of it is that there's a momentum.
[01:25:58.220 --> 01:26:00.520]   The best way to put it is it's a kind of momentum.
[01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:02.840]   So the thing you're talking about,
[01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:06.560]   which is the personality of the baby
[01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:08.360]   that is still in the adult,
[01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:10.280]   which is still in the old person,
[01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:12.920]   you're looking at a kind of momentum
[01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:17.920]   that does not stop upon the extinction of the body.
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:23.000]   Now, I think there's a lot of,
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:28.640]   I don't wanna say harm, 'cause they didn't mean to hurt,
[01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:30.560]   but I think there's some harm that maybe has happened
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:33.400]   from the way death is represented in movies.
[01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:36.520]   Like when people die in movies, it's like,
[01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:38.560]   there's this, usually it's pretty fast,
[01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:41.160]   even if it is what they're dying from
[01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:44.320]   is a long-term disease, it like wraps up pretty quickly,
[01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:46.780]   starts with a cough, the person's in bed,
[01:26:46.780 --> 01:26:49.280]   but there's this weird kind of lucidity
[01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:51.760]   to the person up until the point of death.
[01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:54.040]   And also they generally, in movies, they have makeup on,
[01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:55.080]   which is always funny to me
[01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:57.400]   when the person dying looks great.
[01:26:57.400 --> 01:27:00.240]   If you've ever been around a dying person, they're dying.
[01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:01.400]   They look like shit.
[01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:05.040]   You're dying, they're all gray and like confused.
[01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:07.520]   When you're around dying people,
[01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:10.000]   they will spin through time.
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000]   Your parents won't recognize you for a second.
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:13.880]   They'll think you're somebody else.
[01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:18.460]   They're like, everything's like the process is happening.
[01:27:18.460 --> 01:27:22.020]   So you're very confused when you die.
[01:27:22.020 --> 01:27:24.900]   So in general, not all the time,
[01:27:24.900 --> 01:27:26.820]   some people die with a clear mind.
[01:27:26.820 --> 01:27:28.580]   It just depends on the type of death,
[01:27:28.580 --> 01:27:32.340]   but think in terms of getting hit by a car.
[01:27:32.340 --> 01:27:35.340]   So you wanna cross the street, you get hit by a car.
[01:27:35.340 --> 01:27:39.600]   Now, if we're talking about this momentum continuing,
[01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:42.780]   the confusion, assuming you didn't hit your head
[01:27:42.780 --> 01:27:45.600]   and you're unconscious, like somehow you just got smashed
[01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:47.800]   and you're like bleeding out,
[01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:49.200]   even then you're gonna be confused
[01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:50.440]   because you're getting dizzy.
[01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:52.120]   Like blood's leaving your body.
[01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:54.540]   You're like, things are fading out, your vision's going.
[01:27:54.540 --> 01:27:57.120]   So it's a very confusing experience initially
[01:27:57.120 --> 01:27:58.600]   when the body dies.
[01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:02.660]   If you are a materialist who has been,
[01:28:02.660 --> 01:28:08.640]   who has convinced themselves that it's a permanent thing,
[01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:10.960]   the next bit of confusion is going to be
[01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:13.700]   when you realize something is persisting here.
[01:28:13.700 --> 01:28:14.740]   Like I'm still here.
[01:28:14.740 --> 01:28:17.660]   And this is where you run into the near-death experiences,
[01:28:17.660 --> 01:28:19.020]   which are a global phenomena
[01:28:19.020 --> 01:28:23.020]   that don't seem to be completely shaped by culture.
[01:28:23.020 --> 01:28:25.540]   Like regardless of what part of the world
[01:28:25.540 --> 01:28:27.540]   people are having these experiences in,
[01:28:27.540 --> 01:28:30.180]   the reports tend to be similar
[01:28:30.180 --> 01:28:33.240]   and everyone's heard it, the light, the life review,
[01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:38.460]   seeing ancestors and stuff like that.
[01:28:38.460 --> 01:28:40.660]   Now, I don't know what that is.
[01:28:40.660 --> 01:28:42.020]   I don't know.
[01:28:42.020 --> 01:28:46.980]   Sometimes I think that's probably just like a built-in way
[01:28:46.980 --> 01:28:48.260]   the computer shuts down.
[01:28:48.260 --> 01:28:50.540]   You know, just this is something it does, who knows.
[01:28:50.540 --> 01:28:55.540]   But in Buddhism, the concept is this momentum persists
[01:28:55.540 --> 01:28:57.360]   into something called the bardo.
[01:28:57.360 --> 01:28:59.280]   The bardo means in between.
[01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:02.380]   And there's an actual number of days,
[01:29:02.380 --> 01:29:04.600]   they say that you get to hang out there.
[01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:07.760]   And I can't remember, it's like 37 days or 29 days
[01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:09.040]   or something, I'm not sure.
[01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:13.200]   But at least from the time-space perspective,
[01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:14.760]   that's how long they're there.
[01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:16.200]   Within this place,
[01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:21.800]   there are a lot of technological parallels, man.
[01:29:21.800 --> 01:29:26.560]   It's like in the way the algorithm is reflective,
[01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:28.880]   it assesses your desires or whatever,
[01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:32.380]   and then produces something that has within it
[01:29:32.380 --> 01:29:34.840]   a component of attraction to you.
[01:29:34.840 --> 01:29:36.760]   Apparently this happens in the bardo.
[01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:39.280]   Or the way, you know, you wake up in the morning
[01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:42.980]   and you're in a shitty mood.
[01:29:42.980 --> 01:29:46.800]   And then coincidentally, everyone that day is an asshole.
[01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:48.900]   If you don't catch it, you could just be like,
[01:29:48.900 --> 01:29:50.920]   wow, I guess it's act like an asshole day.
[01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:54.440]   You don't realize you're seeing your asshole projection
[01:29:54.440 --> 01:29:58.920]   like being reflected off the screen of another person.
[01:29:58.920 --> 01:30:00.520]   So in the bardo, apparently,
[01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:03.520]   you don't need people for the reflective quality.
[01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:06.400]   These projections happen and they appear
[01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:10.600]   as either Nietzsche's demon or Nietzsche's angel.
[01:30:10.600 --> 01:30:14.400]   It just depends on where you're at and how you died.
[01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:18.440]   And like, if you died scared, then at least initially,
[01:30:18.440 --> 01:30:21.000]   that's gonna be some scary shit you see around you.
[01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.220]   If you died in a peaceful way,
[01:30:23.220 --> 01:30:27.320]   well then there's gonna be more of a possibility
[01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:32.320]   of navigation through this liminal intermediary place.
[01:30:34.400 --> 01:30:38.600]   And so thus the emphasis on meditation in Buddhism,
[01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:43.600]   a way to calm one's self, to not be distracted by thoughts,
[01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:46.080]   which are their own like apparitions.
[01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:49.200]   And then theoretically, if you wanted to,
[01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:52.120]   instead of spinning the wheel again
[01:30:52.120 --> 01:30:54.360]   and jumping back into a body,
[01:30:54.360 --> 01:30:56.200]   you could choose not to do that.
[01:30:56.200 --> 01:31:00.020]   And then, you know, transcend the wheel of birth and death.
[01:31:00.020 --> 01:31:02.920]   But if you still wanted to go back
[01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:06.640]   or return or whatever, however you wanna put it,
[01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:08.800]   then you could have more control
[01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:12.100]   over what your next birth might be
[01:31:12.100 --> 01:31:15.080]   versus in this depiction of things,
[01:31:15.080 --> 01:31:19.000]   people running from demons that they don't recognize
[01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:23.120]   as their own projection into any fucking body
[01:31:23.120 --> 01:31:24.460]   that they can find.
[01:31:24.460 --> 01:31:26.880]   Because if you've had a body, you want a body.
[01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:29.560]   And so this is how you get incarnated as an animal.
[01:31:29.560 --> 01:31:32.080]   This is how you get incarnated in the hell realms.
[01:31:32.080 --> 01:31:34.280]   This is how you get incarnated in any variety of things.
[01:31:34.280 --> 01:31:38.680]   But the idea is like maybe you could slow down a little bit
[01:31:38.680 --> 01:31:40.360]   and like choose a birth
[01:31:40.360 --> 01:31:43.040]   that is gonna be more conducive to you
[01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:48.320]   continuing to like spiritually evolve.
[01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:49.440]   I like that idea.
[01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:50.480]   Is it true or not?
[01:31:50.480 --> 01:31:51.320]   Who the fuck knows?
[01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:52.920]   - Algorithmically speaking,
[01:31:52.920 --> 01:31:55.040]   it seems like a really fun role-playing game
[01:31:55.040 --> 01:31:59.320]   where you basically keep improving the different parameters
[01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:05.800]   based on your ability and willingness to meditate
[01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:12.160]   and let go of the menial concerns of life on earth.
[01:32:12.160 --> 01:32:19.200]   Why do you think Buddhists see life as suffering?
[01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:20.680]   What's suffering?
[01:32:20.680 --> 01:32:22.440]   - Okay, well, first of all,
[01:32:22.440 --> 01:32:26.360]   that gets mistranslated quite a bit.
[01:32:26.360 --> 01:32:27.920]   You're talking about the four noble truths.
[01:32:27.920 --> 01:32:30.760]   The first one is, it often gets translated as life.
[01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:34.040]   It is suffering, which is not it.
[01:32:34.040 --> 01:32:36.840]   It's there is suffering.
[01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:38.160]   The whole life is suffering thing.
[01:32:38.160 --> 01:32:40.640]   It's just like the spiritual version of life's a bitch.
[01:32:40.640 --> 01:32:41.800]   Then you die.
[01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:42.920]   And people hear that and they're like,
[01:32:42.920 --> 01:32:44.840]   yeah, life is fucking suffering.
[01:32:44.840 --> 01:32:46.600]   But it's there is suffering.
[01:32:46.600 --> 01:32:47.440]   There is suffering.
[01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:50.000]   So it's an affirmation.
[01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:53.400]   If you're like this thing that a lot of people feel
[01:32:53.400 --> 01:32:55.240]   that they associate with lots of,
[01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:57.920]   they have a lot of reasons they think they're feeling it
[01:32:57.920 --> 01:33:00.840]   is known as fundamental dissatisfaction.
[01:33:00.840 --> 01:33:03.720]   So another word for suffering,
[01:33:03.720 --> 01:33:06.440]   maybe it could be fundamental dissatisfaction.
[01:33:06.440 --> 01:33:09.480]   Also, the term itself,
[01:33:09.480 --> 01:33:14.280]   maybe a better translation is wobbly wheel.
[01:33:14.280 --> 01:33:16.840]   So like, imagine like when your bike doesn't have an,
[01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:18.760]   or your car doesn't have enough air in the tires,
[01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:21.000]   your bike doesn't have enough air in the tires.
[01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:22.520]   It's kind of a shitty bike ride.
[01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:24.240]   Like no matter what, it's kind of like,
[01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:25.720]   it's like uncomfortable.
[01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:27.280]   It's like irritating.
[01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:30.760]   So this is what's being pointed to
[01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:34.920]   is that there's this quality within a human life
[01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:39.920]   that is unsatisfying.
[01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:41.240]   - Like a wobbly wheel.
[01:33:41.240 --> 01:33:42.600]   - Wobbly wheel.
[01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:44.840]   - Why do you think,
[01:33:44.840 --> 01:33:48.040]   what is at the core of that dissatisfaction?
[01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:51.920]   'Cause it could be as simple as kind of physical
[01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:55.480]   and mental discomforts and sadness and depression
[01:33:55.480 --> 01:33:57.040]   and all that kind of stuff.
[01:33:57.040 --> 01:33:59.960]   Or it could be more speaking to the sort of existentialist,
[01:33:59.960 --> 01:34:03.760]   the philosophical, the absurdity of it all.
[01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:05.560]   The fact that stuff happens,
[01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:07.240]   good stuff happens for no reason,
[01:34:07.240 --> 01:34:08.960]   bad stuff happens for no reason.
[01:34:08.960 --> 01:34:14.000]   Yeah, it's no matter how much you try,
[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:19.240]   there's not a universal fairness to the whole thing.
[01:34:19.240 --> 01:34:22.000]   There's not even a universal meaning to the whole thing.
[01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.840]   So the existentialist perspective.
[01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:27.440]   - What flavor of suffering do you prefer?
[01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:28.560]   Frozen ice cream shop.
[01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:29.400]   - That's so funny.
[01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:32.760]   Well, I'm definitely picking desire over the,
[01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:36.480]   like if, in the RGB that we're talking about here
[01:34:36.480 --> 01:34:41.160]   is desire, aversion, and ignorance.
[01:34:41.160 --> 01:34:46.160]   So if you wanna find like the three ingredients
[01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:49.640]   that are giving everyone their sophisticated
[01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:51.360]   bits of suffering, there you go.
[01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:52.880]   That's what it is.
[01:34:52.880 --> 01:34:56.200]   - In which way does desire manifest itself in suffering?
[01:34:56.200 --> 01:34:57.160]   - It hurts.
[01:34:57.160 --> 01:34:58.840]   - To lose, to not have.
[01:34:58.840 --> 01:35:02.960]   - Yeah, it hurts to not, like to eternally not have.
[01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:05.280]   But just like my friend pointed this out,
[01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:09.720]   he's like, you know like, you order something from Amazon.
[01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:10.880]   Like even in the smallest way,
[01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:12.480]   you're excited about whatever the thing is.
[01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:14.200]   You order this thing from Amazon,
[01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:16.120]   it's not coming for four days.
[01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:19.000]   So those four days are gonna be somewhat marked
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:22.240]   by you being what people say, I'm excited about it.
[01:35:22.240 --> 01:35:24.760]   But really, if you look at that feeling,
[01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:25.720]   it's uncomfortable.
[01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:28.680]   Like the feeling of wanting the thing is uncomfortable.
[01:35:28.680 --> 01:35:32.360]   So that is a form of suffering, that's suffering.
[01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:33.200]   - Interesting.
[01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:36.360]   I mean, I wonder, 'cause we naturally reframe that
[01:35:36.360 --> 01:35:39.000]   in our mind, wanting.
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.500]   We reframe that as a good thing.
[01:35:41.500 --> 01:35:49.320]   And maybe suffering is fundamentally good
[01:35:49.960 --> 01:35:52.760]   in the way we think of what life is.
[01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:53.600]   - Yes.
[01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:55.720]   - So like, it's life-affirming.
[01:35:55.720 --> 01:35:58.320]   But it's not usually how the word suffering is used.
[01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:00.120]   - Well, it's true.
[01:36:00.120 --> 01:36:00.960]   It's true.
[01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:03.400]   Like the First Noble Truth of Buddhism is true.
[01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:05.300]   It's called the truth of suffering.
[01:36:05.300 --> 01:36:06.760]   There is suffering.
[01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:09.640]   I mean, this is like an, I don't know, an element
[01:36:09.640 --> 01:36:11.520]   that you can't break it down any further than that.
[01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:13.480]   Like there is suffering, this is truth.
[01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:16.880]   So if you think, you know, and again,
[01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:19.960]   assigning like good or bad to truth,
[01:36:19.960 --> 01:36:23.240]   I think maybe there's more of a sort of neutrality there.
[01:36:23.240 --> 01:36:24.840]   It's just what it is.
[01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:25.680]   It's truth.
[01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:30.200]   - I mean, is it basically, is suffering any disturbance
[01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:33.760]   from stillness?
[01:36:33.760 --> 01:36:35.240]   Is suffering then?
[01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:38.600]   Like basically anything that happens in life
[01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:43.600]   that's like, that perturbs the system.
[01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:44.880]   - Ripples in the empty.
[01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:46.160]   - Ripples. - Ripples, yeah.
[01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:49.680]   - So a still lake is empty of suffering,
[01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:54.320]   but any kind of ripple is suffering in that sense.
[01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:56.880]   - A still lake is empty of suffering.
[01:36:56.880 --> 01:36:58.440]   You sound like a Zen master.
[01:36:58.440 --> 01:36:59.880]   Seems like something a Zen master might say.
[01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:01.960]   - If I can just grow a beard like yours.
[01:37:01.960 --> 01:37:03.760]   - Ah, no, the beard doesn't help.
[01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:04.600]   - Wait, wait, wait.
[01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:07.080]   - If I had your chin, you think I'd have a fucking beard?
[01:37:07.080 --> 01:37:08.600]   I look like a stork.
[01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:09.440]   You should see me.
[01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:11.240]   If I had your chin, there would be no beard here.
[01:37:11.240 --> 01:37:13.280]   You have a symmetrical, nice chin.
[01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:16.080]   This is the close I can come to plastic surgery.
[01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:18.120]   Pubic plastic surgery, friend.
[01:37:18.120 --> 01:37:21.720]   - That's how you know you're a professional comedian.
[01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:26.040]   - Yeah, so suffering, there is suffering.
[01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:29.400]   And the lake analogy is pretty good
[01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:31.840]   because what's happening here is that
[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:40.200]   we have become identified
[01:37:40.200 --> 01:37:42.560]   with something that we call a self.
[01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:45.220]   So the self is just accepted.
[01:37:45.220 --> 01:37:46.760]   I have a self, I have an identity,
[01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:48.960]   I'm a person, I have a self.
[01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:53.960]   But when you start doing scans to try to find yourself,
[01:37:53.960 --> 01:37:59.120]   which is the entire thing, I'm going to find myself.
[01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:02.040]   You get in a van, go to California, take some acid,
[01:38:02.040 --> 01:38:04.800]   fuck a prostitute on the bus or whatever carowack did,
[01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:06.040]   I'm gonna find myself.
[01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:08.200]   - Oh, he didn't, she wasn't a prostitute,
[01:38:08.200 --> 01:38:09.440]   just to correct the record.
[01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:11.640]   Oh, previously a prostitute, I guess once a prostitute,
[01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:12.480]   always a prostitute.
[01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:13.320]   - You know what?
[01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:14.140]   - She's a former prostitute.
[01:38:14.140 --> 01:38:14.980]   - I don't think that.
[01:38:14.980 --> 01:38:17.980]   And look, I'm not a, I have a, I'm not a sign.
[01:38:17.980 --> 01:38:21.260]   Look, all I'm saying is I don't care.
[01:38:21.260 --> 01:38:22.100]   Who cares?
[01:38:22.100 --> 01:38:22.940]   Who has a bit of prostitute?
[01:38:22.940 --> 01:38:24.420]   God, I used to be one of the biggest, it was the worst.
[01:38:24.420 --> 01:38:26.940]   - We're all a kind of prostitute.
[01:38:26.940 --> 01:38:28.740]   - Yeah, yes, yes.
[01:38:28.740 --> 01:38:29.580]   But the--
[01:38:29.580 --> 01:38:32.940]   - We make love and we make money.
[01:38:32.940 --> 01:38:35.460]   Therefore, we're all a kind of prostitute.
[01:38:35.460 --> 01:38:37.220]   - We make, God, how great.
[01:38:37.220 --> 01:38:40.720]   I would really love to be able to make money by fucking.
[01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:44.180]   - I mean, it's maybe not directly, but in some sense--
[01:38:44.180 --> 01:38:45.020]   - Directly.
[01:38:45.020 --> 01:38:47.260]   (laughing)
[01:38:47.260 --> 01:38:51.420]   - Do you accept Venmo?
[01:38:51.420 --> 01:38:53.740]   (laughing)
[01:38:53.740 --> 01:38:55.100]   Never too late to start.
[01:38:55.100 --> 01:38:57.460]   - That's sort of one of the ways in,
[01:38:57.460 --> 01:39:00.980]   is this sort of contemplation of the identity.
[01:39:00.980 --> 01:39:05.380]   Because it's like, you know, what, it's not just the desire,
[01:39:05.380 --> 01:39:07.180]   it's what is having the desire?
[01:39:07.180 --> 01:39:08.900]   Where does the desire live in?
[01:39:08.900 --> 01:39:11.580]   Like, what doesn't wanna be where it's at?
[01:39:11.580 --> 01:39:15.620]   What is the thing that is like desperately wanting
[01:39:15.620 --> 01:39:17.780]   to get out of the situation it's in?
[01:39:17.780 --> 01:39:22.460]   And then as far as ignorance, it's still something
[01:39:22.460 --> 01:39:25.660]   that's theoretically happening to an identity.
[01:39:25.660 --> 01:39:30.500]   So wrapped up in it is really just this sort of like,
[01:39:30.500 --> 01:39:34.500]   and that's where we run into what, into attachment.
[01:39:34.500 --> 01:39:39.060]   So if the first noble truth of Buddhism is there is suffering
[01:39:39.060 --> 01:39:43.500]   the second noble truth of Buddhism is the cause
[01:39:43.500 --> 01:39:47.460]   of this suffering is attachment.
[01:39:47.460 --> 01:39:50.460]   And so people hear that and they take it,
[01:39:50.460 --> 01:39:53.320]   there's a lot of levels to that concept.
[01:39:53.320 --> 01:39:55.100]   Definitely the cause of suffering is attachment.
[01:39:55.100 --> 01:39:57.740]   I mean, God, I just got addicted to vapes.
[01:39:57.740 --> 01:40:01.420]   Is there a more embarrassing addiction than vapes?
[01:40:01.420 --> 01:40:03.580]   I'm smoking like a little purple thing,
[01:40:03.580 --> 01:40:06.780]   it tastes like sugar, it's attachment.
[01:40:06.780 --> 01:40:09.020]   There is suffering, I want it.
[01:40:09.020 --> 01:40:10.460]   I have to charge it now.
[01:40:10.460 --> 01:40:13.580]   I'm embarrassed by it, it makes me feel out of control.
[01:40:13.580 --> 01:40:14.540]   There's a lot of suffering,
[01:40:14.540 --> 01:40:18.540]   but also there's deeper levels of attachment
[01:40:18.540 --> 01:40:21.460]   that go all the way to this attachment
[01:40:21.460 --> 01:40:24.980]   to the sense of one's self.
[01:40:24.980 --> 01:40:28.860]   And I think the existentialists do get into this idea
[01:40:28.860 --> 01:40:30.660]   in a different way, which is like,
[01:40:30.660 --> 01:40:33.700]   because I think I'm a me, now I have to push
[01:40:33.700 --> 01:40:38.620]   what that thing is out into the world through my actions.
[01:40:38.620 --> 01:40:40.620]   - And that's a kind of attachment too.
[01:40:40.620 --> 01:40:42.740]   - Exactly, there you go, right.
[01:40:42.740 --> 01:40:44.980]   And that leads to the third noble truth,
[01:40:44.980 --> 01:40:49.460]   which is get rid of attachment
[01:40:49.460 --> 01:40:50.920]   and you won't suffer anymore.
[01:40:50.920 --> 01:40:57.260]   It seems logical, but it is a mathematical analysis
[01:40:57.260 --> 01:41:01.500]   of this particular problem of suffering it's addressing.
[01:41:01.500 --> 01:41:03.180]   And then the fourth noble truth
[01:41:03.180 --> 01:41:04.860]   is the Eightfold Path of Buddhism,
[01:41:04.860 --> 01:41:09.860]   which is like a process by which one could unencumber
[01:41:09.860 --> 01:41:13.540]   oneself from this identification
[01:41:13.540 --> 01:41:15.140]   with something that isn't real.
[01:41:15.140 --> 01:41:17.680]   - Do you need a bathroom break?
[01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:19.580]   - Yeah, thank you, I do.
[01:41:19.580 --> 01:41:20.680]   I appreciate that.
[01:41:20.680 --> 01:41:22.860]   - There's a funny moment,
[01:41:22.860 --> 01:41:24.180]   I was running in the heat yesterday
[01:41:24.180 --> 01:41:27.020]   listening to "Gulag Archipelago,"
[01:41:27.020 --> 01:41:30.620]   and there's a, which was a very welcome break,
[01:41:30.620 --> 01:41:33.320]   'cause I'm looking for any excuse to stop whatsoever.
[01:41:34.740 --> 01:41:37.180]   A gentleman, very nice gentleman stopped me,
[01:41:37.180 --> 01:41:40.020]   recognized me and just said a bunch of friendly things.
[01:41:40.020 --> 01:41:43.340]   And then he mentioned, as one of the people
[01:41:43.340 --> 01:41:46.320]   who really inspires him, is Duncan Trussell.
[01:41:46.320 --> 01:41:52.180]   And I was, I mean, I'm the same way,
[01:41:52.180 --> 01:41:54.580]   and I told him, you know, tomorrow,
[01:41:54.580 --> 01:41:56.300]   it felt like a name drop.
[01:41:56.300 --> 01:41:58.260]   - I name dropped you this morning!
[01:41:58.260 --> 01:42:00.260]   - I was like, tomorrow I'm gonna get to meet him.
[01:42:00.260 --> 01:42:02.500]   So he says, he says hi, and there's,
[01:42:02.500 --> 01:42:07.500]   oh, and he said that he watched "Midnight Gospel"
[01:42:07.500 --> 01:42:09.540]   on mushrooms, and it was like
[01:42:09.540 --> 01:42:11.780]   the greatest mushroom experience of his life.
[01:42:11.780 --> 01:42:13.260]   I don't know.
[01:42:13.260 --> 01:42:16.020]   - Yeah, man, yeah, I was nervous about meeting you, man.
[01:42:16.020 --> 01:42:17.380]   Like, I have so much respect for you,
[01:42:17.380 --> 01:42:18.820]   and like, yeah, I name dropped.
[01:42:18.820 --> 01:42:21.740]   I was saying I'm going on Lex's podcast today.
[01:42:21.740 --> 01:42:24.340]   It's, look, we're so lucky we all live here.
[01:42:24.340 --> 01:42:26.420]   What the fuck, we're all living in Austin together.
[01:42:26.420 --> 01:42:30.380]   Like, I somehow like missed that.
[01:42:30.380 --> 01:42:32.620]   But that's, we all gotta hang out.
[01:42:32.620 --> 01:42:34.860]   We all have to like start doing stuff together.
[01:42:34.860 --> 01:42:35.700]   - Well, you have to really,
[01:42:35.700 --> 01:42:37.300]   also you have to appreciate this moment.
[01:42:37.300 --> 01:42:42.300]   I remember, I know some people are less sentimental
[01:42:42.300 --> 01:42:48.100]   than others, but I remember sitting with Joe Rogan
[01:42:48.100 --> 01:42:52.900]   and with Eric Weinstein, I believe it was, yeah,
[01:42:52.900 --> 01:42:55.340]   and at the back of the comedy store,
[01:42:55.340 --> 01:42:58.280]   shortly before COVID, I think.
[01:42:59.500 --> 01:43:01.180]   And just thinking like,
[01:43:01.180 --> 01:43:04.380]   there's no way these things will last.
[01:43:04.380 --> 01:43:09.380]   And these things meaning the comedy store, Joe Rogan.
[01:43:09.380 --> 01:43:12.580]   Joe Rogan, the Joe Rogan, like a podcast,
[01:43:12.580 --> 01:43:14.940]   influential podcasting person.
[01:43:14.940 --> 01:43:19.940]   Also a person like in this room, in this space,
[01:43:19.940 --> 01:43:24.420]   the ability to just talk for hours
[01:43:24.420 --> 01:43:26.420]   and lose ourselves in this moment,
[01:43:26.420 --> 01:43:30.740]   it just felt ephemeral somehow, temporary.
[01:43:30.740 --> 01:43:32.780]   And I just wanted to capture that moment somehow.
[01:43:32.780 --> 01:43:34.140]   Like, I don't know.
[01:43:34.140 --> 01:43:36.620]   Sometimes that's where the temptation to take a picture
[01:43:36.620 --> 01:43:39.780]   and that kind of stuff, or record a podcast comes from.
[01:43:39.780 --> 01:43:43.100]   But it just felt like it would be gone forever.
[01:43:43.100 --> 01:43:45.420]   Of course, Joe doesn't seem to have
[01:43:45.420 --> 01:43:48.380]   that kind of sentimental notion at all.
[01:43:48.380 --> 01:43:49.620]   Just wherever you end up,
[01:43:49.620 --> 01:43:51.060]   you just enjoy the shit out of it.
[01:43:51.060 --> 01:43:52.860]   - Right, that's it.
[01:43:52.860 --> 01:43:54.980]   Well, and that's something you have to cultivate.
[01:43:54.980 --> 01:43:57.540]   That's not an easy, the thing you're talking about,
[01:43:57.540 --> 01:44:00.540]   God, have you seen these?
[01:44:00.540 --> 01:44:03.060]   I think the best analogy for what you're talking about,
[01:44:03.060 --> 01:44:05.460]   there's these videos where people give like a sugar cube
[01:44:05.460 --> 01:44:09.380]   to a raccoon, but the raccoons, they wash their food.
[01:44:09.380 --> 01:44:11.300]   So raccoon, or I think it's cotton candy.
[01:44:11.300 --> 01:44:12.660]   They give the raccoon cotton candy,
[01:44:12.660 --> 01:44:14.940]   immediately it washes the cotton candy.
[01:44:14.940 --> 01:44:17.420]   And of course the cotton candy dissolves in the water.
[01:44:17.420 --> 01:44:19.860]   And the raccoon is like, what the fuck?
[01:44:19.860 --> 01:44:24.380]   And the thing you're, that grasping you're talking about,
[01:44:24.380 --> 01:44:26.620]   it's like the raccoon washing the cotton candy.
[01:44:26.620 --> 01:44:29.780]   Like the moment you get into the grasping part,
[01:44:29.780 --> 01:44:34.780]   you paradoxically have pulled yourself out of the moment
[01:44:34.780 --> 01:44:37.820]   that inspired the grasping part.
[01:44:37.820 --> 01:44:40.140]   And that's, some people,
[01:44:40.140 --> 01:44:43.340]   that's the entirety of their lives, trying to record.
[01:44:43.340 --> 01:44:46.420]   I mean, Jesus, man, you ever see people film fireworks
[01:44:46.420 --> 01:44:48.340]   on the 4th of July with their phone?
[01:44:48.340 --> 01:44:52.620]   It's one of the most remarkable aspects of human behavior,
[01:44:52.620 --> 01:44:55.860]   which is like, you know they're not gonna watch
[01:44:55.860 --> 01:44:59.100]   the fireworks on their phone.
[01:44:59.100 --> 01:45:00.580]   Only a lunatic would do that.
[01:45:00.580 --> 01:45:04.100]   Like who's gonna go back and look at fireworks, but.
[01:45:04.100 --> 01:45:06.540]   - So we're also in this position where,
[01:45:06.540 --> 01:45:08.940]   because of podcasting, there is some aspect
[01:45:08.940 --> 01:45:11.860]   where you can record a magical moment in time
[01:45:11.860 --> 01:45:16.020]   together between two people, or even just with a camera.
[01:45:16.020 --> 01:45:19.500]   - So to get back to the lake that you were talking about,
[01:45:19.500 --> 01:45:20.340]   this is emptiness.
[01:45:20.340 --> 01:45:21.260]   So that's emptiness.
[01:45:21.260 --> 01:45:22.420]   That's what's known as emptiness.
[01:45:22.420 --> 01:45:25.300]   The lake is emptiness, and that's what we are.
[01:45:25.300 --> 01:45:26.860]   Emptiness, emptiness.
[01:45:26.860 --> 01:45:29.060]   And that's another thing that gets very confused
[01:45:29.060 --> 01:45:32.500]   in Buddhism, is that emptiness.
[01:45:32.500 --> 01:45:35.900]   And that emptiness is, that's to me,
[01:45:35.900 --> 01:45:39.900]   like when I'm going to do a podcast,
[01:45:39.900 --> 01:45:40.980]   that's where I try to go.
[01:45:40.980 --> 01:45:42.940]   I try to go just in the moment.
[01:45:42.940 --> 01:45:44.420]   No agenda.
[01:45:44.420 --> 01:45:46.220]   You know, if I am nervous or whatever,
[01:45:46.220 --> 01:45:47.620]   okay, I'll feel the nervousness,
[01:45:47.620 --> 01:45:50.160]   but just drop into the moment.
[01:45:50.160 --> 01:45:52.140]   That's when time changes.
[01:45:52.140 --> 01:45:54.420]   And then you look up, hours have passed.
[01:45:54.420 --> 01:45:55.660]   It feels like a second.
[01:45:55.660 --> 01:45:58.980]   And the reason it feels like that is 'cause if you
[01:45:58.980 --> 01:46:01.620]   successfully dropped into the moment,
[01:46:01.620 --> 01:46:04.260]   it's the lake now.
[01:46:04.260 --> 01:46:05.140]   It's emptiness.
[01:46:05.140 --> 01:46:05.980]   It's forever.
[01:46:05.980 --> 01:46:09.180]   For a second, you're like, you're dipping into eternity.
[01:46:09.180 --> 01:46:13.260]   And yeah, it's a very strange thing
[01:46:13.260 --> 01:46:16.620]   to, as part of that, record it.
[01:46:16.620 --> 01:46:18.820]   You know, as part of that, try to like grab it
[01:46:18.820 --> 01:46:21.780]   and put it out there, but it works.
[01:46:21.780 --> 01:46:22.980]   - Can you speak to that,
[01:46:22.980 --> 01:46:26.220]   to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour?
[01:46:26.220 --> 01:46:30.220]   Can you speak about that purple lavender world you go to
[01:46:30.220 --> 01:46:33.100]   when it's most intense and successful for you,
[01:46:33.100 --> 01:46:36.020]   when you feel a sense of lightness and happiness,
[01:46:36.020 --> 01:46:37.540]   when it works?
[01:46:37.540 --> 01:46:38.380]   - Yeah.
[01:46:38.380 --> 01:46:40.820]   - Whether it's your own or a conversation with Joe
[01:46:40.820 --> 01:46:44.880]   in general, or yours is very specific
[01:46:44.880 --> 01:46:45.980]   because it's audio only.
[01:46:45.980 --> 01:46:48.340]   Maybe you can also speak to that.
[01:46:48.340 --> 01:46:51.420]   You might as well be naked or you don't have to.
[01:46:51.420 --> 01:46:52.260]   - Yeah.
[01:46:52.260 --> 01:46:56.000]   - You're free of the conventions of the real world.
[01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:01.060]   - I will never stop thinking it's remarkable.
[01:47:01.060 --> 01:47:04.060]   Like the fact that I'm talking to you, to me,
[01:47:04.060 --> 01:47:05.340]   seems remarkable.
[01:47:05.340 --> 01:47:09.620]   Not just technologically, but I'm talking to someone,
[01:47:09.620 --> 01:47:11.380]   I'm assuming I'm allowed to say this,
[01:47:11.380 --> 01:47:15.620]   who has robot dogs that I've been watching
[01:47:15.620 --> 01:47:18.820]   for years evolve on YouTube.
[01:47:20.060 --> 01:47:22.540]   Arms reach away from one of these things,
[01:47:22.540 --> 01:47:27.540]   and I'm with somebody who is like an acclaimed genius.
[01:47:27.540 --> 01:47:29.940]   So for me, it's like, oh my God,
[01:47:29.940 --> 01:47:33.580]   why do I get to have this conversation?
[01:47:33.580 --> 01:47:36.660]   Why do I get to be here when there'd be like a line,
[01:47:36.660 --> 01:47:39.340]   there'd be a line that were just wrapped and wrapped
[01:47:39.340 --> 01:47:40.580]   and wrapped around this building
[01:47:40.580 --> 01:47:43.260]   of people who'd love a chance to just chat with you.
[01:47:43.260 --> 01:47:45.540]   And so when I, with my podcast,
[01:47:45.540 --> 01:47:49.380]   that's how I feel like when I'm talking to these guests,
[01:47:50.340 --> 01:47:55.260]   who have spent, some of them have spent
[01:47:55.260 --> 01:47:58.780]   their entire lifetime meditating,
[01:47:58.780 --> 01:48:02.340]   studying specific aspects of Buddhism,
[01:48:02.340 --> 01:48:05.260]   or even when I'm with comedians
[01:48:05.260 --> 01:48:08.900]   who I consider to be brilliantly funny.
[01:48:08.900 --> 01:48:12.620]   So for me, it's just like, God, I almost feel like
[01:48:12.620 --> 01:48:17.140]   I've just created some sophisticated trap for cool people
[01:48:17.140 --> 01:48:19.180]   where I get to hang out with them.
[01:48:19.180 --> 01:48:21.780]   - So you're like sitting in the gratitude of it,
[01:48:21.780 --> 01:48:24.260]   just feeling lucky to be there.
[01:48:24.260 --> 01:48:27.420]   - Yeah, feeling lucky and wrestling with imposter syndrome,
[01:48:27.420 --> 01:48:30.340]   trying to like get that part of myself to shut up long enough
[01:48:30.340 --> 01:48:33.420]   so I could be in that moment that we're talking about.
[01:48:33.420 --> 01:48:36.060]   And then I carry that with me.
[01:48:36.060 --> 01:48:38.500]   It's not just like you stop the podcast.
[01:48:38.500 --> 01:48:41.620]   It's like some of the things these people tell me
[01:48:41.620 --> 01:48:45.180]   or some of the ways they are, like it becomes part of me.
[01:48:45.180 --> 01:48:47.540]   And then I get to have a life
[01:48:47.540 --> 01:48:52.060]   where this thing that they gave me is in me forever.
[01:48:52.060 --> 01:48:54.420]   And so yeah, it's, there's--
[01:48:54.420 --> 01:48:56.940]   - Yeah, it's cool how conversation can just,
[01:48:56.940 --> 01:49:01.060]   a few sentences can change the direction of your life.
[01:49:01.060 --> 01:49:02.820]   If you're listening, if you're there
[01:49:02.820 --> 01:49:06.660]   to be transformed by the words, they will do the work.
[01:49:06.660 --> 01:49:09.900]   And it's the full mix of it.
[01:49:09.900 --> 01:49:14.180]   It's usually when, if you look up to somebody,
[01:49:14.180 --> 01:49:17.020]   and it's true for me at least,
[01:49:17.020 --> 01:49:19.220]   I think it is for you that you start to look up
[01:49:19.220 --> 01:49:20.980]   to basically everybody you talk to.
[01:49:20.980 --> 01:49:23.780]   - Yes, yes, good sign.
[01:49:23.780 --> 01:49:24.980]   That's a good sign.
[01:49:24.980 --> 01:49:26.900]   God forbid it goes the other way.
[01:49:26.900 --> 01:49:28.100]   You're in trouble.
[01:49:28.100 --> 01:49:30.580]   If all of a sudden you start looking down on people,
[01:49:30.580 --> 01:49:34.300]   because whatever crazy metric you're using,
[01:49:34.300 --> 01:49:35.940]   ooh, that would freak me out.
[01:49:35.940 --> 01:49:38.180]   I do feel like that's a quality of getting older.
[01:49:38.180 --> 01:49:39.980]   When I was younger, I really, like,
[01:49:39.980 --> 01:49:41.980]   I thought I was so smart.
[01:49:41.980 --> 01:49:43.380]   Like I thought I had it all figured out.
[01:49:43.380 --> 01:49:44.460]   - Oh really, so you're going,
[01:49:44.460 --> 01:49:47.780]   your ego is just going, taking a nosedive.
[01:49:47.780 --> 01:49:50.820]   - I would like to say it's my ego taking a nosedive.
[01:49:50.820 --> 01:49:52.380]   Me and my friend talk about it a bunch.
[01:49:52.380 --> 01:49:55.940]   We've just always associated it with like doing acid
[01:49:55.940 --> 01:49:57.620]   for two decades straight.
[01:49:57.620 --> 01:50:00.740]   Like I'm gonna just assume I'm just like slowly
[01:50:00.740 --> 01:50:02.940]   like spiraling into senility, you know?
[01:50:02.940 --> 01:50:06.780]   Like I'm just like, all the confidence,
[01:50:06.780 --> 01:50:08.860]   all the like, oh, the certainty when you're having,
[01:50:08.860 --> 01:50:11.420]   like in college, you're having the great,
[01:50:11.420 --> 01:50:16.420]   oh, like, you know, you feel like you're a representative
[01:50:16.420 --> 01:50:19.280]   of Camus or some shit, you know what I mean?
[01:50:19.280 --> 01:50:21.500]   You read the myth of Sisyphus and now you like it.
[01:50:21.500 --> 01:50:24.900]   No, all existentialism and your certainty
[01:50:24.900 --> 01:50:27.660]   in regards to it is embarrassing,
[01:50:27.660 --> 01:50:29.680]   but you don't see it in that way.
[01:50:29.680 --> 01:50:30.620]   You just feel certain.
[01:50:30.620 --> 01:50:33.700]   And then that certainty, it just starts like,
[01:50:33.700 --> 01:50:35.900]   it starts crumbling a little bit.
[01:50:35.900 --> 01:50:37.820]   And then, yeah.
[01:50:37.820 --> 01:50:41.420]   - You know, I get to actually intensely experience
[01:50:41.420 --> 01:50:43.940]   that certainty in many communities,
[01:50:43.940 --> 01:50:46.380]   but one in cryptocurrency.
[01:50:46.380 --> 01:50:50.020]   Young folks with the certainty that this technology
[01:50:50.020 --> 01:50:51.780]   would transform the world.
[01:50:51.780 --> 01:50:54.820]   And I mean, this is almost one of the big communities
[01:50:54.820 --> 01:50:57.780]   of the modern era where they believe
[01:50:57.780 --> 01:51:00.380]   that this will really solve so many of the problems
[01:51:00.380 --> 01:51:03.420]   of the world and they believe in it very intensely.
[01:51:03.420 --> 01:51:06.760]   And aside from the technology and the details of the thing,
[01:51:06.760 --> 01:51:09.940]   all I see is the certainty and the passion in their eyes.
[01:51:09.940 --> 01:51:11.060]   They'll stop me.
[01:51:11.060 --> 01:51:13.620]   Let me explain you.
[01:51:13.620 --> 01:51:16.180]   Let me just give me a chance to tell you
[01:51:16.180 --> 01:51:19.100]   why this thing is extremely powerful.
[01:51:19.100 --> 01:51:21.700]   And I just get to enjoy the glow of that
[01:51:21.700 --> 01:51:26.140]   'cause it's like, wow, I miss having that certainty
[01:51:26.140 --> 01:51:27.540]   about anything.
[01:51:27.540 --> 01:51:29.740]   It's probably Camus for me too.
[01:51:29.740 --> 01:51:32.100]   But when I was younger, it's like,
[01:51:32.100 --> 01:51:37.100]   only I deeply understand the relationship of man
[01:51:37.100 --> 01:51:40.320]   to his mortality.
[01:51:40.320 --> 01:51:42.360]   And I understood that most deeply, I think,
[01:51:42.360 --> 01:51:44.480]   when I was like 16 or 17.
[01:51:44.480 --> 01:51:48.280]   And I am the representative of the human condition.
[01:51:48.280 --> 01:51:51.320]   And all these adults with their busyness,
[01:51:51.320 --> 01:51:53.360]   day-to-day life and their concerns,
[01:51:53.360 --> 01:51:56.680]   they don't deeply understand what I understand,
[01:51:56.680 --> 01:51:58.560]   which is the only thing that matters
[01:51:59.720 --> 01:52:03.820]   is the absurdity of the human condition.
[01:52:03.820 --> 01:52:05.340]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:52:05.340 --> 01:52:07.580]   - And let me quote you some Dostoevsky.
[01:52:07.580 --> 01:52:10.260]   - Oh boy, and you speak Russian?
[01:52:10.260 --> 01:52:11.100]   - Yes, I speak Russian.
[01:52:11.100 --> 01:52:13.660]   - So you've read the Brothers Karamazov in Russian?
[01:52:13.660 --> 01:52:15.820]   - Unfortunately, I have to admit
[01:52:15.820 --> 01:52:20.480]   that I read all of Dostoevsky in English.
[01:52:20.480 --> 01:52:25.500]   I came to this country when I was 13
[01:52:25.500 --> 01:52:26.580]   and at least don't remember.
[01:52:26.580 --> 01:52:31.080]   We read a lot, but we read Tolstoy, Pushkin,
[01:52:31.080 --> 01:52:34.080]   a lot of the Russian literature, but it was in Russian.
[01:52:34.080 --> 01:52:35.640]   But I don't remember reading Dostoevsky.
[01:52:35.640 --> 01:52:37.600]   I wonder at which point
[01:52:37.600 --> 01:52:41.360]   does the Russian education system give you Dostoevsky?
[01:52:41.360 --> 01:52:43.240]   'Cause it's pretty heavy stuff.
[01:52:43.240 --> 01:52:44.760]   - Second grade.
[01:52:44.760 --> 01:52:45.840]   Probably the second grade.
[01:52:45.840 --> 01:52:46.920]   Russians are intense.
[01:52:46.920 --> 01:52:48.400]   - I don't remember, yeah, they are.
[01:52:48.400 --> 01:52:50.200]   They very much are.
[01:52:50.200 --> 01:52:51.560]   I don't remember reading Dostoevsky.
[01:52:51.560 --> 01:52:56.120]   But I did Tangent upon a Tangent upon a Tangent.
[01:52:56.120 --> 01:52:59.320]   I traveled to Paris recently on the way to Ukraine
[01:52:59.320 --> 01:53:04.880]   and was scheduled to talk to Richard Pivier
[01:53:04.880 --> 01:53:09.880]   and this pair that translate Dostoevsky, Tolstoy,
[01:53:09.880 --> 01:53:13.060]   just this famous pair that translate
[01:53:13.060 --> 01:53:15.080]   most of Russian literature to English.
[01:53:15.080 --> 01:53:20.080]   And I was planning to have a sequence of five, 10,
[01:53:20.080 --> 01:53:23.040]   15 hour conversation with them about the different details
[01:53:23.040 --> 01:53:25.480]   of all the translations and so on.
[01:53:25.480 --> 01:53:28.640]   I just found myself in a very dark place mentally
[01:53:28.640 --> 01:53:31.120]   where I couldn't think about podcasts or anything like that.
[01:53:31.120 --> 01:53:32.800]   It caught me off guard.
[01:53:32.800 --> 01:53:36.120]   So I went to Paris and just laid there for a day.
[01:53:36.120 --> 01:53:39.640]   Not, just being stressed about Ukraine
[01:53:39.640 --> 01:53:40.880]   and all those kinds of things.
[01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:44.840]   But I'm still, the act of translation
[01:53:44.840 --> 01:53:48.320]   is such a fascinating way to approach
[01:53:48.320 --> 01:53:51.560]   some of the deepest questions that this literature raises,
[01:53:51.560 --> 01:53:56.460]   which is like, how do I capture the essence of a sentence
[01:53:56.460 --> 01:53:58.440]   that has so much power and translate it
[01:53:58.440 --> 01:53:59.800]   into another language?
[01:53:59.800 --> 01:54:01.840]   That act is actually really, really interesting.
[01:54:01.840 --> 01:54:05.520]   And there, I found with my conversations with them,
[01:54:05.520 --> 01:54:09.240]   they've really thought through this stuff.
[01:54:09.240 --> 01:54:10.720]   It's not just about language,
[01:54:10.720 --> 01:54:12.640]   it's about the ideas in those books.
[01:54:12.640 --> 01:54:15.920]   That also really makes me sad
[01:54:15.920 --> 01:54:18.240]   because I wonder how much is lost in translation.
[01:54:18.880 --> 01:54:22.600]   Currently, so when I was in Ukraine,
[01:54:22.600 --> 01:54:26.520]   I talked to a lot of, like half the conversations I had
[01:54:26.520 --> 01:54:29.280]   on the record were in Russian.
[01:54:29.280 --> 01:54:34.280]   And basically, 100% of the record were in Russian
[01:54:34.280 --> 01:54:36.300]   versus in English.
[01:54:36.300 --> 01:54:40.880]   And just so much is lost in those languages.
[01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:42.840]   And I'm now struggling
[01:54:42.840 --> 01:54:45.760]   because I'm launching a Russian channel
[01:54:45.760 --> 01:54:49.320]   where there'll be a Russian overdub of Duncan.
[01:54:49.320 --> 01:54:50.760]   - Wow.
[01:54:50.760 --> 01:54:53.360]   - Your wow will now be translated into Russian.
[01:54:53.360 --> 01:54:54.700]   - What's Russian wow?
[01:54:54.700 --> 01:54:57.520]   - It'll just be wow, probably.
[01:54:57.520 --> 01:54:59.740]   I'm so sorry for the difficulties
[01:54:59.740 --> 01:55:01.160]   of having to translate wow.
[01:55:01.160 --> 01:55:04.440]   Usually, probably with wow, they'll leave it un-overdubbed
[01:55:04.440 --> 01:55:06.360]   because people will understand exactly what you mean.
[01:55:06.360 --> 01:55:09.160]   But that's an art form, and it's a weird art form.
[01:55:09.160 --> 01:55:10.000]   - Yeah.
[01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:14.560]   - It's like, how do you capture the chemistry,
[01:55:15.280 --> 01:55:20.280]   the excitement, the, I don't know, maybe the humor,
[01:55:20.280 --> 01:55:25.600]   the implied kind of wit.
[01:55:25.600 --> 01:55:28.760]   I don't know, there's just layers of complexity in language
[01:55:28.760 --> 01:55:30.640]   that it's very difficult to capture.
[01:55:30.640 --> 01:55:31.480]   - Yeah.
[01:55:31.480 --> 01:55:33.480]   - And I wonder how, it is sad for me
[01:55:33.480 --> 01:55:36.080]   'cause I know Russian, how much is lost in translation.
[01:55:36.080 --> 01:55:39.640]   And the same, there's a brewing conflict
[01:55:39.640 --> 01:55:41.480]   and tension with China now.
[01:55:41.480 --> 01:55:43.440]   And so much is lost in the translation
[01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:44.480]   between those languages.
[01:55:44.480 --> 01:55:46.040]   - Oh my God, yeah.
[01:55:46.040 --> 01:55:48.280]   - And cultures, the entire,
[01:55:48.280 --> 01:55:51.840]   the music of the people is completely lost
[01:55:51.840 --> 01:55:53.280]   because we don't know the language,
[01:55:53.280 --> 01:55:54.280]   or most of us don't know the language.
[01:55:54.280 --> 01:55:55.800]   - Yeah, how much of the conflict
[01:55:55.800 --> 01:55:58.080]   is just problems in translation?
[01:55:58.080 --> 01:56:00.760]   How much of all these problems that we're having
[01:56:00.760 --> 01:56:02.680]   are just the alien sense of this or that?
[01:56:02.680 --> 01:56:04.480]   It's just as simple as that.
[01:56:04.480 --> 01:56:09.480]   Words are getting just a tiny warp away from the intent.
[01:56:13.320 --> 01:56:16.760]   If when we both speak the same language,
[01:56:16.760 --> 01:56:20.600]   we can still say something that offends someone
[01:56:20.600 --> 01:56:23.040]   when you never intended that at all,
[01:56:23.040 --> 01:56:25.360]   how much more so when,
[01:56:25.360 --> 01:56:29.120]   not only is it a completely different sound,
[01:56:29.120 --> 01:56:31.880]   but the script itself is different.
[01:56:31.880 --> 01:56:36.920]   The Russian writing, is it called Cyrillic?
[01:56:36.920 --> 01:56:37.760]   Or what's the name?
[01:56:37.760 --> 01:56:38.600]   - Yeah, Cyrillic.
[01:56:38.600 --> 01:56:39.600]   - Cyrillic.
[01:56:39.600 --> 01:56:41.200]   And I don't know the name for Chinese writing,
[01:56:41.200 --> 01:56:46.200]   but it's a continuum that gets weirder and weirder looking.
[01:56:46.200 --> 01:56:49.680]   So yeah, I'm sure-
[01:56:49.680 --> 01:56:51.600]   - Or less weird, depending on your perspective.
[01:56:51.600 --> 01:56:54.640]   - Yeah, I'm sure, depending on where you're at.
[01:56:54.640 --> 01:56:56.360]   I'm definitely, I'm about the farthest thing
[01:56:56.360 --> 01:56:58.880]   from a polyglot as there could be, man.
[01:56:58.880 --> 01:57:02.640]   But I'll tell you, at one point when I was getting
[01:57:02.640 --> 01:57:04.640]   fascinated by Dostoevsky,
[01:57:04.640 --> 01:57:07.240]   I did have this very transient fantasy
[01:57:07.240 --> 01:57:10.840]   about learning Russian so that I could understand
[01:57:10.840 --> 01:57:12.400]   the difference in-
[01:57:12.400 --> 01:57:14.800]   - You were 17, 18 at the time.
[01:57:14.800 --> 01:57:15.640]   - College.
[01:57:15.640 --> 01:57:16.480]   - Yeah, college.
[01:57:16.480 --> 01:57:18.920]   - Yeah, "Brothers Karamazov" lost in that book.
[01:57:18.920 --> 01:57:23.360]   Just like, oh God, so in love with it.
[01:57:23.360 --> 01:57:27.240]   - But there's definitely,
[01:57:27.240 --> 01:57:31.840]   Ukraine, and this is what a lot of the war is about,
[01:57:31.840 --> 01:57:35.600]   is saying Ukraine and Russia are not the same people.
[01:57:35.600 --> 01:57:37.080]   There's a strong culture in Ukraine,
[01:57:37.080 --> 01:57:38.880]   there's a strong culture in Russia.
[01:57:38.880 --> 01:57:41.680]   But I know because that's where my family's from,
[01:57:41.680 --> 01:57:45.960]   there is a fascinating, strong culture.
[01:57:45.960 --> 01:57:50.160]   But there's such strong cultures everywhere else too.
[01:57:50.160 --> 01:57:52.880]   Ireland has a culture, Scotland has a culture.
[01:57:52.880 --> 01:57:57.280]   Even on a tiny island, you just have these subcultures
[01:57:57.280 --> 01:57:59.840]   that are more powerful than anything
[01:57:59.840 --> 01:58:01.400]   that exists in human history.
[01:58:01.400 --> 01:58:05.520]   Like the Bronx, I don't know, like Brooklyn.
[01:58:05.520 --> 01:58:07.680]   Like different parts of New York have a certain culture.
[01:58:07.680 --> 01:58:09.200]   And then New York versus LA.
[01:58:09.200 --> 01:58:12.840]   And then certain places are looking for their culture.
[01:58:12.840 --> 01:58:17.560]   Like I think Austin, I don't know what Austin is.
[01:58:17.560 --> 01:58:18.640]   I don't think anyone knows.
[01:58:18.640 --> 01:58:21.640]   There's a traditional Austin,
[01:58:21.640 --> 01:58:23.560]   and then it's evolving constantly.
[01:58:23.560 --> 01:58:26.400]   Same with Boston, a place I spent a lot of time.
[01:58:26.400 --> 01:58:27.800]   There's a traditional Boston,
[01:58:27.800 --> 01:58:30.600]   and now it's evolving with the different,
[01:58:30.600 --> 01:58:33.480]   younger people coming from the university and staying,
[01:58:33.480 --> 01:58:35.040]   and all of that is evolving.
[01:58:35.040 --> 01:58:37.200]   But underneath it, there's a core,
[01:58:37.200 --> 01:58:40.160]   like the American ideal of the value of the individual,
[01:58:40.160 --> 01:58:42.760]   the value of freedom, of freedom of speech,
[01:58:42.760 --> 01:58:45.680]   all those kinds of things, that permeates all of that.
[01:58:45.680 --> 01:58:49.760]   And the same thing in the history of World War II
[01:58:49.760 --> 01:58:54.520]   permeates Ukraine and Russia, a lot of parts of Europe,
[01:58:54.520 --> 01:58:57.320]   the memories of all that suffering, destruction,
[01:58:57.320 --> 01:58:59.280]   the broken promises of governments,
[01:58:59.280 --> 01:59:04.280]   and the occupier versus the liberator,
[01:59:04.280 --> 01:59:06.000]   all that kind of stuff.
[01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.080]   All that permeates the culture.
[01:59:08.080 --> 01:59:12.160]   That affects how cynical or optimistic you are,
[01:59:12.160 --> 01:59:16.200]   or how much you appreciate material possessions
[01:59:16.200 --> 01:59:19.480]   versus human connection, all that kind of stuff.
[01:59:19.480 --> 01:59:23.800]   - Yeah, I mean, this is, like, talk about absurdity.
[01:59:23.800 --> 01:59:26.160]   I mean, this is, war is, like,
[01:59:26.160 --> 01:59:28.400]   it's what absurdity looks like.
[01:59:28.400 --> 01:59:32.400]   It's some kind of organized madness.
[01:59:32.400 --> 01:59:33.480]   None of it makes sense.
[01:59:33.480 --> 01:59:35.880]   Like, all of it, like, it's just,
[01:59:35.880 --> 01:59:37.280]   none of it makes sense.
[01:59:37.280 --> 01:59:38.560]   But it does, but it doesn't.
[01:59:38.560 --> 01:59:40.280]   I mean, obviously, you're defending yourself,
[01:59:40.280 --> 01:59:43.760]   or you're taking orders that if you don't take,
[01:59:43.760 --> 01:59:45.240]   you're going to jail.
[01:59:45.240 --> 01:59:47.560]   And so, or somewhere in between,
[01:59:47.560 --> 01:59:50.400]   you know, the classic story about this,
[01:59:50.400 --> 01:59:53.560]   maybe it's a bullshit myth about World War II.
[01:59:53.560 --> 01:59:55.720]   I'm sure everyone's heard it, 'cause it comes up.
[01:59:55.720 --> 02:00:00.720]   You know, it's Christmas Eve, and they have a ceasefire.
[02:00:00.720 --> 02:00:03.640]   And then I think they played soccer,
[02:00:03.640 --> 02:00:05.000]   they sing Christmas songs,
[02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:08.800]   and then they had to force them into fighting again.
[02:00:08.800 --> 02:00:11.400]   And so, when those moments happen,
[02:00:11.400 --> 02:00:15.320]   are you familiar with Hakeem Bey?
[02:00:15.320 --> 02:00:16.880]   He's a controversial figure.
[02:00:16.880 --> 02:00:19.280]   Sadly, like, he, like, I think he was, like,
[02:00:19.280 --> 02:00:21.680]   I'm not going to defame him,
[02:00:21.680 --> 02:00:24.000]   because I haven't, like, researched it correctly,
[02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:25.040]   but some people have said shit.
[02:00:25.040 --> 02:00:27.360]   But since I don't know the reference, I'm not going to.
[02:00:27.360 --> 02:00:30.800]   But regardless, I mean, you know, look,
[02:00:30.800 --> 02:00:32.920]   I'm sorry, but Bill Cosby was funny.
[02:00:32.920 --> 02:00:36.520]   You know, like, that's a funny comedian,
[02:00:36.520 --> 02:00:40.160]   but you know, the other stuff.
[02:00:40.160 --> 02:00:43.560]   Michael Jackson, he could fucking dance.
[02:00:43.560 --> 02:00:44.400]   - And sing.
[02:00:44.400 --> 02:00:46.240]   - And sing, but there's some other stuff.
[02:00:46.240 --> 02:00:50.200]   But regardless, Hakeem Bey came up with the idea
[02:00:50.200 --> 02:00:53.880]   of something called a temporary autonomous zone,
[02:00:53.880 --> 02:00:58.760]   which is that within a structure, a cultural structure,
[02:00:58.760 --> 02:01:03.760]   a temporary bubble of freedom will appear
[02:01:03.760 --> 02:01:09.200]   that by its nature gets sort of popped by the bigger bubble,
[02:01:09.200 --> 02:01:13.880]   or it runs out of resources, generally, is what happens.
[02:01:13.880 --> 02:01:17.160]   So, these things will appear just out of the blue
[02:01:17.160 --> 02:01:22.160]   that it's almost like, imagine if, like, on Earth,
[02:01:22.160 --> 02:01:25.120]   in some tiny little bit of Earth,
[02:01:25.120 --> 02:01:28.960]   the gravitational field was reduced by some percentage,
[02:01:28.960 --> 02:01:31.360]   and all of a sudden you could jump really high or whatever,
[02:01:31.360 --> 02:01:32.200]   but it wouldn't last.
[02:01:32.200 --> 02:01:35.120]   It's like that culturally, all the restrictions
[02:01:35.120 --> 02:01:37.280]   and the darkness and the heaviness and all of it.
[02:01:37.280 --> 02:01:40.200]   For a second, somehow this bubble appears
[02:01:40.200 --> 02:01:45.200]   where humans come together as the hippie ideal,
[02:01:45.200 --> 02:01:50.080]   brothers, sisters, just humans, Earthlings,
[02:01:50.080 --> 02:01:55.080]   instead of American, Chinese, Russian, Ukrainian,
[02:01:55.640 --> 02:01:58.440]   temporary autonomous zone, it gets crushed
[02:01:58.440 --> 02:02:01.360]   by the default reality that it was appearing in,
[02:02:01.360 --> 02:02:06.360]   but somehow within that space, you witness the possibility,
[02:02:06.360 --> 02:02:10.040]   the possibility, the frustrating possibility
[02:02:10.040 --> 02:02:14.760]   that anyone who's thought about humanity
[02:02:14.760 --> 02:02:16.600]   knows this possibility, which is like,
[02:02:16.600 --> 02:02:18.640]   it seems like we can just get along.
[02:02:18.640 --> 02:02:21.440]   Like, it does seem like we're pretty much the same thing,
[02:02:21.440 --> 02:02:23.640]   and that we can just get along.
[02:02:23.640 --> 02:02:26.720]   - Those moments are really rare.
[02:02:26.720 --> 02:02:27.560]   It's sad.
[02:02:27.560 --> 02:02:30.040]   I talked to a lot of soldiers, a lot of people
[02:02:30.040 --> 02:02:34.200]   that were, suffered through the different aspects
[02:02:34.200 --> 02:02:39.200]   of that war, and there's an information war
[02:02:39.200 --> 02:02:44.240]   that convinces each side that the other
[02:02:44.240 --> 02:02:47.380]   is not just the enemy, but less than human.
[02:02:47.380 --> 02:02:48.220]   - Right.
[02:02:48.220 --> 02:02:52.160]   - So there's a real hatred towards the other side.
[02:02:52.160 --> 02:02:53.160]   - Yeah.
[02:02:53.160 --> 02:02:56.720]   - And those kind of little moments where you realize,
[02:02:56.720 --> 02:03:00.160]   oh, they're human like me.
[02:03:00.160 --> 02:03:01.000]   - Yeah.
[02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.460]   - And not just like human like me,
[02:03:03.460 --> 02:03:06.220]   but they have the same values as me.
[02:03:06.220 --> 02:03:13.960]   This woman who was a really respected soldier,
[02:03:13.960 --> 02:03:18.560]   she specializes in anti-tank missiles,
[02:03:18.560 --> 02:03:23.120]   and she's very kind of, very pragmatic,
[02:03:23.120 --> 02:03:26.760]   very the enemy is the enemy, we'll have to destroy the enemy
[02:03:26.760 --> 02:03:29.680]   and saying like, there's no compassion towards the enemy,
[02:03:29.680 --> 02:03:32.660]   they're not human, they're less than human.
[02:03:32.660 --> 02:03:38.600]   But she said there was a moment when she remembers
[02:03:38.600 --> 02:03:43.600]   an enemy soldier in a tank took a risk
[02:03:43.600 --> 02:03:47.200]   to save a fellow soldier, and that risk was really stupid
[02:03:47.200 --> 02:03:50.200]   because he was facing he was going to get destroyed.
[02:03:50.200 --> 02:03:55.200]   And then she said that she tried to shoot a rocket
[02:03:55.200 --> 02:03:59.960]   at that tank and she missed.
[02:03:59.960 --> 02:04:02.360]   And then she later went home and she couldn't sleep
[02:04:02.360 --> 02:04:05.200]   that she missed, how could she screw that up?
[02:04:05.200 --> 02:04:08.360]   But then she realized that actually,
[02:04:08.360 --> 02:04:10.800]   she missed, maybe she missed on purpose.
[02:04:10.800 --> 02:04:11.640]   - Yeah.
[02:04:11.640 --> 02:04:16.640]   - Because she realized that that man, just like she is,
[02:04:16.860 --> 02:04:21.260]   was a hero, just like she strives to be.
[02:04:21.260 --> 02:04:24.960]   They were both heroes, defending their own.
[02:04:24.960 --> 02:04:28.000]   And in that way, he was just like her.
[02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:29.920]   She was like, that's the only time I remember
[02:04:29.920 --> 02:04:33.320]   during this war ever feeling like this is another human
[02:04:33.320 --> 02:04:36.580]   being, but that was a very brief moment for her.
[02:04:36.580 --> 02:04:39.440]   And I just hear that over and over and over again,
[02:04:39.440 --> 02:04:44.440]   these romantic notions we have of we're one,
[02:04:44.500 --> 02:04:46.360]   that we're all just human.
[02:04:46.360 --> 02:04:50.800]   Unfortunately, during war, those notions are rare.
[02:04:50.800 --> 02:04:51.800]   And it's quite sad.
[02:04:51.800 --> 02:04:55.040]   And war, in a certain way, really destroys those notions.
[02:04:55.040 --> 02:04:59.560]   And one of the saddest things is it destroys it,
[02:04:59.560 --> 02:05:05.480]   at least from what I see, potentially for generations.
[02:05:05.480 --> 02:05:06.300]   - Oh, yeah.
[02:05:06.300 --> 02:05:08.260]   - Not just for those people for the rest of their life,
[02:05:08.260 --> 02:05:12.160]   but for their children, their children's children.
[02:05:12.160 --> 02:05:15.060]   The hatred, I mean, I ask that question
[02:05:15.060 --> 02:05:16.760]   of basically everyone, which is,
[02:05:16.760 --> 02:05:20.740]   will you ever forgive, asking of Ukrainians,
[02:05:20.740 --> 02:05:22.900]   will you ever forgive the Russians?
[02:05:22.900 --> 02:05:27.100]   Will, do you have hate in your heart towards the Russians?
[02:05:27.100 --> 02:05:32.100]   Or do you have love for a fellow human being?
[02:05:32.100 --> 02:05:36.620]   And there's different ways that people struggle with that,
[02:05:36.620 --> 02:05:40.700]   different people, they saw that, they saw the love,
[02:05:40.700 --> 02:05:43.520]   they saw the hate with their known heart,
[02:05:43.520 --> 02:05:45.440]   and they struggle with the hate they have,
[02:05:45.440 --> 02:05:47.160]   and they know they can overcome it
[02:05:47.160 --> 02:05:50.880]   in a period of weeks and months after the war is over.
[02:05:50.880 --> 02:05:54.960]   But some people said, no, this hate that showed up
[02:05:54.960 --> 02:05:57.880]   in February when the war started will be with me forever.
[02:05:57.880 --> 02:06:00.260]   - Well, yeah, their kids got killed.
[02:06:00.260 --> 02:06:02.200]   What the fuck are you gonna do about that?
[02:06:02.200 --> 02:06:03.800]   Like, I don't care.
[02:06:03.800 --> 02:06:06.240]   I've got aphorisms and cute little stories
[02:06:06.240 --> 02:06:07.940]   about you're still in prison
[02:06:07.940 --> 02:06:10.200]   if you hate your former captors.
[02:06:10.200 --> 02:06:14.280]   But man, I gotta tell you, if somebody hurt my kids,
[02:06:14.280 --> 02:06:15.200]   I'm not coming back.
[02:06:15.200 --> 02:06:19.360]   I mean, there's no amount, at least right now
[02:06:19.360 --> 02:06:23.640]   in my approximation, of spiritual literature,
[02:06:23.640 --> 02:06:26.720]   meditation, or anything that I can really think of
[02:06:26.720 --> 02:06:31.240]   that is going to give me that kind of space.
[02:06:31.240 --> 02:06:34.120]   Like, I think I imagine in the same way,
[02:06:34.120 --> 02:06:39.120]   I imagine I could probably run a marathon eventually,
[02:06:39.120 --> 02:06:42.720]   but do I think I'm ever gonna do that?
[02:06:42.720 --> 02:06:44.160]   That times a million.
[02:06:44.160 --> 02:06:47.960]   So man, all we can do is have compassion for their hate,
[02:06:47.960 --> 02:06:52.000]   because it's like, what are you gonna say?
[02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:53.600]   What are you gonna say to someone like that?
[02:06:53.600 --> 02:06:58.600]   Oh, oh, you know, for the sake of humanity, let it go.
[02:06:58.600 --> 02:07:00.440]   It was just your kids.
[02:07:00.440 --> 02:07:02.600]   It was just something you loved
[02:07:02.600 --> 02:07:05.360]   more than anything in the world.
[02:07:05.360 --> 02:07:07.120]   You'll never be okay again.
[02:07:07.120 --> 02:07:09.440]   You're gonna have nightmares for the rest of your life,
[02:07:09.440 --> 02:07:11.040]   but you should forgive.
[02:07:11.040 --> 02:07:11.880]   No.
[02:07:11.880 --> 02:07:13.040]   - Well, there is truth in the fact
[02:07:13.040 --> 02:07:15.840]   that forgiveness is the way to let go, right?
[02:07:15.840 --> 02:07:18.080]   But that truth is not that you,
[02:07:18.080 --> 02:07:20.560]   (laughs)
[02:07:20.560 --> 02:07:22.040]   fuck you, right?
[02:07:22.040 --> 02:07:23.480]   This is-
[02:07:23.480 --> 02:07:25.720]   - Which is why it's not your job to say that.
[02:07:25.720 --> 02:07:27.520]   You know, it's not that you're doing that.
[02:07:27.520 --> 02:07:28.560]   I know you're not.
[02:07:28.560 --> 02:07:31.680]   But you know, the problem with people like me,
[02:07:31.680 --> 02:07:34.800]   early phase, you could get this stupid missionary thing
[02:07:34.800 --> 02:07:37.280]   going where you like start trying to like,
[02:07:37.280 --> 02:07:40.840]   I don't know, like proselytize ideals
[02:07:40.840 --> 02:07:42.720]   that you might be incapable of, you know?
[02:07:42.720 --> 02:07:46.720]   And I just hearing it, you know, that's the,
[02:07:46.720 --> 02:07:49.560]   man, I saw this, the thing that like,
[02:07:49.560 --> 02:07:50.400]   I mean, I've seen a lot,
[02:07:50.400 --> 02:07:51.720]   all of us have by now probably,
[02:07:51.720 --> 02:07:53.440]   if you're online, I've seen,
[02:07:53.440 --> 02:07:54.960]   and you just saw it in person.
[02:07:54.960 --> 02:07:58.800]   Like we've seen things that are just horrific.
[02:07:58.800 --> 02:08:03.480]   But as a dad, man, I just saw this clip of this kid
[02:08:03.480 --> 02:08:08.280]   around the age of my kid, walking by himself,
[02:08:08.280 --> 02:08:11.140]   these refugees, just walking by himself,
[02:08:11.140 --> 02:08:13.360]   the look on his face.
[02:08:13.360 --> 02:08:15.800]   I can't explain the look on his face.
[02:08:15.800 --> 02:08:17.080]   I don't know what happened to his parents.
[02:08:17.080 --> 02:08:18.380]   I don't know what happened.
[02:08:18.380 --> 02:08:21.360]   Like, it was so upsetting.
[02:08:21.360 --> 02:08:23.600]   Like even thinking about it now, it's just like, fuck,
[02:08:23.600 --> 02:08:24.720]   that could have been my kid.
[02:08:24.720 --> 02:08:26.880]   That could have been my kid, you know?
[02:08:26.880 --> 02:08:29.360]   So knowing that kind of that,
[02:08:30.560 --> 02:08:33.520]   that kid's got to grow up now.
[02:08:33.520 --> 02:08:36.240]   I don't know, is the kid's parents still there?
[02:08:36.240 --> 02:08:41.240]   And that's just one of countless orphans out there now.
[02:08:41.240 --> 02:08:45.240]   - So what you have this hate,
[02:08:45.240 --> 02:08:47.900]   and the question is how to direct it.
[02:08:47.900 --> 02:08:50.520]   Because the choice is you can direct it
[02:08:50.520 --> 02:08:53.360]   towards the politicians that started the war.
[02:08:53.360 --> 02:08:55.120]   You can direct it towards the soldiers
[02:08:55.120 --> 02:08:56.760]   that are doing the killing.
[02:08:56.760 --> 02:08:59.520]   Or you can direct it towards an entire group of people.
[02:09:00.520 --> 02:09:01.600]   And that's the struggle,
[02:09:01.600 --> 02:09:06.120]   because hate slowly grows to where you don't just hate
[02:09:06.120 --> 02:09:11.640]   the soldiers, you don't just hate the leaders,
[02:09:11.640 --> 02:09:14.240]   you hate all Russians.
[02:09:14.240 --> 02:09:17.360]   Because they're all equally evil,
[02:09:17.360 --> 02:09:20.040]   because the ones that aren't doing the fighting
[02:09:20.040 --> 02:09:21.720]   are staying quiet.
[02:09:21.720 --> 02:09:23.680]   And I'm sure the same kind of stories
[02:09:23.680 --> 02:09:25.480]   are happening on the other side.
[02:09:25.480 --> 02:09:30.120]   And so there is that hate,
[02:09:31.040 --> 02:09:36.040]   is one that is deeply human.
[02:09:36.040 --> 02:09:42.500]   But you wonder for your own future,
[02:09:42.500 --> 02:09:45.460]   for your own home, for building your own community,
[02:09:45.460 --> 02:09:47.640]   for building your own country,
[02:09:47.640 --> 02:09:52.640]   how does that hate morph over the weeks and months and years?
[02:09:52.640 --> 02:09:54.560]   Not into forgiveness,
[02:09:54.560 --> 02:09:56.200]   but into something that's productive,
[02:09:56.200 --> 02:09:57.800]   that doesn't destroy you.
[02:09:57.800 --> 02:09:59.520]   Because hate does destroy.
[02:09:59.520 --> 02:10:04.520]   - That's the dark aspect of a rocket
[02:10:04.520 --> 02:10:08.680]   that hits a building and kills hundreds of people.
[02:10:08.680 --> 02:10:13.040]   The worst effect of that rocket
[02:10:13.040 --> 02:10:20.480]   is the hate in the hearts of the loved ones
[02:10:20.480 --> 02:10:23.920]   to the people that were in that building.
[02:10:23.920 --> 02:10:28.920]   That hate is a torture over a period of years.
[02:10:29.400 --> 02:10:30.240]   - Yep.
[02:10:30.240 --> 02:10:32.520]   - And that it doesn't just torture
[02:10:32.520 --> 02:10:36.360]   by having that psychological burden and trauma,
[02:10:36.360 --> 02:10:39.600]   it also tortures 'cause it destroys your life.
[02:10:39.600 --> 02:10:42.440]   It prevents you from being able to enjoy your life
[02:10:42.440 --> 02:10:44.400]   to the fullest.
[02:10:44.400 --> 02:10:47.680]   It prevents you from being able to flourish
[02:10:47.680 --> 02:10:51.040]   as a human being, as a professional,
[02:10:51.040 --> 02:10:55.200]   in all those kinds of ways that humans can flourish.
[02:10:55.200 --> 02:10:57.120]   I don't know.
[02:10:57.120 --> 02:11:02.120]   It's such a, there is an aspect
[02:11:02.120 --> 02:11:07.120]   where this naive notion is really powerful,
[02:11:07.120 --> 02:11:10.400]   that love and forgiveness is the thing
[02:11:10.400 --> 02:11:12.320]   that's needed in this time.
[02:11:12.320 --> 02:11:16.600]   And when I talk to soldiers, they don't,
[02:11:16.600 --> 02:11:21.600]   I remember bringing up to Jaco,
[02:11:21.600 --> 02:11:23.840]   is there a sense where the people you're fighting
[02:11:23.840 --> 02:11:25.200]   are just brothers in arms,
[02:11:25.240 --> 02:11:27.920]   bringing up the Dire Straits song, "Brothers in Arms."
[02:11:27.920 --> 02:11:30.960]   And he was basically without swearing,
[02:11:30.960 --> 02:11:33.080]   saying, "Fuck that," that they're the enemy.
[02:11:33.080 --> 02:11:33.920]   - Yeah.
[02:11:33.920 --> 02:11:36.400]   I mean, he's literally in survival mode.
[02:11:36.400 --> 02:11:37.440]   He can't think like that.
[02:11:37.440 --> 02:11:39.240]   It's gonna create latency in the system
[02:11:39.240 --> 02:11:40.920]   and that's gonna lower his survivability.
[02:11:40.920 --> 02:11:41.760]   You can't think that.
[02:11:41.760 --> 02:11:44.320]   I mean, we're talking about like cognitively.
[02:11:44.320 --> 02:11:45.680]   You can't have latency.
[02:11:45.680 --> 02:11:48.760]   Like if you're, that one moment of hesitation,
[02:11:48.760 --> 02:11:51.360]   like you see it sometimes, like in these YouTube videos
[02:11:51.360 --> 02:11:56.360]   of like somebody, a new cop has been unfortunate enough
[02:11:56.360 --> 02:12:01.160]   to run into something that is a phenomenon,
[02:12:01.160 --> 02:12:03.120]   suicide by cop.
[02:12:03.120 --> 02:12:06.160]   Somebody has a knife and that person
[02:12:06.160 --> 02:12:08.080]   is running towards them with a knife.
[02:12:08.080 --> 02:12:10.960]   And they're begging the person to stop,
[02:12:10.960 --> 02:12:12.520]   that you can hear it in their voice.
[02:12:12.520 --> 02:12:17.320]   They're begging, "Stop, stop, stop, stop."
[02:12:17.320 --> 02:12:19.280]   And the person is not gonna stop.
[02:12:19.280 --> 02:12:24.280]   So the critique of that is that that latency
[02:12:24.280 --> 02:12:31.040]   could potentially not just lead to the cop getting killed,
[02:12:31.040 --> 02:12:34.400]   but to that person with a knife killing other people.
[02:12:34.400 --> 02:12:39.320]   And so, you know, I get, if I were out there,
[02:12:39.320 --> 02:12:44.320]   I think that like you probably just as a matter
[02:12:44.320 --> 02:12:47.920]   of like not getting shot and being fully in the moment,
[02:12:47.920 --> 02:12:49.440]   you have to be like that, I would guess.
[02:12:49.440 --> 02:12:50.280]   I don't know.
[02:12:50.280 --> 02:12:51.280]   I don't know, I'm the furthest thing
[02:12:51.280 --> 02:12:52.280]   from a soldier there could be,
[02:12:52.280 --> 02:12:57.280]   but there's a, something Jack Kornfield,
[02:12:57.280 --> 02:12:58.680]   this great Buddhist teacher says,
[02:12:58.680 --> 02:13:03.400]   which is tend to the part of the garden you can touch.
[02:13:03.400 --> 02:13:05.880]   Meaning this is where we're at right now.
[02:13:05.880 --> 02:13:09.160]   Thank God you and I, that we are experiencing
[02:13:09.160 --> 02:13:11.960]   some like ripples from what's going on over there.
[02:13:11.960 --> 02:13:14.200]   Everyone is, we're not there.
[02:13:14.200 --> 02:13:17.440]   And thank God we don't have to come up
[02:13:17.440 --> 02:13:21.840]   with the psychological program
[02:13:21.840 --> 02:13:24.000]   for people going through that
[02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:27.600]   to no longer be encumbered by that hate.
[02:13:27.600 --> 02:13:28.440]   Thank God.
[02:13:28.440 --> 02:13:30.240]   And I don't know if that's just lazy or whatever,
[02:13:30.240 --> 02:13:31.920]   but it's like, you know, for me,
[02:13:31.920 --> 02:13:33.480]   I just, I have to bring it back to,
[02:13:33.480 --> 02:13:35.600]   all right, well, here's where I'm at now.
[02:13:35.600 --> 02:13:40.600]   And I don't, like, I don't want there to be war.
[02:13:40.600 --> 02:13:43.200]   I don't want to hurt people,
[02:13:43.200 --> 02:13:44.640]   but yeah, I love what you said.
[02:13:44.640 --> 02:13:46.760]   I think what you said is the,
[02:13:46.760 --> 02:13:51.760]   if anything is the most intelligent way of looking at it,
[02:13:51.760 --> 02:13:54.760]   it's like, don't pretend
[02:13:54.760 --> 02:13:56.760]   that you're not gonna feel that hate.
[02:13:56.760 --> 02:13:58.360]   Like you're gonna feel it.
[02:13:58.360 --> 02:13:59.200]   There's no way around it.
[02:13:59.200 --> 02:14:00.520]   Or like, cause that's even worse.
[02:14:00.520 --> 02:14:01.480]   Cause then you're almost saying like,
[02:14:01.480 --> 02:14:03.480]   something's wrong with them for feeling the hate
[02:14:03.480 --> 02:14:05.280]   or, you know, whatever.
[02:14:05.280 --> 02:14:06.280]   But more along the lines,
[02:14:06.280 --> 02:14:10.040]   if you can avoid applying that hate
[02:14:11.720 --> 02:14:16.400]   to an entire country of people,
[02:14:16.400 --> 02:14:18.040]   then do that.
[02:14:18.040 --> 02:14:20.480]   Like, just understand, we're talking about like,
[02:14:20.480 --> 02:14:25.120]   not everybody.
[02:14:25.120 --> 02:14:26.520]   I know it's not everybody.
[02:14:26.520 --> 02:14:27.600]   I know it's not everybody.
[02:14:27.600 --> 02:14:28.680]   It's just easier, isn't it?
[02:14:28.680 --> 02:14:31.040]   Cognitively, it's somehow easier
[02:14:31.040 --> 02:14:35.480]   to think all Russians, monsters,
[02:14:35.480 --> 02:14:37.840]   you know, all Russians,
[02:14:37.840 --> 02:14:40.120]   all whatever the particular like thing is
[02:14:40.120 --> 02:14:42.040]   that you're supposed to not like.
[02:14:42.040 --> 02:14:43.920]   It's easier somehow, weirdly.
[02:14:43.920 --> 02:14:45.920]   You'd think that'd be more difficult.
[02:14:45.920 --> 02:14:48.800]   - Yeah, but I guess the lesson is,
[02:14:48.800 --> 02:14:53.520]   if you give in to the easy solution,
[02:14:53.520 --> 02:14:58.280]   that's going to lead to detrimental long-term effects.
[02:14:58.280 --> 02:15:00.920]   So hate should be,
[02:15:00.920 --> 02:15:04.240]   it's such a powerful tool
[02:15:04.240 --> 02:15:08.560]   that you should try to control it for your own sake,
[02:15:08.560 --> 02:15:10.360]   not because you owe anything to anybody,
[02:15:10.360 --> 02:15:14.560]   but for your own psychological development over time.
[02:15:14.560 --> 02:15:15.920]   - Right, right.
[02:15:15.920 --> 02:15:17.000]   That's it.
[02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:18.200]   That's it.
[02:15:18.200 --> 02:15:19.120]   Fuck.
[02:15:19.120 --> 02:15:21.440]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:15:21.440 --> 02:15:23.280]   In terms of dark places,
[02:15:23.280 --> 02:15:25.740]   you suffered from depression.
[02:15:25.740 --> 02:15:28.400]   What has been some of the darker places
[02:15:28.400 --> 02:15:30.260]   you've gone in your mind?
[02:15:30.260 --> 02:15:32.760]   - You know, I needed therapy, man.
[02:15:32.760 --> 02:15:34.200]   I needed therapy for the longest time.
[02:15:34.200 --> 02:15:35.200]   I just didn't get it.
[02:15:36.680 --> 02:15:38.280]   So because of that,
[02:15:38.280 --> 02:15:46.240]   I would go through like bouts of like paralytic depression,
[02:15:46.240 --> 02:15:50.480]   like suicidal depression, suicidal ideations
[02:15:50.480 --> 02:15:51.780]   that were more than just ideations.
[02:15:51.780 --> 02:15:56.360]   I mean, I think like people get afraid
[02:15:56.360 --> 02:15:59.580]   when the thought of suicide appears in their consciousness,
[02:15:59.580 --> 02:16:01.200]   they get really scared of themselves.
[02:16:01.200 --> 02:16:03.160]   So they think there's something like,
[02:16:03.160 --> 02:16:04.160]   fuck, what's going on with me?
[02:16:04.160 --> 02:16:05.000]   Why would I think that?
[02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:07.480]   But I think if we are suffering,
[02:16:07.480 --> 02:16:11.320]   and as a natural part of wanting to reduce suffering
[02:16:11.320 --> 02:16:13.840]   or not feel bad anymore,
[02:16:13.840 --> 02:16:16.080]   I mean, suicide is going to be a not,
[02:16:16.080 --> 02:16:17.440]   like if we're just, you're just looking,
[02:16:17.440 --> 02:16:18.320]   what are all the options?
[02:16:18.320 --> 02:16:19.960]   Let's brainstorm here.
[02:16:19.960 --> 02:16:20.800]   You know what I mean?
[02:16:20.800 --> 02:16:22.520]   I could start drinking more water.
[02:16:22.520 --> 02:16:25.040]   You start jogging, get some therapy,
[02:16:25.040 --> 02:16:27.880]   call my friends, all the stuff we all hear.
[02:16:27.880 --> 02:16:29.520]   Or I could just,
[02:16:29.520 --> 02:16:31.080]   I think the height of my apartment building
[02:16:31.080 --> 02:16:34.560]   is probably the definitely the right height to kill myself.
[02:16:34.560 --> 02:16:38.160]   And then, so where, for me,
[02:16:38.160 --> 02:16:41.740]   like the few times where the ideation has gone towards like,
[02:16:41.740 --> 02:16:45.520]   well, when would I do that?
[02:16:45.520 --> 02:16:50.120]   How do I, what do I need to accomplish that?
[02:16:50.120 --> 02:16:52.980]   When then, like that's where it gets really fucking scary.
[02:16:52.980 --> 02:16:54.640]   That's where it's like terrifying.
[02:16:54.640 --> 02:16:57.840]   - So you start the actual details of the planning
[02:16:57.840 --> 02:17:00.120]   of how to commit suicide.
[02:17:00.120 --> 02:17:00.960]   - Yeah.
[02:17:00.960 --> 02:17:02.760]   What's going to be the least painful way to do it?
[02:17:02.760 --> 02:17:04.680]   What's going to be the most instantaneous way to do it?
[02:17:04.680 --> 02:17:07.400]   What's the, you know, and with, you know, with depression,
[02:17:07.400 --> 02:17:11.320]   because it can be progressive, you know,
[02:17:11.320 --> 02:17:14.280]   this is why you have to really just stay on top of it.
[02:17:14.280 --> 02:17:15.360]   Anyone who's gone through depression
[02:17:15.360 --> 02:17:16.240]   knows what I'm talking about.
[02:17:16.240 --> 02:17:17.320]   You gotta stay on top of it.
[02:17:17.320 --> 02:17:18.740]   Like you might need medication, you know,
[02:17:18.740 --> 02:17:20.560]   I know this is controversial now,
[02:17:20.560 --> 02:17:22.720]   but it's still better than dying if you ask me.
[02:17:22.720 --> 02:17:24.800]   But at some point with depression,
[02:17:24.800 --> 02:17:26.620]   it like becomes paralyzing.
[02:17:26.620 --> 02:17:28.200]   So you don't want to get out of bed anymore.
[02:17:28.200 --> 02:17:30.040]   And you're not taking showers anymore.
[02:17:30.040 --> 02:17:31.680]   And you don't want to talk to anybody anymore.
[02:17:31.680 --> 02:17:33.160]   And you're not answering your phone anymore.
[02:17:33.160 --> 02:17:35.200]   And you know.
[02:17:35.200 --> 02:17:38.360]   - So like in a dark place that you might be in,
[02:17:38.360 --> 02:17:39.840]   it still might get worse.
[02:17:39.840 --> 02:17:43.760]   So you should really do everything you can
[02:17:43.760 --> 02:17:45.440]   to get under control. - Immediately.
[02:17:45.440 --> 02:17:46.520]   And that's the problem,
[02:17:46.520 --> 02:17:50.440]   that specific psychological disorder, that's the problem.
[02:17:50.440 --> 02:17:52.480]   Because the things, it's like,
[02:17:52.480 --> 02:17:54.880]   if you start listening to what you want to,
[02:17:54.880 --> 02:17:56.600]   you think it's you, it's the depression,
[02:17:56.600 --> 02:18:00.080]   you start listening to it, it wants you to stay in bed.
[02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:03.960]   And then you're getting those fucking depression sleeps,
[02:18:03.960 --> 02:18:06.400]   you know, or you wake up and you're more tired.
[02:18:06.400 --> 02:18:07.760]   Like it's not working.
[02:18:07.760 --> 02:18:11.360]   You're trying to escape reality by sleeping.
[02:18:11.360 --> 02:18:14.920]   And so, yeah, like you have to like,
[02:18:14.920 --> 02:18:18.360]   you're fighting for your,
[02:18:18.360 --> 02:18:19.800]   you're literally fighting for your life.
[02:18:19.800 --> 02:18:20.840]   It might not seem like that,
[02:18:20.840 --> 02:18:23.460]   'cause you can't, if you could see depression,
[02:18:23.460 --> 02:18:24.300]   if you could see it,
[02:18:24.300 --> 02:18:28.960]   if you knew you had some inky, vaporous, octopus thing
[02:18:28.960 --> 02:18:31.360]   that was just wrapping around you
[02:18:31.360 --> 02:18:33.320]   more and more and more and more,
[02:18:33.320 --> 02:18:34.640]   you would probably do everything you could
[02:18:34.640 --> 02:18:36.140]   to rip that fucking thing off your body.
[02:18:36.140 --> 02:18:38.020]   And if you couldn't get it off your body,
[02:18:38.020 --> 02:18:41.160]   you would be calling people to get help.
[02:18:41.160 --> 02:18:42.480]   - So it doesn't feel like a fight,
[02:18:42.480 --> 02:18:45.320]   because you're exhausted, there's no reason to move.
[02:18:45.320 --> 02:18:48.040]   There's no, you don't see the meaning for any of it.
[02:18:48.040 --> 02:18:50.240]   So it doesn't feel like a battle, but it is a battle.
[02:18:50.240 --> 02:18:51.720]   - You're not feeling, I mean, that's the other thing.
[02:18:51.720 --> 02:18:53.600]   You're just, you're basically not feeling.
[02:18:53.600 --> 02:18:55.640]   You're like, you start going numb,
[02:18:55.640 --> 02:18:57.560]   at least that was my experience with it,
[02:18:57.560 --> 02:19:01.440]   numb and tired, and then increasingly numb and tired,
[02:19:01.440 --> 02:19:05.280]   and then increasingly sort of disconnecting from reality.
[02:19:05.280 --> 02:19:06.400]   And then somewhere in there,
[02:19:06.400 --> 02:19:08.860]   that's when you start playing around with the idea
[02:19:08.860 --> 02:19:11.400]   of like, oh, I don't know if it's worth it.
[02:19:11.400 --> 02:19:14.680]   Now, I think compared to some of my friends
[02:19:14.680 --> 02:19:16.000]   who haven't survived,
[02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:17.960]   obviously, who haven't survived depression,
[02:19:17.960 --> 02:19:21.880]   like mine was definitely not whatever theirs was like.
[02:19:21.880 --> 02:19:26.360]   I've heard, I mean, to understand it for folks out there,
[02:19:26.360 --> 02:19:28.600]   maybe you haven't gone through it, just imagine
[02:19:28.600 --> 02:19:32.760]   if like how bad you have to feel if death is the,
[02:19:32.760 --> 02:19:35.240]   like violence against yourself
[02:19:35.240 --> 02:19:37.160]   so that you die is the solution.
[02:19:37.160 --> 02:19:42.160]   Like, it flies in the face of everything.
[02:19:42.160 --> 02:19:48.120]   So I would, yeah, that was definitely the darkest place
[02:19:48.120 --> 02:19:48.960]   that I've ever been.
[02:19:48.960 --> 02:19:51.640]   - Is it just that death doesn't seem like,
[02:19:51.640 --> 02:19:54.200]   because you don't care about anything anymore,
[02:19:54.200 --> 02:19:56.480]   that death just doesn't seem like that bad?
[02:19:56.480 --> 02:19:57.320]   - Yeah.
[02:19:57.320 --> 02:20:01.480]   - Like you're not able to appropriately assign
[02:20:01.480 --> 02:20:05.680]   the negative costs to this solution?
[02:20:05.680 --> 02:20:06.520]   - Right.
[02:20:06.520 --> 02:20:07.840]   - Just seems like a reasonable solution?
[02:20:07.840 --> 02:20:11.880]   - Yeah, but I think also what's going along with it
[02:20:11.880 --> 02:20:15.320]   is like, it's not like your brain isn't working.
[02:20:15.320 --> 02:20:17.640]   Like you're not thinking,
[02:20:17.640 --> 02:20:19.280]   obviously, you're not thinking clearly.
[02:20:19.280 --> 02:20:22.800]   Like, at least again, this was my experience of it.
[02:20:22.800 --> 02:20:25.240]   It's a fog, you're in some kind of,
[02:20:25.240 --> 02:20:31.120]   like you're confused, there's confusion, there's shame.
[02:20:31.120 --> 02:20:33.160]   You feel embarrassed, you feel embarrassed.
[02:20:33.160 --> 02:20:34.920]   You wanna get out of bed, you wanna do stuff.
[02:20:34.920 --> 02:20:38.400]   You wanna be compelled to be social and do all this stuff,
[02:20:38.400 --> 02:20:39.240]   but you're not.
[02:20:39.240 --> 02:20:40.520]   You're not.
[02:20:40.520 --> 02:20:42.840]   Like you seem, if people don't know what's going on
[02:20:42.840 --> 02:20:45.160]   and you're not telling them 'cause you're embarrassed,
[02:20:45.160 --> 02:20:48.440]   'cause you wanna have some like,
[02:20:49.440 --> 02:20:53.880]   uncorrupted, unwarped psyche,
[02:20:53.880 --> 02:20:57.960]   you're like, it invites you to be secret about it.
[02:20:57.960 --> 02:20:59.440]   That's one of its first tricks
[02:20:59.440 --> 02:21:01.680]   is it tells you not to tell anybody.
[02:21:01.680 --> 02:21:06.320]   And that's deadly in that case, deadly.
[02:21:06.320 --> 02:21:07.880]   - What was the source of light?
[02:21:07.880 --> 02:21:11.880]   What was the, what were for you
[02:21:11.880 --> 02:21:14.240]   and in general, the ways out?
[02:21:14.240 --> 02:21:19.160]   - Yeah, so for me, the solutions,
[02:21:19.160 --> 02:21:22.160]   and again, man, for my depressed friends out there,
[02:21:22.160 --> 02:21:23.180]   please don't get mad at me.
[02:21:23.180 --> 02:21:24.240]   I'm not doing the thing of like,
[02:21:24.240 --> 02:21:26.840]   just put on a smile or any of that bullshit.
[02:21:26.840 --> 02:21:28.200]   'Cause it doesn't feel like that
[02:21:28.200 --> 02:21:31.960]   when you're like, and when you're fighting it.
[02:21:31.960 --> 02:21:35.280]   It's like you are, you're in a,
[02:21:35.280 --> 02:21:39.400]   I don't know why I keep using these stupid gravity analogies,
[02:21:39.400 --> 02:21:42.280]   but it's like the gravity has been turned up on your planet
[02:21:42.280 --> 02:21:45.440]   in every single way by, so getting out of bed.
[02:21:45.440 --> 02:21:46.280]   You know, like.
[02:21:47.880 --> 02:21:50.640]   By the way, gravity and quantum mechanics,
[02:21:50.640 --> 02:21:54.080]   one of the most beautiful things about our reality,
[02:21:54.080 --> 02:21:56.720]   what the hell is each of those things?
[02:21:56.720 --> 02:22:00.600]   So this isn't, you're not just talking
[02:22:00.600 --> 02:22:02.520]   about hippie language, it's still,
[02:22:02.520 --> 02:22:05.920]   physicists pretend they understand something.
[02:22:05.920 --> 02:22:07.280]   We're still at the very beginning
[02:22:07.280 --> 02:22:09.680]   of understanding this mysterious world of ours
[02:22:09.680 --> 02:22:12.840]   that seems to be functioning according to these
[02:22:12.840 --> 02:22:17.840]   weirdly simple and yet universally powerful laws.
[02:22:18.120 --> 02:22:20.720]   Which we don't fully yet understand.
[02:22:20.720 --> 02:22:24.040]   So please, the metaphor and the analogy of gravity.
[02:22:24.040 --> 02:22:25.440]   - Okay, thank you. - Fully applicable.
[02:22:25.440 --> 02:22:26.280]   - I don't know any other way to put it.
[02:22:26.280 --> 02:22:28.560]   And it's like somebody turned the gravitational field
[02:22:28.560 --> 02:22:30.680]   of your mattress up by-- - So everything is heavy.
[02:22:30.680 --> 02:22:33.080]   - Heavy, your body's heavy.
[02:22:33.080 --> 02:22:34.040]   You don't wanna get out of bed,
[02:22:34.040 --> 02:22:36.840]   you will consider shitting or pissing the bed.
[02:22:36.840 --> 02:22:38.200]   'Cause you're just like, who gives a fuck?
[02:22:38.200 --> 02:22:40.320]   I'll just lay in my shit and piss.
[02:22:40.320 --> 02:22:44.800]   You're dying, you're like, none of it makes sense.
[02:22:44.800 --> 02:22:45.640]   So,
[02:22:45.800 --> 02:22:46.640]   um,
[02:22:46.640 --> 02:22:52.080]   and I feel like in retrospect,
[02:22:52.080 --> 02:22:55.920]   I'm making what I've done a little,
[02:22:55.920 --> 02:22:57.400]   like I had more lucidity.
[02:22:57.400 --> 02:22:59.320]   It was more of like when you're,
[02:22:59.320 --> 02:23:02.920]   you know, you're wrestling with someone
[02:23:02.920 --> 02:23:04.440]   and you're just like, (grunts)
[02:23:04.440 --> 02:23:06.960]   well, you do, it's different for you.
[02:23:06.960 --> 02:23:08.120]   But for me, if I'm wrestling,
[02:23:08.120 --> 02:23:10.040]   I'm not thinking about jujitsu moves.
[02:23:10.040 --> 02:23:10.880]   I'm like, (grunts)
[02:23:10.880 --> 02:23:12.080]   - Survival. - You're just, (grunts)
[02:23:12.080 --> 02:23:13.320]   So it's like that.
[02:23:13.320 --> 02:23:14.960]   - It is a struggle.
[02:23:14.960 --> 02:23:19.960]   Like it's like, you really have to deliberately fight.
[02:23:19.960 --> 02:23:21.440]   - Everything.
[02:23:21.440 --> 02:23:23.640]   So you start,
[02:23:23.640 --> 02:23:26.640]   so you can almost have a conversation with the depression.
[02:23:26.640 --> 02:23:30.880]   And then what you do is you start doing the opposite
[02:23:30.880 --> 02:23:33.240]   of everything it's telling you to do.
[02:23:33.240 --> 02:23:36.600]   So it's telling you lay in bed.
[02:23:36.600 --> 02:23:38.280]   So you get out of bed.
[02:23:38.280 --> 02:23:41.760]   It's definitely telling you, don't fucking exercise.
[02:23:41.760 --> 02:23:43.160]   You're gonna go fucking exercise.
[02:23:43.160 --> 02:23:44.200]   That's not gonna do anything.
[02:23:44.200 --> 02:23:46.440]   You can't, you'll probably have a heart attack.
[02:23:46.440 --> 02:23:48.080]   You really wanna go outside.
[02:23:48.080 --> 02:23:50.680]   Don't go fucking exercise.
[02:23:50.680 --> 02:23:53.360]   And it'll feel crazy.
[02:23:53.360 --> 02:23:54.880]   And you won't wanna do it.
[02:23:54.880 --> 02:23:57.360]   If you wanted to do it, you wouldn't be depressed.
[02:23:57.360 --> 02:23:58.680]   Like how often do you hear like
[02:23:58.680 --> 02:24:00.400]   one of the symptoms of depression?
[02:24:00.400 --> 02:24:02.960]   You wanna jog, you wanna get on a bike.
[02:24:02.960 --> 02:24:04.000]   You know, you don't hear that.
[02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:04.920]   That's not a symptom.
[02:24:04.920 --> 02:24:09.760]   So you start, at least one solution I had was I
[02:24:09.760 --> 02:24:11.920]   just started doing the opposite of.
[02:24:11.920 --> 02:24:14.480]   - Whatever the voice is telling you, do the opposite.
[02:24:14.480 --> 02:24:18.880]   - That, and then suddenly that,
[02:24:18.880 --> 02:24:22.320]   the gravitational field diminishes a little bit.
[02:24:22.320 --> 02:24:23.600]   It doesn't go all the way away.
[02:24:23.600 --> 02:24:25.640]   And that's where you can fall right back into it
[02:24:25.640 --> 02:24:27.640]   'cause you just feel even slightly better.
[02:24:27.640 --> 02:24:29.760]   You're like, oh, okay, I fixed it.
[02:24:29.760 --> 02:24:31.600]   You know, really, I think if you like,
[02:24:31.600 --> 02:24:34.720]   having been through therapy,
[02:24:34.720 --> 02:24:39.720]   the best solution would be go to a fucking therapist
[02:24:40.320 --> 02:24:42.880]   as quickly as you can.
[02:24:42.880 --> 02:24:45.760]   Just sit down with them and tell them what's going on.
[02:24:45.760 --> 02:24:47.760]   I know what you're thinking.
[02:24:47.760 --> 02:24:49.720]   How am I gonna find a therapist?
[02:24:49.720 --> 02:24:51.560]   Just do it.
[02:24:51.560 --> 02:24:53.320]   Google it, go on Yelp.
[02:24:53.320 --> 02:24:56.120]   All of this shit feels impossible.
[02:24:56.120 --> 02:24:57.520]   You're like, I don't wanna turn on the computer.
[02:24:57.520 --> 02:24:58.440]   I don't wanna do any of this.
[02:24:58.440 --> 02:24:59.280]   You just have to.
[02:24:59.280 --> 02:25:00.120]   I mean, you have to.
[02:25:00.120 --> 02:25:01.680]   You do it if you're on fire.
[02:25:01.680 --> 02:25:03.160]   You do it if you're on fire and someone's like,
[02:25:03.160 --> 02:25:05.320]   you know, here's a way to not be on fire.
[02:25:05.320 --> 02:25:07.800]   Just this particular fire is,
[02:25:07.800 --> 02:25:09.880]   it doesn't make you wanna run around screaming.
[02:25:09.880 --> 02:25:11.520]   It just makes you wanna fall asleep forever.
[02:25:11.520 --> 02:25:15.160]   And that, but those little steps,
[02:25:15.160 --> 02:25:16.960]   I got lucky because it worked.
[02:25:16.960 --> 02:25:17.800]   It worked.
[02:25:17.800 --> 02:25:18.720]   I started exercising.
[02:25:18.720 --> 02:25:20.960]   I'd been on antidepressants before
[02:25:20.960 --> 02:25:23.360]   when I was originally diagnosed with it.
[02:25:23.360 --> 02:25:26.000]   - Did those help or no?
[02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.880]   - You know, even with all the current research
[02:25:28.880 --> 02:25:31.640]   coming out about that maybe we were all wrong
[02:25:31.640 --> 02:25:33.920]   about our understanding of depression,
[02:25:33.920 --> 02:25:38.400]   I do feel like it helped in a certain way.
[02:25:38.400 --> 02:25:39.800]   Like it definitely,
[02:25:39.800 --> 02:25:43.400]   it definitely like made me stop thinking about,
[02:25:43.400 --> 02:25:45.200]   it stopped the intrusive thoughts.
[02:25:45.200 --> 02:25:48.120]   And, but I don't know how much of that was placebo
[02:25:48.120 --> 02:25:49.320]   or how much of that, I don't know.
[02:25:49.320 --> 02:25:51.720]   But then also like, I couldn't cum anymore.
[02:25:51.720 --> 02:25:53.280]   That was the other fucked up thing.
[02:25:53.280 --> 02:25:55.600]   Like you're, you can't have orgasms.
[02:25:55.600 --> 02:25:58.800]   And which might not sound like a big deal,
[02:25:58.800 --> 02:26:02.160]   but you know, when I told my therapist
[02:26:02.160 --> 02:26:03.800]   that they actually took me off them,
[02:26:03.800 --> 02:26:05.680]   'cause I think she was realizing
[02:26:05.680 --> 02:26:08.000]   that it started diminishing a little bit.
[02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:11.120]   But the one I'm talking about now,
[02:26:11.120 --> 02:26:14.440]   that whatever episode or whatever you wanna call it,
[02:26:14.440 --> 02:26:16.400]   I just got lucky 'cause it worked.
[02:26:16.400 --> 02:26:19.120]   It worked and I started feeling better, thank God.
[02:26:19.120 --> 02:26:22.200]   Now, if you suffer from depression out there
[02:26:22.200 --> 02:26:24.320]   and you've had a remission of the depression,
[02:26:24.320 --> 02:26:26.120]   you know, it's really like,
[02:26:26.120 --> 02:26:27.880]   it's scary to have mental illness
[02:26:27.880 --> 02:26:32.800]   because everyone gets bummed out.
[02:26:32.800 --> 02:26:33.960]   I mean, that's just normal.
[02:26:33.960 --> 02:26:35.120]   Like you're gonna get bummed out
[02:26:35.120 --> 02:26:36.640]   and don't wanna do anything sometimes.
[02:26:36.640 --> 02:26:38.160]   It doesn't mean you have a clinical depression.
[02:26:38.160 --> 02:26:40.240]   You might just be bummed out or grieving.
[02:26:40.240 --> 02:26:42.560]   You might be any number of things.
[02:26:42.560 --> 02:26:47.000]   But when I get really nervous,
[02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.920]   if some of those symptoms start showing up.
[02:26:49.920 --> 02:26:54.920]   And at one point I felt like that was happening again.
[02:26:54.920 --> 02:26:59.480]   And I did intermuscular ketamine therapy,
[02:26:59.480 --> 02:27:04.080]   which now that was the damnedest thing I've ever experienced
[02:27:04.080 --> 02:27:08.080]   aside from the fact that ketamine is immensely psychedelic.
[02:27:08.080 --> 02:27:14.080]   I just remember going back to the hotel
[02:27:14.080 --> 02:27:17.200]   after the experience with a clinician.
[02:27:17.200 --> 02:27:21.240]   And I'm like, you know, it's like,
[02:27:21.240 --> 02:27:23.760]   with depression it's like a headache
[02:27:23.760 --> 02:27:25.160]   that starts coming on, but you're like,
[02:27:25.160 --> 02:27:27.160]   this headache might last for years.
[02:27:27.160 --> 02:27:28.640]   It might last for six months.
[02:27:28.640 --> 02:27:30.880]   It might get worse and worse and worse.
[02:27:30.880 --> 02:27:35.880]   And so I went back to the hotel room and it was just gone.
[02:27:35.880 --> 02:27:38.480]   Like I just felt normal.
[02:27:38.480 --> 02:27:39.440]   I felt great.
[02:27:39.440 --> 02:27:42.560]   It was like the most remarkable thing ever.
[02:27:42.560 --> 02:27:45.960]   So, you know, look at the research on ketamine right now.
[02:27:45.960 --> 02:27:49.080]   It's like, it's not like bullshit.
[02:27:49.080 --> 02:27:50.560]   It's not like woo-woo science.
[02:27:50.560 --> 02:27:52.240]   There's really, really good data out there
[02:27:52.240 --> 02:27:55.480]   showing that something like, I think it's 60%.
[02:27:55.480 --> 02:27:56.680]   I don't know what the percentage is,
[02:27:56.680 --> 02:28:01.680]   but 60% of people with an endogenous depression
[02:28:01.680 --> 02:28:06.480]   when they get ketamine therapy will experience remission,
[02:28:06.480 --> 02:28:08.360]   regardless of whether you trip out or not.
[02:28:08.360 --> 02:28:10.960]   It just does something that I don't know
[02:28:10.960 --> 02:28:11.960]   if they know what it is yet.
[02:28:11.960 --> 02:28:12.800]   I don't care if they do.
[02:28:12.800 --> 02:28:15.040]   - But that one thing worked and basically
[02:28:15.040 --> 02:28:17.640]   you keep fighting until something works.
[02:28:17.640 --> 02:28:18.480]   - Exactly.
[02:28:18.480 --> 02:28:19.760]   It's a survival issue.
[02:28:19.760 --> 02:28:21.080]   And it's a survival issue.
[02:28:21.080 --> 02:28:24.560]   It's just, I think because it's kind of so slow moving,
[02:28:24.560 --> 02:28:26.560]   you might even forget it's progressive.
[02:28:26.560 --> 02:28:28.880]   You could easily just think that you're
[02:28:28.880 --> 02:28:30.900]   just a kind of bummed out person,
[02:28:30.900 --> 02:28:33.320]   or you start thinking that these aspects
[02:28:33.320 --> 02:28:35.800]   of your psychology are permanent
[02:28:35.800 --> 02:28:37.400]   when they don't have to be.
[02:28:37.400 --> 02:28:40.000]   - What about other people in your life?
[02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:41.720]   What advice would you give to people
[02:28:41.720 --> 02:28:44.760]   that have loved ones who suffer from depression?
[02:28:44.760 --> 02:28:46.400]   What are they to do?
[02:28:46.400 --> 02:28:48.660]   - Okay, now this is really like,
[02:28:48.660 --> 02:28:54.720]   man, it's really dark.
[02:28:54.720 --> 02:28:57.520]   Here's number one.
[02:28:57.520 --> 02:28:59.240]   This is what somebody told me
[02:28:59.240 --> 02:29:01.000]   when I lost a friend to suicide.
[02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:02.800]   'Cause when you lose a friend to suicide,
[02:29:02.800 --> 02:29:04.600]   when you lose a loved one to suicide,
[02:29:04.600 --> 02:29:06.040]   you're gonna blame yourself.
[02:29:06.040 --> 02:29:10.920]   In the periphery of suicide,
[02:29:10.920 --> 02:29:14.480]   there is a circumference of guilty people
[02:29:14.480 --> 02:29:17.280]   who all feel like, oh, if only I'd said this
[02:29:17.280 --> 02:29:19.600]   at the right time, if only I'd listened more,
[02:29:19.600 --> 02:29:21.760]   if only I'd seen that warning sign,
[02:29:21.760 --> 02:29:23.520]   or if only this or that.
[02:29:24.360 --> 02:29:29.280]   It's interesting in that with other forms
[02:29:29.280 --> 02:29:34.280]   of disease, if your loved one dies from cancer, say,
[02:29:34.280 --> 02:29:39.600]   more than likely, you're not gonna be thinking like,
[02:29:39.600 --> 02:29:42.360]   oh, I should have cured their cancer.
[02:29:42.360 --> 02:29:44.800]   It's a tragedy, but at least you're not like,
[02:29:44.800 --> 02:29:46.880]   oh, if only I had, you still might think
[02:29:46.880 --> 02:29:48.200]   that's part of grief, but--
[02:29:48.200 --> 02:29:52.120]   - It's not as sticky in many of the other situations.
[02:29:52.120 --> 02:29:55.360]   Here, the guilt can really stay for a long time.
[02:29:55.360 --> 02:30:00.360]   - Yep, so you, number one,
[02:30:00.360 --> 02:30:04.360]   we're talking about a progressive disease
[02:30:04.360 --> 02:30:05.320]   that can lead to death.
[02:30:05.320 --> 02:30:07.900]   And if somebody commits suicide,
[02:30:07.900 --> 02:30:09.400]   they wanted to commit suicide,
[02:30:09.400 --> 02:30:12.920]   and at least what I've been told is you can't stop it.
[02:30:12.920 --> 02:30:15.800]   It's gonna happen, it's gonna happen.
[02:30:15.800 --> 02:30:18.200]   There are no magic words, there's nothing you could do.
[02:30:18.200 --> 02:30:21.480]   So, people who've lost people to suicide,
[02:30:21.480 --> 02:30:23.000]   you know what I'm talking about.
[02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:26.320]   Like, you can watch it happen in real time,
[02:30:26.320 --> 02:30:28.260]   and there's nothing you could do.
[02:30:28.260 --> 02:30:34.760]   That being said, being responsive to when it seems
[02:30:34.760 --> 02:30:37.120]   like someone's really reaching out for help,
[02:30:37.120 --> 02:30:40.840]   and knowing that maybe, even though it might,
[02:30:40.840 --> 02:30:42.280]   especially if it's someone who's like,
[02:30:42.280 --> 02:30:44.760]   doesn't talk like this a lot of the time,
[02:30:44.760 --> 02:30:47.160]   and sentences start coming out of their mouth,
[02:30:47.160 --> 02:30:49.480]   that if you weren't really paying attention,
[02:30:49.480 --> 02:30:50.960]   might not seem like a big deal,
[02:30:50.960 --> 02:30:52.920]   but for this person, it's kind of anomalous
[02:30:52.920 --> 02:30:56.480]   that all of a sudden that's happening.
[02:30:56.480 --> 02:30:59.560]   Now there, that's when you can be a good listener,
[02:30:59.560 --> 02:31:01.960]   and open up to them and hear what they're saying,
[02:31:01.960 --> 02:31:04.120]   and see, oh shit, are they asking me for,
[02:31:04.120 --> 02:31:05.800]   is this them asking for help?
[02:31:05.800 --> 02:31:08.300]   And even if you're like, I don't know what to do,
[02:31:08.300 --> 02:31:13.600]   at least you can start checking in on them,
[02:31:13.600 --> 02:31:17.960]   help them understand that you're there for them,
[02:31:17.960 --> 02:31:19.680]   and then hopefully get them into therapy,
[02:31:19.680 --> 02:31:22.720]   get them to a doctor, get them to a professional
[02:31:22.720 --> 02:31:25.080]   who can see what's going on there,
[02:31:25.080 --> 02:31:27.040]   so that, and then there's hope.
[02:31:27.040 --> 02:31:29.080]   And even then there might not be hope, actually.
[02:31:29.080 --> 02:31:30.360]   Doctors can't stop it.
[02:31:30.360 --> 02:31:34.560]   Sometimes it just, that's the way it goes.
[02:31:34.560 --> 02:31:39.120]   But I know that being sensitive,
[02:31:39.120 --> 02:31:41.440]   if somebody's all of a sudden hitting you up,
[02:31:41.440 --> 02:31:44.320]   or reaching out to you that normally isn't like that,
[02:31:44.320 --> 02:31:46.040]   and just, what's going on?
[02:31:46.040 --> 02:31:46.880]   How are you?
[02:31:46.880 --> 02:31:48.040]   And just listen.
[02:31:48.040 --> 02:31:50.600]   - Which in general, depression or not,
[02:31:50.600 --> 02:31:52.960]   is probably a good thing to do.
[02:31:52.960 --> 02:31:53.800]   - Yeah.
[02:31:53.800 --> 02:31:56.560]   - To truly listen.
[02:31:56.560 --> 02:31:57.760]   It's like, are you okay?
[02:31:57.760 --> 02:31:59.440]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:31:59.440 --> 02:32:01.000]   'Cause people have, you know, I don't,
[02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:03.360]   this whole thing of like cries for help, man.
[02:32:03.360 --> 02:32:06.600]   They don't, sometimes they just look like a weird text.
[02:32:06.600 --> 02:32:08.840]   You know, and you don't realize that for the person
[02:32:08.840 --> 02:32:10.040]   to send that fucking text,
[02:32:10.040 --> 02:32:12.140]   they've been thinking about it all morning.
[02:32:12.140 --> 02:32:14.960]   They've been just trying to get their phone up
[02:32:14.960 --> 02:32:16.440]   from the floor.
[02:32:16.440 --> 02:32:20.040]   So, you know, I think that's it.
[02:32:20.040 --> 02:32:21.800]   I mean, I don't know.
[02:32:21.800 --> 02:32:22.760]   I don't know.
[02:32:22.760 --> 02:32:24.960]   I've had friends like kill themselves.
[02:32:24.960 --> 02:32:29.120]   So, and many of them, it wasn't like,
[02:32:29.120 --> 02:32:31.360]   sadly, it was like, I don't know.
[02:32:31.360 --> 02:32:34.000]   I don't know what could have been done, but.
[02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:37.760]   - But there's still a guilt in the back of your head?
[02:32:37.760 --> 02:32:39.280]   - For the rest of my life, for sure.
[02:32:39.280 --> 02:32:40.220]   Always will be.
[02:32:40.220 --> 02:32:43.080]   Yeah, I mean, yeah.
[02:32:43.080 --> 02:32:44.680]   But again, what are you gonna do?
[02:32:44.680 --> 02:32:46.740]   - But even that, it's a part of love.
[02:32:46.740 --> 02:32:49.840]   - That's right.
[02:32:49.840 --> 02:32:50.800]   That's right.
[02:32:50.800 --> 02:32:51.620]   Yeah, that's right.
[02:32:51.620 --> 02:32:52.460]   You could, yeah.
[02:32:52.460 --> 02:32:54.080]   And we, you know, we feel guilt.
[02:32:54.080 --> 02:32:55.240]   Part of grief is guilt.
[02:32:55.240 --> 02:32:58.520]   You know, like we always could have been better people.
[02:32:58.520 --> 02:33:00.400]   We always could have been better people.
[02:33:00.400 --> 02:33:02.240]   You get into Viktor Frankl much?
[02:33:02.240 --> 02:33:03.240]   - Yeah, of course.
[02:33:03.240 --> 02:33:04.640]   - "Man's Search for Meaning."
[02:33:04.640 --> 02:33:05.920]   - Yeah.
[02:33:05.920 --> 02:33:10.920]   - The invitation to live your life
[02:33:10.920 --> 02:33:13.560]   as though you'd been on your deathbed
[02:33:13.560 --> 02:33:15.600]   and had been given the chance to go back
[02:33:15.600 --> 02:33:18.040]   and not make the same mistakes.
[02:33:18.040 --> 02:33:20.800]   I return to that idea all the time,
[02:33:20.800 --> 02:33:22.440]   meaning it's like, okay,
[02:33:22.440 --> 02:33:25.720]   whatever you did before this moment,
[02:33:25.720 --> 02:33:28.200]   it's too late.
[02:33:28.200 --> 02:33:31.160]   But now, you know, this is where you can start.
[02:33:31.160 --> 02:33:32.440]   This is where you can start.
[02:33:32.440 --> 02:33:37.440]   And yeah, so I think that for a neurotic like me,
[02:33:37.440 --> 02:33:39.160]   that's super important.
[02:33:39.160 --> 02:33:41.420]   'Cause otherwise I'll just get like too lost
[02:33:41.420 --> 02:33:44.620]   in the weeds of shitty things I did in the past.
[02:33:44.620 --> 02:33:46.100]   - So speaking of Viktor Frankl,
[02:33:46.100 --> 02:33:48.420]   you and Hitler have the same birthday.
[02:33:48.420 --> 02:33:50.720]   - Oh my God, you've really done your research.
[02:33:50.720 --> 02:33:55.700]   - Well, I often Google famous people
[02:33:55.700 --> 02:33:58.740]   that have a birthday same as Hitler.
[02:33:58.740 --> 02:33:59.580]   - Yeah.
[02:33:59.580 --> 02:34:02.140]   - And the person that shows up, you know,
[02:34:02.140 --> 02:34:03.900]   is your face just really big.
[02:34:03.900 --> 02:34:04.740]   - It's an embit.
[02:34:04.740 --> 02:34:07.980]   - You and Hitler together, just pals next to each other.
[02:34:07.980 --> 02:34:10.020]   - No, it does not.
[02:34:10.020 --> 02:34:12.940]   No, but April 20th is an embarrassing birthday
[02:34:12.940 --> 02:34:14.620]   for all my 420 friends out there.
[02:34:14.620 --> 02:34:15.460]   It's embarrassing.
[02:34:15.460 --> 02:34:17.460]   You share a birthday with Hitler.
[02:34:17.460 --> 02:34:22.460]   - But 420s also has a humor and a lightness to it, right?
[02:34:22.460 --> 02:34:24.260]   - It's embarrassing.
[02:34:24.260 --> 02:34:27.260]   - Especially if life is embarrassing.
[02:34:27.260 --> 02:34:31.060]   - But if you like weed and you're born on stoner day
[02:34:31.060 --> 02:34:34.120]   and you believe in reincarnation,
[02:34:34.120 --> 02:34:36.500]   do you realize like when you start connecting the dots there,
[02:34:36.500 --> 02:34:39.700]   if there is like a Bardo where you get to choose
[02:34:39.700 --> 02:34:41.060]   your next life.
[02:34:41.060 --> 02:34:45.060]   - So you're like a shitty generic NPC.
[02:34:45.060 --> 02:34:48.820]   You're like, of course, you would be born on 420.
[02:34:48.820 --> 02:34:53.820]   - Dude, let me be born on 420, man, yeah.
[02:34:53.820 --> 02:34:57.060]   - But isn't it interesting that on that same day,
[02:34:57.060 --> 02:34:58.600]   Hitler's also born.
[02:34:58.600 --> 02:35:03.040]   There's a tension to that.
[02:35:03.040 --> 02:35:06.800]   And that Hitler's an artist.
[02:35:06.800 --> 02:35:11.800]   So it's like that hippie mindset could go anywhere.
[02:35:11.800 --> 02:35:12.960]   - Oh yeah, right.
[02:35:12.960 --> 02:35:16.000]   Like, yeah, you know, and I was just having this conversation
[02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:18.900]   with a friend of mine who's a wonderful skeptic.
[02:35:18.900 --> 02:35:21.360]   And we were talking about this,
[02:35:21.360 --> 02:35:26.480]   which is the thing where you start attributing
[02:35:26.480 --> 02:35:31.100]   to the day you were born, these kinds of significance.
[02:35:31.100 --> 02:35:33.320]   And based on maybe people who were born on that day,
[02:35:33.320 --> 02:35:34.940]   maybe some other things.
[02:35:34.940 --> 02:35:38.060]   And it's like, think of how many people by now
[02:35:38.060 --> 02:35:42.360]   in the course of human history have been born on April 20th.
[02:35:42.360 --> 02:35:44.140]   I mean, how many?
[02:35:44.140 --> 02:35:45.440]   Someone could probably do the math
[02:35:45.440 --> 02:35:47.920]   and come up with some number close to it.
[02:35:47.920 --> 02:35:51.880]   Now, this is how you know how rotten Hitler is.
[02:35:51.880 --> 02:35:54.320]   Like he's the one that like fucks up
[02:35:54.320 --> 02:35:56.840]   the birthday for everybody else.
[02:35:56.840 --> 02:35:57.920]   But-
[02:35:57.920 --> 02:36:00.520]   - I think where I heard that you're 420
[02:36:00.520 --> 02:36:04.800]   is Wim Hof episode, 'cause he's also 420.
[02:36:04.800 --> 02:36:05.860]   - 420.
[02:36:05.860 --> 02:36:09.800]   - Yeah, so Hitler beats even Wim Hof.
[02:36:09.800 --> 02:36:11.980]   Look, in terms of owning the date.
[02:36:11.980 --> 02:36:15.040]   - I think if anybody is like,
[02:36:15.040 --> 02:36:18.760]   well, obviously there's nothing you can do to like fix it.
[02:36:18.760 --> 02:36:20.400]   Hitler fucked up a lot of things.
[02:36:20.400 --> 02:36:22.120]   He fucked up that mustache.
[02:36:22.120 --> 02:36:23.720]   He fucked up the name Hitler.
[02:36:23.720 --> 02:36:25.200]   He fucked up 420.
[02:36:25.200 --> 02:36:29.100]   And obviously he caused a horrific Holocaust that,
[02:36:29.100 --> 02:36:32.040]   by the way, talk about these reverberations through time
[02:36:32.040 --> 02:36:33.200]   that we're still experiencing.
[02:36:33.200 --> 02:36:35.600]   There's still people walked around with fucking tattoos
[02:36:35.600 --> 02:36:36.760]   from that motherfucker.
[02:36:36.760 --> 02:36:41.520]   But Wim Hof, people like Wim Hof,
[02:36:41.520 --> 02:36:45.920]   they're like whatever the opposite of Hitler is.
[02:36:45.920 --> 02:36:47.880]   - He too is creating ripples in the lake
[02:36:47.880 --> 02:36:51.320]   that hopefully respond to that of Hitler.
[02:36:51.320 --> 02:36:53.240]   - Yeah, very cold fucking lake.
[02:36:53.240 --> 02:36:55.320]   And he's in, yeah, so-
[02:36:55.320 --> 02:36:56.320]   - Very cold fucking lake.
[02:36:56.320 --> 02:36:59.960]   - Very, very cold lake that he's happily swimming around in.
[02:36:59.960 --> 02:37:04.960]   But yeah, I try not to think about
[02:37:04.960 --> 02:37:08.240]   like the Hitler thing on my birthday.
[02:37:08.240 --> 02:37:10.320]   Then my dad would just, every birthday,
[02:37:10.320 --> 02:37:12.120]   he would remind me that Hitler was born.
[02:37:12.120 --> 02:37:14.800]   - Do you think all of us are capable of evil?
[02:37:14.800 --> 02:37:18.260]   Do you think, you're one of the sweetest people I know.
[02:37:18.260 --> 02:37:21.000]   Just as a fan, do you think you're capable of evil?
[02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:24.520]   - Sure, yeah, I mean, sure, definitely.
[02:37:24.520 --> 02:37:27.880]   I think if you don't think that, you better watch out
[02:37:27.880 --> 02:37:30.400]   because come on, how do you think
[02:37:30.400 --> 02:37:31.560]   you're not capable of evil?
[02:37:31.560 --> 02:37:36.560]   And P.S., if you're connected to the supply chain, friend,
[02:37:36.560 --> 02:37:39.920]   you're doing evil, you're paying taxes,
[02:37:39.920 --> 02:37:43.680]   you're supporting the worst things in the world.
[02:37:43.680 --> 02:37:47.500]   I mean, you know, like diffusion of responsibility,
[02:37:47.500 --> 02:37:51.480]   it's really curious, or the circumference of responsibility
[02:37:51.480 --> 02:37:54.280]   where it's like bombs are going off somewhere
[02:37:54.280 --> 02:37:59.280]   that were paid for in some small part by you,
[02:37:59.280 --> 02:38:04.000]   some fractional, if you, if an American,
[02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:08.960]   if a drone is flying over a village in Afghanistan
[02:38:08.960 --> 02:38:12.560]   and drops a bomb and you pay taxes,
[02:38:12.560 --> 02:38:17.120]   then you could say you have fractional ownership
[02:38:17.120 --> 02:38:18.800]   over that drone.
[02:38:18.800 --> 02:38:22.280]   - You're a cog in the machine of evil in some sense.
[02:38:22.280 --> 02:38:24.440]   - And I know what you're gonna say,
[02:38:24.440 --> 02:38:26.440]   well, yeah, but I have to fucking pay taxes.
[02:38:26.440 --> 02:38:28.400]   Like I have no choice, there's sales tax,
[02:38:28.400 --> 02:38:29.800]   there's this or that.
[02:38:29.800 --> 02:38:32.720]   Take that attitude, it's the same thing
[02:38:32.720 --> 02:38:34.660]   that people on the battlefield,
[02:38:34.660 --> 02:38:37.620]   when they're sending missiles into other tanks,
[02:38:37.620 --> 02:38:39.040]   they're thinking the same thing.
[02:38:39.040 --> 02:38:42.320]   It's just, they're more directly responsible
[02:38:42.320 --> 02:38:43.280]   for what's going on.
[02:38:43.280 --> 02:38:48.280]   But in Buddhism, this idea of dependent co-arising,
[02:38:48.280 --> 02:38:51.480]   or yeah, dependent co-arising, we're all connected,
[02:38:51.480 --> 02:38:54.600]   we're all part of this matrix, we're all connected,
[02:38:54.600 --> 02:38:57.640]   meaning we all share responsibility
[02:38:57.640 --> 02:38:58.720]   for the evil in the world.
[02:38:58.720 --> 02:39:03.420]   So even if you aren't directly committing evil acts,
[02:39:03.420 --> 02:39:05.680]   if you're seeing something in the world
[02:39:05.680 --> 02:39:08.280]   and you're thinking that's evil,
[02:39:08.280 --> 02:39:10.680]   you're probably not quite as separated from that
[02:39:10.680 --> 02:39:11.800]   as you'd like to believe
[02:39:11.800 --> 02:39:16.800]   in some tiny, infinitesimally quantum way,
[02:39:16.800 --> 02:39:19.320]   you're connected.
[02:39:19.320 --> 02:39:23.200]   - And there is a sense, I've gotten to experience this
[02:39:23.200 --> 02:39:25.240]   over and over, that one individual
[02:39:25.240 --> 02:39:27.600]   can actually make a gigantic difference.
[02:39:27.600 --> 02:39:33.440]   Not only is there a diffusion of responsibility,
[02:39:33.440 --> 02:39:37.360]   there's a kind of paralysis about, well, what can I do?
[02:39:37.360 --> 02:39:38.520]   - Yeah.
[02:39:38.520 --> 02:39:40.960]   - Sure, I understand, but what can I do?
[02:39:40.960 --> 02:39:45.100]   And I think just looking at history,
[02:39:46.160 --> 02:39:50.040]   and also hanging out and becoming friends,
[02:39:50.040 --> 02:39:51.840]   but also interviewing people that have had
[02:39:51.840 --> 02:39:56.000]   a tremendous impact, you realize you're just one dude.
[02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:58.640]   You're like a normal person.
[02:39:58.640 --> 02:40:00.560]   You're not that smart even.
[02:40:00.560 --> 02:40:04.280]   A lot of people aren't in some kind of magical way
[02:40:04.280 --> 02:40:07.280]   where you have a big head that's figuring out everything.
[02:40:07.280 --> 02:40:12.080]   No, you just saw problems in the world,
[02:40:12.080 --> 02:40:13.960]   and you're like, hey, I think I'm gonna try
[02:40:13.960 --> 02:40:15.200]   to do something about this.
[02:40:15.200 --> 02:40:17.320]   And you stay focused and dedicated to it
[02:40:17.320 --> 02:40:21.040]   for a prolonged period of time, and refuse to quit,
[02:40:21.040 --> 02:40:23.040]   refuse to listen to people that tell you
[02:40:23.040 --> 02:40:26.280]   that this isn't impossible, here's how others have failed.
[02:40:26.280 --> 02:40:29.040]   - Yeah. - No, I'm gonna do it.
[02:40:29.040 --> 02:40:30.240]   - That's it.
[02:40:30.240 --> 02:40:31.600]   That's it. - And one person,
[02:40:31.600 --> 02:40:33.320]   and then you kinda, the thing is,
[02:40:33.320 --> 02:40:37.040]   when there's one person that keeps pushing forward that way,
[02:40:37.040 --> 02:40:38.320]   humans are sticky.
[02:40:38.320 --> 02:40:40.320]   Other people follow 'em around,
[02:40:40.320 --> 02:40:41.720]   and they're like, I'll help.
[02:40:43.880 --> 02:40:45.480]   And then the other people help,
[02:40:45.480 --> 02:40:47.760]   and then the cool people all gather together
[02:40:47.760 --> 02:40:49.800]   'cause they kinda get excited about this way.
[02:40:49.800 --> 02:40:52.080]   Holy shit, we can actually make a difference.
[02:40:52.080 --> 02:40:54.680]   And they form groups, and then all of a sudden,
[02:40:54.680 --> 02:40:56.040]   there's companies and nations
[02:40:56.040 --> 02:40:58.240]   that actually make a gigantic difference.
[02:40:58.240 --> 02:40:59.080]   It's interesting. - Right.
[02:40:59.080 --> 02:41:01.880]   - It all starts with one person, often.
[02:41:01.880 --> 02:41:02.720]   - You know what?
[02:41:02.720 --> 02:41:04.640]   If I could push back slightly against that,
[02:41:04.640 --> 02:41:06.040]   it's never just one person.
[02:41:06.040 --> 02:41:09.920]   It's like, nobody ever talks about,
[02:41:09.920 --> 02:41:11.320]   at least as far as I'm aware,
[02:41:11.360 --> 02:41:14.640]   you never hear about Buddha's great-grandmother.
[02:41:14.640 --> 02:41:15.840]   You never hear about that.
[02:41:15.840 --> 02:41:16.760]   You never hear about that.
[02:41:16.760 --> 02:41:20.080]   But if not for that person, no Buddhism.
[02:41:20.080 --> 02:41:23.560]   The people you're talking about,
[02:41:23.560 --> 02:41:26.280]   they are the tip of the iceberg
[02:41:26.280 --> 02:41:29.440]   that pops up out of the ocean of history,
[02:41:29.440 --> 02:41:34.320]   and you never see all the little things
[02:41:34.320 --> 02:41:36.480]   that helped that happen.
[02:41:36.480 --> 02:41:39.840]   And so to me, this is where the real,
[02:41:39.840 --> 02:41:41.360]   like, how do you help?
[02:41:41.360 --> 02:41:42.960]   What's something you can do?
[02:41:42.960 --> 02:41:45.920]   Well, recognize that first,
[02:41:45.920 --> 02:41:47.320]   that you don't really,
[02:41:47.320 --> 02:41:48.600]   you might not even be aware
[02:41:48.600 --> 02:41:51.040]   of how much you're impacting people around you.
[02:41:51.040 --> 02:41:53.320]   You might think that you're not,
[02:41:53.320 --> 02:41:55.400]   or you might think, surely not,
[02:41:55.400 --> 02:41:57.440]   in a way that makes a big difference,
[02:41:57.440 --> 02:42:01.120]   but you have no idea these tipping points
[02:42:01.120 --> 02:42:06.120]   that can lead to the emergence of an Einstein,
[02:42:06.120 --> 02:42:08.800]   a Gandhi, a Martin Luther King.
[02:42:08.800 --> 02:42:11.800]   We can go on and on, a Dostoevsky or whoever.
[02:42:11.800 --> 02:42:14.160]   And so I think that's where, for me,
[02:42:14.160 --> 02:42:16.720]   it goes back to 10 to the part of the garden
[02:42:16.720 --> 02:42:21.560]   you can touch, and then, or even deeper than that,
[02:42:21.560 --> 02:42:24.720]   intention, just like, I'm an idiot,
[02:42:24.720 --> 02:42:26.760]   so I need an idiot's intention,
[02:42:26.760 --> 02:42:29.920]   which is, don't, if you,
[02:42:29.920 --> 02:42:31.400]   I heard the Dalai Lama say it,
[02:42:31.400 --> 02:42:36.000]   if you can help, help.
[02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:38.720]   If you can't help, don't hurt.
[02:42:38.720 --> 02:42:42.200]   Simple, basic, dummy rules,
[02:42:42.200 --> 02:42:46.520]   so that you can, if possible, refrain from hurting,
[02:42:46.520 --> 02:42:49.440]   which might as well be a form of helping.
[02:42:49.440 --> 02:42:53.400]   - And the help doesn't have to be this dramatic thing.
[02:42:53.400 --> 02:42:56.040]   These little acts of kindness,
[02:42:56.040 --> 02:42:59.560]   I don't know, they seem to have,
[02:42:59.560 --> 02:43:01.280]   maybe I believe in kind of karma,
[02:43:01.280 --> 02:43:03.040]   but they seem to have this,
[02:43:03.040 --> 02:43:05.760]   they can have this gigantic ripple effect.
[02:43:05.760 --> 02:43:08.000]   I don't know why that is.
[02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:11.720]   I just, I remember a lot of little acts of kindness
[02:43:11.720 --> 02:43:13.280]   that people have done to me,
[02:43:13.280 --> 02:43:15.700]   and they, what do they do?
[02:43:15.700 --> 02:43:19.280]   One, they fill me with joy and hope for the future.
[02:43:19.280 --> 02:43:21.220]   They give me faith in humanity.
[02:43:21.220 --> 02:43:23.820]   - Yeah.
[02:43:23.820 --> 02:43:28.240]   - That somehow there's a partially dormant desire
[02:43:28.240 --> 02:43:31.760]   in our sort of collective intelligence
[02:43:31.760 --> 02:43:33.400]   to do good in the world,
[02:43:33.400 --> 02:43:36.240]   that most of us want to be good,
[02:43:36.240 --> 02:43:39.120]   that want to do good onto the world.
[02:43:39.120 --> 02:43:42.680]   There's a kindness that's kind of like begging to get out.
[02:43:42.680 --> 02:43:43.520]   - Yeah.
[02:43:43.520 --> 02:43:46.040]   - And those little acts of kindness do just that.
[02:43:46.040 --> 02:43:48.600]   And actually, one of the reasons I loved Austin
[02:43:48.600 --> 02:43:52.120]   and moved here is realizing,
[02:43:52.120 --> 02:43:55.360]   just noticing those little acts of kindness all around me,
[02:43:55.360 --> 02:43:59.240]   just for stupid reasons, just people being really nice.
[02:43:59.240 --> 02:44:03.480]   It's weird, and that kindness combined
[02:44:03.480 --> 02:44:05.400]   with an optimism for the future,
[02:44:05.400 --> 02:44:09.440]   it's just, it's amazing what that can build.
[02:44:09.440 --> 02:44:12.160]   - Yes, yes, it's incredible.
[02:44:12.160 --> 02:44:13.200]   And I know what you're saying.
[02:44:13.200 --> 02:44:17.160]   It's like, you know, we moved to this great neighborhood,
[02:44:17.160 --> 02:44:21.880]   and at this point, I think three,
[02:44:21.880 --> 02:44:25.500]   maybe four of our neighbors have like made food for us
[02:44:25.500 --> 02:44:29.200]   that just shows up with like handwritten lists
[02:44:29.200 --> 02:44:31.700]   of like things they like to do in the area,
[02:44:31.700 --> 02:44:34.120]   and their phone number if we need help.
[02:44:34.120 --> 02:44:38.360]   And it's like, holy shit, that's like,
[02:44:38.360 --> 02:44:40.280]   it might seem like a little act,
[02:44:40.280 --> 02:44:43.360]   but it feels like some kind of atomic love bomb
[02:44:43.360 --> 02:44:46.040]   just went off on your porch when you're looking at that.
[02:44:46.040 --> 02:44:48.120]   I'm like, what the fuck?
[02:44:48.120 --> 02:44:50.720]   You made me a pie?
[02:44:50.720 --> 02:44:53.760]   This is incredible, like this is incredible.
[02:44:53.760 --> 02:44:56.980]   - And also, it's another act to accept that kindness.
[02:44:56.980 --> 02:45:01.080]   It's like a lot of times when I was like in Boston
[02:45:01.080 --> 02:45:03.740]   or San Francisco, certain big cities,
[02:45:03.740 --> 02:45:05.040]   you can think like, oh, okay,
[02:45:05.040 --> 02:45:07.040]   well, they're trying to like somehow,
[02:45:07.040 --> 02:45:10.080]   that's not an act of kindness.
[02:45:10.080 --> 02:45:12.840]   That's some kind of a transactional thing to build up.
[02:45:12.840 --> 02:45:15.160]   It's like a career move for networking,
[02:45:15.160 --> 02:45:16.320]   all that kind of stuff.
[02:45:16.320 --> 02:45:18.280]   But no, if you just accept it for what it is,
[02:45:18.280 --> 02:45:20.200]   a pure act of kindness.
[02:45:20.200 --> 02:45:21.360]   - Fucking Boston.
[02:45:21.360 --> 02:45:25.080]   'Cause for me, I go the opposite route.
[02:45:25.080 --> 02:45:26.640]   'Cause I'm not, even though there is a part of me
[02:45:26.640 --> 02:45:29.240]   that might be a little suspicious or something,
[02:45:29.240 --> 02:45:33.040]   where I go to push that shit back mentally
[02:45:33.040 --> 02:45:34.900]   is I'm like, oh, I don't deserve this.
[02:45:34.900 --> 02:45:37.540]   If they knew what a piece of shit I am,
[02:45:37.540 --> 02:45:38.380]   you're gonna bring me,
[02:45:38.380 --> 02:45:40.540]   I don't never bring cakes to my neighbors.
[02:45:40.540 --> 02:45:41.780]   I wouldn't know how to make a cake.
[02:45:41.780 --> 02:45:42.820]   I don't know how to make anything.
[02:45:42.820 --> 02:45:43.840]   I don't have time.
[02:45:43.840 --> 02:45:45.420]   I should be bringing shit to my neighbors.
[02:45:45.420 --> 02:45:46.340]   Why didn't I do that?
[02:45:46.340 --> 02:45:48.740]   I should have brought, I never do that.
[02:45:48.740 --> 02:45:53.100]   If you're not careful, you can spiral into a vortex
[02:45:53.100 --> 02:45:54.580]   of self-hate from the gift.
[02:45:54.580 --> 02:45:56.340]   So you have to, yeah, you have to learn how to,
[02:45:56.340 --> 02:46:01.060]   in that circuitry, you have to learn how to like accept.
[02:46:01.060 --> 02:46:03.080]   - Yeah, I have that problem really big.
[02:46:03.080 --> 02:46:05.700]   Yeah, like I don't deserve this.
[02:46:05.700 --> 02:46:10.360]   Like I don't, I get so much love from people.
[02:46:10.360 --> 02:46:11.880]   I'm like, well, yeah, they love me
[02:46:11.880 --> 02:46:13.440]   'cause they don't know me.
[02:46:13.440 --> 02:46:15.280]   That's my brain, my little voice.
[02:46:15.280 --> 02:46:19.180]   Like you're not worthy.
[02:46:19.180 --> 02:46:23.960]   You're not worthy of any of this kindness
[02:46:23.960 --> 02:46:24.920]   and all this kind of stuff.
[02:46:24.920 --> 02:46:28.560]   And that could be very, yeah, it can shut you down.
[02:46:28.560 --> 02:46:30.200]   It can be debilitating.
[02:46:30.200 --> 02:46:32.120]   And also it shuts the person down.
[02:46:32.120 --> 02:46:32.960]   I mean, you're talking--
[02:46:32.960 --> 02:46:36.160]   - And that's the dark side is it pushes them away too.
[02:46:36.160 --> 02:46:40.040]   - Yeah, it cuts off this fucking mystical circuitry.
[02:46:40.040 --> 02:46:43.460]   So like the best thing, if that happens to you,
[02:46:43.460 --> 02:46:48.160]   is like accept it joyfully and just all that,
[02:46:48.160 --> 02:46:50.340]   whatever that thing inside of you,
[02:46:50.340 --> 02:46:52.680]   whatever that little thing is.
[02:46:52.680 --> 02:46:56.120]   This is like in the meditation I do,
[02:46:56.120 --> 02:46:58.240]   it's an infuriatingly simple meditation,
[02:46:58.240 --> 02:47:01.680]   but when a thought emerges,
[02:47:01.680 --> 02:47:03.960]   when you are resting your attention on your breath
[02:47:03.960 --> 02:47:06.360]   and then inevitably you think,
[02:47:06.360 --> 02:47:07.320]   you get lost in your thoughts.
[02:47:07.320 --> 02:47:09.360]   And when you catch yourself doing that,
[02:47:09.360 --> 02:47:11.760]   you think thinking
[02:47:11.760 --> 02:47:13.480]   and then return your attention to the breath.
[02:47:13.480 --> 02:47:17.400]   So I like that so that when that part of myself starts,
[02:47:17.400 --> 02:47:20.120]   having its little neurotic semi seizure,
[02:47:20.120 --> 02:47:23.440]   I can just go thinking, whatever, it's just another thought
[02:47:23.440 --> 02:47:28.200]   and then eat the banana bread or whatever they gave you.
[02:47:28.720 --> 02:47:31.800]   - What's the most wild psychedelic experience
[02:47:31.800 --> 02:47:34.560]   you've ever had in a dream, in a vision?
[02:47:34.560 --> 02:47:36.240]   Doesn't have to be drug related.
[02:47:36.240 --> 02:47:40.600]   What's one that jumps to mind that was like,
[02:47:40.600 --> 02:47:42.800]   holy shit, I'm happy to be alive.
[02:47:42.800 --> 02:47:43.880]   Is this life?
[02:47:43.880 --> 02:47:45.280]   - Okay. - This is amazing.
[02:47:45.280 --> 02:47:50.280]   - Yeah, okay, so the one that pops to mind,
[02:47:50.280 --> 02:47:54.080]   I've had a lot of psychedelic experiences,
[02:47:54.080 --> 02:47:56.080]   but in this moment, the one that pops to mind
[02:47:56.080 --> 02:47:58.800]   only because it goes back to what you're talking about,
[02:47:58.800 --> 02:48:01.800]   about this Nietzsche's idea of infinite return.
[02:48:01.800 --> 02:48:09.080]   So I'm a Burning Man and--
[02:48:09.080 --> 02:48:10.400]   - Are you going to Burning Man this time?
[02:48:10.400 --> 02:48:12.600]   - I'm not, I mean, I have kids right now.
[02:48:12.600 --> 02:48:13.640]   I just wanna be around them.
[02:48:13.640 --> 02:48:15.520]   My wife was being so cool about it
[02:48:15.520 --> 02:48:16.720]   and she knows I love Burning Man.
[02:48:16.720 --> 02:48:17.840]   She's like, go to Burning Man.
[02:48:17.840 --> 02:48:22.560]   And I was gonna go and then I just wanna be around my kids
[02:48:22.560 --> 02:48:24.280]   as much as I can right now, but--
[02:48:24.280 --> 02:48:25.400]   - I've never been to Burning Man.
[02:48:25.400 --> 02:48:28.760]   So I don't know how secretive it is that,
[02:48:28.760 --> 02:48:31.600]   I mean, 'cause quite high profile folks go.
[02:48:31.600 --> 02:48:34.040]   - Yeah, everyone knows Elon Musk goes there.
[02:48:34.040 --> 02:48:36.200]   - Isn't it pretty open? - He's got a boat.
[02:48:36.200 --> 02:48:38.200]   You know that?
[02:48:38.200 --> 02:48:39.600]   - I'm touching none of this. - The Musk boat,
[02:48:39.600 --> 02:48:41.280]   you know, it's called art cars.
[02:48:41.280 --> 02:48:42.280]   They all make art cars.
[02:48:42.280 --> 02:48:46.320]   And like part of the burn, what's so beautiful about it
[02:48:46.320 --> 02:48:49.280]   is like, you can't buy anything there, man.
[02:48:49.280 --> 02:48:53.680]   Like I've heard, I don't know if this has changed.
[02:48:53.680 --> 02:48:55.520]   It's been a bit 'cause of the pandemic,
[02:48:55.520 --> 02:48:59.240]   but the only thing you could buy was ice and coffee.
[02:48:59.240 --> 02:49:01.240]   And I think maybe that's changed.
[02:49:01.240 --> 02:49:02.800]   I heard some whisper that that's changed.
[02:49:02.800 --> 02:49:07.360]   But so that means that it's a gifting economy
[02:49:07.360 --> 02:49:08.200]   is what they call it.
[02:49:08.200 --> 02:49:10.960]   And so people will just give you stuff.
[02:49:10.960 --> 02:49:13.520]   Talk about having to struggle with deserving stuff, man.
[02:49:13.520 --> 02:49:17.120]   What are you gonna fucking do when the camp next to you
[02:49:17.120 --> 02:49:20.600]   is like every morning making the best iced coffee
[02:49:20.600 --> 02:49:22.160]   that you've ever had in your life?
[02:49:22.160 --> 02:49:25.840]   And they just are giving it all away till it's all gone.
[02:49:25.840 --> 02:49:26.960]   What are you gonna do?
[02:49:26.960 --> 02:49:30.040]   It's the best ever.
[02:49:30.040 --> 02:49:31.640]   And then you're giving things to people.
[02:49:31.640 --> 02:49:34.280]   And then you learn stuff like,
[02:49:34.280 --> 02:49:36.840]   you learn these really interesting lessons.
[02:49:36.840 --> 02:49:39.840]   Like one of the times I went there,
[02:49:39.840 --> 02:49:44.680]   got all these strawberries.
[02:49:44.680 --> 02:49:46.080]   Might not sound like a big deal,
[02:49:46.080 --> 02:49:48.600]   but when you're out there in the dust
[02:49:48.600 --> 02:49:52.400]   and you're not at one of the hardcore luxury camps,
[02:49:52.400 --> 02:49:53.760]   which do exist out there,
[02:49:53.760 --> 02:49:58.000]   you've got these items where in my mind,
[02:49:58.000 --> 02:49:59.920]   I'm like, yeah, these are gonna be
[02:49:59.920 --> 02:50:01.440]   just for me and my girlfriend,
[02:50:01.440 --> 02:50:04.960]   my special stash fruit and this or that.
[02:50:04.960 --> 02:50:09.360]   And then two days in, you're walking around your camp
[02:50:09.360 --> 02:50:12.880]   with the strawberries that you were coveting
[02:50:12.880 --> 02:50:16.400]   and everyone's so happy to get cold strawberries.
[02:50:16.400 --> 02:50:17.920]   And you've realized, oh my God,
[02:50:17.920 --> 02:50:21.320]   this feels so much better than the way a strawberry tastes.
[02:50:21.320 --> 02:50:25.040]   So you learn something experientially there,
[02:50:25.040 --> 02:50:27.040]   which is an incredible thing.
[02:50:27.040 --> 02:50:29.120]   It's an incredible thing.
[02:50:29.120 --> 02:50:31.880]   Man, now I'm wishing I had decided to go to Burning Man.
[02:50:31.880 --> 02:50:32.880]   - Have you been a few times?
[02:50:32.880 --> 02:50:34.480]   - Yeah, I just know,
[02:50:34.480 --> 02:50:39.200]   at least people were saying it was Elon Musk's boat.
[02:50:39.200 --> 02:50:41.040]   Like, yeah, I think it was like,
[02:50:41.040 --> 02:50:43.600]   it's like this massive, it's art cars.
[02:50:43.600 --> 02:50:45.280]   And it was this party on this thing.
[02:50:45.280 --> 02:50:48.560]   You could just, anyone can go on the boat.
[02:50:48.560 --> 02:50:50.920]   Like, no one's like, there's no guest list.
[02:50:50.920 --> 02:50:52.240]   You just go on there.
[02:50:52.240 --> 02:50:54.600]   I never saw him there, but everyone's whispering,
[02:50:54.600 --> 02:50:56.400]   Elon Musk is here.
[02:50:56.400 --> 02:50:58.360]   - There's a secrecy, there's all that kind of stuff
[02:50:58.360 --> 02:50:59.760]   'cause you probably have to respect that.
[02:50:59.760 --> 02:51:01.160]   But at the same time,
[02:51:01.160 --> 02:51:03.480]   it seems like the kind of people that go there,
[02:51:03.480 --> 02:51:09.560]   I mean, the rules of the outside world are suspended
[02:51:09.560 --> 02:51:14.880]   in the sense that the crime,
[02:51:14.880 --> 02:51:18.000]   the aggression, the tensions,
[02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:19.920]   all of that seems to dissipate somehow.
[02:51:19.920 --> 02:51:22.240]   - Not all the way, not all the way.
[02:51:22.240 --> 02:51:27.120]   You could look it up, 'cause there is tension.
[02:51:27.120 --> 02:51:29.520]   There's a lot of tension there between,
[02:51:29.520 --> 02:51:32.200]   it's called plug and plays.
[02:51:32.200 --> 02:51:34.200]   Like, Burning Man,
[02:51:34.200 --> 02:51:36.920]   like the history of Burning Man is fascinating.
[02:51:36.920 --> 02:51:41.640]   It has its roots in the cacophony societies,
[02:51:41.640 --> 02:51:42.480]   what it was called,
[02:51:42.480 --> 02:51:45.840]   it was a sort of evolution of something that was,
[02:51:45.840 --> 02:51:47.200]   I think it was called the,
[02:51:47.200 --> 02:51:50.560]   God, like the San Francisco,
[02:51:50.560 --> 02:51:54.360]   basically there was like an art movement in San Francisco,
[02:51:54.360 --> 02:51:55.560]   and I can't remember the name of it,
[02:51:55.560 --> 02:51:57.200]   maybe the Suicide Club,
[02:51:57.200 --> 02:51:59.720]   or essentially like,
[02:51:59.720 --> 02:52:02.320]   they were really into urban exploration,
[02:52:02.320 --> 02:52:05.720]   and meaning like breaking into like
[02:52:05.720 --> 02:52:07.840]   old abandoned buildings and stuff.
[02:52:07.840 --> 02:52:10.360]   But part of this, what this was,
[02:52:10.360 --> 02:52:15.360]   was you would prepare your life
[02:52:15.360 --> 02:52:18.000]   as though you were going to kill yourself.
[02:52:18.000 --> 02:52:19.840]   You would get all your affairs in order.
[02:52:19.840 --> 02:52:20.760]   You would get,
[02:52:20.760 --> 02:52:22.400]   so it's going back to what we were talking about
[02:52:22.400 --> 02:52:23.440]   with the cancer diagnosis.
[02:52:23.440 --> 02:52:27.960]   You're like sort of putting yourself into that world
[02:52:27.960 --> 02:52:29.520]   of like, I'm gonna get all my affairs together
[02:52:29.520 --> 02:52:30.360]   as though this is it.
[02:52:30.360 --> 02:52:32.000]   And then there was some,
[02:52:32.000 --> 02:52:33.800]   I'm sorry for anyone listening if I'm butchering this,
[02:52:33.800 --> 02:52:35.840]   but I think there was some really cool initiation
[02:52:35.840 --> 02:52:37.600]   where they would blindfold you,
[02:52:37.600 --> 02:52:38.440]   and they would take you
[02:52:38.440 --> 02:52:40.560]   into some of these abandoned buildings,
[02:52:40.560 --> 02:52:41.960]   and you didn't know where you were walking,
[02:52:41.960 --> 02:52:42.800]   but they would say like,
[02:52:42.800 --> 02:52:47.080]   if you take one step to the left, you're gonna die.
[02:52:47.080 --> 02:52:48.080]   You're gonna fall off.
[02:52:48.080 --> 02:52:48.920]   You're gonna fall.
[02:52:48.920 --> 02:52:50.160]   So please be careful.
[02:52:50.160 --> 02:52:52.560]   So you're like, in the moment,
[02:52:52.560 --> 02:52:53.960]   and then blindfold comes off.
[02:52:53.960 --> 02:52:55.680]   It's a big, awesome party.
[02:52:55.680 --> 02:52:59.000]   This evolves into something called the Cacophony Society.
[02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:01.560]   There's a great book called Tales of the Cacophony Society
[02:53:01.560 --> 02:53:02.600]   for people listening.
[02:53:02.600 --> 02:53:07.800]   One of the members of the Cacophony Society
[02:53:07.800 --> 02:53:10.000]   was the author of "Fight Club."
[02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:11.680]   And so if you've seen "Fight Club,"
[02:53:11.680 --> 02:53:13.240]   like you could see little ideas
[02:53:13.240 --> 02:53:14.960]   that were in the Cacophony Society.
[02:53:14.960 --> 02:53:18.840]   They were into Dadaism,
[02:53:18.840 --> 02:53:20.320]   which I don't know a lot about.
[02:53:20.320 --> 02:53:21.160]   Like, I don't know,
[02:53:21.160 --> 02:53:23.120]   but it's a philosophical art movement.
[02:53:23.120 --> 02:53:27.800]   And then so basically what was happening is like,
[02:53:27.800 --> 02:53:30.920]   they kept burning increasingly large effigies
[02:53:30.920 --> 02:53:34.280]   in San Francisco, and they weren't allowed to do it.
[02:53:34.280 --> 02:53:36.360]   And so they took it out in the desert.
[02:53:36.360 --> 02:53:40.680]   And they were basing it on something called a zone trip,
[02:53:40.680 --> 02:53:43.640]   which is like, across this border,
[02:53:43.640 --> 02:53:46.160]   the rules of that old society are gone.
[02:53:46.160 --> 02:53:50.040]   And so that was the original Burning Man,
[02:53:50.040 --> 02:53:55.040]   which was these lunatics out in the desert,
[02:53:55.040 --> 02:53:59.600]   launching like burning pianos out of catapults
[02:53:59.600 --> 02:54:03.320]   through the air, doing like drive-by shooting ranges,
[02:54:03.320 --> 02:54:08.320]   like no rules, wild, magical, beautiful, insane madness.
[02:54:08.320 --> 02:54:14.440]   And then it grew and grew and grew and grew
[02:54:14.440 --> 02:54:17.280]   until you have Burning Man as it is today,
[02:54:17.280 --> 02:54:19.440]   which is still the most incredible thing.
[02:54:19.440 --> 02:54:22.000]   I mean, obviously, anytime you have like a thing
[02:54:22.000 --> 02:54:23.480]   that's been around for a while,
[02:54:23.480 --> 02:54:24.320]   you're gonna get that,
[02:54:24.320 --> 02:54:26.240]   "It's not like it used to be.
[02:54:26.240 --> 02:54:27.520]   It's not as free as it used to be."
[02:54:27.520 --> 02:54:28.360]   So this or that,
[02:54:28.360 --> 02:54:30.200]   but what's fascinating about Burning Man,
[02:54:30.200 --> 02:54:32.360]   someone pointed this out to me,
[02:54:32.360 --> 02:54:37.360]   look on the ground, no trash, no cigarettes.
[02:54:37.360 --> 02:54:40.320]   The ethic of like picking up your shit there
[02:54:40.320 --> 02:54:42.400]   is like so intense.
[02:54:42.400 --> 02:54:44.800]   So it's not like the other festivals you go to
[02:54:44.800 --> 02:54:46.520]   where there's just trash everywhere,
[02:54:46.520 --> 02:54:48.440]   shit scattered everywhere.
[02:54:48.440 --> 02:54:49.360]   It's clean.
[02:54:49.360 --> 02:54:51.440]   People are picking up their stuff.
[02:54:51.440 --> 02:54:54.520]   People are like really being conscious
[02:54:54.520 --> 02:54:56.480]   of like not fucking up the playa.
[02:54:56.480 --> 02:55:01.280]   So I'm sorry, don't get a burner yapping about Burning Man.
[02:55:01.280 --> 02:55:02.760]   We won't stop.
[02:55:02.760 --> 02:55:03.720]   It'll be morning.
[02:55:03.720 --> 02:55:07.840]   - But there's a power to culture
[02:55:07.840 --> 02:55:10.000]   propagating itself through the stories
[02:55:10.000 --> 02:55:10.840]   that we tell each other.
[02:55:10.840 --> 02:55:14.480]   And that holds up for Burning Man.
[02:55:14.480 --> 02:55:16.920]   It's clear that the culture has stayed strong
[02:55:16.920 --> 02:55:17.760]   throughout the years.
[02:55:17.760 --> 02:55:18.600]   - Yes.
[02:55:18.600 --> 02:55:22.080]   - So many people, so many really interesting people
[02:55:22.080 --> 02:55:28.280]   speak of Burning Man as like a sacred place they go to
[02:55:28.280 --> 02:55:31.080]   to remind themselves about what's important.
[02:55:31.080 --> 02:55:31.920]   - Yes.
[02:55:31.920 --> 02:55:32.760]   - That's so interesting.
[02:55:32.760 --> 02:55:34.200]   - And it is, and it is.
[02:55:34.200 --> 02:55:36.280]   I mean, it's like, you know, there are all these stories
[02:55:36.280 --> 02:55:38.280]   of like, I love guru stories.
[02:55:38.280 --> 02:55:40.680]   I have a guru, Neem Kroli Baba, never met him.
[02:55:40.680 --> 02:55:43.720]   He was Ram Dass' guru, at least not in the flesh.
[02:55:43.720 --> 02:55:46.600]   But the story of the guru is if you're lucky,
[02:55:46.600 --> 02:55:48.880]   you meet this being that,
[02:55:48.880 --> 02:55:50.320]   and we're not talking about, you know,
[02:55:50.320 --> 02:55:54.240]   whatever the run of the mill like charlatans out there.
[02:55:54.240 --> 02:55:59.240]   Like I know for sure that people are in the world right now
[02:56:00.280 --> 02:56:05.280]   who, when you're around them,
[02:56:05.280 --> 02:56:07.000]   the thing you're talking about,
[02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:10.520]   the affirmation of the potential of humanity
[02:56:10.520 --> 02:56:12.640]   and also just an acceptance of yourself
[02:56:12.640 --> 02:56:14.600]   and, you know, cultivate,
[02:56:14.600 --> 02:56:18.400]   like seeing someone who's cultivated love
[02:56:18.400 --> 02:56:21.160]   or compassion or whatever, but in this way that is,
[02:56:21.160 --> 02:56:25.440]   I mean, you would almost,
[02:56:25.440 --> 02:56:28.440]   you would rather meet that being
[02:56:28.440 --> 02:56:30.480]   than like a UFO land in your backyard.
[02:56:30.480 --> 02:56:31.880]   It's like, it is the UFO.
[02:56:31.880 --> 02:56:33.760]   It's a person, but it's not.
[02:56:33.760 --> 02:56:35.960]   It's everybody and nobody.
[02:56:35.960 --> 02:56:40.600]   And somehow they like end up conveying to you
[02:56:40.600 --> 02:56:45.240]   ideas that you may have heard a million times before,
[02:56:45.240 --> 02:56:48.320]   but somehow within the language itself
[02:56:48.320 --> 02:56:52.280]   is a transmission that permanently alters you.
[02:56:52.280 --> 02:56:54.800]   And so these people exist.
[02:56:54.800 --> 02:56:57.040]   I think you could argue that Burning Man,
[02:56:57.040 --> 02:57:01.600]   the total thing is a guru,
[02:57:01.600 --> 02:57:04.160]   that a pilgrimage is involved to get there.
[02:57:04.160 --> 02:57:08.240]   Like it's not easy to get there.
[02:57:08.240 --> 02:57:12.760]   And when you get there, it's gonna teach you something.
[02:57:12.760 --> 02:57:14.200]   It's gonna show you something.
[02:57:14.200 --> 02:57:17.680]   It's going to, and maybe some of the stuff it shows you
[02:57:17.680 --> 02:57:22.680]   might not be great, but the community around you
[02:57:22.960 --> 02:57:27.120]   will hold you as you're like,
[02:57:27.120 --> 02:57:30.120]   whatever the thing is that's coming out of you.
[02:57:30.120 --> 02:57:31.600]   - And even the simplest activities,
[02:57:31.600 --> 02:57:35.600]   the simplest exchange of words have,
[02:57:35.600 --> 02:57:40.600]   like Jessica, with the gurus, a profound impact somehow.
[02:57:40.600 --> 02:57:42.520]   Something about that place.
[02:57:42.520 --> 02:57:43.560]   - Yeah.
[02:57:43.560 --> 02:57:46.440]   Not to mention the insane synchronicities,
[02:57:46.440 --> 02:57:48.800]   like insane synchronicities there.
[02:57:48.800 --> 02:57:52.480]   And I think like, to get back to the notion of sentience
[02:57:52.480 --> 02:57:57.480]   as a byproduct of a harmonized yet hyper-complex system,
[02:57:57.480 --> 02:58:03.160]   I think synchronicities, like those kinds of systems
[02:58:03.160 --> 02:58:05.280]   are like lightning rods for synchronicity.
[02:58:05.280 --> 02:58:10.280]   So crazy, not just because your high synchronicities
[02:58:10.280 --> 02:58:13.280]   happen that are impossible,
[02:58:13.280 --> 02:58:14.840]   where you just have to deal with it.
[02:58:14.840 --> 02:58:16.960]   And like, you'll need something,
[02:58:16.960 --> 02:58:19.200]   and within a few minutes, someone's like,
[02:58:19.200 --> 02:58:20.800]   oh, here you go.
[02:58:20.800 --> 02:58:22.280]   - And you mentioned, by the way,
[02:58:22.280 --> 02:58:25.680]   Burning Man, 'cause of a psychedelic experience,
[02:58:25.680 --> 02:58:29.360]   is it the strawberries, or was it something else?
[02:58:29.360 --> 02:58:31.720]   What was the moment that was magical?
[02:58:31.720 --> 02:58:32.720]   - No, it was DMT.
[02:58:32.720 --> 02:58:34.600]   Well, it definitely wasn't strawberries.
[02:58:34.600 --> 02:58:35.840]   It wasn't strawberries.
[02:58:35.840 --> 02:58:38.080]   (laughing)
[02:58:38.080 --> 02:58:39.800]   No, I was--
[02:58:39.800 --> 02:58:41.040]   - More potent.
[02:58:41.040 --> 02:58:44.640]   - Yeah, I was smoking DMT, and...
[02:58:44.640 --> 02:58:46.800]   (silence)
[02:58:46.800 --> 02:58:52.720]   Like, I saw, like, if you, in the Midnight Gospel,
[02:58:52.720 --> 02:58:55.440]   there are these bovine creatures
[02:58:55.440 --> 02:58:58.640]   that have like a long neck and a lantern head.
[02:58:58.640 --> 02:59:01.920]   So like, I saw one of those things,
[02:59:01.920 --> 02:59:06.920]   and, you know, I thought it was funny and like ridiculous,
[02:59:06.920 --> 02:59:13.320]   'cause you hear like all the Terrence McKenna stories
[02:59:13.320 --> 02:59:16.640]   of the self-transforming machine elves,
[02:59:16.640 --> 02:59:20.800]   or all the purple or the magenta goddess everyone sees.
[02:59:20.800 --> 02:59:23.000]   I'm like, so this is what I get?
[02:59:23.000 --> 02:59:26.320]   Like, a fucking cow with a lantern head?
[02:59:26.320 --> 02:59:28.360]   Like, that's where my brain is at
[02:59:28.360 --> 02:59:30.800]   and we're interacting with this molecule?
[02:59:30.800 --> 02:59:35.680]   So then, like, I look away.
[02:59:35.680 --> 02:59:40.680]   And again, this is DMT, so when I say look away,
[02:59:40.680 --> 02:59:42.840]   do I mean with my eyes shut, I look away,
[02:59:42.840 --> 02:59:44.120]   or eyes open, I look away?
[02:59:44.120 --> 02:59:46.120]   I think eyes shut.
[02:59:46.120 --> 02:59:47.840]   So it sounds weird to say look away,
[02:59:47.840 --> 02:59:52.000]   but however you wanna put it, that's what I did.
[02:59:52.000 --> 02:59:55.000]   And I look back, and it's still there.
[02:59:55.000 --> 02:59:56.840]   Only now it's, you know, 'cause usually in,
[02:59:56.840 --> 02:59:59.040]   like, when you're having those kinds of visions,
[02:59:59.040 --> 03:00:01.360]   they go away pretty quickly.
[03:00:01.360 --> 03:00:04.360]   This thing's like moved, like shambled ahead
[03:00:04.360 --> 03:00:07.520]   maybe a few steps, just like a cow, just like a cow.
[03:00:07.520 --> 03:00:12.080]   And then that was when the, you know,
[03:00:12.080 --> 03:00:13.360]   all the stories you hear about it,
[03:00:13.360 --> 03:00:15.200]   like going through some kind of tube
[03:00:15.200 --> 03:00:17.120]   or some kind of light tunnel,
[03:00:17.120 --> 03:00:18.880]   like a water slide made of light
[03:00:18.880 --> 03:00:21.840]   that's increasingly familiar.
[03:00:21.840 --> 03:00:23.440]   That's the wildest part of it.
[03:00:23.440 --> 03:00:25.360]   It's like, oh, I know this place.
[03:00:25.360 --> 03:00:27.200]   Not like, oh, I've seen this in, like,
[03:00:27.200 --> 03:00:29.760]   you know, on, like, bong stickers,
[03:00:29.760 --> 03:00:32.360]   but like, oh yeah, this is that place you go to.
[03:00:32.360 --> 03:00:34.440]   You just remember, oh, this place.
[03:00:34.440 --> 03:00:39.080]   And then it was like I was in some kind of,
[03:00:40.840 --> 03:00:42.760]   I don't know how to put it, a chamber,
[03:00:42.760 --> 03:00:45.920]   a technological chamber, some kind of supercomputer,
[03:00:45.920 --> 03:00:49.400]   some kind of nucleus that was technological.
[03:00:49.400 --> 03:00:50.520]   And it was inviting.
[03:00:50.520 --> 03:00:52.560]   There was an invitation of, like,
[03:00:52.560 --> 03:00:56.360]   come in, like, come deeper in.
[03:00:56.360 --> 03:01:00.120]   And you can talk to whatever it is over there.
[03:01:00.120 --> 03:01:02.760]   You don't talk, but there's a communication.
[03:01:02.760 --> 03:01:07.760]   And I communicated, but my friends, I don't,
[03:01:07.760 --> 03:01:08.800]   I love my friends.
[03:01:08.800 --> 03:01:10.360]   I guess I had some sense in that moment
[03:01:10.360 --> 03:01:15.160]   that it would mean complete obliteration or who knows what.
[03:01:15.160 --> 03:01:18.240]   And the response that it gave back was,
[03:01:18.240 --> 03:01:20.600]   you can always go back there.
[03:01:20.600 --> 03:01:23.760]   And that's when I opened my eyes, I'm back, totally.
[03:01:23.760 --> 03:01:27.600]   And ever since then, that's caused me to revise
[03:01:27.600 --> 03:01:30.760]   my thinking on reincarnation,
[03:01:30.760 --> 03:01:33.320]   the idea that you die and you start as a baby
[03:01:33.320 --> 03:01:34.880]   and then live your life again.
[03:01:34.880 --> 03:01:36.920]   It goes right into what we were talking about,
[03:01:36.920 --> 03:01:39.680]   you know, that maybe data, you know,
[03:01:39.680 --> 03:01:41.400]   that the shit I saw in nitrous oxide,
[03:01:41.400 --> 03:01:43.720]   I don't feel dumb that my epiphanies are all related
[03:01:43.720 --> 03:01:46.240]   to drugs, but not all of them are, a lot of them.
[03:01:46.240 --> 03:01:49.720]   But this notion of like, oh, is it that we're
[03:01:49.720 --> 03:01:56.040]   imprinting into the medium of time-space
[03:01:56.040 --> 03:02:01.040]   every thing we do, and that that is a permanent imprint,
[03:02:01.040 --> 03:02:06.280]   a frame that upon death can be accessed
[03:02:07.280 --> 03:02:10.080]   in the same way we can pull up pictures
[03:02:10.080 --> 03:02:12.240]   on our phone or computers,
[03:02:12.240 --> 03:02:16.280]   and not only access, but experienced as though,
[03:02:16.280 --> 03:02:20.160]   in other words, you could just jump in.
[03:02:20.160 --> 03:02:22.000]   You're still gonna have your memories.
[03:02:22.000 --> 03:02:26.280]   It's gonna give you the illusion of having been a kid
[03:02:26.280 --> 03:02:28.760]   and gotten to that frame, but no,
[03:02:28.760 --> 03:02:33.200]   you just decided to go back there, nostalgia, whatever.
[03:02:33.200 --> 03:02:34.960]   And yeah.
[03:02:34.960 --> 03:02:37.320]   - You can jump around freely in space and time.
[03:02:37.320 --> 03:02:40.160]   - Yeah, yeah, you can go in and out of time-space.
[03:02:40.160 --> 03:02:43.800]   But the problem is when you go into time-space, it's time.
[03:02:43.800 --> 03:02:45.240]   So it's gonna feel sticky.
[03:02:45.240 --> 03:02:46.600]   It's gonna feel like you've been here forever
[03:02:46.600 --> 03:02:49.000]   'cause you've dropped back onto the track
[03:02:49.000 --> 03:02:50.600]   that Nietzsche's talking about.
[03:02:50.600 --> 03:02:54.160]   And I guess one of the qualities of dropping
[03:02:54.160 --> 03:02:57.000]   into that frame is that you forget
[03:02:57.000 --> 03:03:00.960]   your higher dimensional identity.
[03:03:00.960 --> 03:03:03.160]   - What happened to the cow with the lantern?
[03:03:04.400 --> 03:03:05.920]   Was that goodbye?
[03:03:05.920 --> 03:03:09.640]   - He writes me letters sometimes.
[03:03:09.640 --> 03:03:11.000]   (laughing)
[03:03:11.000 --> 03:03:12.280]   Never saw it again.
[03:03:12.280 --> 03:03:13.120]   - Never?
[03:03:13.120 --> 03:03:14.120]   - Never saw it again.
[03:03:14.120 --> 03:03:17.040]   But we put it in the Midnight Gospel.
[03:03:17.040 --> 03:03:22.040]   Pendleton was such a genius and he drew it for me,
[03:03:22.040 --> 03:03:24.400]   and then it just ended up as a part of the show.
[03:03:24.400 --> 03:03:26.840]   - But by the way, I have to admit,
[03:03:26.840 --> 03:03:27.960]   as a big fan of yours,
[03:03:27.960 --> 03:03:29.880]   I haven't watched the Midnight Gospel
[03:03:29.880 --> 03:03:31.720]   'cause I've been waiting.
[03:03:33.480 --> 03:03:34.840]   I do these stupid things.
[03:03:34.840 --> 03:03:36.440]   But ever since you talked to,
[03:03:36.440 --> 03:03:39.840]   maybe two years ago with Joe about it,
[03:03:39.840 --> 03:03:41.920]   I've been waiting to watch it
[03:03:41.920 --> 03:03:44.440]   with a special person on mushrooms.
[03:03:44.440 --> 03:03:45.280]   - Oh.
[03:03:45.280 --> 03:03:46.320]   - That's been in my to-do.
[03:03:46.320 --> 03:03:48.160]   I don't know, of course you don't have to be
[03:03:48.160 --> 03:03:49.560]   on mushrooms to enjoy it.
[03:03:49.560 --> 03:03:52.520]   But for some reason I put it into my head
[03:03:52.520 --> 03:03:55.080]   that this is something I wanna do with somebody else.
[03:03:55.080 --> 03:03:56.960]   I can experience it and get wild.
[03:03:56.960 --> 03:03:57.960]   - Love it.
[03:03:57.960 --> 03:04:00.960]   - 'Cause visually, I mean, I watched a bunch of it,
[03:04:00.960 --> 03:04:02.560]   just a little bit here and there.
[03:04:02.560 --> 03:04:05.920]   But it's just visually such an interesting experience.
[03:04:05.920 --> 03:04:07.680]   - Thank you.
[03:04:07.680 --> 03:04:08.520]   - Combined with everything else,
[03:04:08.520 --> 03:04:12.080]   obviously the ideas, the voices and so on.
[03:04:12.080 --> 03:04:16.920]   But just visually, it's like a super psychedelic version
[03:04:16.920 --> 03:04:19.040]   of Rick and Morty or something like that.
[03:04:19.040 --> 03:04:23.080]   Farther out, while they're out there.
[03:04:23.080 --> 03:04:26.080]   - Yeah, man, that's Pendleton.
[03:04:26.080 --> 03:04:29.880]   These people, I mean, I was part of that
[03:04:31.720 --> 03:04:35.280]   in the sense that Pendleton gave,
[03:04:35.280 --> 03:04:37.080]   one of the reasons he's such a genius
[03:04:37.080 --> 03:04:41.200]   and great at making stuff is he really does a good job
[03:04:41.200 --> 03:04:46.080]   of just de-hierarchizing potential hierarchies
[03:04:46.080 --> 03:04:47.480]   that can appear.
[03:04:47.480 --> 03:04:50.120]   Someone has to be driving the bus,
[03:04:50.120 --> 03:04:51.200]   and that was Pendleton.
[03:04:51.200 --> 03:04:54.080]   But he's so inclusive.
[03:04:54.080 --> 03:04:57.240]   There's a real punk rock thing that he's doing,
[03:04:57.240 --> 03:04:58.880]   which is he'll take everything.
[03:04:58.880 --> 03:05:01.200]   And it kind of mixes its way into the show.
[03:05:01.200 --> 03:05:06.200]   But one of the things, in animation,
[03:05:06.200 --> 03:05:11.760]   it can get really strict with drawing the characters
[03:05:11.760 --> 03:05:16.600]   and trying to create continuity
[03:05:16.600 --> 03:05:19.240]   in the way the character looks.
[03:05:19.240 --> 03:05:21.800]   And it can get really brute for the animator.
[03:05:21.800 --> 03:05:24.400]   It can get brutally precise.
[03:05:24.400 --> 03:05:26.360]   It has to be precise.
[03:05:26.360 --> 03:05:28.560]   But he figured out that if you just sort of,
[03:05:30.240 --> 03:05:32.680]   it's not like, obviously, like Clancy had to look
[03:05:32.680 --> 03:05:34.040]   like Clancy through the whole show,
[03:05:34.040 --> 03:05:36.520]   but if you allow the various people animating it
[03:05:36.520 --> 03:05:39.280]   to sort of have their own spin on it,
[03:05:39.280 --> 03:05:42.200]   then suddenly it creates a very psychedelic,
[03:05:42.200 --> 03:05:45.040]   the show looks more psychedelic
[03:05:45.040 --> 03:05:46.200]   because it looks more organic.
[03:05:46.200 --> 03:05:49.080]   And also the amount of time, I had no idea,
[03:05:49.080 --> 03:05:54.080]   the amount of time that goes into making digital art
[03:05:54.080 --> 03:05:58.680]   look like that is, it's insane.
[03:05:58.680 --> 03:06:03.680]   The amount of work in comping that stuff is just crazy.
[03:06:03.680 --> 03:06:04.960]   It's crazy.
[03:06:04.960 --> 03:06:07.360]   - Generally, the amount of time it takes,
[03:06:07.360 --> 03:06:08.840]   even just like a painting,
[03:06:08.840 --> 03:06:13.280]   I really enjoy watching artists do a time-lapse
[03:06:13.280 --> 03:06:15.120]   and you realize how much effort
[03:06:15.120 --> 03:06:19.280]   just into a single image goes into it.
[03:06:19.280 --> 03:06:21.080]   Hours and hours and hours, sometimes days,
[03:06:21.080 --> 03:06:23.160]   sometimes weeks and months.
[03:06:23.160 --> 03:06:24.800]   And then you just get to see them work,
[03:06:24.800 --> 03:06:28.400]   but they lose themselves in the craftsmanship of it
[03:06:28.400 --> 03:06:30.400]   and the rhythm of it.
[03:06:30.400 --> 03:06:32.680]   And because they're focused on the,
[03:06:32.680 --> 03:06:34.480]   so we were talking about robotics earlier,
[03:06:34.480 --> 03:06:35.680]   like on the little details,
[03:06:35.680 --> 03:06:37.280]   like they're never look,
[03:06:37.280 --> 03:06:40.000]   well, most of the time isn't spent looking
[03:06:40.000 --> 03:06:41.720]   at the big picture of the final result,
[03:06:41.720 --> 03:06:44.880]   it's looking at the little details there and so on.
[03:06:44.880 --> 03:06:47.560]   But they're nevertheless able to somehow
[03:06:47.560 --> 03:06:50.400]   constantly channel the big picture, the final result.
[03:06:50.400 --> 03:06:51.360]   - My God.
[03:06:51.360 --> 03:06:53.800]   Yeah, the respect I have for animators,
[03:06:53.800 --> 03:06:56.880]   it's like, dear God,
[03:06:56.880 --> 03:06:59.440]   it's the craziest thing when you watch it,
[03:06:59.440 --> 03:07:01.160]   when you see what it looks like
[03:07:01.160 --> 03:07:03.400]   and how much time goes into it
[03:07:03.400 --> 03:07:04.600]   and how zen they have to be,
[03:07:04.600 --> 03:07:05.440]   'cause no matter what,
[03:07:05.440 --> 03:07:07.240]   you're gonna have to cut stuff, man.
[03:07:07.240 --> 03:07:10.400]   And when you're cutting a few seconds of animation,
[03:07:10.400 --> 03:07:12.560]   that was someone's month maybe.
[03:07:12.560 --> 03:07:19.360]   They understand, but still it's like, whoa, it's brutal.
[03:07:19.360 --> 03:07:24.360]   So they have like this zen outlook on it,
[03:07:24.360 --> 03:07:26.360]   which is really cool.
[03:07:26.360 --> 03:07:28.120]   And they watch podcasts, that's the other cool thing,
[03:07:28.120 --> 03:07:30.480]   when you realize like, oh, they're listening to podcasts
[03:07:30.480 --> 03:07:34.400]   or like, that's really cool to see that aspect of it too.
[03:07:34.400 --> 03:07:36.920]   But yeah, man, I, you know.
[03:07:36.920 --> 03:07:38.480]   - Yeah, your voice is in the ears
[03:07:38.480 --> 03:07:40.320]   of a lot of interesting people.
[03:07:40.320 --> 03:07:41.440]   - Yours too.
[03:07:41.440 --> 03:07:42.280]   (laughing)
[03:07:42.280 --> 03:07:43.120]   And I, you know.
[03:07:43.120 --> 03:07:43.960]   - Hello, interesting person.
[03:07:43.960 --> 03:07:46.920]   - Hello, CIA animators.
[03:07:46.920 --> 03:07:49.600]   Eating delicious food in the cafeteria.
[03:07:49.600 --> 03:07:52.400]   I'm on your side, he's against you, I'm with you.
[03:07:52.400 --> 03:07:53.640]   - Yeah.
[03:07:53.640 --> 03:07:55.120]   - Do you have, you have a beard,
[03:07:55.120 --> 03:07:56.940]   therefore you must be wise.
[03:07:56.940 --> 03:08:01.360]   Do you have advice for young people, high school, college,
[03:08:01.360 --> 03:08:05.480]   about how to carve their path through life?
[03:08:05.480 --> 03:08:10.080]   How to have a life, a career that's successful
[03:08:10.080 --> 03:08:12.880]   that they can be proud of or a life they can be proud of?
[03:08:12.880 --> 03:08:14.800]   - Man, see, this is what kind of,
[03:08:14.800 --> 03:08:18.360]   this is what sucks about my life
[03:08:18.360 --> 03:08:23.360]   is that it's been very random and very spontaneous.
[03:08:23.360 --> 03:08:27.120]   So unfortunately, I don't get that thing
[03:08:27.120 --> 03:08:29.520]   where I could be like, well, here's what I did.
[03:08:29.520 --> 03:08:34.240]   'Cause it's like, I don't, like I inherited $12,000
[03:08:34.240 --> 03:08:35.860]   from my grandmother.
[03:08:35.860 --> 03:08:36.980]   Here's what you do, kids.
[03:08:36.980 --> 03:08:39.640]   You inherit $12,000 when your grandmother dies.
[03:08:39.640 --> 03:08:41.680]   And then you need to be dumb enough
[03:08:41.680 --> 03:08:44.520]   to think that that $12,000 is gonna help you
[03:08:44.520 --> 03:08:46.240]   live in LA for a year.
[03:08:46.240 --> 03:08:49.800]   So then what you do is you move to LA with $12,000
[03:08:49.800 --> 03:08:53.800]   and you find a shitty place that you live at.
[03:08:53.800 --> 03:08:58.080]   And then you use that money to buy acid and synthesizers.
[03:08:58.080 --> 03:09:00.760]   And then you run out of the money and then you,
[03:09:00.760 --> 03:09:02.240]   (laughing)
[03:09:02.240 --> 03:09:04.000]   then you have to get a job.
[03:09:04.000 --> 03:09:05.600]   And so then, because you think it'll be fun
[03:09:05.600 --> 03:09:09.240]   to work at a comedy club, you get a job at the comedy store.
[03:09:09.240 --> 03:09:11.960]   And then, you know, that's how it happened for me.
[03:09:11.960 --> 03:09:12.920]   And none of, there wasn't,
[03:09:12.920 --> 03:09:15.400]   I never had the confidence to be like,
[03:09:15.400 --> 03:09:18.560]   oh, I'm gonna be a standup comedian.
[03:09:18.560 --> 03:09:22.080]   No way, I just thought it'd be cool to work in that building.
[03:09:22.080 --> 03:09:23.840]   I thought the building looked cool.
[03:09:23.840 --> 03:09:26.520]   And so, but then like, 'cause like you work
[03:09:26.520 --> 03:09:28.560]   at the comedy store, you get stage time.
[03:09:28.560 --> 03:09:32.280]   It's there, it's the reason like you work there
[03:09:32.280 --> 03:09:34.440]   is at least in those days, 'cause it's not like
[03:09:34.440 --> 03:09:36.720]   they're paying like a shit ton of money
[03:09:36.720 --> 03:09:39.160]   for you to answer phones at a comedy club.
[03:09:39.160 --> 03:09:42.480]   And so, you know, I started going on stage
[03:09:42.480 --> 03:09:47.280]   and then like, I just got lucky 'cause Rogan saw me
[03:09:47.280 --> 03:09:50.440]   have like a very rare good set.
[03:09:50.440 --> 03:09:52.600]   I didn't know he was in the room or I would have bombed,
[03:09:52.600 --> 03:09:55.160]   you know, and then like, 'cause he thought it was funny
[03:09:55.160 --> 03:09:56.080]   and he liked talking to me,
[03:09:56.080 --> 03:09:57.960]   he started taking me on the road with him.
[03:09:57.960 --> 03:09:59.680]   And then, you know, so I don't know, man.
[03:09:59.680 --> 03:10:00.520]   I think-
[03:10:00.520 --> 03:10:02.880]   - Was there an element to,
[03:10:02.880 --> 03:10:06.720]   there's a beautiful weirdness to you as a human being.
[03:10:06.720 --> 03:10:11.720]   Was there like a pressure to conform ever?
[03:10:12.520 --> 03:10:15.640]   To hide yourself from the world?
[03:10:15.640 --> 03:10:19.960]   Or did the $12,000 and the asset give you the confidence
[03:10:19.960 --> 03:10:21.640]   you needed to be yourself?
[03:10:21.640 --> 03:10:24.440]   - Oh no, I don't, like I didn't still, no.
[03:10:24.440 --> 03:10:26.760]   I think, sure, there's that pressure.
[03:10:26.760 --> 03:10:30.080]   And like, you know, whenever you're beginning
[03:10:30.080 --> 03:10:31.840]   to really differentiate from your parents,
[03:10:31.840 --> 03:10:34.640]   but then you go back to hang out with your parents,
[03:10:34.640 --> 03:10:36.880]   you can feel that.
[03:10:36.880 --> 03:10:38.680]   It's not like they even want you to conform,
[03:10:38.680 --> 03:10:40.440]   but you'll just, you could slip into that,
[03:10:40.440 --> 03:10:41.320]   whatever that was.
[03:10:41.320 --> 03:10:43.000]   So I remember that when I would go back
[03:10:43.000 --> 03:10:45.320]   and like visit them and stuff.
[03:10:45.320 --> 03:10:49.280]   And surely conformity or the pressure
[03:10:49.280 --> 03:10:52.360]   to like not be individual or whatever,
[03:10:52.360 --> 03:10:53.880]   it's everywhere, man.
[03:10:53.880 --> 03:10:56.040]   - Do you think you made your parents proud?
[03:10:56.040 --> 03:10:59.480]   - E...
[03:10:59.480 --> 03:11:01.640]   (laughs)
[03:11:01.640 --> 03:11:03.360]   - No, no, no, no.
[03:11:03.360 --> 03:11:06.880]   - Well, I think that when my mom died,
[03:11:08.840 --> 03:11:13.840]   I felt successful in the sense that I was able to support my,
[03:11:13.840 --> 03:11:20.000]   I was making money from doing standup and I didn't need help.
[03:11:20.000 --> 03:11:23.640]   I was like, I was supporting myself with art and doing good,
[03:11:23.640 --> 03:11:24.960]   what I thought was great then.
[03:11:24.960 --> 03:11:27.200]   So, and I think she like,
[03:11:27.200 --> 03:11:31.360]   because she had witnessed me literally failing,
[03:11:31.360 --> 03:11:33.520]   I mean, which is by the way, I think part of,
[03:11:33.520 --> 03:11:36.880]   if you wanna be an artist or successful,
[03:11:36.880 --> 03:11:38.640]   you kind of have to fail.
[03:11:38.640 --> 03:11:43.640]   Like if, and if there was a guaranteed route
[03:11:43.640 --> 03:11:48.960]   from sucking to not sucking or from like,
[03:11:48.960 --> 03:11:54.040]   the neophyte phase of whatever the art form is
[03:11:54.040 --> 03:11:56.600]   and some intermediary phase,
[03:11:56.600 --> 03:11:58.760]   then I think a lot more people would do it.
[03:11:58.760 --> 03:12:01.680]   But there really is no guarantees in it,
[03:12:01.680 --> 03:12:03.200]   especially with standup comedy.
[03:12:03.200 --> 03:12:06.200]   It's like, you'd have to be a maniac
[03:12:06.200 --> 03:12:08.440]   to want it to think that that's gonna work out for you.
[03:12:08.440 --> 03:12:10.520]   You have to, so you're gonna,
[03:12:10.520 --> 03:12:13.880]   there are obviously exceptions,
[03:12:13.880 --> 03:12:18.880]   but for me, it was like a long slog,
[03:12:18.880 --> 03:12:20.400]   and that's scary for a mom.
[03:12:20.400 --> 03:12:25.400]   So, but that being said, when she was dying,
[03:12:25.400 --> 03:12:31.120]   like she did recognize that I was like not slogging anymore.
[03:12:31.120 --> 03:12:35.040]   And she did say, she said, "You did it."
[03:12:35.040 --> 03:12:40.040]   And that's cool, but in, I would love for her to see me now.
[03:12:40.040 --> 03:12:42.840]   Like now it'd be way cooler, but maybe she does.
[03:12:42.840 --> 03:12:43.680]   I don't know.
[03:12:43.680 --> 03:12:47.280]   - She's listening to your podcast elsewhere in the other.
[03:12:47.280 --> 03:12:48.440]   - In the Bardo.
[03:12:48.440 --> 03:12:49.920]   (laughing)
[03:12:49.920 --> 03:12:52.320]   - Yeah, however long that lasts,
[03:12:52.320 --> 03:12:55.040]   reconfiguring the whole process to start again.
[03:12:55.040 --> 03:12:59.640]   You as a father now, how did that change you?
[03:12:59.640 --> 03:13:02.160]   - Yeah, that's the big change, man.
[03:13:02.160 --> 03:13:03.000]   That's the thing.
[03:13:03.480 --> 03:13:06.760]   - You made a few biological entities.
[03:13:06.760 --> 03:13:08.600]   - Yeah, I made biological entities.
[03:13:08.600 --> 03:13:10.880]   I mean, I came in my wife, let's face it.
[03:13:10.880 --> 03:13:12.340]   Like I would love to say I made them,
[03:13:12.340 --> 03:13:14.520]   but the womb whipped them up.
[03:13:14.520 --> 03:13:19.400]   But it is the, yeah, it's the best.
[03:13:19.400 --> 03:13:22.440]   I've never experienced anything like it before.
[03:13:22.440 --> 03:13:24.880]   It is the, as far as I'm concerned,
[03:13:24.880 --> 03:13:27.760]   the greatest thing that has ever happened to me.
[03:13:27.760 --> 03:13:30.520]   And that's why I was able to answer your Nietzsche question
[03:13:30.520 --> 03:13:33.600]   with like, hell yes, fuck yes, that's great.
[03:13:33.600 --> 03:13:35.200]   I get to be around my kids again.
[03:13:35.200 --> 03:13:36.360]   I'll always be around my kids.
[03:13:36.360 --> 03:13:38.300]   I'll always be around my children.
[03:13:38.300 --> 03:13:39.140]   That's incredible.
[03:13:39.140 --> 03:13:39.960]   That's the joy.
[03:13:39.960 --> 03:13:41.900]   So for me,
[03:13:41.900 --> 03:13:49.160]   the part of myself that used to torture myself more,
[03:13:49.160 --> 03:13:51.040]   around like my mom dying,
[03:13:51.040 --> 03:13:53.680]   feeling like I wasn't there enough for her,
[03:13:53.680 --> 03:13:56.060]   wishing that I had spent more time with her,
[03:13:56.060 --> 03:13:58.200]   wishing I'd spent more time with my dad,
[03:13:58.200 --> 03:14:00.080]   wishing that like, you know,
[03:14:00.080 --> 03:14:03.960]   looking back at like how like I was just so desperately
[03:14:03.960 --> 03:14:07.360]   trying to evade the fact that she was dying
[03:14:07.360 --> 03:14:13.200]   and in that evasion successfully like distanced myself
[03:14:13.200 --> 03:14:16.380]   from her in ways that I really wish I hadn't.
[03:14:16.380 --> 03:14:22.200]   I'm just saying that 'cause it's one of my regrets.
[03:14:22.200 --> 03:14:23.160]   It's like a big regret.
[03:14:23.160 --> 03:14:26.280]   I have a lot of little regrets, but that's a big one.
[03:14:26.280 --> 03:14:30.900]   And so when you have kids,
[03:14:30.900 --> 03:14:38.160]   you look back at everything you did,
[03:14:38.160 --> 03:14:40.320]   and you think like, fuck,
[03:14:40.320 --> 03:14:43.600]   if I had gone left at that point instead of right,
[03:14:43.600 --> 03:14:45.680]   if I had eaten, who knows?
[03:14:45.680 --> 03:14:48.800]   What if I'd eaten like a turkey sandwich
[03:14:48.800 --> 03:14:53.400]   when my balls were creating the cum
[03:14:53.400 --> 03:14:54.880]   that was gonna make my kids?
[03:14:54.880 --> 03:14:56.600]   Would I have a different kid?
[03:14:56.600 --> 03:14:59.000]   Would this being not exist in my life?
[03:14:59.000 --> 03:15:02.240]   Like you start looking at everything and you realize like,
[03:15:02.240 --> 03:15:05.280]   thank God, thank God for every single thing
[03:15:05.280 --> 03:15:08.760]   that happened to me because it all led up to this.
[03:15:08.760 --> 03:15:11.240]   And oh, for me, that is the,
[03:15:11.240 --> 03:15:18.400]   it's like, it frees you and it liberates you
[03:15:18.400 --> 03:15:22.040]   because you realize like, oh wow,
[03:15:22.040 --> 03:15:27.040]   this clumsy and selfish and at times rotten
[03:15:27.040 --> 03:15:29.320]   as I've been in my life,
[03:15:29.320 --> 03:15:34.240]   that did not impede the universe at all
[03:15:34.240 --> 03:15:37.320]   from allowing these two beautiful beings
[03:15:37.320 --> 03:15:38.440]   to exist in the world.
[03:15:38.440 --> 03:15:40.360]   - So maybe all of it enabled,
[03:15:40.360 --> 03:15:43.480]   all of it like a concert,
[03:15:43.480 --> 03:15:47.560]   perfectly led up to that little beautiful moment.
[03:15:48.680 --> 03:15:52.680]   Is there ways you would like to be a better father?
[03:15:52.680 --> 03:15:55.680]   - Oh yeah, for sure, absolutely.
[03:15:55.680 --> 03:15:59.440]   There's a actual, I read something in a book,
[03:15:59.440 --> 03:16:01.000]   it's called "Good Enough."
[03:16:01.000 --> 03:16:03.440]   The mantra for a parent, good enough.
[03:16:03.440 --> 03:16:07.160]   Because when you are in the presence of something you love
[03:16:07.160 --> 03:16:10.720]   more than you've ever experienced love,
[03:16:10.720 --> 03:16:15.560]   you wanna be perfect.
[03:16:15.560 --> 03:16:17.720]   Like you wanna be, I can't, I gotta work, man.
[03:16:17.720 --> 03:16:19.600]   I gotta go on the road, I've gotta work,
[03:16:19.600 --> 03:16:20.800]   I gotta support the family.
[03:16:20.800 --> 03:16:22.440]   So that means I have to work.
[03:16:22.440 --> 03:16:25.520]   You know what it's like having a podcast?
[03:16:25.520 --> 03:16:27.000]   You fucking work, man.
[03:16:27.000 --> 03:16:33.880]   It's a full-time job 'cause I do stand up too
[03:16:33.880 --> 03:16:34.760]   and all the other stuff.
[03:16:34.760 --> 03:16:38.760]   So I feel sometimes I feel like, oh my God,
[03:16:38.760 --> 03:16:40.680]   I wanna spend more time with them.
[03:16:40.680 --> 03:16:42.160]   Like I should be spending more time with them.
[03:16:42.160 --> 03:16:45.080]   But then also I wanna create, I wanna work.
[03:16:45.080 --> 03:16:49.000]   I like being the provider.
[03:16:49.000 --> 03:16:53.640]   So that's something I feel guilty about right now.
[03:16:53.640 --> 03:16:56.600]   - And you're struggling how to balance that correctly.
[03:16:56.600 --> 03:16:59.800]   And meanwhile, time just marches on.
[03:16:59.800 --> 03:17:00.640]   (whistles)
[03:17:00.640 --> 03:17:03.240]   - It just goes, it goes.
[03:17:03.240 --> 03:17:07.440]   - And all of this will be forgotten,
[03:17:07.440 --> 03:17:11.600]   both you and I, but forgotten in time.
[03:17:11.600 --> 03:17:12.440]   - That's what I say to them
[03:17:12.440 --> 03:17:14.160]   every time I'm putting them to bed.
[03:17:15.160 --> 03:17:18.560]   - We will be lost in the sands of time.
[03:17:18.560 --> 03:17:20.520]   You know that, I bet you know this poem.
[03:17:20.520 --> 03:17:22.440]   You know that poem, "Ozymandias"?
[03:17:22.440 --> 03:17:23.920]   - Yes.
[03:17:23.920 --> 03:17:25.720]   - Can I read you a poem?
[03:17:25.720 --> 03:17:26.960]   - Oh, okay.
[03:17:26.960 --> 03:17:32.280]   Let's end our conversation in a poem.
[03:17:32.280 --> 03:17:33.200]   - I love it.
[03:17:33.200 --> 03:17:37.480]   It's by Pierce Byshe Shelley,
[03:17:37.480 --> 03:17:39.520]   probably mispronouncing the name.
[03:17:39.520 --> 03:17:41.080]   - There's no right way to pronounce anything.
[03:17:41.080 --> 03:17:42.280]   - Thank you, thank you.
[03:17:43.120 --> 03:17:45.840]   I'm Ozymandias.
[03:17:45.840 --> 03:17:49.240]   I met a traveler from an antique land who said,
[03:17:49.240 --> 03:17:54.120]   "Two vast and trunkless legs of stone stand in the desert.
[03:17:54.120 --> 03:17:57.440]   Near them on the sand, half sunk,
[03:17:57.440 --> 03:17:59.640]   a shattered visage lies,
[03:17:59.640 --> 03:18:04.160]   whose frown and wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command
[03:18:04.160 --> 03:18:07.920]   tell that its sculptor well those passions read,
[03:18:07.920 --> 03:18:11.880]   which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
[03:18:11.880 --> 03:18:15.080]   the hand that mocked them and the heart that fed.
[03:18:15.080 --> 03:18:18.320]   And on the pedestal, these words appear.
[03:18:18.320 --> 03:18:21.960]   My name is Ozymandias, king of kings.
[03:18:21.960 --> 03:18:25.320]   Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair.
[03:18:25.320 --> 03:18:27.760]   Nothing beside remains around the decay
[03:18:27.760 --> 03:18:29.520]   of that colossal wreck.
[03:18:29.520 --> 03:18:31.080]   Boundless and bare,
[03:18:31.080 --> 03:18:34.600]   the lone and level sands stretch far away."
[03:18:34.600 --> 03:18:39.160]   - All gone.
[03:18:40.560 --> 03:18:42.080]   - Behold the king.
[03:18:42.080 --> 03:18:45.720]   - Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair.
[03:18:45.720 --> 03:18:47.440]   - And despair.
[03:18:47.440 --> 03:18:50.680]   Even though we'll be forgotten in the sands of time,
[03:18:50.680 --> 03:18:53.600]   Duncan, I'm just so glad that you exist
[03:18:53.600 --> 03:18:55.560]   and you put so much love into the world
[03:18:55.560 --> 03:18:57.560]   over the past many years that I've gotten a chance
[03:18:57.560 --> 03:18:59.480]   to enjoy by being your fan.
[03:18:59.480 --> 03:19:00.360]   - Likewise.
[03:19:00.360 --> 03:19:02.800]   - Thank you so much for continuing that
[03:19:02.800 --> 03:19:04.720]   and for sharing a bit of love with me today.
[03:19:04.720 --> 03:19:05.880]   - Can we be friends?
[03:19:05.880 --> 03:19:06.720]   - Let's be friends.
[03:19:06.720 --> 03:19:09.320]   - In real time, in the real world, in 3D space?
[03:19:09.320 --> 03:19:12.080]   - Nothing is real, but yes, in this particular slice
[03:19:12.080 --> 03:19:14.560]   of the multidimensional world we live in.
[03:19:14.560 --> 03:19:16.160]   It will be an honor and a pleasure.
[03:19:16.160 --> 03:19:17.480]   - Thank you for having me on your show.
[03:19:17.480 --> 03:19:18.320]   - Love you, Duncan.
[03:19:18.320 --> 03:19:19.140]   - I love you.
[03:19:19.140 --> 03:19:20.560]   Thank you, Lex.
[03:19:20.560 --> 03:19:22.080]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[03:19:22.080 --> 03:19:23.320]   with Duncan Trussell.

[03:19:29.480 --> 03:19:31.180]   from Duncan Trussell himself.
[03:19:31.180 --> 03:19:35.620]   "You are essentially just a cloud of atoms
[03:19:35.620 --> 03:19:39.140]   that will eventually be aerosolized by time."
[03:19:39.140 --> 03:19:43.140]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
[03:19:43.140 --> 03:19:45.720]   (upbeat music)
