[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.680]   - Our host of the "Everyday Educator" podcast, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.240]   has chosen a special episode for you to enjoy.
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.300]   Thanks for listening.
[00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.320]   And as always, we hope that you continue
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.760]   to encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.400]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.700]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.240]   - You know, that was sometimes, frankly,
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.240]   one of the most bittersweet parts of my children growing up
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.040]   was realizing that there need to be boundaries
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.680]   as they grow about how much I tell them to do,
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.920]   how much I'm in charge.
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.560]   And that boundary needs to kind of, it starts to wiggle.
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.880]   - Hey, I'm Delise.
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:47.840]   - And I'm Jenny.
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.960]   We know that parenting comes in seasons
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.980]   and even the smallest ones deserve a happy dance.
[00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.720]   - Join us as we chat with moms
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.840]   in every stage of the parenting journey,
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.960]   fixing our eyes on Jesus each step of the way.
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.120]   - This is "Blessings and Motherhood"
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.160]   because we believe that you can hold tissues
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.020]   and confetti at the same time.
[00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.440]   - Hey guys, welcome back to another episode
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.000]   of "Blessings and Motherhood."
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.240]   Today, we are super excited to get to talk with Lisa Bailey.
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.020]   - Yeah, Lisa Bailey has been working
[00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.620]   with Classical Conversations for a very long time.
[00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.280]   And if you are not a homeschooling mom, I want you to pause.
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.220]   Do not stop the episode.
[00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.000]   The other really huge and exciting aspect
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.560]   of this conversation we're about to have with her
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.480]   is actually that she's a grandmother.
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.480]   Lisa drops so many beautiful nuggets about being a parent,
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.720]   about living in the moment, about regrets,
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.480]   or even things that the Lord has taught her over the years.
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.160]   And one of my favorite things that she shares
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.760]   is her grandparent name.
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.520]   We will not spoil it for you,
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.760]   but you're gonna wanna listen,
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.440]   even if it's just for a little idea for the future.
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.800]   - It is amazing, you guys.
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.420]   Definitely, don't stop.
[00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.080]   Don't stop the episode, just keep going.
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.000]   It's awesome. - Yeah.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.120]   - Yeah, so without further ado,
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.200]   here is our conversation with Lisa.
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.440]   - All right, everybody, so we are so excited
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.100]   to have Lisa Bailey here on the podcast today.
[00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.700]   Lisa, for our listeners who do not know you,
[00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.300]   and you are a legend among Classical Conversations people.
[00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.140]   - Yes.
[00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.900]   - Introduce yourself, tell us about your season of life.
[00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.300]   What's going on with you these days?
[00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.100]   - Well, I don't know if I should be flattered or chagrined
[00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.500]   to be called a legend.
[00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.700]   (all laughing)
[00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:27.660]   - It's a good thing.
[00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.700]   - I will tell you that I've been around
[00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.380]   Classical Conversations for a long time,
[00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.580]   so maybe that affords me legend status.
[00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.620]   My family found Classical Conversations in 2004,
[00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.140]   when my daughters were fifth grade and second grade,
[00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.700]   and my husband and I had been homeschooling them
[00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.500]   the whole time and had been trying to recreate
[00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.340]   what I now know as a classical education on our own.
[00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.500]   And we were doing okay, but as I looked ahead
[00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.220]   to the high school, the junior high and high school years,
[00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.380]   I was getting a little nervous
[00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.340]   about how well I could do that.
[00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.620]   And when I was introduced to CC by some friends
[00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.180]   who had older students, I was mesmerized
[00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.000]   by the plan that I saw laid out.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.620]   And really the challenge program is what hooked my husband.
[00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.220]   What hooked me was somebody had done
[00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.820]   some really good planning.
[00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.820]   It was everything that I had wanted my girls to know
[00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.100]   in the way I was excited to teach them.
[00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.940]   And so we jumped in at that level.
[00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.780]   I started tutoring Challenge B
[00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.100]   'cause I actually like junior high students.
[00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.140]   And I loved mock trial.
[00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.860]   I loved doing logic with them.
[00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.660]   And I've sat in a lot of seats
[00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.660]   on the CC bus through the years.
[00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.940]   I've been in some state management leadership roles.
[00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.080]   I've served as a Challenge B program manager.
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.100]   Most recently, well, I worked on practicum for years.
[00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.420]   And so some people know me from kind of creating
[00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.180]   the practicums and then training the speakers
[00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.820]   for those events for about seven years.
[00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.580]   And most recently I have come to rest
[00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.440]   in the curriculum development team
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.080]   where I am blessed to get paid real money
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.660]   to read and write and encourage parents.
[00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:39.560]   And I have spent most of the last year
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.860]   working on a brand new piece of curriculum
[00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.060]   that you guys have talked about before,
[00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.940]   Scribblers at Home, Recipes from Lifelong Learners,
[00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.100]   which actually is the perfect place for me
[00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.940]   because I get to encourage parents
[00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.340]   and play with little kids and develop tools
[00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.540]   that I know are gonna bless families.
[00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.580]   And that's really what's close to my heart
[00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.460]   after all these years with CC.
[00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:05.780]   - I love that.
[00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.180]   And you also have another new role
[00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.820]   if my memory serves me right, right?
[00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.100]   Lisa, you have just become a grandmother, right?
[00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.900]   - Yes, I've just become a grandmother, our first grandson.
[00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.620]   My husband, David and I have two lovely daughters
[00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:27.060]   and now we have one handsome grandson who was born in June
[00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:32.060]   and we have really relished our new roles as grandparents.
[00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.460]   It's been great.
[00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:34.300]   - That's awesome.
[00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.700]   It's funny how the Lord brought you right now
[00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.780]   to the role of writing Scribblers,
[00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.780]   which is for the younger children.
[00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.220]   And He has given you one to just start fresh with, right?
[00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.300]   As a grandparent.
[00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.060]   - I know, I just think he probably was laughing
[00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.020]   the whole time because I started working on Scribblers
[00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.500]   before Gideon was a twinkle in his parents' eye.
[00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.860]   And so it is really cool to me to think
[00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.620]   that I had a hand in something
[00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.820]   that I know we'll be using with him.
[00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:08.260]   - That is awesome.
[00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.100]   Well, tell me a little bit about when you first found out
[00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:12.780]   you were going to be a grandmother.
[00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.900]   Like what came into your mind?
[00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.380]   What were you excited about?
[00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.260]   What were you maybe fearful about?
[00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:19.620]   What were your thoughts?
[00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:23.380]   - Well, I was super excited to be a grandmother.
[00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.700]   I have friends who have welcomed grandchildren
[00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:29.740]   and they have said to me, "Oh, this is the best."
[00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.900]   You thought you loved your children unconditionally,
[00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:36.420]   but just wait until you have a grandchild.
[00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:40.060]   And so I was really, I'll be really frank with you guys.
[00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:45.660]   Through the years, the Lord has taught me so much
[00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:48.740]   as I have worked with classical conversations
[00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.820]   and as I've been blessed to work with parents.
[00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:55.300]   You know, a lot of people say, "Oh, you've taught me so much."
[00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.460]   Or even you guys have said,
[00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.940]   "Oh, I know that there are things that we want to know
[00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:04.900]   from you," but I feel like God did such a work in me
[00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.300]   and in my understanding in my life.
[00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:11.180]   And so I feel like, and I've told people before
[00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:12.940]   at practicums who come up and say,
[00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:16.020]   "Oh, can't you just come home and homeschool my children?
[00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.980]   I wish my children had you as a mom."
[00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:22.700]   And it makes me, it humbles me, but it also makes me laugh.
[00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:25.580]   And I look at them and I say, "Hey, you know what?
[00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:29.900]   My children wish they had had this me as a mom too.
[00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:32.420]   They did not have this me because the Lord
[00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:37.420]   has done such a work as far as me understanding Him,
[00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:42.740]   understanding myself, understanding education,
[00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:46.140]   understanding what He's trying to communicate to me
[00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:48.580]   and to the rest of us through His creation,
[00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:50.420]   through His word and through the people
[00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:51.900]   He puts in our paths."
[00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:56.100]   So what I was most excited about is a do-over,
[00:07:56.100 --> 00:08:01.100]   a chance to pour into a new little life
[00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:05.660]   kind of in a more relaxed way, okay?
[00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:08.500]   Knowing that, "Oh, you know what?
[00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.020]   I'm not going to do that perfectly
[00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:11.300]   and that's going to be okay.
[00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.140]   And actually that's going to be better
[00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:16.740]   because I won't be setting myself and this child up
[00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:20.180]   with unreal expectations."
[00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:23.820]   And so I was really excited to be a grandmother
[00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:27.460]   because it gave me an opportunity
[00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:30.740]   to enjoy this little person,
[00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:33.340]   probably in a way I was too uptight
[00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:37.380]   to enjoy my own girls at points in their childhood.
[00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:40.740]   - I want to pause right there and just say it again
[00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:43.380]   for myself and all the people in the back.
[00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:48.300]   The fact that you saw or can see now
[00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:51.460]   that you were too uptight to enjoy your kids.
[00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:55.180]   I mean, there are little whispers in my head
[00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:58.180]   and I'm even thinking about just my day yesterday, right?
[00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:00.140]   And how, you know, you want to be a good mom
[00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.180]   and I think a lot of it comes from fear,
[00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:05.060]   but the kind of fear that like you are trying
[00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:08.060]   to be a good steward of your child's life.
[00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:10.340]   You're trying to be faithful to the Lord.
[00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:12.540]   So you want your kid to have good character.
[00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:14.140]   So you're trying to be on your pees and pews.
[00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:15.700]   They don't develop these habits that they're like,
[00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:16.660]   "Mom, why didn't you help me?"
[00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:19.300]   You know, whether it's nose picking or being rude,
[00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:20.980]   you know, just all the things.
[00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:23.100]   But I think at the end of the day,
[00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:28.100]   there is a sense that we have that might not be from God,
[00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:29.700]   that it's all on us.
[00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.700]   And so we end up, instead of being intentional
[00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:35.620]   or instead of being faithful, which is what we want,
[00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:36.940]   we end up being uptight.
[00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:37.780]   - Right.
[00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:39.700]   - And we suck the joy out of the moment.
[00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:44.220]   - We do, and I think that another huge fallacy
[00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:47.140]   that Satan uses, or I should just say,
[00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:49.700]   he used it in my life.
[00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:54.700]   I fell prey to believing that there was one right way
[00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:59.380]   to do almost all the things I did with and for my girls.
[00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:04.260]   And that if I did not find that one right way,
[00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.340]   that, okay, they weren't gonna be derailed totally,
[00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:08.820]   but they would suffer for it.
[00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:10.420]   And we would suffer for it.
[00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:13.420]   And it wouldn't be as good as it,
[00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:15.660]   the experience would not be as good as it could be.
[00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:19.820]   And so I spent, not all my time,
[00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:22.740]   I truly did enjoy my girls a lot.
[00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:25.020]   And we loved homeschooling,
[00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:29.580]   but I do know that I was so focused on doing things right
[00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:33.580]   that sometimes we did not have as much fun
[00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:36.700]   enjoying one another as we should have.
[00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:37.700]   - That's such a good point.
[00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.740]   And that's such a huge thing.
[00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:41.500]   I think about that catechism that says,
[00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:43.860]   what is the chief end of man?
[00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:44.700]   What is it to worship God?
[00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:47.900]   - To glorify God and enjoy Him forever.
[00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:49.020]   - There you go.
[00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:50.540]   And I think there's a part of that
[00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:52.180]   that we mirror for our kids.
[00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:55.700]   Like when I think about how parenting is modeling
[00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:58.020]   the heart of God for your kids,
[00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:01.580]   the enjoying one another piece is so big.
[00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:03.780]   And I don't know, I'm glad that you said that
[00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:05.860]   'cause I feel like I'm gonna be thinking about that
[00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:06.700]   for a week.
[00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:09.060]   So let's talk about how,
[00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:11.140]   and I know you're very much at the beginning of it,
[00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:12.860]   how old is your grandson right now?
[00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:15.580]   - He is almost four months old.
[00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:18.460]   - Okay, so he's a little nugget,
[00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:20.700]   probably just starting to smile and stuff.
[00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:23.500]   Tell us a little bit though,
[00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:25.140]   in your short journey so far,
[00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:28.620]   how has being a grandmother changed you?
[00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:30.420]   How has it changed your perspective?
[00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:32.220]   You kind of hit a little bit on it just now,
[00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:34.540]   but what are the things that you feel God
[00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:36.060]   is kind of churning in your heart
[00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:39.500]   and using being a grandma to do in your life?
[00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:42.940]   - Hmm, I think that
[00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:49.260]   He is using Gideon to help me focus on simple joy
[00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.700]   and simple pleasures.
[00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:55.860]   He is teaching me with Gideon
[00:11:55.860 --> 00:12:00.580]   to enjoy all of the moments
[00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:04.380]   and not wish any one of them away.
[00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:06.260]   You guys are still young moms.
[00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.420]   And so I can say this to you and you'll remember,
[00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:13.100]   there were times when my girls were newborns
[00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:17.380]   that I thought, okay, this is never going to get easier.
[00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:19.940]   This is not, this piece is never going away.
[00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:22.780]   It will never be quote unquote, right again.
[00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:29.260]   And now of course, I realized that's not true.
[00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:33.460]   And the sleepless night doesn't last forever.
[00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:36.180]   And the stage where
[00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:41.620]   your baby or your small child does this thing that,
[00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:44.220]   you know, it's cute the first time
[00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:46.500]   and then it's just annoying.
[00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:48.260]   That doesn't last forever.
[00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.740]   And so Gideon, having him
[00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:55.100]   has helped me be just really open
[00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:57.460]   to living more in the moment.
[00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:00.220]   When I was a mom of a newborn,
[00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:01.900]   I remember saying to myself,
[00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:06.020]   well, when she sleeps through the night, it will be better.
[00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:10.140]   Well, when we get on a better nursing schedule,
[00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:11.260]   it will be better.
[00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:16.220]   Well, when, you know, when she doesn't throw her spoon
[00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:18.940]   or when she will eat what I fix
[00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:21.660]   or when she stops asking so many questions,
[00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:24.020]   and by the way, that never happened.
[00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:26.940]   But you just keep, I just found myself
[00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:31.620]   so often living for the next moment
[00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:34.340]   instead of living in the moment
[00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:35.820]   that the Lord had provided.
[00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:40.820]   That with Gideon, when my daughter brought him home,
[00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.460]   I stayed with them for a couple of nights
[00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:45.700]   and she was like, oh, I just really need a break.
[00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:47.180]   And I'm like, I'm fine.
[00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:48.820]   I can stay up with him.
[00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:51.980]   I can, it will be my pleasure
[00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:55.140]   to spend some of these in the middle of the night hours
[00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:57.020]   with him, just looking at him
[00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:59.340]   because he's changing every minute.
[00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:00.900]   And that was a gift.
[00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:03.380]   And I think that is a perspective
[00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:05.220]   that I'm happy to have now
[00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:08.100]   that I didn't have when my girls were little.
[00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:10.020]   - Yeah, I bet your girls are happy
[00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:12.260]   or your daughter is happy to have that as well
[00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:13.940]   because you're saying that that's a gift
[00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:16.020]   for that time with Gideon.
[00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:19.220]   But I know she sees that as a blessing to her
[00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:21.420]   that you are giving to her, right?
[00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:24.980]   - Yeah, I hope so, I think so, yeah.
[00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:26.780]   - I would have loved that for sure.
[00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:29.300]   And I just keep thinking like,
[00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:32.140]   this is what us young moms need to hear.
[00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:35.460]   And it's so uplifting for that reminder
[00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:37.940]   to enjoy the simple joys
[00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:40.100]   because we can get, as you said, caught up
[00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:41.380]   in things like that.
[00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:45.140]   And we forget that we can enjoy the seasons
[00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:47.060]   even if they're hard.
[00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:50.860]   - Yes, and that there's more than one right answer
[00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:51.700]   for things.
[00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:55.220]   I thought, if you don't,
[00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:57.260]   if the girl, if I had a schedule in my mind
[00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:00.740]   or a sense of what would be best for this baby
[00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:01.980]   and it didn't happen,
[00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:04.660]   it just kind of threw me for a loop
[00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:06.740]   and I felt like, I don't know what to do.
[00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:09.420]   And so the answer with the baby,
[00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:11.220]   they don't perform on command.
[00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:13.300]   And I know that now,
[00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:16.380]   but if I could just have looked back and said,
[00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:17.980]   you know what?
[00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:22.980]   Whatever is happening is what is supposed to happen.
[00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:25.820]   So let's just enjoy that thing
[00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:28.980]   instead of spending my time thinking,
[00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:32.340]   why is this not going like I expected it to go?
[00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:34.820]   Just enjoy what God has given you.
[00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:36.860]   There's beauty in that,
[00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:39.460]   even if it's not what I expected to see.
[00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:40.300]   - That's great.
[00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:42.780]   - Yeah, it can also bestow that sense of wonder
[00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:46.220]   in you as a grandparent and as a mom
[00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:48.860]   and even for our kids just to say,
[00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:50.620]   okay, I wasn't expecting that,
[00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:52.900]   but man, look at how God can perform
[00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:56.020]   and look at what God has created in this moment
[00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:58.660]   and just His mightiness.
[00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:00.980]   I don't know, that's what it makes me think of.
[00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:02.340]   - It's amazing.
[00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:05.180]   - And we're so excited about this new Scribblers.
[00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:06.900]   Let's go back to that real quick.
[00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:08.580]   You've written the Scribblers program
[00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:10.740]   for Classical Conversations.
[00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:12.380]   It's meant for the younger kids.
[00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:14.900]   So tell us a little bit about it.
[00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:19.740]   - Well, it was really born out of Lee's desire,
[00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:24.740]   Lee Borton's desire to help young families
[00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:29.220]   develop good learning habits, to find a good rhythm.
[00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:32.500]   And as she talked to me a little bit about the project
[00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:35.660]   before we ever wrote the first activity
[00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:37.380]   or developed the first chart,
[00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:40.660]   it really resonated with me
[00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:42.860]   in that there were so many things
[00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:47.060]   that I wish I had known when I started homeschooling.
[00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:49.700]   So many things that I learned along the way
[00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:52.380]   and I got better at and we got more comfortable at
[00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:53.700]   and it was all great.
[00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:58.140]   But what if I had known at the beginning
[00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:02.020]   that developing the relationships
[00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:05.140]   between family members was key?
[00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:07.700]   It was so key that it was way more important
[00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:10.660]   than what reading curriculum I picked.
[00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:14.540]   What if I had realized at the beginning
[00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:19.500]   that there were simple rhythms that we could start
[00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:21.880]   when the kids were really young
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:25.260]   that would become so much a part of our family's DNA
[00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:28.340]   that it would become just what we do.
[00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:31.020]   Like learning is just what we do.
[00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:33.980]   Reading good books is just what we do.
[00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:37.900]   Talking about big ideas is just what we do.
[00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:39.500]   And we don't even notice it.
[00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:42.620]   Going outside to look at what God's made
[00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:45.380]   and then asking questions about it
[00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:47.220]   and looking in the scripture
[00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:51.500]   and asking other people what they know about the world.
[00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:54.780]   If I had known at the beginning
[00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:57.020]   that that was the kind of thing
[00:17:57.020 --> 00:18:00.620]   that would change the world for me and my kids
[00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:03.660]   and my husband, I would have done that in a skinny minute.
[00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:05.660]   But I didn't know.
[00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:08.380]   I was so set at the beginning
[00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:11.780]   that I had to pick the right reading curriculum,
[00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:15.220]   that we needed to spend X amount of time doing math.
[00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:18.620]   I needed to be sure that we did handwriting
[00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:21.000]   and we did it as long as we were supposed to
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.100]   and at the right time, they became good spellers
[00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:25.620]   and that we learned about this.
[00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:27.900]   I was so worried about all of that stuff
[00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:30.340]   that a lot of times in the early years,
[00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:33.020]   I would get to the end of the day and think,
[00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:34.980]   well, we didn't finish the math lesson
[00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:36.700]   and she still can't read
[00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:39.820]   and we didn't even do a science experiment
[00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:43.180]   and art is just like what they do when I'm not looking.
[00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:47.540]   If I had had somebody to tell me,
[00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:50.920]   hey, take a deep breath.
[00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:54.380]   You prayed together with your girls.
[00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:56.720]   You read together.
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:59.440]   You played outside together.
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:02.320]   You fixed lunch for daddy.
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:06.160]   You explored the ladybugs on the back steps.
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:10.840]   You prayed, played, read, explored and served.
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:12.400]   That was a good day.
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:13.720]   You did a good thing
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:17.240]   and y'all established really good rhythms.
[00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:19.340]   That was a good homeschool day.
[00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:24.600]   And so "Scribblers" was really written
[00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.440]   to encourage parents
[00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:32.400]   that the things their children do naturally are enough
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:37.720]   that parents can intentionally harvest the habits
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:43.480]   of praying, playing, reading, exploring and serving
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:48.480]   and begin to build habits that turn into the learning
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:51.920]   that the children will do,
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:55.600]   not just till they graduate from high school, but forever.
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:20:01.520]   And just helping parents connect this intentional play
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:05.240]   with the habits that are gonna help their high schoolers
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:09.260]   write a paper or do a chemistry lab
[00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:12.560]   or work with the quadratic equation.
[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:16.160]   Really and truly, I can remember thinking,
[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:17.700]   I don't know how we're gonna get there,
[00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:20.280]   but I'll worry about it then.
[00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:22.960]   But "Scribblers" actually shows parents,
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:26.420]   look, you think your children are just clapping
[00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:28.560]   the rhythm of their name,
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:32.400]   but they are actually learning that words have syllables,
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:35.620]   that words have parts and that you can,
[00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:39.220]   and that is gonna help them read and spell
[00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:41.080]   and take a foreign language.
[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:45.440]   And so for parents to think that this intentional play
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:47.680]   is going somewhere is huge.
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:50.840]   - Yeah, yeah, I think a lot of us moms need to hear that,
[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:53.360]   especially as homeschooling moms.
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:54.560]   I love when you said,
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:57.280]   it's not always about choosing the right curriculum.
[00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:59.860]   It's really the relationships when they're younger,
[00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:01.560]   because that is gonna help high schoolers
[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:03.520]   when they are doing those quadratic equations
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:04.680]   when they're older,
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:06.400]   because they're gonna have that relationship
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:08.920]   that they can trust you, that you are for them
[00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:10.640]   and that you care about their education.
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:13.800]   So you're not making them do all of these math problems
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:17.500]   because you're being a mean mom or just to do it.
[00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:19.120]   They have that trust with you
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:21.400]   because you started at such a young age
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:23.280]   focused in on the relationships
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:27.280]   and not how many worksheets do we get done today
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:31.480]   or do I have the right program to teach them correctly?
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:33.560]   And that's what "Scribblers" is about, right?
[00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:36.440]   - Right, it's about being with your kids.
[00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:40.680]   It is being with your kids, doing these fun things together
[00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:42.800]   because really a lot of us,
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:46.680]   I mean, I reclaimed such a huge swath of my education
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:49.000]   when I started teaching my kids at home.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.020]   There are things that as parents,
[00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:54.680]   you're gonna learn by doing the "Scribblers" activity.
[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:57.640]   You're gonna learn stuff about each of the strands.
[00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:59.920]   You're gonna learn things about science and history
[00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:02.320]   and phonics and all of that,
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.920]   but you're also gonna learn about your child
[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:08.080]   and how your child learns and how they look at the world
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:11.160]   and what they need from you at any given moment.
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:12.400]   - Yeah, I've had a chance
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:14.320]   to look through the "Scribblers" program, actually.
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:18.120]   I've got one of the early books of it.
[00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:18.960]   - Phototypes, yeah.
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:21.840]   - And it's been so fun to look through with my kids.
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.400]   I'll be honest, I have not tried one of them yet.
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:25.240]   - That's okay.
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:28.840]   - But I loved how encompassing they are.
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:32.100]   There's some activities that you can do inside.
[00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:33.360]   I think there was a baking activity
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:34.580]   that really sparked my interest
[00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:35.680]   'cause I'm a baker,
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:37.360]   but then you had them going outside
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:40.080]   or you have them going to different rooms of the house
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:42.980]   and making these memories with your kids,
[00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:44.360]   but letting them learn,
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:45.720]   and they don't even know it.
[00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:47.480]   They're not gonna know that they're learning math
[00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:50.760]   while we're baking and measuring out things.
[00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:51.600]   They're just gonna say,
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:53.040]   "Ooh, I'm making cookies with mommy,"
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:53.960]   or something like that,
[00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:55.640]   and that's what I loved
[00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:57.520]   when I was going through the prototype.
[00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:00.840]   - Hey, guys, we wanna take a break from the show
[00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:04.480]   to tell you about the Words Aptly Spoken Book Club
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:06.180]   by Classical Conversations,
[00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:09.140]   and it's actually hosted by our founder, Leigh Bortens.
[00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:11.520]   - Yeah, so she hosts this book club online
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:14.720]   every Thursday at 7 p.m. Eastern Standard Time,
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:16.960]   and each week's meeting centers around a discussion
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:18.720]   on a new book that includes
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.960]   Classical Conversations exclusives,
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:23.600]   like selections from the Copper Lodge Library series,
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:25.880]   as well as some of the literary classics
[00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:26.960]   that we all know and love,
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:30.600]   like The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Mere Christianity.
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.240]   - Yeah, so if you'd like to engage
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:34.360]   in thought-provoking conversations
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:37.680]   on the power held by words, ideas, and stories
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:41.040]   with other homeschoolers, parents, and lovers of books,
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:43.520]   then this book club is definitely for you.
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:45.240]   - Yeah, so if you guys are interested,
[00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:47.560]   you can go visit leighbortens.com
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:49.720]   to find a link to join in live
[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:51.800]   at the Words Aptly Spoken Book Club.
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:55.800]   Remember, it's Thursdays at 7 p.m. Eastern Standard Time,
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:58.680]   and you can go to leighbortens.com.
[00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:00.120]   - Let's get back to the show.
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:05.680]   So just really, again, I hear you saying so much
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:08.920]   about just instilling that sense of wonder in learning,
[00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:13.920]   and even internalizing that ourselves as parents,
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:17.600]   as we model that, and just reawakening
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:19.760]   that hunger to learn for ourselves.
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:22.720]   And so this is not gonna be a clean segue.
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:24.520]   I'll just go ahead and let you know, Lisa.
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:27.000]   (laughing)
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.240]   So, you know, I love to hear about that.
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:31.160]   And you guys, if you are interested,
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:32.480]   absolutely go and look it up.
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:36.040]   I'll give you the information about that at the end.
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:38.560]   But as I just think about the season of life
[00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:41.040]   that you're in right now, again, as a grandmother,
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:43.200]   your season with your girls has passed.
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:45.320]   Now you've got a little boy, which is different, too,
[00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:46.800]   which is a new, fun thing.
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:49.960]   And I'm thinking about boundaries, actually,
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:52.240]   and just kind of wondering,
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:56.240]   because most of our listeners are in my seat
[00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:59.360]   and Jenny's seat when we're in our first round.
[00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:02.400]   But for you, as the grandmother,
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:05.000]   I'm sure that you have things that you may have wished,
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.160]   you know, the grandmother had these boundaries,
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:08.520]   or boundaries that you may have wished
[00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:10.920]   that you set personally for your family.
[00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:14.520]   And I think this is such an area where we can glean from you
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:15.920]   and your years of experience.
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:19.120]   So can you talk to us a little bit about the boundaries
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:21.800]   that you maybe are setting for yourself as a grandmother,
[00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:24.680]   or boundaries that you would encourage young moms
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:25.880]   to set for their families
[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:28.360]   as they navigate that new season of life?
[00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:30.560]   'Cause it's very different when you go from being just you
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:32.400]   and your spouse to you and your kids
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:33.920]   and your extended family.
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.040]   There's a lot in the mix.
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:37.160]   So can you just talk to us a little bit about that?
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:38.320]   - It's so interesting.
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:40.520]   I've thought a lot about this.
[00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:46.640]   Partly because I always have a plan.
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:47.960]   I always have a plan.
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:51.320]   I always like to, I sort of like to be in charge,
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:53.520]   and my kids and my husband probably roll their eyes
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:54.760]   and say, "Sort of."
[00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:56.440]   (laughing)
[00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:58.000]   Like when we go on vacation,
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.240]   when we go to Disney World, I make the plan.
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:01.080]   And they're just happy.
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:02.640]   You know, like what are we gonna do first?
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:04.960]   And where are we headed first?
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:07.120]   And as the girls grew up,
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:11.680]   you know, that was sometimes, frankly,
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:15.680]   one of the most bittersweet parts of my children growing up
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:20.480]   was realizing that there need to be boundaries
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:25.480]   as they grow about how much I tell them to do,
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:29.200]   how much I'm in charge.
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:31.680]   And that boundary needs to kind of,
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:34.000]   it starts to wiggle, right?
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.440]   So as my girls got older, I had to give them freedom.
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:43.040]   Even if I knew what they, quote unquote, "ought to do,"
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:45.720]   sometimes I needed to let them figure out
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:48.920]   what they would do, and then see maybe,
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:50.280]   "Hey, that was not the best thing.
[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:52.920]   "I ought to have done this."
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:55.640]   But they needed to figure that out on their own.
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:57.640]   And as they went to college,
[00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:01.520]   I learned to say less and listen more.
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:04.960]   I learned to ask a lot of questions
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:09.920]   and not given an opinion unless they asked me for it.
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:13.840]   You have no idea.
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:15.600]   You have no idea how hard that was.
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:20.600]   And ironically enough, texting saved me a lot of times
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:27.520]   because if my daughter had told me some of the things
[00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:31.480]   she told me on the phone and I had to react in the moment,
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:33.520]   it would not have been wise.
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:36.040]   But I could get a text about it and think,
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:37.760]   "Oh my goodness!"
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:40.160]   But I didn't say that because it was a text.
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:44.080]   And I could put it down, walk away, take a walk,
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:48.120]   reframe it, calm down.
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:51.120]   And then a lot of times what happened
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:55.960]   was I could ask a clarifying question
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:58.400]   because I had taken the deep breath.
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:01.280]   And sometimes the clarifying question made it clear
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:03.520]   that I had nothing to worry about,
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:08.360]   that my child was actually just extending an opportunity
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:12.480]   to discuss an idea, not telling me a decision,
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:15.520]   not communicating a decision she had made.
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:19.720]   And so I learned that asking questions
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:24.400]   and waiting for the answer instead of giving the answer
[00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:26.600]   was the best way to go.
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:30.200]   And so as a grandmother, I've really tried to do that.
[00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:35.200]   I have been, I have eagerly waited in the wings
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:38.480]   for my daughter to need me, right?
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:43.400]   To ask a question, I will always take her calls and texts
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:46.080]   before almost anybody else's.
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:50.320]   But I have tried to not rush in and say,
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:53.200]   "Well, when you were little, daddy and I did this,"
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:56.120]   or, "I think you should do this," or clearly,
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:59.120]   or just act like the plan that I made
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:00.360]   was obviously the right one.
[00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:01.960]   Why wouldn't you do that too?
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:08.400]   I have tried to hang back and make lots of supportive noises
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:13.040]   and tell her when she is doing an amazing job.
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:14.400]   And I look at her and say,
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:16.440]   "You are so much better at this than I was.
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:18.400]   "You are so much more relaxed,
[00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:21.840]   "and that is helping you and helping your son
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:23.880]   "so much for you to relax."
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:26.400]   So I try to give lots of encouragement
[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:28.200]   and lots of feedback,
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:31.440]   but not lots of opinions until they're sought.
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:33.680]   That's a boundary I'm trying to hold.
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:34.520]   - That's good.
[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:35.840]   - That is really good wisdom.
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:38.240]   I love how you just said supportive noises.
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:40.760]   'Cause that can come, you're right,
[00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:42.800]   that can come in so many different ways.
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:44.680]   You can use words, but sometimes it is,
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:46.080]   you just need to make the noise.
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:48.400]   And us daughters, we get it.
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:50.200]   We know our moms enough to be like,
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:51.880]   "Oh, she's not liking that.
[00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:53.440]   "Do I need to rethink something?"
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:55.360]   And it's exactly what you said.
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:56.760]   It's a noise.
[00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:57.600]   - I love it.
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:59.840]   We need to release a rehearsal pack.
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:01.440]   Supporting noises for mom.
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:02.280]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:03.120]   - Yeah.
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:03.960]   - Oh, that's right.
[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:05.440]   How funny that would be.
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:07.040]   - I love that you're just talking about
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:08.320]   encouraging your daughters,
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:11.160]   because you still are their mom,
[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:14.400]   and now you are a grandmother to their little ones.
[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:17.800]   And it is a little bit of a different role.
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:20.040]   It's not as, you know, with your grandkids,
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:21.200]   it's not as authoritative,
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:23.280]   but it doesn't mean it's any less significant,
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:27.280]   or you're not as important as a grandparent, right?
[00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:28.960]   I think the Bible tells us,
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:30.680]   you know, generation upon generation,
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:31.720]   you embark your wisdom,
[00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:35.840]   you tell the testimonies of what you have lived through,
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:39.840]   so that they may grow in their faith, most importantly,
[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:42.400]   but also just as followers of Jesus.
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:43.480]   - Yeah, I love that.
[00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:47.040]   - So as a grandparent, grandma,
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:48.520]   what are you called, Lisa?
[00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:49.360]   Nana?
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:50.680]   Grandma?
[00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:53.960]   - No, my husband, I am Lollie.
[00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:54.800]   - Lollie.
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:55.640]   Oh, that's cute.
[00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:56.480]   - Is he pop?
[00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:58.000]   - My husband is pop,
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.320]   and so the grandkids will come to Lollipop's house.
[00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:03.160]   - Oh my goodness.
[00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:04.000]   - That's so cute.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:04.840]   - I might have to steal that.
[00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:06.720]   - Take notes, everybody take notes.
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:07.560]   - Lollie and Pop.
[00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:08.400]   - You're free to steal that.
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:09.240]   - That's the best.
[00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:11.200]   And so that's really fun,
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:13.520]   that fits our personalities pretty well too.
[00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:14.360]   - It really does.
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:16.440]   All right, well, as Lollie,
[00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:19.720]   what is your biggest prayer for your grandkids?
[00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:22.640]   And then even as for your daughters,
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:26.120]   what is your biggest prayer as they are becoming parents?
[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:26.960]   Twofold.
[00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:31.920]   - For my grandson,
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:34.560]   I pray that he grows up
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:40.200]   to know God fully
[00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:45.200]   and to know how loved he is
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:47.320]   by God the Father.
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:50.320]   I pray that he feels the love of God
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:53.440]   and that it transforms him
[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:57.720]   into the man that God has already designed him to be.
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:59.560]   And that's my prayer for him.
[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:03.720]   The corollary of course is that
[00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:07.920]   I pray he feels the love and support of his family.
[00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:11.560]   And for my girls,
[00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:15.800]   I pray that they will be moms,
[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:21.960]   that they will understand the heart of God
[00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:24.960]   more deeply as they become parents.
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:30.040]   I know that that was really true for me.
[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:33.760]   I mean, I never really understood God the Father
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:39.640]   until I had a child of my own to love and to watch over.
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:46.200]   I pray that my girls never lose sight of the fact
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:51.200]   that God will entrust to them precious treasures
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:58.320]   that are theirs to shepherd, but not to own.
[00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:04.160]   That those babies will always belong to the Lord
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:06.280]   and he loans them out to us
[00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:10.280]   and allows us to shepherd them.
[00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:15.120]   I think that's what I want them to know.
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:17.360]   - Yeah, amen, that's beautiful.
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:19.880]   We can all take a note from that book.
[00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:22.200]   So as we close out,
[00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:24.480]   you know, just thinking over your years,
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:25.640]   you've got many years to come
[00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:27.560]   and many years under your belt,
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:32.200]   what advice would you wanna give to moms
[00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:35.280]   who are heading into maybe a new season?
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:38.300]   A mom who sees something on the horizon
[00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:41.160]   is probably trying to either brace herself
[00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:44.400]   or prepare her heart for, you know, what God's got.
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:46.360]   Sometimes it's a little of both,
[00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:48.760]   but what would you say to us mommas
[00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:50.360]   as we're transitioning in life?
[00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:53.960]   - I think what I would say
[00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:59.920]   is make everything a serious matter of prayer,
[00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:05.780]   but don't take anything including yourself too seriously.
[00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:11.280]   You know, take it all to the Lord and give it to him
[00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:13.000]   and do your best to leave it there.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.120]   I mean, we're all good at taking it to the Lord,
[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:17.400]   but sometimes we carry it away with us.
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:21.920]   Try to leave those big perplexities of life with the Lord,
[00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:26.800]   but then don't take yourself so seriously.
[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:29.200]   Nobody is expect, nobody but you
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:31.560]   is expecting you to be perfect
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:34.960]   and a perfect house is not a lot of fun to live in.
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:35.800]   - Amen.
[00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:40.680]   - So, so get dirty, make a mess,
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:44.160]   splash out of the bathtub, you know,
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:47.200]   track in on the kitchen floor,
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:50.640]   experience life at the end of the day,
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:55.520]   don't leave too much in the I wish I had pile
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:59.360]   and have more in the I'm glad I pile.
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:03.360]   - That's beautiful, I love it.
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:06.200]   Well, thank you so much for chatting with us today, Lisa.
[00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:08.200]   I still, I'm in that group that was like,
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:09.760]   I just want you to come parent my children.
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:12.800]   I am definitely in that group.
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:15.560]   - Nope, nobody loves your little ones like you do,
[00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:17.960]   and so you really are the very best one
[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:20.240]   to love and be with your children.
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:22.320]   - Absolutely, thank you all for letting me come.
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:24.760]   I have enjoyed this immensely.
[00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:29.200]   - What an amazing conversation.
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:32.040]   Lisa always has just so many good little nuggets
[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:34.320]   of wisdom and encouragement.
[00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:36.720]   I think my favorite thing she reminded me though,
[00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:39.080]   as a mom with a lot of little kids,
[00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:42.520]   is to find joy in just the simple things.
[00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:44.840]   And we get so caught up in,
[00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:46.640]   oh, I don't want to mess my kid up,
[00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:49.640]   or I don't want to do this and ruin their lives.
[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:52.160]   And in reality, we're not going to ruin their lives, right?
[00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:54.480]   God has got them in His hands.
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:56.720]   And what a great reminder that was for Lisa.
[00:35:56.720 --> 00:36:00.040]   It just kind of lets me take a deep breath
[00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:02.200]   and say, you know what?
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:04.080]   God has got them, you know?
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:05.520]   I'm not gonna mess anything up.
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:06.960]   Can I do things better?
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:11.240]   Potentially, yes, but we can't be fearful to fail.
[00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:14.040]   And I think that's what any mom in any stage
[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:17.400]   really can hear and just grab onto.
[00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:19.040]   - Absolutely, so guys,
[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:21.600]   I hope that you enjoyed this conversation.
[00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:23.480]   And if you did, we would love it
[00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:25.360]   if you would share this with another friend
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:26.560]   who's a mom that you know
[00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:28.120]   could just use a little pep talk today,
[00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:29.640]   send this episode to them.
[00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:31.360]   And if you're not already subscribed,
[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:33.360]   we'd love it if you would hit the subscribe button.
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:34.440]   It's mostly for you,
