[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.440]   A listener named Ian in Australia writes in to ask this, "Pastor John, how would you
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.120]   preach from Psalm 103.3, which says that God heals all our diseases? Do we just
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.020]   spiritualize this? He heals us from the disease of sin? Or do we take it in the
[00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.920]   ultimate sense that one day we will be healed in heaven? There are many
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.880]   Christians today who die of awful diseases." Yeah, this is an
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:35.400]   absolutely crucial question because verse 3 of Psalm 103, "He forgives all
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:43.640]   your iniquity, He heals all your diseases," is one of dozens of places in the Psalms
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:51.200]   that seem to promise things that are so idealistic, so far beyond anybody's
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.520]   ordinary experience. And so we really do need an answer to this question of not
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.680]   only how to teach them, but how to believe them, how to enjoy them. What
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.880]   comforts me, and has helped me perhaps as much as anything in wrestling with the
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.660]   absolute statements of blessing in the Psalms, is that Jesus knew this problem
[00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:20.200]   and the devil knew it, and the way they interacted about it is very illuminating.
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.960]   So the devil knows Psalm 91. It's one of those Psalms like, "The arrow will not
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.280]   come near you," you know? It's just an amazing Psalm, Psalm 91. You're gonna be
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.760]   protected. Nothing is gonna harm you. So the devil quotes this to Jesus, standing
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.400]   on the top of the temple, and he says, "If you're the Son of God, throw yourself
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.320]   down from here, for it is written," and he quotes it in the Bible. The devil's
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.600]   quoting the Bible. "He will command his angels concerning you to guard you. On
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.360]   their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against the stone."
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:04.040]   In other words, he's saying, "Jesus, jump off of here, because the Bible says angels
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:10.960]   won't let you die jumping off this temple." So he's tempting Jesus by quoting
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:17.240]   him in Scripture, just like he heals all your diseases. I mean, they're in the same
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.920]   category. He never lets you dash your foot against the stone. You can't fall
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:28.360]   off a cliff if you're a Christian, and you won't get any diseases, or if you get
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:34.600]   one, you'll be healed. And Jesus answered him and said, "You shall not put the Lord
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.840]   your God to the test." That's Luke 4 and 9. "You shall not put the Lord your God to the
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:46.080]   test." So for Jesus, the devil was quoting the Bible at a wrong time, in the wrong
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:53.160]   way, for the wrong end. Jesus had come into the world to suffer and to die. He
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:03:00.640]   was going to be crushed. Therefore, all the Psalms of never coming to harm,
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.520]   or always being delivered, could not be applied directly to Jesus at any
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:14.400]   given moment. He came to die. So to try to apply the Psalm to the best of men would
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:22.440]   be a misapplication. And Jesus knew it, and Paul knew it. In fact, Paul saw that
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:28.520]   the Psalms themselves would not allow this kind of simple application to every
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:38.240]   person at any time. Psalm 44, 22 says, "For your sake, God, we are being killed all
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:44.240]   day long. We are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered." Now, in that context, in Psalm
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.440]   44, 22, that is not owing to God's judgment, it's not owing to their
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.160]   sin, it's simply the fact they've been faithful and they're being slaughtered.
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:04.400]   Which is why Paul quotes it in Romans 8, as part of what Christians can expect. He
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.280]   says, "What shall separate us from the love of God? Shall tribulation, distress, or
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.200]   persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? As it is written, we are
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:18.640]   being killed all day long." So he quotes the very Psalm that says we'll be
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:26.040]   killed and destroyed. And so Christians can expect this. So now, against that
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:35.160]   backdrop of the New Testament, and Jesus and Paul helping us not oversimplify the
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.280]   absolute statements of blessing in the Psalms, what do they mean? And here's
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:45.600]   my threefold answer. Number one, there is coming a time when all of these
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:51.400]   statements, all of these promises, will be fulfilled in Jesus and in all of those
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:58.840]   who are in Jesus, in the new earth, in the ideal world. And all those promises will
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:04.960]   not prove to be overstatements. All sins will be forgiven, all diseases will be
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:10.960]   healed, eventually. And Jesus has forged a way through suffering, he calls us to
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.320]   forge the way through suffering into the full experience of those Psalms in the
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:24.040]   age to come. Second, in this world, God does heal. And all healing that comes to
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:30.720]   us comes to us from God. And so we should look for it, ask for it, thank him when he
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:39.320]   gives it. But the final promise of no more death and no more disease will come
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:47.040]   in the future. And third, even our diseases and our calamities are not
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:53.760]   defeats. That's what Paul said, "In them all we are more than conquerors through
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:59.840]   him who loved us." They work good for us now, in all the ways that count, and they
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.760]   prepare a weight of glory beyond all comparison. So that's how I would teach
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:10.920]   my people to read that Psalm. He heals all your diseases, meaning he will heal
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:18.480]   them in the age to come. He heals them often now, and when he doesn't, they work
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.640]   a healing that's even better. Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening
