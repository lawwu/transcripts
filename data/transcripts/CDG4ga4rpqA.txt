[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880]   And so I thought let's get philosophical today.
[00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:09.240]   The deep question I want to tackle, why is it important to preserve the
[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.720]   vanishing art of thinking?
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.600]   So I want to dive deep on that question.
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:25.000]   I'm Cal Newport, and this is Deep Questions, the show about working and
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.320]   living deeply in a distracted world.
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:37.440]   I'm here in my deep work HQ, joined as always by my producer, Jesse.
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.120]   Jesse, you know why I'm in a good mood today?
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:40.960]   Why's that?
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:41.960]   Going to the ballpark.
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.160]   Yeah, baby.
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.640]   Seen the Nationals play, the Padres.
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.440]   I think, and Jesse, you'll back me up on this.
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.880]   The audience wouldn't mind if we then therefore dedicated today's show to the
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.360]   analytical picture of the 2023 Nationals.
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.320]   I think that's appropriate.
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.360]   I think it's appropriate.
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.680]   I watched a little of the game last night.
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.640]   They were down three, nothing.
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:05.480]   I'm not sure what happened.
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.600]   They tied it up for two run home run by Abrams and a one run home run by Thomas.
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.760]   But then Soto hit a home run and Erasmus gave up two runs and we lost by three.
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.440]   But what I want to get into, and I think everyone, especially our
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.440]   international listeners will be very interested in this, is trying to
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:29.000]   understand if the gap between Josiah Gray's FIP and ERA is something we
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.520]   should worry about, or if it's instead actually just capturing the increased
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.480]   weak contact we're getting off of his newly developed cutter.
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.000]   So I have three guests we're going to bring on to get into this in detail.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   No, I'm joking, but I am happy about going to the Nats.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.480]   It's my first game I've seen of the season.
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.600]   I haven't made it out there yet, Jesse.
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.200]   So, uh, good atmosphere down there.
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.880]   Not a lot of people go to the games, but yeah, I think weeknight, though Soto
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.080]   might, you know, the Padres are in town, but yeah, weeknight, weeknight Nats
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.840]   might be a fun, like not that many people.
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:57.280]   Yeah.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.600]   We'll see.
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.840]   They have 30,000 there this weekend.
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.440]   For one game?
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.920]   One game.
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:02.320]   Yeah.
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.680]   Yeah.
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.320]   31,000.
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.040]   And what's it hold?
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.960]   Uh, God, 40 something.
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.600]   Okay.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.840]   Yeah.
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.600]   Yeah.
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.240]   So like a playoff game, they'll get like 42 or 40, 43.
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.080]   Uh, but I'm not, I will say, I promise I won't actually, I won't actually
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.600]   talk that much about baseball.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.000]   In fact, let me, let me change gears and talk about something completely unrelated.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.680]   Uh, it was actually a pretty cool, it got me thinking, Jesse, it
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.400]   was a cool documentary from 1966.
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.040]   It's on YouTube and a listener sent it to me and I hadn't seen it before.
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.640]   And it's a documentary in which it's about John von Neumann.
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.760]   If you don't know John von Neumann, he's a sort of first half of the 20th century
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:48.280]   got mathematicians slash physicists slash electrical engineer for those in the know.
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.600]   Von Neumann is considered essentially one of the smartest human beings to ever live.
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.680]   He just made breakthroughs in field after field at a stunning speed.
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.560]   He was based largely, especially in the war period out of Princeton and the
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.040]   Princeton area, the Institute for Advanced Studies, Princeton university.
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.960]   Uh, and he was known for being able to walk in and goodwill hunting style,
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:14.240]   solve your equation, reconceptualize your whole physical framework build.
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.080]   He built one of the very first digital computers.
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.360]   And it was a very smart guy.
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.360]   Not as well known as some of his contemporaries like Girdle or
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.480]   Turing, but a very smart guy.
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.120]   Anyway, so it says 1966 documentary.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.840]   It's old, muddy, black and white footage is shown on YouTube, but it included
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.440]   a clip that caught my attention.
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.320]   This was, uh, the physicist Edward Teller was being interviewed about von Neumann.
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.560]   I'm going to bring this up on the screen here.
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.720]   So if you're watching, you should be looking for episode two 50.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.920]   At youtube.com/CalNewportMedia.
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.920]   You can also find it as episode two 50 at the deep life.com.
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.760]   So I have up on the screen here, a picture of Edward Teller
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.000]   from this 1966 documentary.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.600]   And here he is talking about von Neumann.
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.960]   He says, many people have wondered how Johnny von Neumann could think so
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:11.320]   fast and so effectively how he could find so many original solutions in areas where
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.440]   most people did not even notice the problems.
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.560]   I think I know a part of the answer.
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.240]   Perhaps an important path or important part.
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.680]   Johnny von Neumann enjoyed thinking.
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.680]   I have come to suspect that the most people thinking is painful.
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.520]   Some of us are addicted to thinking.
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.920]   Some of us find it a necessity.
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.960]   Johnny enjoyed it.
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.840]   I even have the suspicion that he enjoyed practically nothing else.
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.200]   This explains a lot because, uh, what you like, you do well.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.080]   And he liked thinking, not just in mathematics.
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.840]   He liked thinking in the clear and complete manner of a
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.080]   mathematician in every field.
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.360]   In mathematics and physics, in the business world, his father
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.360]   was a banker in many other fields.
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.760]   So this sent me down a cognitive rabbit hole.
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:05:00.040]   I began thinking, reflecting about thinking itself, thinking as an activity
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.200]   to which you can develop or have a relationship and the role of thinking,
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.800]   not just in our culture, but in the fully developed human life.
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.680]   And so I thought, let's get philosophical today.
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.760]   The deep question I want to tackle, why is it important to preserve
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.480]   the vanishing art of thinking?
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.360]   So I want to dive deep on that question.
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.720]   Then we'll have a collection of questions from you, my listeners that
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.560]   all vaguely relate to this general theme of how you improve your ability to think.
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.080]   And then we'll, we'll shift gears at the end of the show and talk about some
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.240]   of the books I read last month.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.120]   All right.
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.200]   So let's jump into this deep dive.
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.600]   We need to start with definitions.
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.400]   What do we mean when we say thinking?
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.040]   Let's define it like this for now.
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:48.920]   The uniquely human activity of synthesizing and structuring existing
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.360]   information to create new information that's useful to understanding
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.360]   or acting in the world.
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.960]   So you bring in information, you structure it in your head in such a way that
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.320]   actually produces information that improves the world, you have a better
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.360]   understanding or it can impact the way people act and make more value happen
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.840]   in those actions, we're being pretty general here, but that's thinking.
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:16.920]   It's, it's, uh, building something new out of existing information.
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.880]   Now I'm going to claim that thinking is the core driver of human culture,
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:28.120]   of human invention and human civilization is what distinguishes us from other species.
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.400]   Uh, it also should not be surprising that this type of thinking, the
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:37.880]   creation of useful information is deeply satisfying for human beings in a way that
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:42.320]   it's hard for other activities to replicate.
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.160]   We've known this for a while.
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.600]   Aristotle wrote about this.
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.800]   I'm going to bring up an Aristotle quote here on the screen.
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:52.960]   Uh, this is from the ethics, I believe book 10, section seven.
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.960]   Here is Aristotle.
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.560]   "The activity of philosophic wisdom is admittedly the pleasantest
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.120]   of virtuous activities.
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:06.280]   At all events, the pursuit of thought, uh, to offer pleasures that are
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:10.400]   marvelous for their purity and their enduringness, and is to be expected
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.640]   that those who know will pass their time more pleasantly than those who inquire.
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:19.160]   The activity of reason, which is contemplative, seems both to be superior
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:24.080]   in serious worth and to aim at the no end beyond itself, to have
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.640]   its pleasure proper to itself."
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:31.160]   This is Aristotle in the ethics where he, in book 10, comes to this conclusion
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:36.160]   that the teleological necessity of human beings is our ability to think
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.160]   deeply, that we get pleasure out of that for no other reason than just thinking,
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.800]   because this is what humans can do that nothing else can.
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:46.280]   It is in thinking, in deep contemplation, what he calls
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:50.520]   philosophic wisdom, that we find our full expression.
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:54.040]   So we, from the beginning of us starting to reflect about the human condition,
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:57.320]   we knew thinking was important.
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:00.200]   All right, here's the problem.
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:06.640]   I believe we're in a moment where the value of thinking is decreasing.
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:11.000]   It's decreasing in part because we think about it less, that's
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.680]   sort of a circular irony there.
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:13.840]   We think about thinking less.
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:16.920]   We isolate it less as a standalone activity.
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:23.480]   We're much less likely to think of it as a particular pursuit that we might focus
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:28.360]   on or emphasize or cultivate in our own lives, thinking is getting pushed to the
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:32.680]   margins of our understanding of our culture.
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:35.000]   Now there's a lot of reasons why this is true.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.680]   I want to point to one particular reason in particular, which I've been, I've
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:41.160]   been thinking about recently, and I'm trying to articulate, so I'm going to
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:42.960]   try out some rough thoughts for you here.
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:46.520]   And this is the impact that's coming from the knowledge sector, from the
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:51.840]   work, the world of work, in particular, knowledge work, intertwined with the,
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:55.440]   the world of technology, which itself is connected to the world of work.
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:01.280]   I've come to believe that the knowledge sector is uncomfortable with this
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:06.400]   Aristotelian, Jean van Neumann style understanding of thinking as this
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.560]   fundamentally creative human activity.
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:16.040]   The reason is if you're in the business of transforming information into value,
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:21.120]   this is what happens in the knowledge sector, human thinking in that type of
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:25.680]   purified, creative form is complicated for you.
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:32.600]   It is hard to predictably find people who can do it well.
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.640]   It is hard to evaluate thinking.
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.720]   Is someone thinking well, what value are they producing through their thinking?
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:43.160]   It's hard to manage thinking because it's interior and the
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.800]   results are not always obvious.
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.200]   And you can't tell what's happening in someone's head.
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:51.320]   Are they thinking or are they instead contemplating Josiah
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.640]   Gray's FIP instead of his ERA?
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.720]   And so it makes us uncomfortable, especially if you imagine a
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:00.680]   industrial sector that has, I mean, an economic sector that has come out of
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.920]   before this, it was a industry, it was manufacturing, before that it was
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:07.520]   agriculture, these were economic productions in which the, the chain
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.880]   between inputs and outputs is much more clarified.
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:13.040]   We really understand the different processes and how effective they are.
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:15.760]   All of this goes away when we're instead thinking about what's
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.320]   happening between someone's ears.
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:22.000]   This idea that just creativity and contemplation is going to eventually
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.240]   produce something that's real valuable.
[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.280]   That's nerve wracking.
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:31.680]   If you own a company, if you manage a team, thinking the knowledge sector
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.400]   also leads to superstar dynamics.
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:40.080]   If you have built your industry on the quality, the competitive quality of rare
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:43.120]   raw thought stuff produced by your employee, that's going to lead to
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:48.160]   superstar dynamics in which having the very best thinker in a particular area
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:52.320]   is significantly more valuable than having the second best thinker or
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.960]   kind of good thinkers, and that creates problems for business.
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:58.960]   That also creates problems for employees as well.
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:04.040]   In fields where we do still directly value raw thought stuff, thinking like
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:08.400]   academia, it's an incredibly competitive superstar market where hundreds of
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:12.520]   people apply for any tenure track position and only one will actually get the position.
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:15.000]   So, so thinking also creates economic dynamics.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.200]   Building revenue off of the sheer quality of what comes out of a brain is difficult.
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:23.760]   Because maybe only one company has an Aristotle, and if you don't,
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:25.840]   you're going to struggle.
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.800]   Well, that company is going to take all the business.
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.240]   All right.
[00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.360]   So what has the world of business done instead?
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:38.560]   Well, my argument is they would like to rely more on computation, not cognition.
[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:44.040]   And we'd like to push human cognitive agency towards the margins of these efforts.
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:47.720]   I believe the world of knowledge work is more comfortable when they think of
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:55.680]   humans as the custodians of computation, as opposed to centers of original cognition.
[00:11:55.680 --> 00:12:00.360]   And I think they're being egged on, this industry sector is being egged on in
[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:04.760]   this by the tech industry that is creating these computational tools.
[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:06.840]   So what do I mean by this?
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:11.160]   Well, we're thinking about this almost assembly line type model that's
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:16.480]   developing in knowledge work in which what's important is data and computer
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:22.040]   programs that can find this data, that can analyze this data, that can generate
[00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:24.200]   insights from this data that's important.
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:27.960]   So the cogitation here is actually being reduced to algorithmic digital
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:30.840]   computation and what do humans do in this picture?
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:34.840]   They help identify what problems are important.
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:37.520]   They point these programs in the right direction.
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:41.040]   They massage the interface and the settings of the programs.
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:45.920]   They look at the resulting conclusions of these programs and then translate
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:49.880]   that into action, they get together to make decisions about where to actually
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:53.120]   aim this proverbial computational canon.
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:57.560]   But the actual human sitting there thinking hard thoughts and creating
[00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:01.640]   new value out of nothing is devalued in this framework.
[00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:05.360]   It is very similar to what happened in industrial manufacturing with the rise
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:12.760]   of assembly lines, where you went from a world of craft, I have all the expertise
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:21.640]   needed to build a complicated mechanism, like a automobile, a craftsman, Ben's
[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:27.080]   working in the Oldsmobile Ben's factory in Germany in 1900, and it went from that
[00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:33.520]   to, now I turned the bolt that puts the steering wheel onto the Model T.
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:38.280]   All the thoughts is all the intelligence is in the process and I'm just a
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:40.080]   custodian of this complex process.
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:42.320]   I think that is comfortable, right?
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:45.480]   That opened up huge profitability in the industrial manufacturing sector.
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:48.400]   And I think that's something similar to this happening in knowledge work.
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:50.480]   Human cogitation is scary.
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:51.480]   We don't know what to do with it.
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:57.240]   A Salesforce database that's hooked up to some sort of custom ML analytic tool.
[00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:00.680]   And what you do as a humans is just have meetings on zoom, the sort of like pick
[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:02.960]   targets and point the software in the right direction.
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:04.760]   That's much more comfortable.
[00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:08.560]   This obviously also makes a lot of sense for the tech companies because now all
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:13.000]   of the value is in the technological tools, it opens up the possibility for a
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.680]   tech company to have a massive piece of the economic pie in the sector.
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:19.680]   If you build a software, everyone is using, then you're going
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:21.080]   to make massive profitability.
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:24.800]   So now we can consolidate a huge amount of the revenue being generated in the
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:26.920]   economic sector and a small number of companies.
[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:31.200]   This is what Microsoft did in the 1990s with their office productivity software.
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:36.280]   It's what open AI is hoping to do now in the 2020s with their plugin enhanced.
[00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:41.680]   Large language model interfaces where they're hoping to ingrain themselves
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:44.560]   into automating more and more of the piece of this knowledge work assembly
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:48.600]   line, and therefore have a small number of people siphon off a huge amount of
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:52.400]   these profits, this assembly line approach in which humans are custodians
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:55.880]   of computation is also good for knowledge work firms themselves because it makes
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:59.280]   work more predictable workers themselves become more interchangeable.
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:05.200]   It is a much more ordered world of valued knowledge production.
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.520]   Right?
[00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:09.920]   So in this context, we devalue good old fashioned, hard and original thinking.
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:12.920]   We don't even identify it as a standalone activity anymore.
[00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:16.760]   All of our terminology about what makes someone a valuable or productive
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:20.800]   employee is going to instead collapse on issues of efficiency.
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:23.040]   How quick can they get things?
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:24.800]   How quick can they move information around?
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:29.920]   How agile are they in actually working with these various information systems
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:32.240]   to extract information from it?
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:35.480]   We have just a general sense of this person is available.
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:38.800]   This person is busy as a mark that they are a good employee and
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:39.800]   that we should work with them.
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:43.120]   And what's gone out of this picture is how smart is this person?
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:45.280]   How original is their thinking?
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:47.480]   That's been pushed to the margins.
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:50.400]   So there's a lot we should do about this, right?
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:55.320]   This is a complicated issue that exists that many different scopes.
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:56.880]   And I don't want to get into most of those scopes.
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:59.400]   There's a whole economic argument to make here about the structure of
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:05.800]   knowledge, work and agency and whether the quote Braverman, if the de-skilling
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:11.480]   that so plagued the manufacturing sector is now itself being applied
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:15.000]   to the knowledge sector, there's theses you could write on this, but I want to
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.320]   focus as we do often on this show on the individual, what the individual response
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.920]   could be right now to the situation.
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:27.320]   And I think one of the first things we can do to push back this devaluing of
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:29.320]   thinking is as individuals reclaim it.
[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:36.520]   If as individuals, we reclaim thinking as a, think of it as the signal of our
[00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:39.640]   humanity, something that we are proud of, that we want to get better at, that we
[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:41.080]   want to put the center of our lives.
[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:45.320]   This creates a back pressure against attempts to try to
[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:47.160]   devalue it and push it to the side.
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:50.720]   We don't even know what we're losing if we don't actually spend time
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:53.680]   trying to support it or develop it.
[00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:58.240]   So of the various responses we need to this current moment, I think a good one
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:04.120]   is just us as individuals starting to talk about thinking again, in the same
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:08.440]   way, like we might talk about other abilities, we should reclaim it in our
[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:14.480]   own lives, we should reteach our brains how to do it well, this has been considered
[00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:17.320]   before, I want to bring up a quote here on the screen.
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:22.560]   This is from Arnold Bennett in his 1910 book, how to live on 24 hours a day.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.800]   One of the very first, what we might think of as a modern advice or self help book.
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:31.000]   I actually have a first edition of this book that a listener sent me.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.320]   I forgot to bring it.
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:34.720]   It's on a display in my library at home.
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:40.120]   And it's an important part of my collection because Bennett is really an early thinker
[00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:43.280]   of this form of, you know, a smart person who's thought a lot about the world,
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:46.640]   trying to actually put their thoughts into a prescriptive framework as a way of
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:48.120]   actually trying to improve people's lives.
[00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:51.120]   So it's a very important book for those of us who write pragmatic nonfiction.
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.960]   But he tackled this issue in 1910.
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:59.320]   He was worried about with the rise of the sort of suburban knowledge work commuter
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:04.240]   that people were going to be increasingly alienated from actual thinking.
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:05.240]   And he gave real advice.
[00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:05.920]   Let's look at this here.
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:06.920]   I want to read a couple of quotes.
[00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.440]   He starts by setting the stakes.
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:14.680]   Without the power to concentrate, that is to say without the power to dictate to the
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:19.720]   brain, its task and to ensure obedience, true life is impossible.
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:22.720]   Mind control is the first element of a full existence.
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:27.440]   So this has Bennett saying, if you can't aim your brain at interesting or meaningful
[00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:31.560]   or useful activity and have it actually think deeply about it, you do not have a
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:32.560]   full existence.
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:33.960]   Aristotle would agree with this.
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:37.880]   So he goes on to say, hence, it seems to me the first business of the day should be to
[00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:40.040]   put the mind through its paces.
[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:42.120]   Here's his specific piece of advice.
[00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:48.120]   When you leave your house, concentrate your mind on a subject, no matter what to
[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:52.280]   begin with. You will not have gone 10 yards before your mind has skipped away under
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:55.760]   your very eyes and is lurking around the corner with another subject, but bring it
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.200]   back by the scruff of the neck.
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.840]   Have you reached the station?
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:02.960]   You will have brought it back about 40 times.
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:04.240]   So he's talking here about.
[00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:09.080]   Essentially, the subway station, this was the the era, the early 20th century was the
[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:13.480]   era of the London suburbs, the growth of what he called the strap hangers, the people
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:16.720]   who would get on a train and hold on to the strap and drive into the city to actually
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.080]   do their work. That was new back then.
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:20.560]   Do not despair. Continue.
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:21.920]   Keep it up. You will succeed.
[00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:23.960]   You cannot by any chance fail if you persevere.
[00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:28.000]   It is idle to pretend that your mind is incapable of concentration.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.400]   Do you not remember that morning when you received the disquieting letter which
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:35.520]   demanded a very carefully worded answer, how you let your mind steadily kept your mind
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:39.200]   steadily on the subject of the answer without a second's intermission until you
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.920]   reached your office, whereupon you instantly sat down and wrote the answer?
[00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:46.400]   That was a case in which you were aroused by the circumstances to such a degree of
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:49.560]   vitality that you were able to dominate your mind like a tyrant.
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:51.400]   You would have no trifling.
[00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:54.960]   You insisted that his work should be done and his work was done.
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:20:00.200]   Right. So even in 1910, we get this interesting advice from Arnold Bennett saying
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:03.280]   essentially what I call productive meditation in my books.
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:07.400]   This is him 100 years earlier saying, yeah, teach your mind how to think.
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:08.680]   Give it something to think about.
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:11.840]   Bring your attention back to the subject again and again.
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:17.640]   You have more control over your mind than you think if you do the work to be a good
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:21.000]   thinker is to be like someone who can run a fast mile.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.920]   Humans are capable of running a fast mile, but it takes a lot of training.
[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:28.800]   You have to get your heart and your lungs and your legs used to the distance.
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:31.560]   Bennett is saying you can do the same with your head.
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:36.160]   There's a lot of other things we might talk about here in terms of how you might
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:37.920]   reclaim thinking in your life.
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:42.240]   You've heard many of these mentioned in isolation before on the show.
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:46.600]   We're talking about ideas like avoiding cheap digital distraction as your default
[00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:52.480]   response to boredom, reading hard books, struggling with harder ambiguous ideas as
[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:55.800]   a regular part of your leisure, simplifying the demands on your life so you have more
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:21:02.000]   space for open thought for toying with things, high quality leisure that pushes
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.720]   your mind to contemplate beauty and heart and art and high quality.
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:08.200]   All these things can matter.
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:10.480]   I think all these things are important.
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:15.760]   They're not trifles, uh, luxuries of the indulgent.
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:19.560]   They're really at the core of the human condition and we should care about it.
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:24.000]   Right at a time in which I think there's a lot of pressures as we just talked about
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.200]   a lot of the economic pressures to try to get us to ignore this most human of
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:32.640]   activity is the time I think that we should instead care more about it.
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.960]   We are not mere custodians of computation.
[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:38.920]   We're not mere receptacles of digital distraction.
[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:43.960]   We are like Aristotle or John von Neumann before us, beings capable, capable of
[00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:48.680]   wrangling information out of the ether and through force of concentration, produce
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:52.800]   new conceptual structures of majestic scope.
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:57.680]   So thinking matters and we should take it more seriously.
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:01.800]   Oh, no, these are early thoughts, Jesse, but I've been thinking a lot about
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:04.560]   thinking recently, which is kind of ironic.
[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:05.640]   I like it.
[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:06.040]   Yeah.
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:11.560]   But I like that, that von Neumann clip is like von Neumann was so in love with
[00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:13.640]   thinking that he became a superhero.
[00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:16.520]   Basically he could just, we're just breaking through his everywhere because
[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:17.920]   his mind was so comfortable with it.
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:22.560]   And, uh, you know, it's not, it's not the way the world of business thinks right now.
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:24.280]   It's, it's too scary to think about.
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:27.000]   The mind and just think and produce great thoughts.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:27.960]   We want to reward you for it.
[00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:32.520]   It's like, we'd much rather you be moving information around and visibly on Slack
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:35.840]   and email and in meetings and we're just much more comfortable with that.
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:38.080]   Did he live a long life?
[00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:38.920]   I think so.
[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:39.680]   Yeah.
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:40.640]   Yeah.
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:43.960]   Um, growing up near Princeton, everyone would tell von Neumann stories.
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:46.160]   So he was, he was a smart guy.
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:49.200]   Uh, people think about like Richard Feynman.
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:52.840]   Richard Feynman was very smart in physics, but von Neumann was smart in physics
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:55.440]   and mathematics and artificial life and electrical engineering, really
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:56.920]   crazy, the polymath he was.
[00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:00.480]   Uh, put him up against someone like Turing and he would
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:01.600]   just blow him out of the water.
[00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:07.200]   Like Turing was a very creative guy, very original guy, but von Neumann was a heavy.
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:11.200]   Like he could come in and make a breakthrough in physics, make a
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:13.960]   breakthrough in graph theory, make a breakthrough in all these different fields.
[00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:14.360]   You know?
[00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:17.800]   Uh, so he was really an intellectual superstar.
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:18.320]   He's a cool guy.
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:20.440]   Interesting guy.
[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:20.920]   All right.
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:24.040]   So what I want to do is some questions now that vaguely have to do with this
[00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:29.840]   general theme of prioritizing or improving your ability to think before we do.
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:32.920]   Let me first mention a sponsor that helps make this show possible.
[00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:36.520]   That is our friends at Rhone, R H O N E.
[00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:40.600]   In particular, I want to talk about their commuter collection, the most
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:45.840]   comfortable, breathable, and flexible set of clothing products known to man.
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:50.480]   I like Rhone clothing and this commuter collection only strengthens my
[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:53.040]   appreciation of the products they make.
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:56.880]   So the commuter collection offers the world's most comfortable pants,
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:59.720]   dress shirts, fourth zips, and polos.
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:04.520]   It uses comfortable four-way stretch fabric to provide breathability
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:07.520]   and flexibility that leaves you free to enjoy what life throws your way.
[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:13.560]   From your commute to your 18 holes of golf, golf, uh, it has wrinkle
[00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:16.720]   release technology, so wrinkles disappear as you stretch and wear the products.
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:19.080]   It has gold fusion, anti-odor technology.
[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:21.400]   It's a hundred percent machine washable.
[00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:23.880]   I love this stuff because it's lightweight.
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:27.880]   It looks good and it breathes, especially if you're going to have a hard or long day.
[00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:32.280]   So if I'm going to be at a conference all day, or if I'm teaching, I love a Rhone
[00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:33.880]   shirt, cause it's going to be very lightweight.
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:34.640]   It's going to breathe.
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:38.920]   It is going to look wrinkle-free as you wear it, it gets smoother.
[00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:41.160]   You can, don't have to take it to the dry cleaner.
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:46.840]   It's a great match, I think, for the modern knowledge worker who's
[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:51.520]   sometimes at home and sometimes on the road and is traveling and has long days.
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:56.680]   And once I go to the golf course from, from the office, the commuter collection
[00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:58.520]   at Rhone, it has what you need.
[00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:01.600]   So the commuter collection can get you through any workday and
[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:02.920]   straight into whatever comes next.
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:07.120]   Head to rhone.com/cal and use that promo code CAL to save
[00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:09.120]   20% off your entire order.
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:11.080]   That's 20% off your order.
[00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:16.720]   When you head to rhone.com/cal and use that code CAL, it's time to
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:18.960]   find your corner office comfort.
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:24.760]   And of course, no matter how well you look in terms of your clothing, you're
[00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:26.080]   not going to make the impression you want.
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:27.520]   If your shave is no good.
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:32.800]   So this brings us to another sponsor of the show, our friends at Hinson Shaving.
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:36.120]   This is the razor that I use.
[00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:37.240]   So I've talked about them before.
[00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:41.280]   Hinson Shaving is a family owned aerospace parts manufacturer.
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:46.080]   So they focus on making incredibly precise engineered parts for things like the
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:48.080]   international space station or the Mars rovers.
[00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:51.880]   They could then use this precision milling technology to
[00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:54.600]   build their Hinson's razor.
[00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:58.080]   It's milled out of aluminum to an incredibly precise specification.
[00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:03.720]   The blade that you put into a Hinson's razor extends only 0.0013
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:05.560]   inches beyond the edge of the razor.
[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:10.360]   This is what allows it to give you a clean, close shave.
[00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:15.240]   If you have the razor extend too far, you get the diving board effect where
[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.720]   the razor is moving up and down.
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:17.880]   That's, what's going to give you nicks.
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:19.600]   That's what's going to give you an uneasy shave.
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:23.120]   So the precision of the manufacturing of this razor gives you
[00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:27.880]   a incredibly close shave, reduces clogs as well.
[00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:29.280]   But here's, what's cool about it.
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:35.280]   The trade-off is because this razor is so precisely milled, you can use just a
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:40.000]   standard 10 cent safety razor blade inside the fancy razor.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.200]   You don't need 19 blades that are laser guided with vibration
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:45.480]   technology to get a good shave.
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:47.920]   You need a quality razor to hold a standard blade.
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:54.200]   What this means is you will quickly make back the cost of the razor because of all
[00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:58.480]   of the savings you have on how cheap the blades become, and it doesn't take long
[00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:04.160]   before the cost of using the Hinson razor becomes significantly cheaper than using
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:08.480]   the disposables from the drugstore or the subscription services.
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:11.800]   It's also just a really nice piece of engineering as a tool.
[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:12.960]   It's just a beautiful object.
[00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:15.040]   I have this milled aluminum stand.
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:18.320]   They gave me that I put my Hinson razor on.
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:22.520]   So it's time to say no to subscriptions and yes to a razor
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:23.760]   that'll last you a lifetime.
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:30.000]   Visit hinsonshaving.com/cal to pick the razor for you and use code CAL and you'll
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.080]   get two years worth of blades free with your razor.
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:34.400]   Just make sure to add them to your cart.
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:42.560]   That's 100 free blades when you head to H E N S O N S H A V I N G.com/cal
[00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:44.480]   and use that code CAL.
[00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:47.280]   All right, Jesse, let's do some questions.
[00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:48.440]   Who is first up?
[00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:49.640]   All right.
[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:52.720]   First question is from Derek, a 34 year old engineer.
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:56.960]   Is there room in a deep life for watching movies and shows and how do you
[00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:58.720]   approach spending time on them?
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:04.000]   So one thing I wanted to point out in my answer here is that if you're watching
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:09.920]   a good movie and you're giving it your full concentration, it is a similar act
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:16.000]   to reading a good, let's say novel, your mind will have a lot of work to do to
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.680]   try to make sense of what's going on and what's it seen and what are the themes
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:22.400]   and how are those themes interacting with what you're seeing on the screen.
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:26.080]   And that's fantastic training for thinking because that is thinking.
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:30.240]   That is you taking these existing schemas of understanding your mind and trying
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:34.320]   to build off them or apply them to understand this interesting, complicated
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:36.720]   thing that you are seeing.
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:42.160]   Uh, this is particularly true of certain genres that just the other day, actually,
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:48.000]   Jesse, I watched Paul Schrader's film from 2017 first reformed Paul Schrader,
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.200]   the writer director known, uh, you know, namely for his scripts from the seventies
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:56.240]   like taxi driver and the last temptation of Christ.
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:58.080]   He did a lot of work with Scorsese.
[00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:00.240]   Uh, first of all, first of all, a great movie.
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:01.600]   I think it's 2017.
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:06.080]   It's first in a trilogy, uh, taxi driver type vibe.
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:06.320]   Right.
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:11.680]   There's a sort of Travis Bickle type vibe is this sort of slow degradation of the,
[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:15.760]   the individual who sort of placid on the top and seating underneath.
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:19.520]   But it's a style that Schrader's really into a transcendentalist film, which
[00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:24.240]   means that the whole film is filmed in such a way that he calls it the delayed
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:29.520]   cut, the scene starts often before the actors even enter the scene and it ends
[00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:31.120]   once they've already left.
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:32.480]   So there's just space.
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:35.520]   The actual come in, they'll talk to leave it slow.
[00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:39.600]   There's space transcendentalist films are also known as being part of the slow film
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:40.160]   movement.
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:43.920]   But the whole point of this is to leave you as the viewer time to make your own
[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:48.480]   cuts, to understand the, try to structure what you're seeing, what's going on here.
[00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:52.240]   Why might he say that they're giving you the space to actually do a lot of work
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:53.920]   yourself in your mind, which is all to say.
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:55.680]   Yes.
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:59.200]   Watching movies can be incredible training for your ability to think.
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:01.120]   Not always true.
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:03.920]   I watched Pacific rim with my boys the other day.
[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:08.800]   I love Guillermo del Toro and it's a beautifully shot movie, but your mind
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:09.600]   doesn't have to work as much.
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:15.360]   I would say, or if your mind does work, you quickly become sort of angry and
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:19.120]   confused about the plot because look, and I don't want to complain Jesse about
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:24.160]   the plot of a movie, but the whole plot here is that there's an interdimensional
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:27.680]   portal opening in a sub oceanic rift, which happens.
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:30.720]   Giant monsters are coming through at the Kaiju, which happens.
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:36.800]   I do not understand why the only response we could think of is what we, we, we
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:43.280]   have to build giant metal robot mechs that are controlled by two operators
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:47.360]   who minds have the meld to fight the, the fight, the codes you coming out of this
[00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:47.680]   or that.
[00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:49.280]   I mean, my boys figured this out right away.
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:53.440]   It's like, couldn't you just have right next to the rift, like nuclear tip
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:57.200]   torpedoes, like, couldn't we just shoot like the big monsters, but couldn't we
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:59.360]   just like shoot missiles at them?
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:05.760]   Like, do we have to build metal robots that are 15 stories high to do hand, like
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:08.960]   the punch, the monsters, it can't possibly be the right answer.
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:15.280]   Can't possibly look, I'm going to fire seven, uh, whatever harpoon missiles
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:18.640]   from my Aegis destroyer that have like tactical nuclear warheads on them.
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:20.400]   They can just, they'll, they'll come in and shoot them.
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:26.160]   And blow up the Godzilla's no, we're going to have a sword.
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:27.360]   I think I saw some of that movie.
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:30.560]   I mean, it's, it's the point of course is not the actual, my point is the point
[00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:33.760]   is not the plot is that he, it's the, the cinematography and the, and the cool
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:36.320]   graphics and, and, you know, Del Toro having fun.
[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:40.080]   My point is that's a movie where you're, you're not supposed to think it's
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:40.720]   supposed to be just.
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:45.040]   Expert experiential and that's fun, not helping your ability to think, but that's
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:45.280]   fun.
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:48.080]   But if you're not, you're not supposed to think, you're not supposed to think
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:50.080]   not helping your ability to think, but that's fun.
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:54.160]   But if you watch, you know, Paul Schrader film, well, then you're going to have to,
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:55.840]   you have to think that's good.
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:57.440]   So no, it's good movies, good movies.
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:58.480]   I think are like good novels.
[00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:00.400]   Uh, they can help you think.
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:06.320]   Um, some prestige TV shows have this too, you know, that was a complaint.
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:07.600]   I've been watching succession recently.
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:13.280]   I think it gets you thinking, but I'm comparing it to movies have, because I
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:15.200]   guess the directors have the space or I don't know.
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:17.360]   Movies do a better job than prestige.
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:21.360]   The prestige shows, they do get you thinking, but they keep you moving along.
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:27.040]   You know, Hey, what's it's very plot focused and, and reaction to the characters.
[00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:33.600]   And I don't know, but my point being is movies, good TV shows.
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:33.840]   Yes.
[00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:36.560]   This could be a big part, a big part of thinking.
[00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:37.520]   That's my main point.
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:44.000]   My secondary point is robots are not the right answer for battling.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.920]   I mean, you could just have a submarine right at the rift.
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:52.480]   And every time a monster comes out, you tactical nuclear, you know, we don't even have
[00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:52.720]   summary.
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:56.400]   We just like, we just, we just have a bunch of tactical nuclear weapons.
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:57.600]   We just set it up at the rift.
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:59.280]   It's underwater, right?
[00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:00.960]   As soon as a kaiju comes out, we explode it.
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:02.480]   And then someone comes and set up another one.
[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:09.280]   No, there are two solutions are giant mechs with swords, the like fist fight, and then
[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:16.160]   also the build a wall around the Pacific ocean to which, which by the way, was not even as
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:17.600]   tall as the monsters themselves.
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:23.040]   So like the monster just came and just stepped over it, basically fire a missile.
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:26.000]   It doesn't make sense.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.400]   I mean, they just surround that part of the ocean with, with planes and ships that just
[00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:32.000]   fire fire missiles.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.280]   I just don't, I don't know.
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:35.840]   I don't know.
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:36.160]   Okay.
[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:39.120]   Well, anyways, that's that let's do another question here.
[00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:39.840]   All right.
[00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:42.800]   Next question is from a meat, a 21 year old from Toronto.
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:45.760]   What's the difference between deep work and reading?
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:51.040]   If I've maxed out the four hours of deep week work I have in a given day, what are the activities
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:52.240]   left for my brain?
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:54.960]   Can I only do shallow activities thereafter?
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:34:00.160]   I mean, well, this is where Arnold Bennett, who I quoted earlier, this is where Arnold
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:06.000]   Bennett makes this very clear argument that I don't believe that your brain can't do
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:06.880]   interesting thinking.
[00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:14.880]   Arnold Bennett says your brain is either sleeping or can do high-end high quality thinking.
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:15.760]   That's his claim.
[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:18.240]   Now I think that claim might be a little bit strong.
[00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:23.280]   I think there's obviously cases in which it's very difficult to do contemplation.
[00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:28.480]   If you're sick, it is very difficult to do any sort of interesting thinking.
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:32.560]   If you're really tired, you know, like you're sleep deprived, it could be very difficult
[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:33.840]   to do really interesting thinking.
[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:40.720]   But I do think there's a, there's a, a kernel of truth in this claim that is worth emphasizing.
[00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:46.240]   And I think he's right about, which is we underestimate what our mind is comfortable
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:46.560]   with.
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:51.520]   We, we make this division where we think, I don't know, watching the Paul Schrader film
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:55.360]   or reading an interesting novel or just going for a walk and thinking about things that
[00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:57.120]   this is demanding activities.
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:59.680]   This is like athletic training.
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:03.440]   And because of that, you know, I have to be in the right mood to do that.
[00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:06.880]   And I think what Bennett is saying is that through exposure, that can be more of just
[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:08.080]   a default mode.
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:10.160]   That that's just what your brain is happy doing.
[00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:12.080]   That it is bored.
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:16.960]   If you give it the movie about Kaiju and it's like, okay, I'm happy with this novel.
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:21.120]   I'm happy with this book that you can, in other words, raise the baseline of just standard
[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:23.520]   thinking from very low to being much higher.
[00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:28.080]   And so when you're, when you're tired, when you're sick, the really high end stuff is
[00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:28.720]   very high end.
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:33.520]   And the default stuff you can still do would be to someone else seeming really concentrating
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:35.200]   or really demanding, but to you, it's not.
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:36.480]   So you can raise your baseline.
[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:40.080]   And probably we could make a physical analogy here that if you get a really good cardio
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:43.360]   vascular shape, you might say, you know, I'm tired.
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:48.320]   So I can't go run a five minute mile today, but I can jog a, an eight minute mile, right?
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:50.320]   Because you've raised your cardiovascular base.
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:54.320]   Whereas, you know, for me running an eight minute mile would be very, very difficult.
[00:35:54.320 --> 00:36:01.920]   So I think Bennett is onto a good general point there, which is as you re embrace thinking,
[00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:07.600]   as you practice thinking, as you push yourself on what types of thinking you are able to
[00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:11.600]   tackle and the amount of time you spend thinking, it becomes more second nature.
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:16.480]   And we begin to see less of this distinction between, oh, I have to either be shut down
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:19.280]   or in a rarefied moment where I can concentrate.
[00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:24.080]   And it says, no, no thinking about hard things or interesting things is just what I do as
[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:25.280]   a human being with a brain.
[00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:29.280]   That's the place that you can get through, through enough exposure.
[00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:33.360]   All right, who do we have next?
[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:37.840]   Next question is from John, a 43 year old physician from Potomac.
[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:43.280]   What knowledge management systems and technology stacks do you use to keep track of advancements
[00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:44.800]   in your field and other interests?
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:47.360]   For example, building a second brain.
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:50.560]   Yeah, I want to talk about the role.
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:58.560]   I like this question because I'm interested in the notion of a second brain and what role
[00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:00.000]   that actually plays in thinking.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:06.240]   So second brain, I mean, I think that is Forte, what's his name, Tig Forte?
[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:07.280]   I'm sure if I have that right.
[00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:08.640]   I can look it up.
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:09.840]   Yeah, definitely last name Forte.
[00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:14.000]   I apologize if I'm mixing up first names in my mind.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.160]   I think it's Tig Forte.
[00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:23.040]   Popularize the notion of the second brain as a piece of vocabulary that refers to, in
[00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:30.320]   general, having a external fully featured digital system to help track and organize
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:34.800]   information so you can get it out of your brain and you can store it and organize it.
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:40.880]   And typically part of the idea of a second brain is that it can surface new insights
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:43.280]   or essentially do some cogitation for you.
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:45.280]   So it's not just that you're storing lots of things.
[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:46.800]   Oh, Tiago Forte.
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:47.760]   Sorry about that.
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:49.360]   Tiago, T-I-A-G-O.
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:50.560]   I don't know what Tig is.
[00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:53.360]   I'm thinking of the comedian.
[00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:54.900]   Tig.
[00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:57.040]   God, I can't remember.
[00:37:57.040 --> 00:37:59.520]   I can get one part of everybody's name.
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:04.320]   There's a comedian, Tig something.
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:09.120]   And then there's Tiago Forte is the second brain.
[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:10.800]   Now I have to look that up.
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:12.000]   Look up comedian.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:12.720]   Okay.
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:13.600]   Then T-I-G.
[00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:17.200]   See if I, this is going to torture me.
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:19.760]   Notaro.
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:20.880]   Tig Notaro.
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:21.840]   That's what I've seen.
[00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:22.720]   I'm getting old.
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:24.240]   Maybe I do need a second brain.
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:24.800]   Okay.
[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:25.840]   So not Tig Notaro.
[00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:30.400]   Tig Notaro has very few things to say on digital information management.
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:31.280]   Tiago Forte does.
[00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:35.200]   So I think he popularized the term second brain, but it captures something that a lot of people
[00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:36.560]   have been interested in a long time.
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:40.160]   So we have systems to not only capture and organize information, but actually do some
[00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:42.480]   sort of outsource cogitation.
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:46.320]   So surface new insights or connections.
[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:52.800]   So no, I don't use a digital second brain in that way.
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:57.680]   And the reason, what I wanted to bring up here is a lot of serious thinkers.
[00:38:57.680 --> 00:39:04.880]   I know what they focus on instead is taking better advantage of their primary brain.
[00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:06.640]   Right.
[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:13.280]   So, so what, what they focus on is let me take the time when I'm encountering something
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:17.040]   that's potentially useful, a new idea or a concept or information.
[00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:23.600]   Let me take the time to work with it in my mind, to think it through, to associate it
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:30.240]   with my sort of existing schemas of understanding to integrate it into these, these, these whatever
[00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:32.640]   systems of understanding I have into my head.
[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:39.040]   There's a, a slower pace to their intake of information, but by doing so they make their
[00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:40.480]   primary brain smarter.
[00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:45.840]   So then when it comes time to think an original thought, they have the, the structures of
[00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:50.800]   thought they're drawing from are more sophisticated and can produce better insights and draw from
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:53.680]   more examples and see more of these connections.
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:58.480]   And I think this, this may be the issue with second brain thinking.
[00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:02.320]   And, and again, I want to be clear when I say issue, there's a lot that's actually very
[00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:04.640]   useful about having good organizational systems.
[00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:09.520]   So there's a lot about this technology I like, but this issue that we need to outsource
[00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:13.040]   cogitation to a digital system.
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:19.280]   I think the, what we're missing here is that, that most people have not yet saturated their
[00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:21.040]   first brain and its capabilities.
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:27.120]   Let's focus on that first before we care about now we need to cybernetically augment that
[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:27.920]   with another system.
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:32.160]   And this is what I see the difference between serious thinkers and others is that they take
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:33.360]   the time to do that.
[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:37.920]   To saturate your primary brain is to actually spend time with information to walk and think
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:42.960]   and, and talk it through and, and the bat it around and the test it out in different types
[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:47.840]   of essays that the, the effort to get your primary brain to be as sophisticated as possible
[00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:49.840]   can be a lifelong effort.
[00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:55.040]   And your primary brain can be the, the primary source of, of, of brilliant insights.
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:58.640]   Almost every great thinker in the history of thinkers with maybe the one exception of the
[00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:02.880]   guy who wrote the Zettelkasten book, who claims to have written a hundred academic papers
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:04.560]   based out of a second brain system.
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:08.560]   Almost every great thinker in the, in the history of world has produced his or her thoughts
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:11.200]   by working on making the primary brain better.
[00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:16.880]   And I'm using this as an example to get at thinking as an activity that we have to cultivate
[00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:17.680]   and work with that.
[00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:21.200]   If we want to make better use of information, we have to take time with it and get comfortable
[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:26.400]   chewing on it and swirling it, proverbially speaking around our, our mind and where does
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:26.800]   it fit?
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:29.440]   And let me try out these ideas here and there.
[00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:33.440]   Now, of course, digital systems though, have a very important role to play in terms of
[00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:37.760]   capturing details, information that we might need to reference.
[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:39.600]   Tego system is very good, good at this.
[00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:42.400]   For example, I think it's one of the really useful aspects of it.
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:46.560]   Making it easy to go in and collect and reference specific citations.
[00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:49.360]   You know, primary brains aren't great at memorizing little details.
[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:54.080]   You know, I know this paper had this important idea that I've integrated into my schema,
[00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:57.680]   but I need to actually find that paper and quote it and having a digital system that
[00:41:57.680 --> 00:41:58.880]   can bring it up really quickly.
[00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:00.000]   That is a huge advantage.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.720]   And that's where I think we get advantages with these sort of supplementary digital systems
[00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:08.880]   is making it easier to organize and retrieve specific details.
[00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:16.240]   It's the appendix that connects to the primary sources of thought that exist within our primary
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:16.560]   brain.
[00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:23.120]   I think that's, that's the setup that works best when it comes to actual human thinking.
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:31.200]   So digital tools are great for supporting the human brain, but I'm a big believer that
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:35.680]   we're so far, most of us are so far from getting the most out of our primary brain that it's
[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:38.080]   not really time to think about outsourcing thinking yet.
[00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:40.320]   We're not there yet.
[00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:41.680]   We haven't reached our capabilities.
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:45.920]   All right, let's see what we got next, Jesse.
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:48.880]   All right, next question is from Nawal.
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:54.320]   What do you think of using technology like Kindle Scribe or Remarkable as a way of
[00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:55.920]   consolidating notebooks?
[00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:59.040]   I'm interested in this.
[00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:02.080]   This, this is, this is interesting to me, right?
[00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:04.000]   As I just mentioned, we're talking about second brains.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:09.280]   I'm a big believer that the primary brain should be the main source of new ideas,
[00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:14.640]   but, but I just mentioned that what is digital systems good for is capturing information,
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:19.840]   having information ready so that you can cite the details you need to support your thinking.
[00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:26.080]   And I'm wondering, I'm actually working with this thought of our services like Remarkable,
[00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:27.680]   the, the Remarkable tablet.
[00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:29.840]   Maybe it would be interesting.
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:36.160]   And what I'm trying to figure out is, is that, is there an actual use case here or am I just
[00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:38.000]   being caught by the marketing?
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   I'm going to load up their website here.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.080]   See, let me load up a browser over here.
[00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:44.880]   I want to try to make this decision now on the air.
[00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:50.400]   I feel this intuitive attraction to the Remarkable tablet.
[00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:54.640]   And I want to figure out if it's just because I love the marketing or if there's actually
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:55.920]   an advantage here.
[00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:57.280]   Let me load up our browser.
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:58.640]   Jesse, Chrome doesn't seem to work on here.
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:01.280]   Let me see if Safari does.
[00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:02.960]   All right, so let's look up Remarkable,
[00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:08.080]   Remarkable tablet.
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:10.980]   All right.
[00:44:10.980 --> 00:44:13.120]   Do they have, okay, here we go.
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:14.400]   So I'm loading up the website here.
[00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:15.440]   Let me make this decision.
[00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:20.160]   For those who haven't seen the Remarkable, it looks like a notebook.
[00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:26.400]   It uses something that looks like the electronic ink technology of Kindle, where it's not a
[00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:32.080]   backlit screen, but it's actually, it's, it's little discs are flipping with different colors.
[00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:34.960]   So you're actually seeing the black and white is physical.
[00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:37.200]   It's not being, it's not being projected with light.
[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:40.480]   The Remarkable is like that, except for instead of a Kindle that you're just reading, you
[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:44.480]   can write on it with a stylus, but it feels like you're writing on paper and it looks
[00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:46.320]   like you're writing on paper, but it's digital.
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:51.040]   So you can, you can save that page and put it into electronic notebooks and sync it up
[00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:55.680]   online and, and have hundreds of thousands of pages that you can all have access to.
[00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:56.800]   And I use various notebooks.
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:45:00.880]   So I'm very curious, could Remarkable actually replace a lot of my notebooks, right?
[00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:04.000]   So I've just loaded it on the screen here and I'm going to see if I'm still sold.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:04.240]   All right.
[00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:10.000]   It says meet Remarkable, the paper tablet, a digital notebook designed for tasks that
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.040]   demand focus.
[00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:13.040]   All right.
[00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:14.560]   There's a video.
[00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:16.960]   If I play this video, Jesse, you think it'll show on the screen?
[00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:17.680]   Let's give it a whirl.
[00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:18.480]   Let's give it a whirl.
[00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:18.800]   All right.
[00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:21.200]   All right, here we go.
[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:25.920]   Someone fashionably coffee, fashionably dressed woman got her coffee.
[00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:29.520]   She's looking at, she puts down her laptop and her phone.
[00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:30.320]   She's disgusted.
[00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:32.960]   I'm narrating this here for people who are just listening.
[00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:34.560]   Now she pulls out a Remarkable tablet.
[00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:38.000]   Ooh, it's like the size of eight by eight and a half by 11 looking notebook.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.080]   The sun's on her.
[00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:41.120]   She's contemplating.
[00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:42.320]   Yeah.
[00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:42.720]   See, okay.
[00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:43.200]   If you're watching.
[00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:49.280]   So she's writing on this notebook page and it looks a lot like writing with a, a pen.
[00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:55.520]   And I think you can save these pages, navigate them.
[00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:55.840]   Let's see.
[00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:56.880]   She's taking notes.
[00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:57.680]   She's typing.
[00:45:57.680 --> 00:45:58.800]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:00.320]   You can hook it up to a keyboard.
[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:00.560]   Yeah.
[00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:01.520]   Then there's a folder menu.
[00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:04.000]   So you can save these things in various folders.
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.400]   So I guess it's internet connection.
[00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:07.200]   So here's what it says.
[00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:11.920]   Paper like handwriting, convert your handwritten notes to type text, view, sync and refine
[00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:15.280]   using our apps, all your notes organized and in one place.
[00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:17.680]   So I don't know.
[00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:21.280]   Here's my, Jesse, tell me if you think I need a Remarkable.
[00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:22.480]   Here would be my use case.
[00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:25.680]   Like what are the various notebooks that are relevant to me?
[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:30.960]   I have my moleskin where I keep track of your thoughts about the deep life.
[00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:32.640]   So that's the one you keep in your pocket though, right?
[00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:32.960]   Yeah.
[00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:35.040]   Typically I have that in my, it's in my bag right now.
[00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:41.600]   And then I have a bigger notebooks I'll use if I'm working out ideas on, you know, I'm
[00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:42.800]   on the road or something like that.
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:49.440]   So if I'm working through an idea for a, an article or a business strategy or, you know,
[00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:51.520]   I'll have like bigger notebooks I'll use for that.
[00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:54.480]   So in theory, I could consolidate both of those.
[00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:55.200]   I'll use notebooks.
[00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:58.960]   I'm working on math problems, you know, where I'm just trying to like work through ideas.
[00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:02.320]   And so in theory, all of that could happen on the same Remarkable tablet.
[00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:08.240]   So I would have access to all of those things on the go and could go back and reference,
[00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:11.760]   Hey, remember we worked on this math problem two years ago.
[00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:15.360]   Let's go back and look at those notes so we can reference them today because maybe it's
[00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:17.040]   relevant for this problem we're working on today.
[00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:22.080]   It could be a book ideas, these types of things, article ideas.
[00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:24.000]   I may be having one in a place.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:25.280]   >> Is the main driver to limit space?
[00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:28.160]   >> To have it all in one place, I guess could be useful.
[00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:31.280]   So I just have this one notebook I always have with me.
[00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:35.440]   So I can add an idea, a book idea or switch over and work on a math problem or switch
[00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:38.480]   over and work on a business strategy and it would all be in one place.
[00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:40.000]   >> I'm sure it's all backed up too.
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.360]   >> I'm assuming it would be.
[00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:41.680]   Yeah.
[00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:47.040]   It wouldn't, you know, wouldn't replace once I'm actually actively working on a project.
[00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:49.360]   So let's say I'm writing a book or a New Yorker article.
[00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:53.920]   The amount of resources I gather for that is way too big for this.
[00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:58.240]   So like I use Scrivener and I'll have hundreds of articles and notes and stuff like that.
[00:47:58.240 --> 00:47:58.800]   But that's fine.
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:01.520]   Scrivener is very good for once a product is active.
[00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:07.200]   If I'm writing an academic paper, that's going to move over to a LaTeX editor like Overleaf
[00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:13.440]   where all the math and like that's all going to start going into a specialized tool once
[00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:14.480]   I really get going.
[00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:16.400]   But that's okay.
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:17.840]   So I don't know.
[00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:18.800]   I'm thinking about it.
[00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:19.760]   >> How much are they?
[00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:24.960]   >> Well, I think the whole point here, Jesse, is that I'm hoping someone from Remarkable
[00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:28.960]   is hearing this podcast and says like, we need this in Califree one, right?
[00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:30.480]   Isn't that our play?
[00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:31.040]   How much are they?
[00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:31.760]   It's a good question.
[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:36.480]   I feel like this is by the way, deductible, right?
[00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:41.120]   Because I'd be buying this as an experiment for our listeners.
[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:44.000]   They're not telling me the price.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:44.160]   Yeah.
[00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:45.120]   How do I get to the price?
[00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:47.280]   Yeah, we could do it.
[00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:48.400]   We could plan the show on it.
[00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:50.160]   All right, buy now.
[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:51.280]   Here we go.
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:55.460]   $280.
[00:48:55.460 --> 00:48:57.760]   No joke.
[00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:58.260]   >> Yeah.
[00:48:58.260 --> 00:48:59.520]   >> No joke.
[00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:02.320]   It's kind of the, but yeah, it's interesting.
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:06.000]   Oh, and there's a subscription.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.160]   $3 a month.
[00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:09.840]   >> $3 a month.
[00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:12.240]   That's a weird price.
[00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:13.360]   >> I kind of agree.
[00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:16.400]   I guess that's for the backing up and the connecting to the apps or whatever.
[00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:20.960]   And then there's this other thing, Kindle Scribe.
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:25.440]   I guess Kindle has a remarkable competitor.
[00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:29.040]   I assume, yeah, it looks like it.
[00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:30.000]   Oh, it's $400.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.880]   Interesting.
[00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:34.800]   That makes the remarkable seem all the way better.
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:35.680]   So Kindle Scribe.
[00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:37.920]   All right, so there's tools.
[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:44.080]   I'm loading this up, but nothing's more interesting on radio than listening to someone surfing the web.
[00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:49.680]   Listening to someone just looking at the price of things.
[00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:50.240]   My goodness.
[00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:53.840]   Kindle Scribe is $400.
[00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:57.760]   I guess it's the same idea.
[00:49:57.760 --> 00:49:59.840]   I've never heard of that.
[00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:00.320]   Okay.
[00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:00.880]   Anyways.
[00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:03.040]   >> It'll help pay for Basil's new yacht.
[00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:07.360]   >> Yeah, or to move the bridge for his existing yacht.
[00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:10.880]   >> Right, it's already driving around.
[00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:13.200]   >> Yeah, he's driving around with it.
[00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:16.480]   So let's get back to the original question.
[00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:19.600]   So Noelle, good question about these things.
[00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:20.000]   I don't know.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:20.800]   I think it's interesting.
[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:22.480]   That's what I say.
[00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:23.520]   And I love the marketing.
[00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:28.800]   All those videos like we just showed of the fashionably dressed woman getting frustrated
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:30.400]   and moving her laptop to the side.
[00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:34.880]   And then the sun comes through the window and shines on her sort of angelically as she pulls
[00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:38.320]   out her remarkable and Charles' business strategy notes.
[00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:39.840]   That stuff gets to me.
[00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:40.480]   So I like that.
[00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:41.680]   So anyways, I'm tempted.
[00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:46.240]   I'm tempted to think about it because then I could run my life off of two things.
[00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:50.960]   I'd have my time block planner for actually planning my day.
[00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:51.920]   Right.
[00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:55.840]   And it's important to me that I have the grid there and that it's have my capture and it's
[00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:56.880]   the metrics and I could see it.
[00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:59.600]   I can flip through the page that I would want to be physical, but I could imagine a world
[00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:03.280]   where my time block planner and something like one of these digital notebooks where
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:08.560]   it could basically have five or six notebooks all accessible in one place backed up online.
[00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:10.320]   That's intriguing to me.
[00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:14.080]   So anyways, I will report back if I end up buying one of these things and trying it.
[00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:18.400]   I will report back honestly about my experience using it.
[00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:20.400]   So we'll see.
[00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:23.200]   I'm a sucker for technology like that sometimes, Jesse.
[00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:26.880]   I'm not typically a sucker for technology, but their branding is getting to me on this.
[00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:31.920]   Well, we've talked about remarkable in the past and we had a lot of fan feedback on it
[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:32.400]   as well.
[00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:33.440]   Yeah, they've been pushing it, right?
[00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:35.360]   Like we have a lot of fans who are fans.
[00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:39.280]   It came up probably nine months ago.
[00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:39.520]   Yeah.
[00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:43.920]   We had a lot of test cases and case studies.
[00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:46.640]   Okay, well, I'll report back.
[00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:47.600]   Let's do one more question.
[00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:52.560]   Next question is from Steven, a 33 year old from Canada.
[00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:58.960]   Maria Popova uses a note taking system that involves highlighting passages, writing the
[00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:02.640]   page number and concept on the blank pages in the front and back of the book.
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:05.360]   Your corner marking system is different.
[00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:07.600]   Why don't you follow Maria's approach?
[00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:11.920]   Maria's approach is a good one, which I have tried before.
[00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:14.000]   The friction is higher.
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:18.560]   So it takes more time because you have to go back and think about what you read and
[00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:23.920]   then summarize and then index in the front of the book all of the different key ideas
[00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:24.400]   or quotes.
[00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:29.760]   And then the idea is you can just turn to the front of your book and look at these annotations
[00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:34.080]   and one or two pages remind yourself of all of the big ideas.
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:37.040]   My corner marking system only does the first half of that.
[00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:41.280]   So I marked a corner of a page that has something relevant, and then I'll mark those relevant
[00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:46.160]   passages or sentences right there on the page with a pencil or a pen, maybe adding a few
[00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:48.400]   extra notes of thoughts or observations there.
[00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:53.840]   With the corner marking method, if you want to replicate or remind yourself of the knowledge
[00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:56.480]   captured in a particular book, you actually have to flip through the whole book.
[00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:59.920]   You're flipping through looking for marked corners, and then you go and look at what
[00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:03.760]   was highlighted on the pages that have the marked corners.
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:05.120]   This takes longer.
[00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:08.880]   This review process takes longer than being able to just look at the front of your book
[00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:11.600]   where all of this has been summarized.
[00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:18.160]   The reason why I go with my method, and again, these are deeply related, is that I think
[00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:21.360]   reducing the friction during the reading process is more important for me.
[00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:26.160]   I can get through more books if I don't have to go back and do that summary step.
[00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:31.200]   And also for what I'm typically doing with these books, the friction that is increased
[00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:33.040]   for reviewing is not a big deal.
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:38.800]   So typically what will happen to me is I'll remember whatever, this Neil Postman book,
[00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:40.240]   I vaguely remember reading it.
[00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:44.800]   It had a couple examples in there that I think are relevant to what I'm writing now.
[00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:46.320]   I just need to find those examples.
[00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:49.920]   So I'll just flip through looking at those corner pages, and I'll pretty soon find a
[00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:52.640]   right marked page and get that example out.
[00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:54.640]   It'll take me a minute or two to actually find it.
[00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:56.560]   And I think that's a perfectly good system.
[00:53:56.560 --> 00:54:02.160]   And it works because of what I talked about before, this idea that to become a better
[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:05.440]   thinker, you need to focus on making your primary brain better.
[00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:09.760]   And one of the ways you do this is take time with information to think about it, to ingest
[00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:15.280]   it, to pull out the relevant parts, to compare them against what you already know or understand
[00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:18.400]   and integrate them into your existing schemas of knowledge.
[00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:22.240]   And when you do that, they're accessible.
[00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:26.720]   And so even years later, you remember this book might have something relevant.
[00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:30.160]   This philosopher I remember got me thinking about X, Y, and Z.
[00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:35.680]   So this could be relevant to and then having the pages marked will hone you in on the specifics
[00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:36.720]   there pretty quickly.
[00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:41.200]   So there's not a lot gained by being able to look just at the front pages versus flipping
[00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:43.360]   through the marked corners.
[00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:48.160]   Now, what Maria does as a job, it makes more sense to actually take the work up front to
[00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:53.520]   summarize the books, because what Maria does with marginalia, which used to be called brain
[00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:56.400]   pickings, is she writes summaries of entire books.
[00:54:57.440 --> 00:55:02.160]   So what she needs is access to all of the important books, points of a book and how
[00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:03.360]   they fit together.
[00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:05.360]   That's what she does with these books.
[00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:10.320]   And so doing that work up front as you read the book makes all the sense in the world
[00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:10.640]   for her.
[00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:14.720]   It means if I want to then write about this book on marginalia, I've done the work of
[00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:17.040]   consolidating all the ideas and how they fit together.
[00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:21.120]   And now I can translate that onto, let's say, my essay.
[00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:24.160]   And that's very different than how, let's say, I would typically use a nonfiction book,
[00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:30.000]   which is, I'm not going to summarize Neil Postman's amusing ourselves to death.
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:32.000]   Here's all the relevant quotes and how they fit together.
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:37.840]   I just want to get at the example he gave about the audiences for the Lincoln Douglas
[00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:43.360]   debates in the 19th century were comfortable with four hour long debates because they lived
[00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:46.560]   in a sort of textual linguistic world, typographic world.
[00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:50.640]   And I'd have a vague memory of that example as what I want, but I need to find the exact
[00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:51.040]   words.
[00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:53.200]   That's when the corner marking method is great.
[00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:54.880]   I'll flip through these corner mark pages.
[00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:56.400]   I'm sure that's one of the examples I marked.
[00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:57.520]   I'll get there in a couple of minutes.
[00:55:57.520 --> 00:56:03.280]   So the method could be dictated by how you hope to actually use the information.
[00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:09.680]   And for me, if I'm reading slowly and carefully and deeply like a thinker and I'm
[00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:14.000]   integrating into my schemas of understanding the ideas and concepts that are important,
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:16.480]   I just need the ability to get back to the specifics when I need it.
[00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:19.840]   I don't want to waste the time up front or spend the time up front.
[00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:23.760]   They're like fully summarize everything in the book and how all of it fits together.
[00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:28.000]   But if you're Maria or your book review or your professor who wants to teach these books,
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:29.600]   that might be exactly what you need to do.
[00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:34.800]   So I think your note taking method can be dictated by what you hope to actually do with
[00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:35.760]   the books themselves.
[00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:38.240]   I like Maria.
[00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:42.800]   Maria is cool because she's a she's an example of sort of old school internet.
[00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:45.280]   Yeah, she's been on Ferris a few times.
[00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:47.120]   Yeah, I get her email every Sunday.
[00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:48.320]   She's been doing that for a long time.
[00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:54.720]   She comes out of the original Web 2.0 era of, you know, I'm going to create a website
[00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:55.920]   tied to me.
[00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:58.160]   I'm going to produce content on this website.
[00:56:58.160 --> 00:57:01.280]   And it's interesting and ask for money for it.
[00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:04.560]   And I have nothing to do with social media and have nothing to do with these other large
[00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:04.960]   platforms.
[00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:05.600]   I own a server.
[00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:06.240]   I own a website.
[00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:08.320]   It was the original vision of Web 2.0.
[00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:10.160]   So I love people who exemplify that.
[00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:12.320]   It's not my tech talk.
[00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:13.760]   Videos have a lot of engagement.
[00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:15.920]   I'm trying to monetize my Instagram post.
[00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:16.720]   It's no.
[00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:17.760]   Here's my website.
[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:18.480]   Here's what I do.
[00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:19.680]   I do it.
[00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:23.680]   Well, I'm supported for doing this directly by my my users.
[00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:28.000]   So so all of us sort of Web 2.0 pre social media internet fans.
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:29.760]   We all like Maria because she's a great example.
[00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:31.120]   That was the promise.
[00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:37.200]   And she's one of the few people that has survived all the disruptions of the social age and
[00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:38.880]   are still an exemplar of that older model.
[00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:41.520]   She reads a lot of her books on the treadmill.
[00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:42.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:48.080]   I think she goes to the gym like every morning and I heard she reads like eight hours a day.
[00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:49.120]   Yeah, because their whole job.
[00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:52.000]   Yeah, that's a lot of reading.
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:56.320]   But it goes to our walking to it goes to our earlier conversation, though, right about
[00:57:56.320 --> 00:58:01.920]   someone asked if I did a lot of deep work, maybe I can't read.
[00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:03.600]   I need to just do something shallow or distracting.
[00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:06.480]   Well, here's an example of someone who just through training and experience.
[00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:08.000]   That's all they do is read all day long.
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:13.040]   And Maria is completely comfortable doing that because that's what her mind is used to.
[00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:16.480]   And I would guess I don't know her, but I would guess her mind would have a hard time
[00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:17.360]   with Pacific Rim.
[00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:18.720]   It would be bored.
[00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:23.200]   Like there is no there are no deeper themes here.
[00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:28.880]   I'm not this is not a slow cinema transcendentalist style film where they're using the
[00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:32.480]   compressed aspect ratio to create a sort of spiritual claustrophobia.
[00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:36.720]   They're using slow cuts into which I myself am trying to project my own conceptual cuts
[00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:38.960]   to make sense of this complicated human experience.
[00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:43.120]   Now, robot punch big cause you go boom.
[00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:47.840]   So, again, Arnold Bennett would be proud of Maria Popov.
[00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:48.400]   I would assume.
[00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:50.880]   All right, well, that's enough questions.
[00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:53.600]   I want to move on to talk about some of the books I read in April.
[00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:56.960]   Before I do, let me briefly mention another one of the sponsors that makes the show
[00:58:56.960 --> 00:59:00.400]   possible, and that is our friends at Huel H U E L.
[00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:07.360]   When it comes to fitness and nutrition, I don't want to think about it more than I have
[00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:12.000]   to. So as I talk about many times on the show, my approach to nutrition is automate
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:12.480]   before dinner.
[00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:17.520]   Have some automatic options that get you energy and you know are healthy so you don't
[00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:18.320]   have to worry about them.
[00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:20.160]   They're causing more good than harm.
[00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:21.760]   And then just don't think about it again.
[00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:27.120]   And all of your your pleasure to find in food and experimentation with flavors and time
[00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:28.800]   among friends, you can spend that all on dinner.
[00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:30.960]   And that's what you can think about food.
[00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:34.880]   So just automate breakfast and lunch to be healthy and nutritional.
[00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:40.800]   It really goes a long way towards keeping your nutritional baseline strong, keeping
[00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:41.360]   it large.
[00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:46.880]   And one of the options I throw into my automation of breakfast and lunch is using Huel
[00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:50.640]   Black Edition as a meal replacement.
[00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:51.280]   It's fast.
[00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:56.800]   And I know it has what I need if I'm running a podcast or to a meeting, knowing that I
[00:59:56.800 --> 01:00:01.760]   can make one of their shakes in two minutes and it's going to give me everything I need
[01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:06.640]   to get the lunch, it's going to be nutritionally good, is a classic example of just
[01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:11.200]   automating away the decision fatigue of those meals of the day.
[01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:13.280]   So here's what you need to know about Huel Black Edition.
[01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:16.400]   It's high protein, nutritionally complete meal in a convenient shake.
[01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:17.840]   It's powder.
[01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:22.160]   You put it in the shaker, you add some water, put some ice, you shake it up very, very
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:22.640]   easy.
[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:26.960]   With just two scoops, you'll get everything your body needs, including 27 essential
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:30.160]   vitamins and minerals and 40 grams of protein.
[01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:34.480]   It's vegan, gluten free, lactose free, no artificial sweeteners, naturally flavored,
[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:39.040]   low GI, omega three and omega six is in there, GMO free, palm oil free, contains vegan
[01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:43.440]   vitamins, D2 and D3, and is available in nine flavors.
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:44.800]   It is also affordable.
[01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:52.160]   It works out to about $2.50 for each 400 calorie meal you replace with the shake.
[01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:56.000]   So it's cheap and fast and convenient and you don't have to worry.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.040]   This will give me energy, give me some vitamins I need.
[01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:01.600]   Next, let's move on.
[01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:06.640]   Let's move on and we can save all of our decision energy surrounding food for thinking
[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:08.000]   about dinner.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:14.400]   I mean, tonight at the ballpark, Jesse, I imagine the food I eat will be the opposite
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:15.920]   of a nutritionally complete.
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:21.920]   He'll, uh, black edition shake pretty much impossible to eat.
[01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:25.920]   I don't know that the chicken tenders at national parks contain vegan vitamins, D2
[01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:26.480]   and D3.
[01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:30.640]   I guess I do a lot of, uh, a lot of fuel.
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:30.800]   Yeah.
[01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:36.080]   A lot of rowing with fuel, a lot of fuel, a lot of fuel and rowing to make up for tonight.
[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:41.040]   Um, so here's the thing you can get this@huel.com/questions do that slash question.
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:46.160]   So Huel H U E L.com, but don't forget the slash questions because that will give you
[01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:50.560]   a free t-shirt and shake shaker with your first order.
[01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:55.040]   So that's Huel.com/questions automate one of the meals out of your day.
[01:01:56.320 --> 01:02:00.480]   Easy way to get your nutritional baseline higher and Huel is a great way to do it.
[01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:04.000]   Speaking of nutrition and fitness, we just talked nutrition.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.280]   Let's now talk fitness.
[01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:06.720]   What about those muscles?
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:10.560]   Well, let's get my body tutor involved.
[01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:14.000]   I've known Adam Gilbert, my body tutors founders for many years.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.640]   He used to be the fitness columnist for my study hacks blog back in the day.
[01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:24.240]   Adam's program, my body tutor, his company rather is a 100% online coaching program that
[01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:29.360]   solves the biggest problem in health and fitness, which is the lack of consistency.
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:32.640]   As Adam says in fitness, knowledge isn't the problem.
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:37.920]   Everyone I talked to already knows what to do or they struggle as turning information into action.
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:42.080]   My body tutor fixes that with daily accountability and expert support.
[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:44.320]   The way it works is you get paired with a coach.
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:49.280]   This coach designs for you a custom workout plan to make sense for your goals,
[01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:54.000]   for your life, for the equipment you have access to.
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.080]   They also put together an eating plan.
[01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:57.920]   What should you eat or not eat?
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:00.880]   What's our strategies here customized to you?
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:04.640]   And then you check in with this coach online every day.
[01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:08.960]   That is the accountability consistency that Adam is talking about.
[01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:09.760]   That's how you get it.
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:14.640]   You know the coach is going to see what you eat and how you exercise.
[01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:15.840]   And they're going to give you encouragement.
[01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:16.640]   They're going to help you.
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:17.600]   Hey, this isn't working.
[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:18.640]   Let's adjust it.
[01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:22.240]   Just knowing that you'll be talking to this coach gives you the motivation.
[01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:26.160]   You might have otherwise just talked yourself into not doing the workout.
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:28.240]   You might as well talk yourself into saying,
[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:31.600]   let me get that second order of chicken fingers at Nats Park.
[01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:35.040]   So it's a brilliant idea because we know one-on-one coaching, of course,
[01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:38.160]   is incredibly valuable for getting in shape and improving your fitness,
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:39.920]   but it typically would be expensive.
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:45.280]   By making this relationship online, my body tutor makes it much more affordable.
[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:46.960]   Here's the good news.
[01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:49.360]   If you mention deep questions when you sign up,
[01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:52.720]   Adam will give you $50 off your first month.
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:55.280]   Just mention that podcast deep questions when you sign up.
[01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:58.080]   So head over to mybodytutor.com.
[01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:03.040]   That's t-u-t-o-r mybodytutor.com and mention deep questions when you sign up.
[01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:04.080]   You get $50 off.
[01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:07.760]   It is a very smart way to get in the better shape.
[01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:10.160]   Better shape, Jesse.
[01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:12.160]   I bought some heavier dumbbells recently.
[01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:12.720]   What'd you get?
[01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:16.000]   Got some 50s and some 40s and 50s.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.680]   So did you get them unique or do you get the things where you can slot them in?
[01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:20.240]   Got them unique.
[01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:26.080]   We get them from a gym supply store not far from here.
[01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:26.640]   Nice.
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:27.840]   But I think I need 60s too.
[01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:32.080]   Dumbbells are great because you don't need spotters and you can do weird stuff.
[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:37.120]   But moving up the weights, gotta get serious.
[01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:41.040]   All right, let's do a final segment here.
[01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:42.560]   I want to talk about the books I read in April.
[01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:43.840]   All right, Jesse, here's the bad news.
[01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:44.720]   I lost my list.
[01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:47.280]   I don't know what happened to it.
[01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:51.120]   You were talking about this before the show and I think you should explain
[01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:54.000]   how you finished the book so early.
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.760]   Yeah, so you might be thinking, "Well, wait a second.
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:58.160]   Can't you just remember all the books you read in April?
[01:04:58.160 --> 01:04:59.120]   That was just last month."
[01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:00.320]   But here's the thing.
[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:05.120]   I count books by the month I finished them and I'm on a weird rotation.
[01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:07.440]   I'm sort of out of sync.
[01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:09.760]   So I tend to finish the books for a month.
[01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:12.880]   I start them before the month begins and tend to finish them
[01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:15.920]   about halfway through the month.
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:19.280]   So I'm already, for example, a book and a half into my June books, even though it's
[01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:20.800]   May, whatever.
[01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:25.840]   So when I'm trying to remember my April books, a lot of these are books I started reading or
[01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:28.320]   maybe started reading, what, back in March.
[01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:32.160]   So this is just the weirdness of how I've sort of shifted off schedule.
[01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:37.840]   So I just walked around my library today and looked at books and, okay, that one I
[01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:39.120]   remember, that one I remember.
[01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:43.840]   So I was able, Jesse, to reconstruct four out of the five books I read in April.
[01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:44.960]   I can't remember the fifth.
[01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:47.040]   You had a remarkable notebook.
[01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:51.200]   Right now I would just be hitting the buttons, right?
[01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:53.120]   The sun would come in through the window.
[01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:58.080]   I'd be fashionably dressed with a macchiato and I would see the books.
[01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:02.400]   And then they're always, always in these videos, they always have like a business chart
[01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:04.240]   that they're labeling.
[01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:08.720]   In fact, here, switch over to the screen for a second.
[01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:10.080]   Here's the Kindle Scribe ad.
[01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:12.160]   Look at what's in the picture.
[01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:12.720]   Am I right?
[01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:16.320]   It's a chart that they're labeling.
[01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:18.000]   That's what always happens in these ads.
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.920]   They're always like, what?
[01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:22.720]   And they put like an exclamation point and they're drawing on a chart.
[01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:25.040]   That's what business people do is they label charts.
[01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:28.080]   But anyway, yes, my remarkable scribe would be able to find this.
[01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:28.240]   All right.
[01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:30.240]   But I did remember, I did remember four of them.
[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:34.400]   See, it helped because I went on a vacation during that period.
[01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:37.280]   So it was easy for me to remember what books I brought on the vacation.
[01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:38.320]   So that, that helped me here.
[01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:39.600]   All right.
[01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:44.160]   So I read the book, The Real Work by Adam Gopnik.
[01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:48.880]   Gopnik is a longtime staff writer for the New Yorker.
[01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:52.640]   He's known for art criticism.
[01:06:52.640 --> 01:07:00.480]   So this was his first, the book takes a tentative step towards the pragmatic nonfiction world.
[01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:03.280]   So this book is about what really goes into mastery.
[01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:05.520]   Gopnik's a great writer.
[01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:07.120]   You'll see that as you read the book.
[01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:14.400]   And basically this, he builds reflections about mastery around different, I guess you
[01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:19.040]   could think of them as masters he spends time with or different activities he pursues.
[01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:24.880]   I was reading this actually in Las Vegas and I went to see David Copperfield.
[01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:29.440]   And so I appreciated that there's a whole section in this book where he's working with
[01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:31.440]   professional magicians.
[01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:34.960]   And this is where the real work that term comes from is the world of professional magicians.
[01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:36.880]   So anyways, it's a, it's a, he's a great writer.
[01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:38.960]   This is not a Gladwell book.
[01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:44.240]   So it's not going to let's break down mastery until like, you know, the contrarian understanding
[01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:45.680]   that you can then apply to your life.
[01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:50.400]   It's more reflective and philosophical than that, but is very well-written.
[01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:51.040]   I enjoyed it.
[01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:54.240]   Also read John McPhee's Levels of the Game.
[01:07:54.240 --> 01:08:00.480]   It's his book about tennis, Arthur Ashe versus Grabener.
[01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:03.200]   Brilliant example.
[01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:08.160]   It's sort of studied in nonfiction courses, just a brilliant example of what McPhee is
[01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:13.360]   known for, which is using sophisticated structure to try to generate insight.
[01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:17.680]   And so the structure of Levels of the Game, this book is from the sixties.
[01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:21.280]   This has been replicated a lot now, but I think McPhee was at the cornerstone of this
[01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:26.800]   is it's built around a single us open tennis match between Arthur Ashe and David Grabener.
[01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:33.120]   And it'll, it moves seamlessly without even section breaks between they'll be playing
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:38.000]   this point and then it's a backstory and then back to the point.
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:42.560]   And so it goes back and forth between these two tennis players, backstories and the game
[01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:47.760]   that's going on in a sort of complicated structure where they won't even, he won't even break,
[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:49.520]   you know, it'll be a return.
[01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:57.040]   And then next paragraph is Arthur Ashe, you know, 15 years earlier, and he goes back and
[01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:58.080]   forth, back and forth.
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:04.560]   And the idea is, as you learn more and more about the backstory of these players, the
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:08.640]   nuances of their play, which are also learning more and more about, as you hear about the
[01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:13.360]   match become more clear that he's drawing this connection between their style of play
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:16.720]   and all these different things that went into their history and who they are as a person
[01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:18.320]   and what's going on in the culture around them.
[01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:21.280]   It was just a masterwork in narrative nonfiction.
[01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:25.360]   And one of the things that caught my attention, because I read that and I read Gottlieb's
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:30.240]   book at the same time, two New Yorker writers, obviously different generations is that McPhee,
[01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:35.520]   I don't know who's doing this right now, but I'm inspired by this.
[01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:40.960]   McPhee uses simple language, complicated structure to get the truth.
[01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:46.240]   And I, you know, I would say that's probably not a lot of people are doing that now.
[01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:49.840]   I would say the tone of the New Yorker right now, including my writing for better, for
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:58.720]   worse, also relies on lyricism to try to get at truth, more evocative sentences that have
[01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:03.840]   some sort of, you know, poetry in the writing that the writing and the rhythms, there's
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:07.600]   a lot of rhythm of writing work, I think is going on a lot now at the New Yorker that,
[01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:13.760]   that it's a almost lyrical nonfiction prose that can, can extract insights and understanding.
[01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:14.720]   And Gopnik's great at that.
[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:16.960]   He's a very philosophical, self-reflective writer.
[01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:20.000]   McPhee was so different and his sentences are simple.
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:24.080]   They, they, they, they, they, they, they, they, they, they, they, they, they, they,
[01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:30.720]   they, they read like, they read like they come out of one of those, you know, mid-century
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:35.280]   grammar guides, you know, Strunk and whatever.
[01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:38.400]   Or they might read like you speak, like people speak probably.
[01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:38.560]   Right.
[01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:43.760]   Well, what I meant by like the grammar guides and I'm, I'm, I'm forgetting like the classic
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:47.360]   Strunk and Strunk and white is a Strunk and right.
[01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:47.760]   Yeah.
[01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:50.560]   So in the sense of like, sometimes it's very formal grammar.
[01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:53.680]   It's like, oh, this is just perfectly constructed grammar is what I mean by it.
[01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:54.480]   Yeah.
[01:10:54.480 --> 01:11:00.160]   It's like this comma, this semicolon, this, but it's, it's, it's using grammar like you
[01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:03.600]   would see in Strunk and white, like, oh, this is a well-constructed sentence.
[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:07.440]   Not like in maybe in like something I might write or modern New Yorker piece.
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:12.400]   You, you use grammar to help support something that's more poetic or lyrical or whatever.
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:14.320]   The sentences are just boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:16.080]   Subordinate clause, boom.
[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:18.480]   Just very straightforward.
[01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:22.160]   And yet when combined with complicated structure is incredibly deep.
[01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:24.400]   So I don't know, not a lot of people are doing that now.
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:28.000]   Maybe a lot of, not a lot of people are doing that back then either, but I just as a writing
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:36.080]   masterclass exercise, reading sixties era McPhee, it just got me thinking a lot about how I write
[01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:38.800]   about how he wrote about his, his effect.
[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:42.080]   Made me think about my own writing a little bit.
[01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:44.400]   So that was cool.
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:47.440]   That's how you, from my book group, I'm in a book group that just reads sports books.
[01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:47.840]   Yeah.
[01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:48.160]   Yeah.
[01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:51.200]   So that was, that was my, that was my turn to pick.
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:53.200]   And so of course I was going to pick like.
[01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:55.040]   Was there a lot of tennis strategy in there?
[01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:55.540]   Yeah.
[01:11:55.540 --> 01:11:57.360]   You should read it.
[01:11:57.360 --> 01:11:58.560]   I'll loan you, I'll loan you my copy.
[01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:00.240]   I should.
[01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:00.480]   Yeah.
[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:02.400]   Because you, you play a lot of tennis these days.
[01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:03.840]   I play at least three times a week.
[01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:04.080]   Yeah.
[01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:05.600]   It's a complicated game.
[01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:06.320]   It's like golf.
[01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:07.200]   Oh my God.
[01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:08.080]   The sense I got.
[01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:08.320]   Yeah.
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:08.880]   It's like golf.
[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:12.000]   That's the sense I got is you got to be playing since you were five.
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.160]   Not necessarily, but you need to play a lot.
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:15.600]   It takes a lot of maintenance.
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:18.560]   Like if you want to be any good, like you got to put a lot of time into it.
[01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:21.600]   So one of the things, maybe you would understand this is because you're playing tennis now,
[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:22.800]   I didn't understand as much.
[01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:27.680]   So one of the big parts of Ash's game is that when he was being trained coming up as a kid,
[01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:32.080]   they wanted him, they almost exclusively was trained his backhand.
[01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:36.240]   They wanted the backhand to feel as comfortable to him as a forehand.
[01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:36.480]   Right.
[01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:38.400]   So it was just like, I'm very, very comfortable with it.
[01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:38.560]   Yeah.
[01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:41.360]   Cause a lot of times people just expose your backhand if it's weak.
[01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:41.440]   Yeah.
[01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:42.960]   So he's very comfortable with his backhand.
[01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:47.040]   And then he was a very innovative, creative player, right?
[01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:53.520]   So he was very much a risky, risky, exciting shots, cross court, drop shots, the winners,
[01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:54.080]   that type of thing.
[01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:57.600]   Whereas Grabener was much more of a mechanical play the odds.
[01:12:57.600 --> 01:12:58.720]   There's a lot of statistics in it.
[01:12:58.720 --> 01:12:59.840]   It was very interesting.
[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:02.240]   Actually in air, there was a cool little commercial with Ash.
[01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:03.280]   Remember that in the beginning of the movie?
[01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:03.520]   Yep.
[01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:04.240]   With the racket.
[01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:04.400]   Yep.
[01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:05.040]   The wooden racket.
[01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:05.200]   Yep.
[01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:08.240]   They get into that because Grabener used to moved on to metal racket.
[01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:10.560]   So I think you would, I think you would like it.
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:14.160]   The thing, the tennis players, my book group were saying they were surprised by how fast
[01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:16.240]   Ash was serving.
[01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:19.920]   It really is not that far from today's era of monster serves.
[01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:25.600]   And he's, it was within, I mean, he was serving like one 30 or something like that.
[01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:25.840]   Wow.
[01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:28.720]   Or one 25 or like he was close with a wooden racket.
[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:34.480]   So, yeah, it's like now it's supposed to be the age of the monster serve,
[01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:37.680]   but you read this match, like they would want to get,
[01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:41.440]   if you could get four aces in a row, you're like, that's kind of what I'm looking for.
[01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:44.480]   Is like in a lot of these sets, it's going to be all aces for the surf side.
[01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:47.200]   It's all about making use of the, the, the few mistakes that happen.
[01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:49.200]   It's interesting.
[01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:49.520]   All right.
[01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:52.560]   Other book I read the transcendent brain by Alan Lightman.
[01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:58.000]   I like Alan Lightman a lot, former physicist at MIT that went on to start their science,
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:59.360]   writing master degree program.
[01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:04.320]   I like him in part, as I've mentioned on the show, because their family has a cabin on this
[01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:06.880]   island up in Maine, and they go up there and spend the entire summer.
[01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:09.040]   I think it has electricity.
[01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:11.440]   Maybe there's no phone, there's no internet.
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:14.000]   And I always just, you know, I sort of knew I didn't know him.
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:18.320]   Well, my, my wife had crossed paths with him a few times when we lived in Boston and he was at MIT.
[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:21.280]   I was at MIT and we had friends in common.
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:22.240]   I always loved that about him.
[01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:27.040]   But anyways, he now just writes these short provocative books for Pantheon.
[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:29.200]   And which is cool, which I appreciate.
[01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:33.600]   And this one was trying to give a materialist explanation for spirituality.
[01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:38.800]   I'm trying to say you can appreciate and even organize your life around spiritual experiences
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:42.720]   while still maintaining a scientific materialist view.
[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:48.640]   So he sort of gives a Darwinian explanation for why maybe we feel these senses of connection
[01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:52.880]   or moments of transcendent on trying to try to explain that materialistically.
[01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:58.160]   Typical Alan Lightman book, it's short and it dives into these interesting angles,
[01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:00.800]   different history of religion and brain science over here.
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:02.720]   And it doesn't write more than it needs to write.
[01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:04.560]   So I always enjoy a good Alan Lightman book.
[01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:11.440]   The final book I remember reading in April is called Finding the Mother Tree by Suzanne
[01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:18.960]   Samard, who is a, I don't know what the field is, forestry maybe, who studied,
[01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:23.520]   she did a lot of the innovative work that discovered trees are connected to each other
[01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:27.120]   underground through networks of fungus.
[01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:30.960]   They can not only communicate with each other with these underlying fungus networks,
[01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:34.080]   they can actually move resources on it.
[01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:36.800]   Sugars, for example, from one tree to another.
[01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:40.720]   And you even have in forest, you'll find what she called the mother tree,
[01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:44.080]   these sort of this very old tree that was connected to a lot of younger trees and
[01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:47.440]   helps to redistribute resources to them, et cetera.
[01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:49.040]   You know, she did a lot of work on that.
[01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:51.040]   And so this book is about that.
[01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:53.840]   There's been a couple of books in the last 10 years about trees and communicating.
[01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:56.560]   This one is interesting because it's memoir.
[01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:59.280]   It's memoir slash science.
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:01.760]   So it's, she's actually a very good memoir writer.
[01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:03.680]   She had a very interesting upbringing in Canada.
[01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:08.560]   She comes from a one generation removed from a Canadian lumbering factor,
[01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:12.800]   a family and worked actually in the timber industry before she moved over to academia.
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:15.760]   It's actually a pretty astutely drawn self-portrait.
[01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:18.960]   That's intertwined with her scientific discovery.
[01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:25.200]   So you learn about her discoveries as they occur in her life, as she tells the story of her life.
[01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:29.120]   And it was, I thought it was a surprisingly well, a well-written book.
[01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:31.040]   And the science is interesting too.
[01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:35.520]   Now it's, there's a bit of a grain of salt that has to be taken with it.
[01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:41.040]   I mean, the, there's a, I don't know, a sort of like philosophical or,
[01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:47.360]   you know, political resonance to this idea that clearly has to be involved in the popularity
[01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:48.560]   and the push of these ideas.
[01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:50.240]   It's like, no trees don't compete.
[01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:52.080]   They share resources together.
[01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:54.320]   It's, they, they help each other and cooperate.
[01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:55.280]   They mother each other.
[01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:59.120]   I mean, there's very much like embedded in these scientific studies,
[01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:03.680]   also reflections of critiques of, you know, aspects of capitalist culture.
[01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:06.720]   And so it's a complicated field, but she found some really cool things,
[01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:10.160]   but the book was really well-written and she has a really, had a really interesting life.
[01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:13.360]   So I grabbed it randomly.
[01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:16.960]   This was a politics and pros table, you know, boom, let me just grab it.
[01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:17.520]   It's not new book.
[01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:21.600]   Sometimes when you're traveling, you have to just serendipitously grab something.
[01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:24.080]   And I'm glad I grabbed that one.
[01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:24.480]   All right.
[01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:25.680]   So those four books, there was a fifth.
[01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:28.720]   I just can't remember what it is.
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:29.520]   I should just make one up.
[01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:32.160]   Just see what would be the most impressive thing I could have read.
[01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:38.160]   I guess I was reading gravity's rainbow or a war in peace.
[01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:40.960]   Let's just make up what it is.
[01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:42.160]   I don't know.
[01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:44.640]   There was a fifth in there, but those are the four.
[01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:46.960]   Those are the four I can remember.
[01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:48.640]   All right.
[01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:51.760]   Well, I think that's a good enough, good enough for a show.
[01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:53.920]   We can all go off now and do some thinking on our own.
[01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:56.720]   And thank you everyone who listened or watched.
[01:17:56.720 --> 01:18:01.280]   I'll be back next week with a new episode of the podcast.
[01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:08.320]   And until then, as always, stay deep.
