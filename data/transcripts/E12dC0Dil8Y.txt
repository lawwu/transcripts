[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.880]   how does overload actually operate?
[00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.720]   So I want to take a closer look at that.
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.780]   And we'll do some questions about overload.
[00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.160]   And then we'll switch gears at the end
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.580]   to talk about something interesting.
[00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.460]   Alright, so let's talk about overload.
[00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.440]   When you get a work commitment that you agree to,
[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.100]   it's broken into or we can break it
[00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.020]   into two different parts, execution and overhead.
[00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.960]   So execution is actually executing the work
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.240]   required by that commitment.
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.440]   So if we take an article that you're writing,
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.360]   as an example, the execution is actually writing the article.
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.400]   You're at the word processor,
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.440]   you're putting the words there.
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.360]   The overhead is everything that goes around it.
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.920]   The back and forth communication
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.680]   to set up the interview with someone.
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.920]   I'm trying to arrange a time with my editor
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.320]   to go over these changes.
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.160]   The fact checker and I need to get on the same page.
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.700]   So it's the collaboration and coordination
[00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.040]   that surrounds the actual execution of the work.
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.200]   Now, when most people think about being overloaded,
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.200]   they think about execution.
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.640]   The total amount of things I actually have to do
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.280]   has piled it up to a point where I don't even think
[00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.040]   I have enough time to get it done.
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.560]   This is the classic understanding of overload.
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.920]   This is what students suffer from.
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.520]   When they realize tomorrow, I have to get this paper done
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.240]   and I have this test and I have to finish this problem set.
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.200]   And if they look at the actual work they have to execute,
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.280]   the writing, the studying and the solving of the problems,
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.560]   the amount of time required to do that
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.360]   is more than they really have hours
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.180]   between now and when these things are due.
[00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.040]   So execution, if you have too much total execution to do
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.240]   for the time you have available
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.080]   can create a sense of overload.
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.260]   In most knowledge work settings, however,
[00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.820]   we don't get anywhere near
[00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.800]   the execution demands being too large.
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.120]   The source of overload for a lot of knowledge workers
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.500]   actually comes from the overhead component.
[00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.240]   The coordination and collaboration activities
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.640]   that surround the work we do can fragment up,
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.640]   can muck up, can make hard to pass your schedule
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.800]   much quicker than the actual execution can.
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.920]   And the reason why this is,
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.800]   is partially the nature of the work,
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.860]   not the time required by it.
[00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.960]   Overhead often requires coordination
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.800]   or collaborations with other people.
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.380]   This requires back and forth interaction.
[00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.080]   I have to send you an email,
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.280]   hey, what do you know about this?
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.720]   And you send back, I don't really know.
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.080]   And you say, well, maybe we should talk about it.
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.680]   You say, sure, when are you free?
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.960]   And you say, well, how about Monday?
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.240]   And you say, well, Monday's not good,
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.480]   but maybe Tuesday or Thursday.
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.400]   Like, well, let me give you some time
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.760]   for Tuesday and Thursday.
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.400]   There is a lot of back and forth that happens.
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.720]   And as we talked about commonly on the show,
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.880]   back and forth generates context switching.
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.560]   I have to keep switching my attention
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.360]   back to this conversation
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.920]   every time I need to service
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.720]   or move this conversation forward.
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.760]   Coordinate overhead also creates just other landmines
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.600]   on your schedule, such as meetings.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.640]   Now we should probably just get together and discuss this.
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.960]   We should probably hop on a call
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.720]   and just see what's going on about this.
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.320]   And now you have this part of your schedule
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.500]   where in the lead up to it,
[00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.360]   you have to wind down what you're doing,
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.080]   switch over and talk to someone.
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.360]   And then you have a period after a while
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.500]   to kind of switch your gears after that.
[00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.860]   So you start peppering your schedule
[00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.240]   with these meetings that overhead creates.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.820]   That also makes it difficult,
[00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.640]   makes the environment difficult to pass for execution.
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.360]   So you can fill up a schedule,
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.800]   making it so that very little execution can get done.
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.960]   You can fill up a schedule with overhead much quicker
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.960]   than you can fill up a schedule with execution.
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.000]   Most of the things we actually do in knowledge sector jobs,
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.120]   if you add up the minutes or hours required
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.320]   to execute the core work,
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.560]   doesn't really take up much of your schedule.
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.360]   That's not the bottleneck.
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.220]   The bottleneck is we take the overhead
[00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.600]   for each of these tasks
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.020]   and we pepper it throughout the day.
[00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.200]   And then we pepper this overhead with that overhead
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.400]   with this overhead.
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.300]   It doesn't take much before you're never far
[00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.800]   from more emails to answer,
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.160]   more slacks to get back to,
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.520]   and more meetings to jump from one after another.
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.080]   So I think the state of overhead saturation
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.400]   is the primary cause of overload.
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.180]   And it's what happened to me.
[00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.200]   There was different small work commitments
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.200]   that entered my sphere of responsibility
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.040]   throughout the spring.
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.200]   And I said, look, I have these big things I'm working on.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.480]   I gotta get this book manuscript in,
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:30.880]   I'm working on my courses.
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.840]   Let's deal with this in May once all that's done.
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.560]   And any one of these things in isolation is not that big.
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:37.400]   Any one of these things,
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.080]   if you add up the time required in executing the task,
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.700]   it adds up to a handful of hours.
[00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.520]   None of them are outrageous in isolation.
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.920]   Most of them are important,
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.800]   but they all got pushed to this period
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.160]   for after the big things were done.
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.560]   And even though the amount of execution work
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.320]   I put onto my schedule was incredibly manageable,
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.160]   the overhead was not.
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.080]   And that is why I found myself the other day
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.840]   spending two hours straight trying to triage
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.880]   and service these requests and conversations,
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.640]   and then went away for an hour and came back,
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.260]   and 16 more messages had shown up in my inbox.
[00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:11.980]   It's why I was finding days where it was meeting,
[00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.800]   meeting, meeting, meeting with 30 minutes here,
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:14.640]   20 minutes there,
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.160]   not enough time to get anything done.
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.000]   It's why I was saying,
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.520]   why do I feel so busy when I'm not working on anything?
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.880]   I'm not writing any chapters.
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.560]   I'm not getting any drafts of articles done.
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.440]   It's overhead saturation.
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.820]   The overhead will kill you way before
[00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.540]   the execution gets close.
[00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.920]   So anyways, I was thinking about this
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:37.400]   when I came across an article in the Wall Street Journal,
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.000]   which I think emphasizes that my experience
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.760]   with overhead saturation is not unique,
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.800]   that this is actually a widespread problem
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.240]   in the knowledge sector.
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.640]   So I'm gonna load this article up on the screen here.
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.040]   It's from May 9th in the Wall Street Journal.
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.160]   You can watch this if you wanna watch and see the article
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.720]   as I have it up here on the screen.
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.800]   This is episode 248.
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.880]   So if you go to youtube.com/CalNewportMedia
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:04.920]   or the deeplife.com,
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.480]   just look for the video for episode 248.
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:08.300]   If you're just listening,
[00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.080]   I'll annotate what I'm showing on the screen right now.
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.120]   All right, so here's this article.
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.500]   It's by Ray A. Smith from May 9th.
[00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:16.840]   The title is,
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.400]   "Workers Now Spend Two Full Days a Week
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.020]   on Emails and in Meetings."
[00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.880]   Pretty self-explanatory, so I won't dwell on this,
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.440]   but let me just give you the specifics here.
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.280]   This data comes from Microsoft.
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.920]   Microsoft is analyzing the activity of workers
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.520]   who are using their business applications,
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.200]   Outlook, Word, PowerPoint, et cetera.
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.840]   Because more and more of this software
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.960]   is hosted in the cloud now,
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.480]   Microsoft can actually watch
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.160]   how thousands and thousands of knowledge workers,
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.000]   what they're actually doing
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.160]   with their time on their computers.
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.000]   And they can actually put some pretty wide,
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.700]   draw from a pretty wide variety of data points
[00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:56.720]   to figure out how are people spending their time.
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.720]   So they focused in on what they call
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.800]   the most active users of their apps.
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.640]   What this means is people who are primarily using
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:07.560]   Microsoft apps for their business software needs.
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.400]   These are the users you wanna focus on for this study.
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.580]   Because if the users are using other software,
[00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:15.900]   then that's not gonna get picked up in the data.
[00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:17.760]   But if I'm a Microsoft shop,
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.640]   Microsoft now can really tell how do I spend my time.
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:21.560]   So if we look on the people
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.140]   that actually use mainly Microsoft software,
[00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:26.880]   what they found as hinted by the headline
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.540]   is that these users spent an average
[00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:33.640]   of 8.8 hours a week reading and writing emails
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:37.580]   and 7.5 hours logged into meetings.
[00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:39.280]   So that's gonna be digital meetings
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:42.320]   because that's what Microsoft would know about.
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:45.200]   That's two full days out of five.
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.040]   2/5 of all of your time during the work week
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:52.360]   is spent reading emails and being in meetings.
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:55.280]   Now, if you could guarantee that you would consolidate
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.940]   those into two actual days,
[00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:58.400]   I'll do that on Monday and Tuesday.
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.680]   And to be completely uninterrupted
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:00.640]   for Wednesday through Friday,
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:01.800]   maybe I would take that deal.
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:04.040]   But of course, that is not how that time is distributed
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.320]   throughout your landscape of work.
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.640]   That 8.8 hours of reading email
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:11.800]   is spread throughout the 40 hours of your week
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.000]   in such a way that you always have to come back
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:14.980]   and there's you're never far
[00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:17.000]   from having more emails to read.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.880]   Same thing with that 7.5 hours of meetings.
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.000]   It's two hours of meetings
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.040]   spread out over four meetings today,
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.360]   five hours of meetings this day,
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.960]   it gets sprinkled and peppered throughout your schedule.
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.960]   So you can get to that point of overhead saturation.
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:34.380]   We have one other data point here I wanna point to.
[00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:35.560]   All right, so it's saying these figures
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:37.280]   don't include instant messaging,
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.360]   time on the phone,
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:40.360]   or impromptu conversations with workers.
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:46.160]   In all, the average employee spent 77%
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.980]   of the time they were using Microsoft software
[00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:51.200]   was spent in meetings, email, and chat.
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.240]   So that's the other data point here
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:56.300]   is during the time where they were using Microsoft software,
[00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.680]   the majority of that time was talking about work.
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.400]   Only 43% of their time they spent using that software
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.260]   was for quote unquote, creating things.
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.880]   There's a bit of analysis here.
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:10.980]   This is subjective description, which I think is apt.
[00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:14.840]   Both workers and bosses complain
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:19.160]   that digital overload is hurting innovation and productivity
[00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.840]   a sentiment echoed in numerous workplace studies.
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:26.840]   In a separate Microsoft survey of 31,000 people worldwide,
[00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:30.160]   nearly two out of three said that they struggled
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:35.000]   to find time and energy to do their actual job.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   So they struggled to find time and energy to do their job.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.360]   Those people were more than three times as likely as others
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:48.320]   to say innovation and strategic thinking were a challenge.
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:52.400]   We have a quote here from the leader of the research team.
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.240]   "People feel quite overwhelmed,
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.140]   a sense of feeling like they have two jobs,
[00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:57.740]   the jobs they were hired to do,
[00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:59.560]   but then they have this other job of communicating,
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:01.440]   coordinating, and collaborating."
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:03.160]   Folks, this is exactly what I've been talking about
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.800]   on the show for years.
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.880]   This is exactly what I just talked about
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:11.660]   at the opening of today's deep dive.
[00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:15.040]   It is the overhead of coordinating and collaborating work
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:17.820]   that is causing all of these problems with overload
[00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:19.640]   and the subsequent symptoms of burnout
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:23.580]   that we are realizing have become epidemic
[00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:26.480]   in modern knowledge work.
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.400]   And it is very important that we recognize it.
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:31.040]   It's overhead, not the work itself.
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.740]   It's the meeting about the report,
[00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:34.680]   not the writing the report
[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:38.080]   that's really causing problems.
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.840]   Now, once we understand this issue,
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:43.500]   I think it clarifies potential solutions.
[00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.220]   One of the big discussions right now, of course,
[00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:48.880]   is around artificial intelligence.
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:51.300]   We've talked about this on the show before.
[00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:53.320]   People are thinking, well, wait a second,
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:57.600]   maybe what we need to help work become more productive
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:00.880]   is artificial intelligence agents,
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.020]   artificial intelligence powered agents
[00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:05.800]   that can help us do our work,
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:07.200]   that can help gather sources
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.080]   or write the rough draft of the article
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.520]   that we need to write
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:12.660]   or gather the information I need
[00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:13.900]   to put together this spreadsheet.
[00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:15.640]   And this is gonna really boost productivity.
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:16.600]   And my point is, let's say,
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.540]   even if that technology can do all of that,
[00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:20.600]   and that's a whole separate if,
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:21.440]   can it really do that?
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.200]   Let's put that aside for now.
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:25.320]   It is not gonna get to the core of the problem
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.120]   that is making people feel overloaded,
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:29.600]   which is the overhead around these tasks.
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.100]   The needing to go back and forth
[00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:34.340]   on these nuanced, subtle, subjective, interpersonal issues
[00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:35.460]   about what about this?
[00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:36.660]   Do you know about this?
[00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:38.260]   When should we meet about this?
[00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:39.600]   Let me get your thoughts on this.
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.480]   Let me make sure everyone feels heard.
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:43.840]   This sense of overload is coming from this overhead,
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.220]   and that's not something we can solve
[00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:47.480]   by just making our software tools more efficient.
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:48.600]   It's not something we can solve
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.840]   by having an artificial intelligence agent
[00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:52.040]   gather data from us.
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:53.000]   It's not something we can solve
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.840]   by making the interface for communication faster,
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.620]   that my email is going to auto-guess
[00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:59.000]   what words I wanna type.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.160]   All of that might help a little bit at the margins,
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.320]   but if we wanna really get rid of overload,
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:06.860]   we have to start caring about,
[00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:10.160]   A, how we collaborate and coordinate work.
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:13.880]   How do we take that activity of collaboration
[00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:15.680]   and coordination that surrounds the work
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:19.160]   and make its footprint much smaller and consolidated?
[00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:20.480]   How do we get rid of the ability
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.920]   of even a relatively small obligation
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:26.500]   to create 30 or 40 back and forth emails in four meetings?
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.600]   I believe that to be critical.
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.940]   And B, we gotta manage workload.
[00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:35.480]   We have to say it's not just how many hours
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:36.820]   is this thing gonna take,
[00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:40.560]   but also what's the overhead gonna be.
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:42.320]   A lot of overhead is unavoidable,
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:44.660]   so the secret is do less things at a time.
[00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:47.640]   I only have two things on my plate at a time.
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.720]   So now the overhead does not destroy my schedule,
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.800]   so I can actually execute pretty efficiently.
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:52.700]   And then those things are done,
[00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:54.120]   and I can do two other things,
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:55.380]   and the overhead is small,
[00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:56.760]   so I can execute that efficiently,
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:57.760]   and I get it done faster.
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:58.600]   And you know what?
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.440]   Those four things got done much faster
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:01.600]   than if you had put all four things
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:04.280]   on my plate at the same time.
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:06.840]   Workload management has to be a critical part
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.440]   of this solution.
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.120]   And that's something that's gonna require systems,
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:12.720]   that's gonna require organizational buy-in.
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:14.380]   So I think this is where our focus should be,
[00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:16.200]   not how do we do our work faster,
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:20.120]   but instead, how do we make coordination and collaboration
[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:21.880]   that surrounds tasks have less
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:23.340]   of a spread out footprint on our schedule?
[00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:26.520]   And B, how can we have smarter workload management systems
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:28.880]   that keep less on your plate at the same time?
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:30.760]   This is not about doing less work.
[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:34.120]   This is not a dichotomy between workers and management
[00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:35.560]   where they both have their own interests.
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:37.140]   And it's in the management's interest
[00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:38.720]   for us to have more on our plate,
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:39.840]   and in our interest to have less.
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:43.240]   No, it's in everyone's interest for us to hold things back
[00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.120]   and only give people one thing to do at a time
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:45.960]   or two things to do at a time,
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:47.280]   'cause it gets done faster.
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.920]   And the total amount of work produced per year
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:50.460]   is gonna be higher,
[00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:51.640]   but it just requires a system,
[00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:53.800]   and that's annoying, and that's hard,
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.040]   and we don't like change.
[00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:57.780]   So I think overload is a real issue.
[00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:00.600]   It's caused by overhead.
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.360]   Overhead is where we have to focus our energy
[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:05.060]   when it comes to trying to find solutions.
[00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:08.160]   So I think that Wall Street Journal article makes clear,
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:09.480]   this is a widespread problem.
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:11.000]   It's time to get more serious about thinking
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.200]   about how to get rid of it.
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:16.560]   - Did you talk about overhead saturation
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.640]   in a world without email, that term?
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:21.120]   - No, no.
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:24.280]   I mean, I definitely talked about overhead being a problem,
[00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.940]   and the back and forth being a problem,
[00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:28.940]   and a world without email gets into the psychology
[00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:30.700]   and neuroscience about why all that context shifting
[00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:33.340]   is really bad, but I didn't use that term.
[00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:35.540]   In my new book, "In Slow Productivity,"
[00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:38.420]   which is coming out next year, I do talk about this.
[00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:40.260]   And actually, the terminology I use in that book
[00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.660]   is the overhead tax.
[00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:46.140]   Every obligation brings with it an overhead tax.
[00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:49.580]   And when the amount of that taxes get to a certain point,
[00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:51.060]   you get the saturation,
[00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:53.200]   I sometimes also call it an overhead spiral,
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:56.420]   where now suddenly you're spending so much time
[00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:57.780]   in the overhead of your work
[00:14:57.780 --> 00:14:59.740]   that you can't actually get the work done,
[00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:01.380]   which means more work piles up,
[00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:04.020]   which means more overhead enters the scene,
[00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:06.260]   and it spirals out of control.
[00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:07.200]   And I think this happened,
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.280]   I talk about this more in the book,
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:10.540]   so I won't get, I can talk about it now,
[00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:11.860]   'cause it'll be a year 'til that book comes out,
[00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:13.820]   but basically, a really short summary
[00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:15.900]   of the argument I made there is,
[00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:19.020]   we tend to keep our workloads right at the precipice
[00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:21.060]   of that spiral out of control.
[00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:23.060]   So we say yes and yes and yes
[00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:25.060]   until we're so worried about things spiraling out of control
[00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:27.680]   that we finally have cover to say no.
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:28.520]   And what happened,
[00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:31.820]   this was exposed by the coronavirus pandemic,
[00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:34.180]   because for a lot of knowledge workers,
[00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:35.740]   when they quickly shifted remote,
[00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:38.060]   it's not like it doubled their workload,
[00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:41.900]   but it added a non-trivial amount of new work unexpectedly.
[00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:44.120]   And since everyone was right on the edge,
[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:46.500]   it pushed a lot of people right over that border,
[00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:48.000]   and that's why we had that phenomenon
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.600]   during that first year, year and a half of the pandemic,
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.280]   where we had knowledge workers at home
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:54.560]   who were doing Zoom meetings eight hours a day,
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.620]   who were emailing until late at night,
[00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:57.620]   and who were feeling like
[00:15:57.620 --> 00:15:59.340]   they couldn't actually get much work done.
[00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:01.580]   It's because we pushed the whole population
[00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:05.100]   over that point where you get fully saturated by overhead.
[00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:06.700]   It's just really not a good place to be.
[00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:08.260]   And managers should really worry about this.
[00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:12.020]   I mean, it's a terrible way to actually deploy your resources
[00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:14.640]   if you have workers who are saturated with overhead.
[00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:16.980]   I think that's important because,
[00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:19.220]   it's nice to have a dynamic
[00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:22.020]   where we can tweet indignantly about bad people,
[00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:23.980]   but the solution here is more complicated,
[00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:25.500]   and the issue is more subtle.
[00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:27.380]   It's not just mustache twirlers saying,
[00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:30.100]   "If I could just get more overhead on Jesse's plate,
[00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:33.880]   my plan to kidnap the queen's daughter and get a ransom
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.060]   is gonna come to fruition."
[00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:37.420]   It's not necessarily a mustache-twisting manager.
[00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:40.900]   It's a haphazard work system.
[00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:43.100]   In the absence of other ways to keep track
[00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:44.900]   of how much work are you doing,
[00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:46.500]   to have ways to hold on to work
[00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:48.060]   that's not just on a person's plate,
[00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:49.100]   but in a centralized way,
[00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:51.280]   in the absence of these smarter systems,
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:53.860]   we're just gonna push ourselves till we get worried.
[00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:56.700]   And so we're gonna push ourselves way past the tipping point
[00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:59.540]   of what's the right trade-off between overhead
[00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:01.180]   and actually getting things done.
[00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:03.180]   So we'll see.
[00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:06.300]   Too bad books take so long to come out.
[00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:08.060]   Like I'm almost done with this book.
[00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:09.540]   Next month, we're gonna be,
[00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:12.700]   it's called Transmittal or Transmission.
[00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:15.100]   It's where you pass on the manuscript officially
[00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:17.420]   from editorial to the production teams.
[00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:20.940]   And this is where, and then it's a year.
[00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:23.000]   - A lot of overhead in publishing a book.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:23.840]   - It really is.
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:26.460]   It really is, guys.
[00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:28.860]   But don't worry, you'll hear plenty about that next year.
[00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:30.180]   We're working on covers now.
[00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:31.020]   That's exciting.
[00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:32.180]   All this stuff has to happen so early.
[00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:35.280]   Like you need a cover and advertising copy
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:37.820]   and marketing strategy really far in advance
[00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:40.260]   because it starts so early.
[00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:43.420]   Like if we're gonna release next February or March,
[00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:47.620]   the meetings, the sale of the books to bookstores
[00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:50.620]   that are gonna come out in that time happens pretty soon.
[00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:52.220]   That'll happen later in the summer,
[00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:53.780]   which means right now,
[00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:55.900]   we have to be getting our ducks in the row
[00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:57.500]   so that the sales team can be,
[00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:01.280]   have everything they need to sell this book late summer
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:02.560]   for bookstores thinking about
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:05.660]   what are we gonna place in early 2024.
[00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:07.960]   So the book kind of has to be done before then.
