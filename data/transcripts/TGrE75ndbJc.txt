[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.640]   - Pastor John, we're back.
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.920]   And it just took us about 40 minutes
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.560]   to get our recording equipment set up.
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.920]   - That's right, I'm so out of practice.
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.320]   I didn't even know how to set up Skype anymore.
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.160]   (laughing)
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.640]   - It's been a long time.
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.440]   No, not a problem, we are back.
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.120]   And that's the important thing
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.320]   that APJ listeners are gonna wanna hear.
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.520]   Things are a little bit different.
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.000]   We're both in our home studios.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.640]   My home studio's a little bit different now.
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.480]   I'm in Phoenix.
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.920]   - Yeah, it's about a thousand miles away, right?
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.760]   - It was an 1800 mile drive.
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.000]   So yeah, we moved here in July and it's smoking hot.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.960]   Glad to be in Phoenix.
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:40.960]   You're in Minneapolis.
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.720]   We're back at it. - It's beautiful here, guy.
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.560]   It's beautiful.
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.840]   You didn't have to go down there.
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.680]   - Well, I'll return that favor in December.
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.360]   - That's right, I know you will.
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.120]   Hey, it's minus 40 outside.
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.560]   - Exactly.
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.400]   You know, both of us are in our home studios.
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.040]   This spring, you have had a really busy 2019,
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.680]   really fruitful.
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.720]   You traveled this spring to Belfast and to Edinburgh.
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.080]   And then you went on a 40 day writing leave this summer.
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.440]   And you and I just returned home from Sing, Nashville.
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.120]   And our first ever APJ Live event
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.400]   where we recorded five episodes
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.920]   in front of like, I think, 2000 listeners or so.
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.440]   It was just a really amazing experience.
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.760]   So it seemed to go really well.
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.320]   You're back now in the studio for a little while.
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.080]   And actually, by the time this new episode releases,
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.960]   you'll be on your way out the door again,
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.520]   this time to minister in Holland and France and Germany.
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.120]   So, I mean, give us a little update on 2019.
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.760]   Tell us about your first Europe trip.
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:41.960]   How did the book turn out?
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.760]   And then give us a little preview of what's to come
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.480]   for your second Europe trip.
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.360]   - When I think about the summer,
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.400]   especially the completion of the Providence book
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.320]   a few days ago,
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.920]   the answer to the question,
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.600]   how's the summer going?
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.080]   Feels like it should be answered from Isaiah 46.
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.240]   Listen to me, O house of Jacob,
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.480]   all the remnant of the house of Israel
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.040]   who have been born by me from before your birth,
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.200]   carried from the womb,
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.840]   even to your old age, I am he.
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.840]   And to gray hairs, I will carry you.
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.080]   I have made and I will bear, I will carry and will save.
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.480]   In other words, Tony, I feel about this summer
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.520]   that I'm being carried.
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.840]   That's my main sense.
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.000]   And here's a small parable
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.320]   that the folks might find encouraging for their lives.
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.160]   It certainly is for mine, a little parable
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.080]   of God's carrying Providence
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.000]   during the writing of the book on Providence.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.960]   So I began the 40 day writing leave
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.600]   about half or two thirds of the way through
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.600]   what I hoped would be a biblical summary
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.600]   of the goal and nature and extent of God's Providence.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.880]   Those are the three aspects that I came at it.
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.880]   And that meant I thought I might write maybe this summer
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.160]   50,000 words in addition to the 100, 110
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.440]   that I wrote last summer in these 40 days.
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.560]   And there was no detailed outline.
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.600]   It just kind of emerged as I wrote.
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.080]   You think you want to write a chapter
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.600]   on how God's Providence works to transform his people
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.000]   and you end up writing six chapters
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.880]   on how God works to transform his people.
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.280]   In other words, the whole project is unpredictable
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.280]   and you have no idea if it will fit within the 40 days
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.080]   you've set aside to try to finish it.
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.480]   So you just, you write as fast as you can
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.360]   and as carefully as you can in the minutes that you have.
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.880]   It's like, when I thought of this, it's like watching,
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.880]   I remember actually watching this live,
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.960]   the 1989 finish of the Tour de France
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.480]   where Greg LeMond was 50 seconds
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.480]   behind the Frenchman Laurent Fignon.
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.400]   And there was only one leg to go.
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.880]   And it was a 20 mile, which is almost nothing in this race,
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.640]   you know, it's 2000 miles long, 20 mile time trial.
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.040]   Nobody can make up 50 seconds over a world-class rider
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.520]   in a time trial.
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.440]   And LeMond says to his teammates and all his technicians,
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.160]   "I don't want any radio connection in my head at all.
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.880]   I don't want you to tell me how close I am to him
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:51.840]   or anything.
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.840]   I am going to ride as fast as I can ride.
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.760]   So there's no point in having an earbud in my ear
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.960]   since I'm given flat out."
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.560]   And he beat Fignon by eight seconds.
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.560]   So he won a 2000 mile race by eight seconds in 1989.
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:19.000]   Now that's what these 40 days felt like to me.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.960]   I'm not going to wear a microphone in my head,
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.040]   meaning I'm not going to constantly compute
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.720]   how many days are left, how many days are left
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.160]   and can I finish?
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.320]   I'm just going to go flat out six days a week,
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.480]   nine, 10 hours a day and let Providence,
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.840]   finish Providence or not.
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.960]   And I came to the last day
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.800]   and I only had the conclusion to write,
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.800]   which I thought in itself was an absolute miracle.
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.560]   I came down to Noel for supper time and I said,
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:51.760]   "Can you believe this?
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.320]   Can you believe this?
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.320]   This is the last writing day.
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.280]   And I have just a little bit of my conclusion to write
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.320]   and it's now 7 p.m."
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.880]   So I eat supper with Noel and I say,
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.520]   "I'm just going to go up and finish it.
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.200]   I don't want it hanging over till tomorrow.
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.240]   I've got other things to do."
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.840]   And when I went to bed at 12.45 a.m.,
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.720]   it hit me that I finished this book,
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:22.720]   not just on the last day of the writing leave,
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:28.120]   but in the last minutes of the last day of the writing leave,
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:33.640]   which Tony felt to me like the kiss of Providence.
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.160]   That's what it felt like.
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.760]   So vastly more important than such little parable.
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.520]   I call that a parable for me, 'cause that's all it is.
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.240]   It's just God giving me this little,
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.920]   "I'm okay, you're okay, I'm in charge of this.
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.720]   Don't worry, just work, be faithful
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.400]   and I'll manage the details of your life."
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.880]   But vastly more important than the parable of Providence
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.200]   is the biblical truth of what the Bible teaches
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.680]   about Providence, which I define
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:09.340]   as the purposeful sovereignty of God.
[00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:12.880]   I don't equate sovereignty and Providence
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:16.740]   because sovereignty doesn't carry in itself
[00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.320]   the meaning of purpose.
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.600]   You could be sovereign and be whimsical.
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.740]   But if you say Providence,
[00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:30.740]   you mean that there is now purposefulness in the sovereignty
[00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:35.740]   and the best summary of it is just what?
[00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:38.540]   Four or five verses after,
[00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:41.140]   and this is a sweet Providence as well,
[00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:44.380]   four or five verses after those verses
[00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:46.860]   on being carried to your old age,
[00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:49.260]   where it says in verse nine,
[00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.960]   and the others ended, I think, at verse four,
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.780]   "I am God and there is no other.
[00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:57.860]   I am God and there's none like me,
[00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:59.660]   declaring the end from the beginning.
[00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:01.300]   From ancient times, things not yet done,
[00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:05.500]   saying my counsel shall stand
[00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:09.580]   and I will accomplish all my purpose."
[00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:12.260]   So that's purposeful sovereignty.
[00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.700]   So God will carry his people to glory.
[00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:18.900]   He cannot fail and therefore they cannot fail.
[00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:22.720]   All his purposes stand and his purposes include
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:27.100]   the smallest birds that fall from the trees
[00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:30.300]   and every hair of your head being numbered
[00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.860]   and the appearance and movements of the stars
[00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:35.340]   and the rise and fall of nations
[00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:37.700]   and everybody's life and death
[00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:41.540]   and every living being and salvation of God's elect.
[00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:46.540]   That's the totality of God's purposeful sovereignty.
[00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:49.020]   Those whom he foreknew, he predestined.
[00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:50.540]   Those whom he predestined, he called.
[00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:51.980]   Those whom he called, he justified.
[00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:53.980]   Those whom he justified, he glorified.
[00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:57.140]   None of God's people fail to persevere.
[00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:58.540]   He knows his own.
[00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:00.900]   He saves them to the uttermost.
[00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:04.100]   So you can tell maybe that I love,
[00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:06.940]   I love the providence of God.
[00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:11.940]   I love the truth of the purposeful sovereignty of God.
[00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:15.460]   So I'm on my knees at the end of this summer
[00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:19.040]   with thankfulness for the way God has carried me.
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:21.960]   The book won't be out for another year.
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.400]   That's the way things work.
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:25.940]   But here's a connection,
[00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:27.900]   just a word about the international ministry.
[00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:31.060]   You mentioned the past and the future.
[00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:33.980]   So Amsterdam, Paris, and Hamburg
[00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:37.400]   are just around the corner in late September
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:38.940]   and early October.
[00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:42.500]   And that'll be our third international trip this year,
[00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:45.420]   which is more than we've ever done before.
[00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:47.820]   We were in Sao Paulo and Buenos Aires,
[00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:49.700]   then in Belfast and Edinburgh,
[00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:53.180]   two different trips before this summer.
[00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:56.180]   And this emphasis on the nations
[00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:59.140]   that is making these trips,
[00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.980]   which are costly in terms of time.
[00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:05.620]   I could be making a lot of APJs while I'm on the jet.
[00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:09.780]   This emphasis on the nations beyond the US
[00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:13.700]   fits with a heightened consciousness
[00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:16.580]   and a heightened commitment at Desiring God
[00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:19.500]   of what it means to be a web-based ministry
[00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:21.380]   whose reach is to every nation on earth.
[00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:22.660]   And in the last six months,
[00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:25.100]   I asked Scott yesterday if this was accurate,
[00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:26.500]   in the last six months,
[00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:30.280]   about 7.5 million people have tapped
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:33.500]   into our online ministries at Desiring God
[00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:36.680]   from outside the United States.
[00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:41.580]   Now that puts us in touch with movements
[00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:44.180]   that love the infallible scriptures,
[00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:47.620]   love the supremacy of a saving Christ,
[00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:50.020]   love the sovereignty of God in salvation,
[00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:53.780]   love the power of joy to sustain love and suffering.
[00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:56.420]   And we feel ourselves,
[00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:59.060]   this is the way I say it and feel it,
[00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:01.780]   I feel myself and us as a ministry
[00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:06.780]   called increasingly to bless those movements
[00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:10.620]   in ways that they find helpful,
[00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:13.500]   not us going to them and telling them what they need,
[00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:17.380]   but them coming to us, having found help,
[00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:22.060]   and our aim is to serve what God is doing,
[00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:25.380]   where people already find what we love
[00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:27.140]   at Desiring God to be helpful,
[00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:31.460]   and then help them press into other groups around them.
[00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:36.140]   So it's been a very fruitful summer.
[00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:37.420]   To top it off with,
[00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:40.660]   you didn't ask about this, but I'll say it anyway.
[00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:42.620]   To top it off with grace and joy,
[00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:45.900]   I get to perform the wedding of my daughter
[00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:48.220]   - Oh, wonderful. - in just a few weeks.
[00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:49.740]   So by the time this plays,
[00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:53.380]   she will be Mrs. Moore, Lord willing.
[00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:58.020]   I look forward to the sovereign arms of God
[00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:02.140]   carrying me and Noel to Europe and back.
[00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:06.980]   But as James says, and it's a big part of this book,
[00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:11.620]   James 4:15, "You ought to say, John Piper,
[00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:15.940]   "if the Lord wills, we will go to Amsterdam,
[00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:17.420]   "Paris, and Hamburg.
[00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:19.900]   "Otherwise, you're arrogant when you talk,
[00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:22.020]   "because I run the world, you don't.
[00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:24.020]   "So if the Lord wills, we will live
[00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:25.580]   "and go to Europe and back.
[00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:27.260]   "If not, we die."
[00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:31.580]   But in God's providence, I love to say with Henry Martin,
[00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:34.740]   we are immortal till our works are done.
[00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:35.940]   - And if the Lord wills,
[00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:37.740]   we'll have a bunch of APJs recorded
[00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:40.460]   before you head out to Holland, France, and Germany,
[00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:42.100]   so there won't be any more gaps.
[00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:43.780]   We appreciate listeners who have put up
[00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:46.340]   with listening to recycled episodes,
[00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:48.980]   some of our classics this summer,
[00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:51.580]   to make room for Pastor John to do all of this writing,
[00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:53.940]   all of this travel, and we're looking forward
[00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:56.180]   to getting back into the routine here in the fall
[00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:57.700]   and getting you new episodes.
[00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:59.180]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:00.020]   - Thank you.
[00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:02.540]   - And a lot of great questions have come in from you,
[00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:03.900]   the listeners, thank you for those.
[00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:05.660]   Those are lined up on the docket,
[00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:07.740]   and we've gone through a number of them already.
[00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:09.260]   The easiest way to get new episodes
[00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.860]   is to subscribe to the podcast on your phone
[00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:14.980]   or your tablet through your favorite podcast app.
[00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:18.380]   I use Overcast, I know some of you use Downcast.
[00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:20.740]   Apple Podcasts is by far the most popular app
[00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:22.620]   among APJ listeners.
[00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:24.260]   But there you can get the latest episodes
[00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.700]   immediately as we release them.
[00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:29.180]   Download a podcast app that works for you and your device,
[00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:32.660]   and inside that app, search for Ask Pastor John
[00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:34.380]   and click on Subscribe.

[00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:49.840]   and even ask a question of your own.
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:52.760]   Well, Monday we launch into new fall programming
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:55.700]   with a question 40 of you have asked over the years.
[00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:57.740]   I guess it's about time that we answered it.
[00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:58.980]   It's about water baptism.
[00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:01.680]   Specifically, are we saved after baptism,
[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:04.820]   in baptism, or before baptism?
[00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:05.700]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:07.500]   We'll see you on the other side of the weekend.
[00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:09.980]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:10.820]   See you then.
[00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:13.400]   (upbeat music)
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.980]   (upbeat music)
[00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:25.980]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
