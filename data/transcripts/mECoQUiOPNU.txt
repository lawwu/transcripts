[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.300]   [ Applause ]
[00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:12.060]   >> Our next session here at Boglehead's conference is going to be by Anne Garcia.
[00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.940]   She's going to be talking to us a little bit about saving for college.
[00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:22.220]   She spent a dozen years as a financial advisor, but that is not her only professional interest.
[00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.960]   She also has an interest in wine, as an importer and distributor of wine.
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.280]   She holds a CFP designation.
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.480]   She graduated from Berkeley and is the author of How to Pay for College.
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:40.600]   She's a member of Phi Beta Kappa and of NAPFA, which is a leading association
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.080]   of fee-only financial advisors.
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.840]   She hails from Portland, where she lives with her husband and their twins,
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.680]   who just graduated debt-free from college.
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.720]   So this is not only theoretical, but practical knowledge.
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.220]   And spends her evenings and weekends exploring Portland's food scene, running on the Wildwood Trail,
[00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.260]   or coaching, playing, and spectating soccer on the pitch.
[00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.620]   Anne Garcia, thank you for being here.
[00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:13.000]   [ Applause ]
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.800]   >> Jim's taller than I am.
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.680]   Thank you so much, and thanks for having me.
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.340]   Can everyone hear me?
[00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.540]   Yes, okay.
[00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.800]   So as Jim mentioned, I'm a financial advisor, and I'm from Portland, Oregon.
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.920]   It's a great place to live.
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.140]   It's a great place to raise kids.
[00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.960]   But it's not where I'm from, and it's not where my husband is from,
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.400]   and it's not where we went to college.
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.660]   I'm from California, he's from Michigan, and that's where we went to school.
[00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.860]   And frankly, we both think that we went to the world's best colleges.
[00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:49.220]   And only one of us is right, but we can both continue to think that.
[00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.920]   We feel like our colleges were not just great places to get an education,
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.520]   but great places to become adults.
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.480]   You know, we've made friendships that have lasted a lifetime.
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.240]   We learned all sorts of skills and knowledge that have made us successful
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.420]   in our professional careers, and that was really what we wanted for our kids.
[00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:16.080]   So from a very early age, we started indoctrinating them in all things blue and gold.
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.960]   Here's another thing.
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.880]   We hate the Oregon Ducks.
[00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.340]   And so, I hope I'm among friends and I can say that.
[00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.340]   So, you know, we took them to visit our schools, we bought them all the gears.
[00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.960]   We even got our dog in on the action.
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:40.120]   Now, I bring this all up not because it matters where I went to college
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.460]   or that I have a dog or anything like that,
[00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:48.860]   but because it's usually not homo economicus who's thinking about college.
[00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.780]   It's us as parents looking back at a really amazing time in our lives.
[00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:02.020]   It's us as parents doing that most human thing we do, which is wanting the best for our kids.
[00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:10.800]   It's not that rational thought of college is expensive and how do we make it a good investment.
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.900]   So if that's not how you're thinking, you're normal and that's okay.
[00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.980]   But that's not how we're going to go forward.
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.420]   Because as Jim mentioned, my kids just graduated from college.
[00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.740]   From these pictures, you'd think they were 10 years old.
[00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:29.300]   And actually, I did not stop taking pictures of them when they were 10 years old.
[00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.260]   It's just that when they were about 10, I looked up what it would cost
[00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.220]   to send them to either Berkeley or Michigan.
[00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.980]   And that was when we stopped buying all the t-shirts and all the gear.
[00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.680]   Because much as I love my kids and much as I love my college,
[00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:50.640]   $65,000 a year times four times two kids was completely out of the question for my family.
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.380]   And I realized as I started thinking about why I wanted them to go to Berkeley,
[00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.180]   that it was about things like all these brilliant professors
[00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.540]   who were just eccentrically fascinating on odd topics.
[00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.540]   And it was exposure to different people.
[00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.980]   And it was, you know, learning how to clean the lint screen out of the dryer.
[00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.000]   And all of that seemed like it was going to be available at a lot of places.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.340]   And I realized if we stopped thinking about which college we wanted them to go to
[00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:24.960]   and started thinking about why we wanted them to go to college, we opened up all kinds of doors
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.940]   and provided great opportunities for them to get great educations
[00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.540]   at prices that worked for our family.
[00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.700]   And my story has a happy ending.
[00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:40.820]   Both my kids found a great college, and neither of them is a duck.
[00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.300]   So before we get too far into this, because I know there's tons of numbers,
[00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.660]   and you want to hear about the FAFSA and how you do better on it and whatnot,
[00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:54.620]   really important piece of college planning, it's equal parts financial planning and parenting.
[00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:00.160]   So you could have the greatest plan in the world, like when you do your retirement planning,
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.440]   you can plan out the dollars exactly.
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.560]   But when you're making a college plan, it's not for you, it's for them.
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.420]   So you have to do the parenting work.
[00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.400]   You have to be talking with your kid about what your expectations are, what your goals are,
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.300]   what your budget is, why you're doing this in the first place.
[00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.660]   Because if you're not doing that, the greatest plan in the world will go completely sideways
[00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.980]   because they will be hearing about it from their friends and their friends' older siblings
[00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.060]   and from colleges and from all those beautiful brochures.
[00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:39.880]   So here's my agenda, but I want to leave plenty of time for Q&A, so I'm going to take a vote.
[00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:41.820]   Of what we want to spend the most time on.
[00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.880]   Who wants to talk about saving for college?
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.780]   Excellent.
[00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.920]   Who wants to talk about how much college costs?
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:53.040]   Alright. How about scholarships and how to get them?
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.240]   Yes. FAFSA?
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:00.760]   Alright. How about the actual mechanics of paying for college?
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:06.940]   Okay. So, and sorry you don't get to skip the messy parenting stuff.
[00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.260]   So let's blow through the savings part.
[00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.040]   Saving for college is the ultimate moving goal post-school.
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:18.360]   I just had to show that because my husband loved that slide.
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:28.740]   Please use a 529 to save for college, not a 401(k) loan, not life insurance, not annuities.
[00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:36.700]   I will say Secure 2.0 lets you roll over $35,000 unused education dollars in a 529.
[00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:41.540]   So do not choose not to save because your kid might not go to college.
[00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:48.320]   Your 529 is your child's launch fund, regardless of what they ultimately end up doing.
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:54.300]   Okay. So fun fact about saving.
[00:06:54.300 --> 00:07:01.000]   If you increase your monthly 529 contribution by $5 a month every year
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.520]   on your child's birthday, you would have $20,000 more for college than if you didn't.
[00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:09.840]   So that's an easy, easy flex on your savings.
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:15.700]   But let's talk about what college actually costs.
[00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:22.920]   So obviously list prices, $82,000 and up for private schools, $25,000 and up for public.
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:24.580]   Here's the crazy thing.
[00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:32.620]   While the average tuition inflation rate for list prices has been over 6% for the last 25 years,
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:36.520]   the net price that people actually pay has hardly budged
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.440]   since the financial crisis in 2008-2009.
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:44.020]   The average tuition discount is over 50% right now.
[00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:48.460]   Not only that, but there are tons of other pathways through college.
[00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:53.120]   Dual enrollment, getting college credit through AP and IB courses.
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:57.740]   It's not necessarily a four-year, $80,000 a year proposition to go to college anymore.
[00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:02.760]   In fact, college is available at whatever price you're willing to pay.
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:06.180]   My son has a friend who graduated from college for $0.
[00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:09.740]   She did two years of free community college, and then she worked at Starbucks,
[00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:12.240]   and Starbucks has a partnership program with Arizona State.
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:17.200]   Arizona State let her go online for free for two years.
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:23.360]   So she literally paid $0 for a four-year college degree, and her diploma looks exactly the same
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.840]   as everyone else's from Arizona State.
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.960]   In fact, she walked across the stage on graduation with all the rest of them.
[00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:32.660]   So whatever price you're willing to pay,
[00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:35.720]   there is a college out there that will charge you that for it.
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:40.500]   Here are some of the things that drive college cost.
[00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:43.360]   I mean, we talk about, you know, lazy rivers and dorms.
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.760]   We talk about declines in state funding.
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:50.920]   The reason that the list price of college has gone up is that people are willing to pay it.
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:56.040]   Every year, the top colleges, the Ivy Leagues, the Ivy Pluses, the public Ivys,
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:01.540]   turn away 100,000 or more people who are willing to pay full price.
[00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:03.660]   They have no incentive to drop that price.
[00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:07.620]   However, lots and lots of people aren't able to pay that price,
[00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:11.000]   and so they do discount that tuition.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.120]   So that's the thing that drives college costs up.
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.680]   Other things drive it down.
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:18.120]   Selectivity, for example.
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:22.180]   The most selective colleges, part of the reason why they're so selective is
[00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:24.220]   that everyone who's accepted says yes.
[00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:29.900]   Part of the reason everyone who's accepted says yes is they're typically the most generous ones.
[00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:33.980]   So if you have high financial need, don't shy away from the Ivy Leagues.
[00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:38.160]   They're probably going to give you the best price there is.
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:45.260]   My daughter's second cheapest college choice was the most selective school that she got into.
[00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:50.420]   She went to the University of Chicago, which is the most expensive university on earth,
[00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:53.840]   and her only cheaper choice was the University of Oregon
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:55.740]   where she received a full tuition scholarship.
[00:09:55.740 --> 00:10:02.180]   So don't let selectivity scare you away because that tends
[00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:04.640]   to be where you get the best deals.
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:11.020]   U.S. News and World Report rankings, you need to use these the opposite way.
[00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:14.780]   People, there's so much, you know, pearl clutching around ranking colleges,
[00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:20.420]   but college rankings are the best tool for parents who want to save money on college.
[00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:22.500]   You know what the cheapest colleges are?
[00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:28.140]   The college ranked 26, the college ranked 51, the college ranked 101.
[00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:33.280]   Because you know how they get up to be a top 25 or a top 50 or a top 100 school?
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:36.520]   They enroll students with higher GPAs and test scores.
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:37.720]   And how do they do that?
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.900]   Well, they give those students scholarships.
[00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:45.760]   So pay attention to the rankings, but not for the reasons you've been told
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:46.840]   to pay attention to them.
[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:49.600]   The other thing is local cost of living.
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.480]   You know, I'm from the West Coast.
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:56.060]   University of Utah is so much cheaper than UCLA.
[00:10:56.060 --> 00:11:01.820]   Why? Because housing for a year there is $10,000 instead of $18,000.
[00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:07.040]   So all kinds of factors go into the cost of college, and many of them are within your control
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:11.300]   and available for you to research.
[00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:16.580]   One of the really important things to do as a family is just come
[00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:19.220]   up with what your baseline college budget is.
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:26.620]   And this doesn't have to be fixed for your lifetime, but you should understand well
[00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:29.160]   in advance what it's going to cost to educate your kid.
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:34.860]   So look up what your in-state schools cost, look up what scholarships they offer,
[00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:36.860]   look up what pathways they offer.
[00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:38.720]   You know, is this a four-year thing?
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:39.680]   Is it a two-year thing?
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:40.860]   Is it a three-year thing?
[00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:43.760]   Who gets scholarships?
[00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:51.200]   Because the great thing about scholarships is most of them, most public colleges,
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:55.560]   virtually every public college offers merit scholarships to good students.
[00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:58.220]   They want to keep the good students in their state in-state.
[00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:03.140]   So find out what those scholarships are and what your actual cost is, and then monitor
[00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:05.040]   and adjust as time goes on, you know.
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:11.480]   Is my savings budget tracking to a college pathway that I'm okay with?
[00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:15.340]   This is just an example from the University of Arizona.
[00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:18.220]   I chose this one because it lays out well on a slide.
[00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:23.780]   You can see annual cost, $33,000 on campus, $30,000 off campus.
[00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:29.100]   Newsflash to parents, it used to be cheaper to live in the dorms than off campus.
[00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:35.300]   Dorms are now a big profit center for colleges, so do be mindful of that.
[00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:38.960]   These are their scholarships they give.
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:45.060]   You can get a scholarship with a 2.75 high school GPA.
[00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:48.240]   You can get a merit scholarship at the University of Arizona.
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:55.940]   And with a 3.75 GPA, you get a big scholarship at the University of Arizona,
[00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:59.120]   and you'll get those scholarships as an out-of-state student as well.
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:01.600]   So this is normal for public schools.
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:06.680]   You also can get credit for your AP and IB classes.
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:12.440]   So, you know, take those classes, and maybe you can graduate in three years.
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:15.220]   Look at all the other pathways that are out there, too.
[00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:19.040]   Dual enrollment, where you're simultaneously enrolled in community college
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:21.140]   in either high school or your four-year college.
[00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:25.560]   Getting credit for college-level coursework you do in high school.
[00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:29.360]   But the important thing is if these are your pathways, make sure that you're looking
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:31.980]   at four-year colleges that will take those credits
[00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:34.080]   and give you credit for what you've done in high school.
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.740]   Does your state offer free community college?
[00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:40.140]   If that's one of the options, definitely look into it.
[00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:42.160]   What kind of employer support do you have?
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:47.500]   You know, my son's friend who worked for Starbucks got free tuition from Starbucks,
[00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:49.660]   but maybe your employer offers scholarships.
[00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:53.800]   There are loads and loads of companies that offer support either for their employees
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:59.240]   or for the employee's children that can be built into your budget or into your college pathways.
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:07.820]   So, like I said, just looking at this example, with no scholarships, $32,000 a year,
[00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:12.340]   with a reasonable, you know, scholarship that's within reach, that's $24,000 a year.
[00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:14.200]   Is it a four-year or a two-year path?
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:18.140]   Maybe that's your baseline, that's your baseline cost that you're aiming for.
[00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:25.500]   Of course, people talk about, you know, having, you know, you have to have the cost
[00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:27.440]   of college saved before your kid is 18.
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:30.760]   Actually, you don't, and very few people do.
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:35.080]   Most people do a combination of paying from savings, paying from their income,
[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:39.580]   having their student contribute something, maybe grandparents are gifting,
[00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:43.900]   maybe you're eligible for the tax credit, you're willing to take out a student loan.
[00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:48.120]   But start doing your budget projections early so that you have an understanding.
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:53.940]   Am I, you know, are we on track for a college experience, you know, a college pathway
[00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:58.840]   that we're going to be happy with, or do we need to readjust, whether it's adjusting our expectations
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:03.820]   or adjusting our budget, but the sooner that you can start getting your arms
[00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:10.940]   around those numbers, the sooner you can be guiding your child's choices towards colleges
[00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:12.740]   that will work in their budget.
[00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:17.920]   All right, so let's talk about scholarships.
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:22.100]   My two kids went to what, you know, when I tell people where they went to school,
[00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:25.100]   their common reaction is, oh my gosh, that sounds really expensive, because, yeah,
[00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:27.780]   my daughter went to the world's most expensive private university,
[00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:29.840]   and my son went to an out-of-state public school.
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:36.040]   His school was actually cheaper than staying in-state, because the University
[00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:39.480]   of Arizona is more generous with scholarships than University of Oregon,
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:41.200]   and the cost of living is cheaper there.
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:44.700]   His apartment was $200 a month cheaper than any of his friends who went to Oregon,
[00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:49.080]   so $2,400 a year times four years is a lot of money.
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:54.720]   Every college offers scholarships, every student is eligible for scholarships,
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:16:01.860]   but not every college is going to offer scholarships to every student, so you need to think of,
[00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:06.460]   you need to look for the scholarships that, look for colleges
[00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:08.920]   that offer scholarships that you are eligible for.
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:14.540]   The good news is, it's very simple to apply for scholarships, you just apply to the college
[00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:18.060]   and file the FAFSA and the CSS profile if it's required.
[00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:20.860]   That will get you in the running for the vast majority
[00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:25.020]   of scholarships that your college offers.
[00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:29.760]   But most important, if you want to get scholarships, you have to apply to colleges
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:31.900]   that offer scholarships to students like you.
[00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:37.060]   So, there are three big types of scholarships, there's financial aid,
[00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:40.480]   there's institutional merit aid, and then there are outside scholarships.
[00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:50.140]   Need-based aid, financial aid, is scholarships, grants, and loans that, and work study
[00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:54.680]   that fill the gap between your ability to pay as calculated by the FAFSA and the CSS profile
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:59.820]   and the cost of, and the cost of college, the cost of attendance at a specific college.
[00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:03.200]   So, you may or may not be eligible for financial aid at a college,
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.180]   you may be eligible at some and not, and not at others.
[00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:12.140]   Typically, an institutional financial aid package will combine the college's own dollars
[00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:17.120]   and then federal funds like Pell Grants, student loans, and work study.
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:22.280]   But that's an award that's recalculated every year with each year's new FAFSA.
[00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:25.080]   And so, your cost can vary from year to year,
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:28.420]   particularly if you have variable income from year to year.
[00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:33.620]   Really important to remember is that not all colleges meet financial need
[00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:38.140]   and even less meet 100% of need through grants and loans.
[00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:42.060]   The ones that are the most generous tend to be, tend to be the most selective.
[00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:46.160]   All colleges are required to have a tool on their website called a net price calculator,
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:50.500]   and that lets you punch in your financial information and see what students like you get
[00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:56.240]   as, as scholarships in every, in every year.
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:01.120]   Really important, again, financial aid is allocated by the colleges.
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:04.660]   Your eligibility is calculated by the FAFSA, but it's the school itself
[00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:06.560]   that decides what to do with that number.
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:14.000]   The next big category of scholarships is what's called, what's called merit scholarships.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.720]   And we often think of student athletes as being the ones who get the big scholarships,
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:21.100]   but it's really the mathletes that clean up.
[00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:22.020]   And why is that?
[00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:25.320]   Well, because colleges want to move up in the U.S. news rankings.
[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:29.940]   And the way they move up is by admitting and enrolling better, better students.
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:35.260]   But there are loads of merit scholarships for all kinds of different things.
[00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:41.120]   You might be the only student from a certain state that's applying to a small college
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.900]   that wants to say we have students from all 50 states.
[00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:49.600]   You might be the only cellist, and they need one in, in the orchestra.
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:54.500]   My son had a scholarship for playing video games, so that is a real, a real thing.
[00:18:54.500 --> 00:19:00.120]   You, you can choose to share or not share that with your own teenage boys.
[00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:06.120]   But typically, merit scholarships are awarded to students who are in the top 20 to 25%
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:10.100]   of the incoming, of the incoming class, and good news,
[00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:13.300]   they're offered by both public and, and private schools.
[00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:16.780]   You can just Google the college name, like I said, on the slide,
[00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:19.520]   and you will see what scholarships are, are available there.
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:24.440]   The great thing about merit scholarships is they are typically guaranteed for all four years
[00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:26.340]   as long as you meet certain criteria.
[00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:30.300]   And typically, that's a minimum, a minimum GPA and, and course load.
[00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:33.040]   So it's easy to keep your merit scholarship, and your,
[00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:38.060]   your cost of college becomes very predictable with, with merit scholarships.
[00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:47.480]   Now, more than 50% of students receive some form of scholarship on, to, to go to college.
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:54.280]   So, so this is not like, you know, when I went to college, scholarships were for, like, you know,
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:58.360]   basketball players, football players, and, and maybe a handful of academic superstars.
[00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:03.720]   Kids today can get scholarships, every kid can get scholarships if they're just willing
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:06.060]   to look for the schools that, that offer them.
[00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:10.640]   A great resource in looking for scholarships is the website CollegeData,
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.880]   and that's just collegedata.com.
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:16.880]   You can look up any school there, look at its financials tab,
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:19.360]   and it will tell you what financial aid form they use.
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:21.080]   Is it the FAFSA or the CSS profile?
[00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:26.500]   It will tell you what percent of students had need and got scholarships,
[00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:28.660]   what percent of need was met, and what percent of students
[00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:30.560]   without need got a merit scholarship.
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:33.900]   So, super helpful when you're shopping for scholarships.
[00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:40.240]   Net price calculators are a tool to help you see what scholarships you'll get at a college.
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:44.800]   Every college is required to have one, and you punch in your data, and that shows you what students
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:48.480]   like you are getting in, in the current year.
[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:52.100]   The great thing with net price calculators is they can only show gift aid.
[00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:56.460]   So, colleges can include student loans and work-study in their aid packages,
[00:20:56.460 --> 00:21:00.420]   but those cannot be shown on, on net price calculators.
[00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:04.100]   Some of them include merit scholarships, some, some don't.
[00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:08.960]   So, the third big type of scholarships are what's called outside scholarships,
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:13.700]   and that just means that it's a scholarship offered by someone other than the college.
[00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:18.080]   They can be offered by your employer, they can be offered by local civic groups.
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:22.620]   A lot of the activities your kids participate in offer, offer scholarships.
[00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:27.660]   I would say, you know, key points about them, don't overlook them,
[00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:29.300]   but also don't overestimate them.
[00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:35.400]   They tend to be in the four-digit and below numbers, where institutional aid tends to be
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:39.380]   in the five-digits and, five-digit numbers.
[00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:44.920]   The other thing is there are great big websites like FastBetWeb and the College Board
[00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:47.640]   that have tons and tons of outside scholarships you can apply for.
[00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:49.980]   I think you're best off looking closer to home.
[00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:53.640]   Your high school's college and career center will have a whole list of scholarships.
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:58.540]   Many of them are only open to students at your high school or students in your local community.
[00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:01.260]   Our high school had a scholarship for the tennis team.
[00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:04.260]   I mean, there's like 12 people on the tennis team, and they're not all seniors.
[00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:10.240]   So, your odds of that one are a lot better than, say, the duct tape prom dress scholarship
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:13.260]   that, and you don't have to wear a duct tape prom dress to school.
[00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:19.260]   Student outside scholarships do get added into the financial aid formula.
[00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:21.720]   So, for a student who has high financial need,
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:25.980]   it is really not worth applying for small outside scholarships.
[00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:30.120]   On the other hand, there are great ones out there that have tons of benefits.
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:34.260]   My daughter had an outside scholarship that was $5,000 a year plus $1,000
[00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:37.040]   for technology purchases, plus a corporate mentor
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:39.620]   who helped her find an internship that led to a full-time job.
[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:45.360]   So, definitely don't overlook them, but they are not the thing that's going to close the gap
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:49.320]   between a $10,000 a year college budget and an $80,000 a year college.
[00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:57.820]   So, the FAFSA is your ticket to need-based financial aid.
[00:22:57.820 --> 00:23:02.420]   It is the free application for federal student aid, and the data that you put
[00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:05.440]   in there calculates a number called your student aid index.
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:08.540]   It used to be called the expected family contribution, but much has changed
[00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:11.660]   with the FAFSA this year, including the name.
[00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:14.160]   Normally, it comes out on October 1st.
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:18.520]   This year, because of all the changes, it's delayed, and it's coming out sometime in December.
[00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:27.580]   Odds are the favorite dates are the 31st and the 30th and the 32nd of December.
[00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:28.320]   It has to come out.
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:33.760]   It has to be out before January 1st, but it gets filed every year for every student.
[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:40.260]   The thing about the FAFSA, I think there's a common misperception that it's the tooth fairy.
[00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:42.500]   Like, I filed a FAFSA, and I'm eligible for aid.
[00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:45.980]   Therefore, I can apply to any college I want to, and it will cost me, you know,
[00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:48.600]   the $15,000 that my student aid index is.
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:50.460]   That is flat-out wrong.
[00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:55.360]   It is up to colleges to decide what financial aid you get.
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:24:02.260]   So, every college uses the FAFSA, and they use it as a tool to evaluate all students' ability
[00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:04.420]   to pay on a consistent set of metrics.
[00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:07.140]   What they do from there depends on the college.
[00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:11.640]   The only thing that the FAFSA guarantees is access to federal aid dollars.
[00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:17.860]   That is Pell Grants, direct student loan, and work-study, if you're eligible.
[00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:25.720]   So, if you are eligible for financial aid, you need to apply to colleges that give it.
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:30.400]   There's an additional aid form called the CSS profile that's used by about 250 private schools,
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:33.340]   but the vast majority of colleges use the FAFSA.
[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:40.100]   There are four buckets of financial information that go
[00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:42.980]   into the FAFSA's calculation of your student aid index.
[00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:48.100]   Income and assets from the parents, and income and assets from the student.
[00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:52.180]   People talk a lot about assets, and what do I do about my assets?
[00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:55.380]   You know, oh, I should buy this life insurance policy instead
[00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:57.660]   of having a 529 because it won't be an asset.
[00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:03.320]   But really, parent income is the biggest factor in it.
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:06.940]   And you don't want to give up your income for the sake of financial aid.
[00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:08.640]   I can tell you that.
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.400]   How is it calculated?
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:14.220]   Well, it's your total income from your tax return, not just your AGI.
[00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:18.760]   So, any untaxed income on your tax return gets added back.
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:21.540]   If you're making IRA contributions, they get added back.
[00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:26.540]   If you're self-employed and contributing to a SAP or an individual 401(k), that gets added back.
[00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:31.180]   Your payroll contributions to your employer's 401(k) don't get added back anymore.
[00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:31.980]   They used to.
[00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:35.560]   And they do still get added back on the CSS profile.
[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:39.380]   You get subtractions for your family size and your tax liability.
[00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:45.840]   So, one of the FAFSA planning tools that you can do is to pay more taxes
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:49.940]   in years when your income counts on the FAFSA.
[00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:54.700]   Every incremental dollar of income is assessed at 47 cents.
[00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:56.940]   So, that is a big number.
[00:25:56.940 --> 00:26:00.660]   Parent assets are the ones that people pay the most attention to.
[00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:03.320]   And, of course, you do have more flexibility about your assets.
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:08.700]   What counts is all of the assets that the parents own, except for retirement accounts.
[00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:12.700]   So, it's your 529s for all your kids, if they're owned by the parents,
[00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:14.820]   not if they're owned by grandma, grandpa, aunts, and uncles.
[00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:19.960]   Investment properties, second homes, whatnot, and adjusted value of your business.
[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:25.100]   But all of your assets are only assessed at 5.64% of their value.
[00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:30.360]   So, while people freak out about, you know, how do I get rid of this $500 in my bank account?
[00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:31.960]   You know, that does nothing.
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:34.160]   Just waste your time.
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:37.680]   Student income and assets are another piece of it.
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:40.880]   For the vast majority of students, income doesn't come into play at all
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:46.560]   because they can have $9,400 of income before anything counts against them on the FAFSA.
[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:49.880]   But where students do get hung up is on their assets,
[00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:52.080]   especially right now because wages are so high.
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:57.140]   Students' assets are assessed at 20% of their value, so much higher than parent assets.
[00:26:57.140 --> 00:27:01.640]   So, and particularly now, you know, kids are earning a lot of money.
[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:04.860]   They're earning a few thousand dollars in their summer jobs,
[00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:08.360]   and that can add a lot to their ability to pay for college.
[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:13.780]   So, I always recommend that parents, you know, if that money is for school, move it into a 529.
[00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:17.720]   If it's not for school, open a Roth IRA, but, you know,
[00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:21.440]   don't have them sitting on tens of thousands of dollars.
[00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:28.760]   So, just so you can see, the impact of $1,000 depends on what $1,000 it is.
[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:31.780]   If it's income from the parents, it's $470.
[00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:34.240]   If it's assets from the parents, it's only $56.
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:39.880]   Student income, only if they have a lot of it, doesn't matter at all.
[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:42.520]   But if it's a student asset, it's $200.
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:45.080]   So, really, your income is the thing to think
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:47.120]   about when you're thinking about planning for the FAFSA.
[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:52.060]   I always think it's important to have a slide with lots of small numbers on it.
[00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:54.480]   So, here we go.
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:55.520]   You can download this.
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:28:00.060]   This just shows when different things count for the FAFSA.
[00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:02.460]   The FAFSA uses what's called prior-prior year income.
[00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:04.260]   So, when you're filing the FAFSA in the fall,
[00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:08.720]   you're using your previous year's tax return data to file it.
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:11.240]   Your assets are on the day that you file.
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:15.920]   So, as you go through the years, these are the dates to pay attention to.
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:20.580]   So, there's your first income year starts January 1st of sophomore year of high school
[00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:23.240]   and ends December 31st of junior year.
[00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:28.200]   Your assets count on the day that you file it.
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:36.560]   And if you ever want to see how different things impact your ability to pay,
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:38.980]   there's a tool on the Department of Education website,
[00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:41.580]   which is studentaid.gov, called the Student Aid Estimator.
[00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:45.040]   It doesn't work right now because of FAFSA simplification, but it is normally there.
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:48.500]   And you can play around with that and see, okay, if I do this,
[00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:50.340]   what's the impact on my student aid index?
[00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:54.200]   Or if I do that, what's the impact?
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:57.260]   Big changes came this year, a few of them.
[00:28:57.260 --> 00:29:02.760]   First and foremost, one of the biggest changes is your expected family contribution used
[00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:05.280]   to be divided by the number of students in your family.
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:08.480]   The student aid index is not divided anymore.
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:13.100]   So, students coming from big families, that's going to have a big impact
[00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:17.420]   on your eligibility for financial need.
[00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:21.760]   If you have a student in college right now and this impacts you,
[00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:25.080]   reach out to the Financial Aid Office and find out how that's going to be treated.
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:31.600]   The good news is many colleges will continue considering that.
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:35.000]   I know my daughter's school, as soon as this change was announced,
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   they have a supplemental questionnaire that you fill out and they added a question
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.900]   about how many college students are in the family.
[00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:44.780]   So, many colleges will continue offering what's called the sibling discount.
[00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:49.160]   But that's just a question that you need to ask.
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:52.780]   For students whose parents are divorced, it used to be that this parent
[00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:54.460]   that the student lived with filed the FAFSA.
[00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:57.160]   Now it's the parent who provides the most financial support.
[00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:00.740]   It's also now your income from your tax return only.
[00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:03.200]   It used to be W-2 income as well.
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:05.020]   So, that's something that helps a lot of people.
[00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:09.680]   You know, if you're making 401(k) contributions, that'll bring down your income
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:12.540]   because you no longer add those back.
[00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:16.440]   A nice change for parents, for students who have grandparents who are helping pay
[00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:20.860]   for college is that they no longer have to report distributions from 529s
[00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:23.840]   that aren't owned by their parents on the FAFSA.
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:26.640]   And then there have been a number of tweaks to the formula.
[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:30.380]   So, I know that first thing is a big one for a lot of families,
[00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:33.940]   but a lot of the other changes really mean that the majority
[00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:38.700]   of students will be eligible for more financial aid, not less going forward.
[00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:42.520]   Even some students who have siblings in college.
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:47.160]   There are issues because of the simplification.
[00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:51.000]   You know, the delayed FAFSA means delayed student aid estimator,
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.840]   inaccurate net price calculators, and there's going to be a huge scramble
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:59.920]   when colleges get all these FAFSAs in January and have to process them where they're used
[00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:02.780]   to having all fall to do that.
[00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:05.800]   I still think net price calculators are a good tool.
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:09.600]   They'll give you a sense of, you know, how does the college award aid?
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:14.200]   Do they meet need or do they not meet need?
[00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:21.640]   The College Board also has a tool called an EFC estimator on its website, and you can use that,
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:25.980]   you know, you can use that in the interim.
[00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:30.760]   So, CSS Profile, again, is a second financial aid form.
[00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:35.400]   It's used by a small number of colleges relative to the universe of colleges.
[00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:39.880]   It's a superset of FAFSA data, so it includes W2 income.
[00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:46.240]   It includes assets like your home equity, insurance, other things like that, all the 529s.
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:52.000]   And if you're divorced, both parents are required to use it.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.880]   The thing about the CSS Profile compared with the FAFSA is that colleges have a lot
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:57.200]   of flexibility in how they use it.
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:59.720]   Home equity is one good example.
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:03.400]   You know, you may -- colleges might exclude that completely.
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:08.400]   They might take the full value of your home, or they might cap your home equity
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:12.160]   at a multiple of your income.
[00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:14.920]   Any grandparents here?
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:18.600]   All right, so grandparents wanting to help.
[00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:24.440]   Opening a 529 or contributing to the student's 529 is a terrific way to help.
[00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:27.720]   There are a lot of estate planning advantages of opening a 529.
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:31.480]   You know, it removes those assets from your estate to the extent that that's a consideration.
[00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:35.400]   Like, if you live in Oregon where we have a state tax.
[00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:39.560]   If the student is eligible for need-based aid and you intend to contribute large sums
[00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:45.120]   of money, then open your own 529 and fund it.
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:50.120]   If you're not making large ongoing contributions, you know, if it's birthday money
[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:54.840]   or holiday money, then just contribute it to the parent's account.
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:33:02.440]   It's one less thing to think about, and it just makes sure that the parents have access
[00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:08.360]   to that money when the kid comes -- when the time comes for the kid to go to college.
[00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:12.440]   I always think the parent -- so with the 529, you have an owner and a beneficiary,
[00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:14.320]   and then you have a successor owner.
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:21.200]   If you're a grandparent setting up a 529, name one of the parents as the successor owner.
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:26.000]   If you just look at the timeline of life, something that we see all the time is grandparents
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.520]   set up a 529, the parents know about it but don't necessarily know why,
[00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:36.640]   and now the grandparents are either having cognitive issues and they don't remember
[00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:42.680]   where it was, or they've passed away and there's a lengthy process of getting access
[00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:46.320]   to those funds because they haven't named a successor owner.
[00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:55.520]   So you're doing your grandkids a favor by making the parent the successor owner of your 529.
[00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:59.880]   So college -- we spend a lot of time talking about how to save for college.
[00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:04.880]   You actually have to pay for it, too, and there's better and worse ways to do that.
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:09.920]   So college costs typically when you accept -- so colleges send out acceptance letters
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:16.280]   in the spring, May 1st is acceptance day, and that's why May 1st you see all those
[00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:20.720]   Instagram posts of kids and their college acceptances.
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:22.400]   You will pay a deposit at that point.
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:24.800]   It's usually a couple hundred dollars.
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:30.760]   It's nonrefundable, and it is credited against your cost of college.
[00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:36.040]   All of your other direct billed expenses, so tuition, fees, on-campus room and board,
[00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:40.080]   are typically due at the beginning of the academic term.
[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:44.720]   One of the difficulties about paying for that is that financial aid doesn't often get added
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:49.040]   until right before the term starts.
[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:53.120]   Your loans and your outside scholarships get disbursed directly to the college as well,
[00:34:53.120 --> 00:35:01.680]   so it takes a while before you see, you know, before you see what you actually have to pay.
[00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:03.400]   Most colleges do offer payment plans.
[00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:05.960]   Sometimes there's a cost associated with them.
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:14.400]   So just know as you are thinking about that, a $75 fee for a payment plan is cheaper than
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:18.200]   taking out a student loan because you don't have the cash up front, but if you're just
[00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:26.480]   taking money out of your 529, you're probably better off just paying it all up front.
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:30.360]   When you take money out of your 529, there's three places it can go.
[00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:36.880]   It can go to the account owner, it can go to the school, or it can go to the beneficiary.
[00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:41.800]   Important point about 529 distributions and super boring, so if you haven't fallen asleep
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:49.800]   now, hopefully you can bear with me through this one, the 529 issues a form called a 1099-Q,
[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:55.120]   which is just like the 1099 that you get from a brokerage account or an IRA distribution.
[00:35:55.120 --> 00:36:00.280]   If the distribution goes to the student or to the school, that 1099-Q has the student
[00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:01.880]   social security number on it.
[00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:07.760]   Now the college issues a form called a 1098-T, and that is a tuition tax statement.
[00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:12.480]   That will only have the student social security number on it.
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:19.760]   If there is a matching 1098-T and 1099-Q with the same social security number on it,
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:24.560]   the IRS kind of just says, "Okay, this was paying for college."
[00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:29.000]   If there's a different number social on the 1099-Q because the distribution went to the
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.720]   parent, chances are good that over the course of four years, you're going to get a notice
[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:37.680]   from the IRS that you took a non-qualified distribution from your 529.
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:43.040]   So even though it's horrifying to think of sending this money to your kid, that is usually
[00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:50.680]   the best way to do it, unless you like dealing with the IRS.
[00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:55.240]   So why would you do a distribution to your student besides that?
[00:36:55.240 --> 00:37:01.120]   Well, first of all, if your student's receiving need-based financial aid, picture the financial
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:04.560]   aid office in August or September.
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:06.520]   They're allocating all the money for the students.
[00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:08.640]   They're getting all these loan disbursements.
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:10.160]   They're getting outside scholarships.
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:12.440]   They're getting checks from 529s.
[00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:16.760]   It's easy to code some of those in the wrong column.
[00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:20.800]   And it's not at all unusual for a college to think that a distribution from a 529 is
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:25.320]   actually an outside scholarship, and they will then readjust the student's aid package.
[00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:30.920]   And then you have to go back and track down your very busy financial aid office to get
[00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:34.120]   that rectified.
[00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:38.000]   And furthermore, if your student moves off campus, you're going to be probably taking
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.160]   distributions to pay for room and board.
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:47.440]   And so you're going to have to get the money to someone other than the college anyway.
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:51.000]   I think the best practice is set up a bank account in the student's name that's linked
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   to your own.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.600]   It's really easy to do that with an online savings account.
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:59.360]   And then you take the 529 withdrawal to that account, and then transfer over it to your
[00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:03.680]   own, and then pay the bill that way, or transfer it to your student if they're paying rent
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:07.160]   and buying groceries and whatnot.
[00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:10.200]   You don't have to time your distributions to college bills.
[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:16.280]   So you could take out an amount or pay the bill out of pocket and then reimburse yourself,
[00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:19.000]   or do whatever is convenient for you.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:23.520]   Your 1099Q is only going to show the total amount that you took out, not when it came
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:32.360]   out.
[00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:36.000]   So can't talk about college without talking about student loans.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.880]   Reading the news, you would think that student loans are a one-way ticket to the poorhouse.
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:43.640]   But in fact, for many students, that is the difference between going to college and not
[00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:45.280]   going to college.
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:48.360]   There's three groups of people who struggle with student loans.
[00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:54.940]   Those are people who get graduate degrees, particularly in areas that are not as high-paying
[00:38:54.940 --> 00:39:00.120]   as, say, medicine and law.
[00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:04.960]   There are people who attend for-profit schools, like cooking schools, massage therapy, things
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:05.960]   like that.
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:07.040]   And students who don't graduate.
[00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:12.880]   The cohort default rate among people who take out the direct student loan only as an undergraduate
[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:16.660]   and graduate is very, very low.
[00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:22.440]   So that is a good best practice for planning for college, is limit your borrowing to the
[00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:23.680]   direct student loan.
[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:27.800]   I know that people always say, well, limit it to the amount that you're likely to earn
[00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:29.640]   your first year.
[00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:30.640]   Here's the thing.
[00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:36.240]   The majors with the highest attrition rates in college are the highest-paying ones.
[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:43.440]   So a lot of students go in expecting to be engineers and come out as philosophers.
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:51.080]   And that's a lot of, maybe a little bit more debt than the philosopher might have wanted.
[00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:55.560]   Finally, the parenting piece of it.
[00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:57.400]   Save the best for the last.
[00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:02.640]   Age-appropriate college conversations are super valuable to have.
[00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:08.320]   So many parents wait until the kid actually gets acceptance letters from colleges to talk
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:11.280]   about how they can't afford what the child has applied to.
[00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:14.680]   I think there are great conversations to be had at every age.
[00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:17.600]   Young kids, talk about how college enriched your life.
[00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:19.480]   Talk about friends you made in college.
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:23.880]   Talk about aspirations you have for them as a college student.
[00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:26.720]   Hey, I never knew about thunder and lightning.
[00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:28.320]   Listen to this.
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:31.440]   I never knew how this happened until I took a meteorology class in college, and it was
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:32.680]   so interesting.
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:36.720]   Or my friend Kelly and I, we do all this great stuff together.
[00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:38.960]   Well, we met in college.
[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:44.200]   There are also tons and tons of on-campus activities at your local college that are
[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:46.640]   appropriate for every age.
[00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:54.360]   So take them to a sports event, take them to one of their on-campus programs.
[00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:56.400]   Loads and loads that you can do.
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:59.760]   Once they get to middle school, absolutely appropriate to start talking about money.
[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:04.760]   And usually, your kids will have some friends who have older siblings where you can talk
[00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:11.960]   about, hey, look at the difference between Gonzaga and Oregon State where Jack is applying.
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:15.680]   Once they get to college, it's time to talk about your budget and talk about appropriate
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:16.680]   pathways.
[00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:20.000]   I think the best way to do that is by being goal-oriented.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:26.840]   And so goal-oriented means, my goal is that you can get through college without any student
[00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:30.280]   loan debt or with only taking out the direct student loan.
[00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:34.800]   And we've been saving diligently, and we know that you can do that at our state schools.
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:38.880]   There are probably other schools that you can do that as well, and we will absolutely
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:41.520]   support you in finding them.
[00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:47.400]   That's a lot better message than, we can only afford for you to go in-state, so don't bother
[00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:48.960]   looking anywhere else.
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:52.760]   Really important is that you be your student's ally and their partner and their guide, and
[00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:57.640]   that you set the parameters of their search, and that you do it, like I said, before they
[00:41:57.640 --> 00:42:01.640]   start getting acceptance letters.
[00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:04.760]   It costs about $100 to apply to each school.
[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:11.200]   So that's a lot of budget to spend on applying to colleges that no one's ever going to go
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:15.280]   to because you can't afford.
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:21.360]   So I will -- oh, more questions, all right.
[00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:24.800]   So I will try to get through as many of these as I can.
[00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:29.200]   Does a 529 plan make a student ineligible or reduce scholarship?
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:32.320]   So a 529 counts as an asset on the FAFSA.
[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:35.000]   It counts at 5.64% of its value.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:41.840]   So it will -- so every $1,000 in your 529 plan will reduce your eligibility for financial
[00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:44.800]   aid by $56.
[00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:51.720]   So that means that you are $944 ahead by saving in a 529.
[00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:55.880]   So if people tell you don't save for college because you'll get more scholarships if you
[00:42:55.880 --> 00:43:02.140]   don't, that is -- there's just, you know, a tiny grain of truth in that.
[00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:05.200]   Saving for college gives you lots more choices.
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:08.840]   And really what we want for our kids is good choices.
[00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:12.400]   And so by not saving, you are limiting their choices.
[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:14.760]   Let's see.
[00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:22.000]   What is the difference between the Student Aid Index and the EFC?
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:27.280]   So the Student Aid Index is the new name for the EFC starting this year on the FAFSA.
[00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:31.740]   The CSS profile is still calling it the Expected Family Contribution.
[00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:35.380]   But it used to be that the number that the FAFSA calculated was also called the Expected
[00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:36.500]   Family Contribution.
[00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:38.820]   Now it is called the Student Aid Index.
[00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:44.280]   It will still be a number, you know, if your student aid -- if your EFC was, you know,
[00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:49.780]   $22,000, your SAI will be $22,000 or, you know, some other amount based on the slightly
[00:43:49.780 --> 00:43:52.020]   different calculation.
[00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:58.720]   How you interpret that is that number shows are you or are you not eligible for financial
[00:43:58.720 --> 00:43:59.920]   aid.
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:05.660]   So let's say, for example, your Student Aid Index is $35,000 and your in-state school
[00:44:05.660 --> 00:44:07.280]   costs $30,000.
[00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:10.000]   You are not eligible for aid at that school.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.840]   But you're applying to a private school that costs $75,000.
[00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:15.840]   You are eligible for aid at that school.
[00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:18.100]   It does not guarantee that you're going to get that aid.
[00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:21.680]   And that's why it's important to not just do the Student Aid Estimator and not just
[00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:26.560]   file the FAFSA, but do the Net Price Calculator at the college, because that will tell you
[00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:34.820]   is this Student Aid Index likely to get me a scholarship or not.
[00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:40.480]   Is the CSS profile going to follow FAFSA and not including 529s of the siblings?
[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:44.780]   And will CSS follow the FAFSA change in not adding back 401ks?
[00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:52.460]   So so far the CSS profile has not said that they have any intention of stopping considering
[00:44:52.460 --> 00:45:01.980]   siblings or that they're not going to include financial W-2 information.
[00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:04.020]   Here's the thing with the CSS profile.
[00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:09.460]   The whole point of the CSS profile is to collect more financial information about you than
[00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:10.860]   the FAFSA does.
[00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:14.900]   If the CSS profile was going to do everything the same as the FAFSA, it wouldn't exist.
[00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:20.140]   So my guess is they will not stop collecting this information.
[00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:24.900]   Now it's up to schools what they actually do with this information.
[00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:29.580]   And there are ways that the FAFSA changes can still impact profile schools.
[00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:34.860]   For example, a student with two siblings in college may have been eligible for a Pell
[00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:37.540]   Grant under the old FAFSA formula.
[00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:41.900]   And many colleges have additional grant funds that are automatically given to Pell Grant
[00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:42.900]   recipients.
[00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:48.500]   That student, when you stop dividing your student aid index from the FAFSA by number
[00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:54.060]   of siblings in college, is no longer Pell eligible and they may be losing out on grants
[00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:56.140]   that way.
[00:45:56.140 --> 00:46:01.820]   But now for the first time, historically you've always had a higher expected family contribution
[00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:03.980]   on the profile than on the FAFSA.
[00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:05.940]   And for many students that won't be the case.
[00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:11.340]   But again, because the whole purpose of the profile is to collect more financial information
[00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:17.020]   about you, I don't foresee that changing.
[00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:18.020]   Let's see.
[00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:29.500]   I am saving for an out-of-state online university, tuition is $9,000 per year, tax advantage
[00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:33.060]   of pre-tax money for education.
[00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:47.660]   So using pre-tax money for education -- so a 529 is like a Roth IRA, you know, it's after-tax
[00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:51.140]   money going in, tax-free coming out.
[00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:54.400]   And that's usually your biggest tax advantage.
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:58.060]   Now one thing to keep in mind, if you are eligible for the American Opportunity Tax
[00:46:58.060 --> 00:47:04.460]   Credit, which is an education tax credit for dependent students whose parent's adjusted
[00:47:04.460 --> 00:47:11.340]   gross income is $160,000 or less, you do need to pay for a portion of your tuition from
[00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:16.140]   something other than a 529.
[00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:23.060]   So you don't necessarily want to have the entire cost of college in your 529.
[00:47:23.060 --> 00:47:30.580]   But the best way to get tax advantage dollars into education is through a 529.
[00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:36.860]   Or if you have an employer tuition matching program.
[00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:39.100]   Who can contribute to a 529?
[00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:45.540]   How many people can contribute to a single 529?
[00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:47.960]   And how much can each contribute to a 529?
[00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:54.300]   So the great thing about 529s is the contribution limits are immense.
[00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:58.040]   They're set by the state, but they're typically in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[00:47:58.040 --> 00:48:05.060]   So you can keep contributing until you have about $400,000, give or take, in your 529.
[00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:10.840]   Now a contribution to a 529 is treated by the IRS as a gift for tax purposes.
[00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:18.820]   So you are limited to the annual gift tax exclusion amount, which is $17,000.
[00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:25.160]   So two parents can contribute $34,000 without filing any tax documentation.
[00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:31.420]   You can also do what's called super funding your 529, which is where you make five years'
[00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:33.780]   worth of contributions in a single year.
[00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:42.820]   And then you file that as a pro rata contribution over five years.
[00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:46.000]   But anyone can contribute to a student's 529.
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:49.220]   So everyone who wants to give money to the student's college doesn't have to have their
[00:48:49.220 --> 00:48:51.180]   own 529.
[00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:54.060]   Almost every 529 has a tool called a gifting page.
[00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:57.360]   And this is one of the great things about a 529.
[00:48:57.360 --> 00:49:03.920]   If you've ever said, stop giving my kids toys, give them the gifting link to your 529, and
[00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:08.080]   they can contribute directly to your account that way, and it'll be invested according
[00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:11.720]   to your investment choices in the plan.
[00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:16.120]   So when parents own a 529, the grandparents, aunts, uncles, friends, anyone can contribute
[00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:17.960]   to that 529.
[00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:20.060]   Students can put their own money into the 529.
[00:49:20.060 --> 00:49:23.500]   And in many cases, they can take the state tax benefit for doing so.
[00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:28.440]   So for example, in Oregon, we have a refundable tax credit for 529 contributions.
[00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:35.400]   So a student can put $170 into their 529, file an Oregon tax return, and get $170 back
[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:36.400]   from the state.
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:42.920]   So it's a great way to teach kids about how tax incentives work.
[00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:46.920]   So I hope I answered those questions.
[00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:51.960]   Is it possible to get tuition discounts at a selective school if you are wealthy with
[00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:54.520]   a high income?
[00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:56.280]   So this is a great question.
[00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:58.660]   It depends on the selective school.
[00:49:58.660 --> 00:50:01.680]   The Ivy Leagues do not give merit scholarships.
[00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:07.920]   Being eligible for merit scholarships elsewhere is how you get into an Ivy League.
[00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:10.920]   So you are not going to get merit scholarships there.
[00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:15.520]   If that's you, then you want to have your student apply for outside scholarships.
[00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:18.840]   That's going to be their best path to get there.
[00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:26.000]   However, you may think you're wealthy and private schools may not agree with you.
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:29.160]   You may think you're poor and private schools might not agree with you too.
[00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:32.720]   So it's always worth doing the net price calculators.
[00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:37.760]   Many families are eligible for more need-based financial aid than they think.
[00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:44.920]   But the very upper echelon of schools does not give merit scholarships.
[00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:47.080]   It's kind of the next tier down.
[00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:52.360]   But there are fabulous, fabulous schools in that category.
[00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:56.660]   There's been so much research done about the benefits of college.
[00:50:56.660 --> 00:51:03.360]   And unless you want to be a hedge fund manager, it really doesn't matter where you go to college.
[00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:05.740]   It matters how you go to college.
[00:51:05.740 --> 00:51:09.120]   So there was a study done called the Purdue Gallup Poll where they surveyed adults who
[00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:13.040]   are successful in life, trying to tie that back to their college experiences.
[00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:15.720]   And they found it had nothing to do with public versus private.
[00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:20.840]   It had nothing to do with large versus small, urban versus rural, selective versus not selective.
[00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:25.400]   They found it had to do with a set of specific experiences that people had in college.
[00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:29.200]   And that was being able to apply classroom learning to a job.
[00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:32.080]   That was feeling like professors cared about you.
[00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:35.640]   That was participating in extracurricular activities.
[00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:39.440]   It was working on a project that lasted a semester or more.
[00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:42.020]   All of those are available at loads and loads of schools.
[00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:46.720]   You do not have to go to a highly selective school to become a functioning adult.
[00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:52.520]   I'll say, too, as a parent, one of my kids went to a single-digit acceptance rate school.
[00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:56.280]   The other one went to a sign-up-and-go school.
[00:51:56.280 --> 00:52:01.400]   And both of them graduated this spring and have identical jobs.
[00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:05.880]   You know, same salary, same basic functions, same type of company.
[00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:10.980]   It has -- you know, the one at the more selective school is not better off
[00:52:10.980 --> 00:52:16.440]   than the one at the less selective school.
[00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:22.880]   Is it better to have grandparents, uncles, or aunts have a 529 instead of a parent or a student?
[00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:29.400]   So I feel like the impact of assets on the FAFSA is really negligible.
[00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:35.560]   So unless a grandparent or aunt or uncle intends to give vast sums of money
[00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:40.440]   and wants the tax credit and wants to retain control over those dollars,
[00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:46.000]   it's usually better to just put the money in the parent's 529.
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:50.040]   But if it is tens of thousands of dollars that they're planning to give,
[00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:54.760]   if they're superfunding a 529, then it can make sense.
[00:52:54.760 --> 00:53:00.000]   Superfunding is doing that five-year contribution in one.
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:03.720]   Then it probably makes sense for them to have their own account.
[00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:08.360]   The thing is, the schools that tend to be the most generous with financial aid tend to be the ones
[00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:13.480]   that take the CSS profile, and the CSS profile requires you to report all of the 529s
[00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:15.720]   for which your student is a beneficiary.
[00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:23.960]   So it's not going to get you around the Ivy League's barriers to contributions.
[00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:29.080]   And it does make it a whole lot easier, you know, if it's a couple hundred dollars at a time,
[00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:33.240]   it makes it a whole lot easier to just have it in the parent's account where you know
[00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:36.120]   where it is.
[00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:40.040]   Any thoughts on prepaid college trust versus 529 plans?
[00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:42.520]   So there are two types of 529 plans.
[00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:45.880]   There are college savings plans and prepaid tuition plans.
[00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:51.600]   Most prepaid tuition plans are run by a small number of states, and so they're only open
[00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:56.680]   to people who are in -- who live in those states.
[00:53:56.680 --> 00:54:01.800]   Those, I think, can be a great late-stage college planning tool.
[00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:06.600]   So typically what happens in those is you're buying tomorrow's tuition at today's prices.
[00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:12.600]   So if you contribute $10,000 this year and the cost of tuition is $20,000,
[00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:17.600]   you've bought half a year of tuition, regardless of whether it costs $50,000
[00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:21.480]   or $100,000 when your kid goes to college.
[00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:26.400]   Most state school tuition inflation rates aren't that high.
[00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:29.600]   So, you know, three years ago when interest rates were low,
[00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:35.760]   those were a great late-stage planning tool if you lived in one of those states.
[00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:42.400]   Now when the FDIC insured piece of it makes, you know, makes 5%,
[00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:45.240]   it makes a lot less sense to lock up your money that way.
[00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:49.440]   Those can also only be used for tuition, and there's often a limited universe
[00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:57.680]   where you get a lower inflation crediting rate when you -- if you go out of state.
[00:54:57.680 --> 00:55:01.960]   So that would be my two cents on those.
[00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:04.440]   And Jim's here, so I think we're out of time.
[00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:07.440]   [ Applause ]
[00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:09.280]   Thank you so much.
