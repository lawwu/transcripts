[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.220]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, I have a special invitation for you. I want to invite
[00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:12.700]   you to join me in the beautiful city of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia for an upcoming event called
[00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.820]   Nomad Capitalist Live. This event will be happening at the end of September, specifically
[00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:25.620]   September 25 to September 28 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and this event is called Nomad Capitalist
[00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:31.840]   Live. This is the annual live event organized by Andrew Henderson and his team at Nomad
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.340]   Capitalist. I myself have long been an admirer of the work that Andrew has done. I put together
[00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:43.540]   probably half or three-fourths of my own international plan just from all the free content that Andrew
[00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.320]   shared on his podcasts and on his YouTube channel, what read his book when it first
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.160]   came out. He's got a second edition now. I haven't read that yet, but great book as kind
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.380]   of a good starting point. He has invited me. This is now the second time that I'll be speaking
[00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:01.580]   myself at Nomad Capitalist Live. First time was in Mexico a year or two ago. Then I missed
[00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:07.340]   it last year. I wasn't able to make the event, but this year I will be speaking in Malaysia.
[00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.100]   If you are interested at all in the world of international planning, that can be international
[00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.400]   tax planning, building up backup plans, residencies, and getting second citizenships, opening bank
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.580]   accounts all around the world. If you are interested in a plan A, meaning where would
[00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.460]   I like to move today? What would be a great place for me to raise my family today? I don't
[00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:33.980]   necessarily want to live in Oakland, California, or Toronto, Canada, or Sydney, Australia.
[00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:40.440]   I'm looking for new options. This is a great place for you to go and to begin or continue
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.300]   your international journey. According to the numbers, I believe that there should be over
[00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:51.020]   probably around 600 people or more there at this event. There's more than 35 speakers.
[00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.020]   I am one of those all kinds of different topics. What I most appreciated at the most recent
[00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.980]   one that I was in, which was in Mexico, was how practical the information that was presented
[00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.280]   was, meaning that Andrew brings his team, not only of international speakers and people
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.340]   like me who are doing this stuff, but also all kinds of consultants, people that work
[00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.580]   on his team. What I experienced in Mexico a couple of years ago was that they pulled
[00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.420]   out all kinds of information. That's the kind of stuff that's not frequently talked about
[00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.640]   online. I found that to be really, really helpful. I made a few changes in my own international
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.380]   plan just based upon the stuff that they shared at the conference. I thought it was a really
[00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.820]   great conference when I attended previously. I think this year it's going to be fantastic.
[00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.820]   A bunch of great speakers. I will let you review the website for all the information
[00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.620]   and the speakers, but I'll be one of those. I'll be speaking on living overseas with many
[00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.900]   children. The challenge of living as a family overseas and how to build a workable lifestyle
[00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.900]   because our own financial planning and lifestyle planning and travel planning as a family is
[00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.160]   different from that of somebody who doesn't travel with young children. It's different
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.820]   than somebody who travels with teenagers, different than somebody who travels without
[00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.460]   children. We just have to make adjustments and adapt our plans for the specifics of our
[00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:08.060]   situation. Last year, my family and I, we were in 16 countries total all around the
[00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.740]   world for a total of ... I'll skip those details, but we'll get into it at the conference, I
[00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.420]   promise. If you would like to come to that event, I would like to invite you to do that.

[00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.860]   will gain access for you to the event. I will be there for the entirety of the event. I'll
[00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.840]   make myself as available as possible to hang out with you. I'll, of course, be interacting
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.500]   with a lot of the other people that are there at the conference, but I know many of you
[00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.220]   will come from my audience. As you sign up, please send me an email or something and let
[00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.900]   me know that you'll be there. I'll try to arrange some special Radical Personal Finance

[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.740]   Lumpur in September.
