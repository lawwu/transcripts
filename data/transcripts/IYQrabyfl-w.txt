[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.580]   A podcast listener named Brandon writes in, "Pastor John, in your book Spectacular Sins,
[00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.620]   your main point is that God can and does ordain that sin happen in order to accomplish His
[00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.420]   glorious purposes."
[00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:18.420]   Of which I agree.
[00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.480]   "But it raised a question in my mind.
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.900]   Since God uses sin to accomplish His purposes, is it true to say then that there are some
[00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.160]   of God's plans that only sin can fulfill?
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:37.520]   Does this mean that there is a need or a necessity for sin in His ultimate plan?"
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.020]   My answer is yes.
[00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:48.480]   In God's ultimate plan, sin has a necessary place.
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.240]   And I'll try to explain why from the Bible.
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:01:00.120]   But first, let me say that the word "necessary" does not mean that God is somehow constrained
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:07.240]   or trapped by forces outside Himself that necessitate that He includes something in
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.000]   His plan which He doesn't freely choose to include.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.680]   Get that whole constellation of thoughts around the word "necessity" out of your head.
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:28.440]   Beware of picturing God as forced or necessitated to do what He doesn't freely choose to do.
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:39.160]   What we are saying is that God has planned the very best world for the accomplishment
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.520]   of His goal to magnify the fullness of His glory.
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.720]   And I say that's the ultimate goal of the creation of the world and the governance of
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.760]   the world, to magnify His glory, because of Romans 9, 20 to 23, which I'll let people
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.760]   look up.
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:04.240]   So why do I say that in God's ultimate plan, sin has a necessary place?
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:11.040]   And I say it because of three passages of Scripture for starters, and there are others.
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:17.960]   First, 2 Timothy 1, 9, He saved us and called us to a holy calling, not because of works,
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.420]   but because of His own purpose and grace, which He gave us in Christ Jesus before the
[00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.840]   ages began.
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:32.400]   So grace is the disposition and action of God to treat guilty people better than we
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.880]   deserve.
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:41.280]   It can come to us only because of Jesus Christ, and therefore Paul says that grace is given
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.480]   to us in Jesus Christ before the ages began.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:53.180]   So we were undeserving sinners in God's mind before we were created.
[00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:59.520]   We were seen in relationship to a Redeemer, Jesus Christ, and grace flowed to us in the
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.740]   mind of God before there was any creation.
[00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:14.080]   And therefore, when the plan begins to unfold, guilt, sin, grace, Redeemer are necessary.
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:22.720]   Second text, Ephesians 1, 4, God chose us in Him, mark that, before the foundation of
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.320]   the world, that we should be holy and blameless before Him.
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:34.220]   In love He predestined us for adoption as sons through Jesus Christ.
[00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.020]   So predestined through Jesus Christ, chosen in Jesus Christ before the foundation of the
[00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:44.540]   world according to the purpose of His will, to the praise of the glory of His grace, with
[00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.380]   which He blessed us in the Beloved.
[00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.860]   In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses according
[00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.180]   to the riches of His grace.
[00:03:53.180 --> 00:04:00.700]   So again, the point is that before the foundation of the world, grace is operative, the grace
[00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:08.100]   of election, the grace of predestination, the grace of adoption, all coming to us in
[00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.420]   Him through Jesus.
[00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:18.300]   So Christ is conceived of as a mediator and a Redeemer before the foundation of the world,
[00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:25.740]   where grace is moving God to elect us and predestine us and adopt us, sinners, though
[00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:31.220]   we be in need of grace and in need of a Savior before we were created.
[00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:39.780]   So the whole plan is conceived before implements it, and therefore it is a necessary part of
[00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.180]   the plan.
[00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:46.660]   And the third text is Revelation 13, 8, maybe the clearest of all.
[00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:58.700]   All who dwell on the earth will worship the beast, except those whose names are written
[00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:07.020]   before the foundation of the world in the book of the life of the Lamb who was slain.
[00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:12.620]   So there's a book where names are written before the foundation of the world, and the
[00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:19.340]   book has a name, and the name of the book is the life of the Lamb who was slaughtered.
[00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:28.940]   So Christ is slaughtered for His elect sinners before the foundation of the world.
[00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:36.980]   So from those three passages, I conclude in God's ultimate plan, which He conceived in
[00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:45.660]   His mind before He created the world, sin has a necessary place because grace and a
[00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:49.940]   Redeemer are going to be exalted.
[00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:56.180]   And at this point, it is very important that we stress the holiness of God when we say
[00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:57.180]   this.
[00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:05.460]   God's holiness is not the least compromised or impugned by the fact that God wills for
[00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.820]   unholy acts to take place.
[00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:12.620]   We can see this, for example, in the book of Isaiah.
[00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:17.380]   Few books lift up the holiness of God like Isaiah.
[00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:23.900]   Remember chapter 6, "One angel called to the next, 'Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of
[00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.740]   hosts; the whole earth is full of His glory.'"
[00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:36.020]   Three-fold holy is one of the strongest biblical statements there is about the unimpeachable
[00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:41.780]   holiness, purity, sinlessness of God.
[00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:51.340]   And yet it is Isaiah who in chapter 63, verse 17 says, "O Lord, O Lord, why do You make
[00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:59.380]   us wander from Your ways and harden our hearts so that we fear You not?"
[00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:05.580]   So God is ordaining, whatever the rationale and reason here, ordaining that there be a
[00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:10.220]   season in which this people not fear Him.
[00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:17.020]   With a partial explanation perhaps given in the next chapter, verse 7 of chapter 64, where
[00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:23.460]   he says, "There is no one who calls on Your name, who rouses himself to take hold of You,
[00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:33.900]   for You have hidden Your face from us and have handed us over to our iniquities."
[00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:42.020]   So Isaiah, on the one hand, gives the highest testimony of God's holiness and spotlessness
[00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:47.380]   and sinlessness, and on the other hand, gives one of the clearest statements of how God
[00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:53.520]   wills that sin happen in certain situations.
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:08:03.100]   So I would say on the basis of the Bible, three things that many people find hard to
[00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:05.020]   put together.
[00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:08.020]   But the Bible does, so I try.
[00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:17.020]   One, God is absolutely sovereign and governs all things, including the existence of sin.
[00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:24.420]   Two, the absolute, unimpeachable holiness and sinlessness and purity of God.
[00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:32.620]   Third, the complete responsibility and accountability of all human beings to believe and to do the
[00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:37.380]   things they know are right to believe and do.
[00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:42.460]   And I find it helpful, and I'd end here, I find it helpful to take Genesis 50, verse
[00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:50.180]   20, which Joseph spoke over his brothers who sold him into slavery, to take Genesis 50,
[00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:58.780]   verse 20, and put it as a great banner over all evil, even the very first evil that was
[00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:02.420]   committed by Lucifer in heaven.
[00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:09.060]   As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good.
[00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:10.060]   Amen.
