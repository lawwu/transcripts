[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.480]   Well, the entire goal of the Ask Pastor John podcast is to make you happier in Jesus.
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.520]   But can this podcast actually kill your joy in Christ?
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.760]   When I read this question from a podcast listener, I thought, "Wow, Pastor John, we need to
[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.320]   address this one."
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.320]   It comes to us from a listener named Rory.
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.240]   "Pastor John, I've listened to the vast majority of the APJ episodes for the lifespan of the
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.240]   podcast."
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.600]   Well, however, I'm conscious that my Christian media intake, especially on YouTube, is taking
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.760]   away from time better spent doing important chores around the house.
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.520]   In the past, I used to binge watch lots of sermons by prominent preachers on the internet
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.040]   and then feel like I had overeaten on God's Word.
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.060]   But my fear of missing out on the excellent wisdom and knowledge keeps me from stopping.
[00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:59.360]   This seems strange, but could a podcast like this one actually take away my joy?
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.280]   I think back to Moses' serpent on a staff.
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.180]   It was a means to save the Israelites in the desert, and it also had to be destroyed later
[00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.240]   because they treated it as an idol.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.480]   Sometimes I feel like that with Christian media.
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.520]   Pastor John, what would you say to Rory?
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.920]   Could the podcast Ask Pastor John take away your joy?
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.520]   What a great question.
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:31.560]   In other words, could it have the exact opposite effect that it's intended to have?
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:38.200]   And it sounds like Rory is ahead of me in providing biblical wisdom toward an answer,
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:45.640]   because he points to the serpent hanging on the staff that was meant for healing as a
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:52.280]   reminder of human helplessness and God's grace, but then became an object of worship.
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.920]   Numbers 21.9 and 2 Kings 18.4.
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.360]   That's a sharp insight, Rory.
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.400]   So what do I need to teach you?
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.080]   He knows the answer.
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.120]   So what's left for me to say?
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:11.480]   Well, maybe what I should do is give a simple answer to the question, which he already knows,
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:18.360]   namely, yes, this podcast could take away your joy, rather than deepening it and strengthening
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.120]   it and connecting it to God.
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.940]   Yes, that could happen.
[00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:31.000]   And then maybe I should follow this yes, which I just gave, with seven situations or reasons
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.600]   that might happen.
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:39.800]   I hope it doesn't sound too shocking to people, since I can't think of any good thing in the
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:46.600]   universe, including God himself, that if misused would not become hurtful.
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:52.800]   So there's nothing unusual about saying asbestos can destroy faith or hurt people.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.620]   One aspirin will heal you, a hundred will kill you.
[00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.680]   Fire in your fireplace will warm you, fire in the kitchen will burn your house down.
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.000]   Without the sun, we can't see anything beautiful.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.500]   If you look at the sun, you go blind.
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.240]   God is good and merciful.
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:11.200]   If you try to use him as a bellhop, exalting yourself as his boss, things are going to
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.400]   go very bad for you, no matter how good God is.
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:22.000]   I can't think of any good thing that can't become a hurtful, harmful thing if used badly.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:30.760]   So how might "Ask Pastor John" become one of those joy-robbing things rather than joy-raising?
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:37.040]   Number one, I've got seven brief ways you could be hurt by APJ.
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:44.660]   APJ would take away your joy if it is false or you misunderstand it when it's true.
[00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:53.080]   If I spoke so unclearly or ambiguously or erroneously that I mislead people into error,
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.940]   it would become a joy-defeating podcast.
[00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:03.700]   Or if I spoke truly but people misunderstood what I said, it could become destructive.
[00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:10.020]   So in order for me to achieve the aims of "Ask Pastor John," there has to be truth
[00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:15.980]   and clarity on my side, and there has to be enough goodwill and careful listening from
[00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.860]   the listener on the other side.
[00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:22.800]   Number two, APJ would take away your joy if it replaced the Bible.
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.860]   If this podcast does not lead people deeper into the Bible but instead begins to distract
[00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.300]   them from their own digging into the Bible, it will be destructive in the long run.
[00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:38.900]   God's Word is the only infallible source of truth, not me for sure.
[00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:46.340]   Therefore, even if true statements draw people away from the Bible—get that?—even if
[00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:53.900]   true statements, good doctrine in a podcast draw people away from the Bible, they are
[00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.220]   putting a distance.
[00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:04.780]   That podcast is putting a distance between the people listening and the spring of faith-awakening,
[00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.460]   infallible gospel truth.
[00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.060]   That's very, very harmful.
[00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:15.660]   Number three, APJ would take away your joy if it replaced your church or personal counsel
[00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.220]   from people.
[00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:23.340]   The Bible makes clear that we should not forsake the assembling of ourselves together (Hebrews
[00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:29.740]   3:25) and we should exhort one another every day (Hebrews 3:13).
[00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:38.620]   In other words, the dynamics of living face-to-face church life and the preciousness of interpersonal,
[00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:45.780]   mutual exhortation are indispensable for the kind of joyful maturity and health and obedience
[00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.380]   that God desires.
[00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:55.100]   And if this podcast undermines the church, undermines church life and personal counsel,
[00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:02.020]   you're living in fellowships where you are confronted and encouraged every day from other
[00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:08.340]   people rather than enriching all that—that's what I want to do, I want to enrich all that,
[00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:13.820]   I don't want to replace all that—if that happens, then I will undermine your joy.
[00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:19.620]   Number four, APJ would take away your joy if it becomes an obsession with John Piper.
[00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:26.460]   A crucial test of whether a podcast is being used in a Christ-exalting, faith-building,
[00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:35.380]   love-advancing way is whether its effect is coming from the glory of the reality in Scripture
[00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:41.900]   that is spoken or whether its effect is rooted in the personality of the speaker.
[00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:49.860]   I'm happy if people enjoy listening to these podcasts, but every time there is an intermediary—a
[00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:57.820]   preacher, a teacher, a singer, a counselor, an actor, a friend—every time there's an
[00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:09.580]   intermediary between God and man, there's a risk that the mediator supplant the very
[00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:16.780]   thing he should be mediating, namely the truth and beauty and worth of God and his ways.
[00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:23.660]   Number five, APJ would take away your joy if you were simply trying to score self-exalting
[00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:27.900]   points by listening to it and sharing it with others.
[00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:36.060]   I hope that one of the effects of this podcast is that people get insight, get knowledge,
[00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:44.060]   get wisdom, get ways of looking at the world that are fresh and biblical and helpful.
[00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:55.340]   But wherever that's happening, the danger exists that somebody will take one of those
[00:07:55.340 --> 00:08:03.140]   new insights and use it to score points against someone who doesn't have that insight to bolster
[00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:04.940]   their own ego.
[00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:11.860]   If that's the use that someone begins to make of the podcast, it will ruin their joy.
[00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:17.820]   Number six, APJ would take away your joy if listening to it were driven by fear.
[00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:23.820]   Rory says he couldn't stop listening for fear of missing out on something.
[00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:28.180]   Well, that fear, seems to me, is rooted in bad soil.
[00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:33.700]   And the first thing bad about that soil is how narrow-minded and unrealistic it is.
[00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:40.660]   The fact is that Rory and all of us are missing out every day on hundreds and hundreds and
[00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:45.900]   hundreds and thousands of insights that are spoken by excellent teachers and preachers
[00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:50.420]   and counselors on the internet, because you cannot possibly listen to them all.
[00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:51.660]   You have to miss them.
[00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:53.260]   You have to miss them.
[00:08:53.260 --> 00:09:00.060]   So we need to have a realistic assessment of what's possible and an honest view of our
[00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:03.100]   own limitations as finite, fallible people.
[00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:07.780]   And the other thing that's bad about that soil that gives rise to this fear is that
[00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:09.180]   fear's not healthy.
[00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:15.260]   It's not a Christ-honoring Christian motivation for listening to podcasts.
[00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:25.060]   So let the sweet, restful, peaceful contentment of Christ replace your fear.
[00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:27.380]   And listen out of freedom, or not.
[00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:33.780]   Verse 7, lastly, "APJ would take away your joy if it kept you from doing tasks that God
[00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:35.140]   calls you to do."
[00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:36.380]   Rory mentions this.
[00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:42.900]   Paul says that we should do our work to make a living so that we're not mooching off other
[00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:43.900]   people.
[00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:45.060]   He says that in Ephesians 4.
[00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:47.380]   He says it in 1 Thessalonians.
[00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:55.340]   That means you can't read your Bible all day and be obedient to Scripture, let alone listen
[00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:57.300]   to podcasts all day.
[00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:58.300]   Because you got to do your work.
[00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:02.060]   You got to make a living so you don't mooch off other people.
[00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:04.580]   You're designed by God to have a rhythm.
[00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:10.220]   There's a rhythm of healthy intake of truth and outlay of energy.
[00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:11.660]   So let's find it.
[00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:15.740]   So yes, APJ can take away your joy.
[00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:22.140]   And if any of you is being drawn into any of these seven directions, farewell.
[00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:25.620]   At least for a while.
[00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:26.620]   Yeah.
[00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:30.700]   That seems like one of those sure to be classic episodes in the podcast.
[00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:32.380]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:35.540]   And thanks for listening to this podcast over at our online home.
[00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:39.860]   You can explore all of our episodes in our archive of about 1300 episodes to date.
[00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:43.340]   There you can see a list of our most popular episodes, read full transcripts, and submit
[00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:46.260]   questions you might be wrestling with yourself.
[00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:52.260]   For all of that, go to DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.160]   Will all of us experience it?
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:59.500]   Blasphemous thoughts about God emerge in our mind sometimes.
[00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:03.020]   Thoughts that question his goodness and question his character.
[00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:06.420]   So where do these thoughts come from and how should we respond?
[00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:08.420]   That's the question on Monday when we return.
[00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:09.420]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:10.420]   Have a great weekend.
[00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:11.700]   We'll see you back here then.
[00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:12.200]   Bye.
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.200]   [END]
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.200]   [END]
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.200]   [END]
