[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.480]   We have about a half dozen emails from listeners asking a very similar question,
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.400]   and it's essentially this. Is it okay to come away from Bible reading without a
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.360]   life principle or a specific point of application? Or another way to ask it,
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.920]   Pastor John, is must we come away from our Bible reading with an application
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.800]   principle every single time? Yeah, I feel pretty strongly about this. The answer is
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:36.520]   no. And here's why I feel strongly about it. I would say 95%, maybe 99% of my life,
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:44.840]   and I think everybody's life, is lived without immediate reflection upon a life
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:52.440]   principle, but rather we just act. If you think about your day, there are maybe, you
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.200]   know, a hundred big decisions you make in a day, and by big I just mean conscious,
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:04.600]   but 95% of your time, like right now, I'm just talking to you. I'm just choosing
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.240]   words. I'm not, before every word I'm not stopping to say, "Now what principle is
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.880]   going to govern this word? And what principle is going to govern this sentence?"
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.000]   It's just kind of tumbling out of me right now. Well, that's scary, right? Where
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.080]   did they come from? Which means most of our lives are lived spontaneously. Most
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.120]   of our lives are not lived after 10 seconds of reflection on a biblical
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.760]   principle. So where do they come from? They come from a kind of person, and that
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.360]   raises the question of, "Well, how do you become a kind of person so that you're a
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.840]   tree that bears spontaneous good fruit instead of a bad tree that bears
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:48.000]   spontaneously bad fruit?" And the answer is, you soak in the Scriptures and you
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.800]   let your sight of Jesus and your taste of Jesus and his ways in the Bible affect
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:03.200]   your soul, shape your soul. Your soul marinates in the sauces of grace
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.320]   until the soul is made soft and tender and supple and sensitive to the
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:15.240]   leadings of the Holy Spirit, so that in a kind of spontaneous way, it responds.
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:21.280]   Jesus said, "We'll be called to account for every idle word that we speak." Now, idle
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.320]   words are words that are spoken before you have a chance to think on any
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.400]   biblical principle that you've gotten from your text in the morning. So people
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.680]   who are bent on trying to get three principles or three points or something
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.640]   and then try to keep that list and consciously follow them during the day, I
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.400]   just think they're doing something impossible that we were never, never
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:52.280]   designed to do. And I would put it like this, a godly life is lived out of an
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.960]   astonished heart, a heart that's just astonished at grace, you know, amazing
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.500]   grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me, so that we go to the
[00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.340]   Bible to be astonished. We go to the Bible to be amazed at God and amazed at
[00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.080]   Christ and amazed at the cross and amazed at grace and amazed at the
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:17.640]   gospel, and when we're stunned and amazed and humbled, we walk out of our study or
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.640]   out of our chair, wherever we're having devotions, and there's a spirit and a
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.720]   flavor about us that makes us a better person at the kitchen table and when we
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.880]   go to work. And all that, Tony, just to say, I'm not opposed to principles. Good
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.680]   night. I write books, which I'm trying to give things, and so they
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:45.440]   are helpful to meditate on. But that's the key. Meditating on truth shapes the
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:52.240]   soul. We become what we behold, it says in 2 Corinthians 3:18. So my goal in
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:58.480]   reading the Bible is mainly become a kind of person, don't amass a long list.
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.180]   Pastor John, do you think it's appropriate to talk about the
[00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.800]   subconscious here in this discussion? Is it right to say that we live out the
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:10.120]   Christian life through an informed, spirit-filled subconscious? Yes. That's
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:16.840]   basically what I was trying to say, that most of our life, I think, is lived from
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:23.200]   resources that are not presently reflected on in our mind. Our words
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:30.120]   are coming from inside. You know, what goes into the mouth, it defiles,
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.960]   and what comes out of the mouth, it defiles, because it's coming from a certain
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.360]   kind of heart, and most of that heart is unconscious or subconscious, and that is
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.240]   shaped day by day by what we're taking in. You know, it's shaped by what we do
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.280]   with our eyes on the computer, and it's especially shaped by what we do with our
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:55.800]   Bibles and our prayer. Whenever I pray, I'm pleading with God, "Get down deeper
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:01.480]   than I can get right now. Go deeper. Take your scalpel, and don't just deal with
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:07.120]   the sins I'm aware of. Good night. Please, go be a surgeon. Surgeons put you to
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.400]   sleep, and they go in there where you don't even know you have stuff. They're
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.160]   working with this little gizmo in your belly, and you didn't even know it was there.
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:22.200]   That's what God has to do with us. So yeah, I totally think the subconscious is
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.560]   being worked on by the Holy Spirit all the time. Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you
