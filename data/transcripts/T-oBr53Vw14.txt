[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.700]   Priority Pass. It's the membership that everyone seems to have. The quality of Priority Pass
[00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.320]   lounges is just so variable. Now, Priority Pass has actually changed quite a lot over the years.
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:14.020]   It used to be back in the day that any Priority Pass issued through a credit card could get you
[00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:19.480]   to basically any Priority Pass lounge. And then they started adding restaurants and spas and other
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.820]   experiences. And then over time, credit card companies started taking away those experiences.
[00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.940]   So Amex was the first one to remove it. So you can't use an Amex Cards Priority Pass for
[00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:34.100]   restaurants anymore. Chase removed it recently too. Capital One removed it on most of their
[00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.080]   cards recently. There's very few cards now that will get you into Priority Pass restaurants and
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.020]   spas, but sometimes those are my favorite ones to go to.
