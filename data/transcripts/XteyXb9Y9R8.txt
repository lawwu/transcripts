[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.600]   A listener named Leland writes in to ask this, "Pastor John, today I listened to your TGC
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.280]   podcast panel discussion that you moderated.
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.280]   You, David Platt, and Matt Chandler discussed the comfort of knowing that our good and sovereign
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.560]   God has ordained the suffering that people experience.
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.320]   Matt Chandler spoke movingly about how his view of God's sovereignty in ordaining his
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.360]   cancer helped him through the awful side effects of chemotherapy.
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.600]   Here's my question though, if our sovereign God ordains cancer for his glory and a Christian
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.880]   person's good, Romans 8 28, why isn't the appropriate Christian response either to hope
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.080]   in God to glorify himself by healing the person miraculously or to rejoice in the glory of
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.520]   God in a life ended by cancer?
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.000]   Why is it not a sin to use chemotherapy and other modern medicine to interfere with the
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.520]   natural progression of a disease God ordains for his glory and for a person's good?
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:09.440]   The answer is that it may be sin to pursue chemotherapy and it may be sin not to pursue
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.480]   chemotherapy.
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:19.080]   It isn't the use of human science or ingenuity in relationship to the creation that makes
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.160]   an action sin or not.
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.360]   It's the way we think about it and the way it relates to God and the way it relates to
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.600]   faith and the way it relates to love.
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.960]   Perhaps it will make this a little more clear if I point out that the problem Leland sees
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:41.920]   in relation to chemotherapy also applies to prayer and supernatural healing.
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:49.200]   In other words, if God ordains that I get prostate cancer, which I believe he did, then
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:56.600]   I could ask in relation to prayer and supernatural healing the same thing that Leland asks in
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.480]   regard to chemotherapy.
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.560]   Why interfere by prayer?
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:07.960]   Why interfere by prayer with the natural progression of a disease that God ordains for his glory?
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.240]   So it isn't just chemotherapy that creates the issue, but any kind of intervention on
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.880]   our part, including prayer.
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:22.860]   Prayer for healing would be a human intrusion, and the use of medicine would be a human intrusion.
[00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:30.460]   So I think what would be most helpful for me to do here is to suggest five passages
[00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:38.640]   of Scripture that give us guidance in both of these kinds of intrusions, prayer and chemotherapy,
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.840]   which sometimes may be right and sometimes may be wrong.
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.840]   And prayer may become eventually wrong.
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.320]   So first, here's five quick texts.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.520]   Second Corinthians 12, 7-9.
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.920]   So to keep me from being conceited because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations,
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:03.920]   a thorn was given to me in the flesh, a messenger of Satan, to harass me, to keep me from becoming
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.600]   conceited.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.680]   Three times I pleaded with the Lord about this, that it should leave me, but he said
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.320]   to me, "My grace is sufficient for you.
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.080]   My power is made perfect in weakness.
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.080]   Therefore I will boast all the more gladly in my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.540]   may rest upon me."
[00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:31.440]   This text points out the obvious, that God has ordained for us to pray about our needs
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:37.680]   because we don't know at the outset whether our circumstances are intended to last or
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.320]   be temporary.
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:46.200]   God bids us to pray and says in James 4, "We have not because we ask not," often.
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.840]   He doesn't treat prayer as an intrusion upon his sovereignty.
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.160]   He invites it as part of his sovereignty.
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.960]   It's part of his sovereign plan for ruling the world.
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:02.240]   In some cases, he will make it plain that he does not intend to take away the thorn
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.120]   in the flesh.
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.120]   And we should say, even though it's a messenger of Satan, God is the one overruling it because
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.080]   he's talking about the sanctification of Paul through it.
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:20.120]   Instead, he intends to glorify his sustaining grace through suffering rather than his healing
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.520]   grace in that case.
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:27.240]   And we don't know whether that's the case ahead of time, so we're invited to pray and
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.040]   to be a part of the causality of what God's sovereign will is.
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:41.000]   Second, 2 Corinthians 16, 12, "In the thirty-ninth year of his reign, Asa, the king, was diseased
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.680]   in his feet, and his disease became severe.
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:53.960]   Yet even in his disease he did not seek the Lord, but sought help from physicians."
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:05:02.640]   Now, in that case, God intended Asa's foot disease to lead him back to God so that he
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.660]   would seek him, seek help from God.
[00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:13.080]   But Asa proved to be so indifferent to his relation to God and so saturated with a this-worldly
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.560]   mindset and all of the resources of the world that it didn't even seem important to him
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:23.320]   at all to seek God's help, and he went straight to doctors without consulting God at all,
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.440]   and he was clearly wrong to do it.
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:35.240]   So therefore, I think we are sometimes wrong by failing to pray for healing before we take
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.680]   an aspirin or go to the doctor.
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:46.800]   That's why I said at the beginning that sometimes the pursuit of chemotherapy may be wrong,
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.360]   may not be wrong, may be wrong.
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:55.100]   It doesn't follow that it's right or wrong just that you are doing or can do it.
[00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.920]   It may be wrong, especially if it betrays you have no interest in seeking God's help
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:04.300]   whatsoever and you're not going to rely on him at all and you don't love him and trust
[00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:05.300]   him at all.
[00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.400]   Well, then, whatever you do is going to be wrong.
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.900]   But it may not be wrong.
[00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:16.480]   If you fly to chemotherapy with no reference to God, no love for God, no dependence on
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:22.120]   God, no prayer to God, you're in the same situation as Asa was in.
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:31.720]   Third, Colossians 4.14, "Luke, the beloved physician, greets you as does Demas."
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:37.840]   Now evidently Paul was quite happy to have an attendant physician traveling with him.
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:42.320]   He didn't have to draw attention to the fact that Luke was a physician when he wrote Colossians.
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.520]   He could have dropped that with a kind of embarrassment.
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:49.000]   "Oh dear, I don't want to give the impression that I'm not relying on the Lord," and by
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.880]   referring to my good friend Luke as a physician as though people will think that I need a
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:58.080]   physician, he didn't drop the name.
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.520]   He called him a beloved physician.
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.100]   But he wasn't embarrassed about it.
[00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:09.280]   He didn't seem to think that the work of a physician was intruding upon the sovereign
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.320]   plan of God for his health.
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:17.520]   Rather, it seems as though he regarded Luke's skill as a physician as a gift from God.
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:24.640]   Fourth, 1 Timothy 5.23, Paul says to Timothy, "No longer drink only water, but use a little
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:28.680]   wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent ailments."
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:35.580]   So it seems that Paul not only valued the work of his physician, Luke, but also he valued
[00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:41.800]   some of the therapies that he had learned along the way from whomever, namely that in
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:47.920]   Timothy's case, his chronic stomach problems found relief not just through prayer, but
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.540]   through a wise use of wine.
[00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:56.100]   And if someone objects that there's a huge difference between wine and chemotherapy,
[00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:59.920]   my response is, "Well, actually there's not.
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:06.860]   The line between natural remedies and less natural remedies is not all that clear."
[00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:12.520]   And when you think about it, those lines become very blurry.
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:18.380]   But perhaps even more important is the next passage, the last one I'm going to refer
[00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:24.720]   to because this text says it doesn't really make any difference what the lines are between
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:28.560]   the natural and the human invented.
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:34.560]   So here I am at Genesis 1, verse 28, "God blessed them, and God said to them, 'Adam
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:42.040]   and Eve, be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it and have dominion
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:46.700]   over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and the heavens and every living thing
[00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:47.700]   that moves.'"
[00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:53.720]   Now, what does Moses mean when he writes, "Subdue the earth"?
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:54.720]   Subdue the earth.
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:09:00.160]   It's a remarkable statement because it's given before the fall when everything in the
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.200]   earth and the world was perfect.
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.200]   Perfect.
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.920]   Well, what in the world does he mean by subduing what's perfect?
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.840]   Shouldn't you just leave it alone?
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.920]   No, you shouldn't just leave it alone.
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:20.000]   It means many things, Adam and Eve, as you find them in nature, are not yet perfectly
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.400]   suited for your maximal use.
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:28.160]   They are perfectly suited for your change.
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.580]   They're perfectly suited as raw materials.
[00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:38.360]   So you need to take them as you find them, give thanks, and then by means of your craft
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:47.120]   and your art and your labor, change them, change them into a form where they are maximally
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.200]   beneficial to you.
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:56.120]   So you might cut down a tree, cut it into boards, and build a house to keep the sun
[00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:59.040]   off and the rain off.
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:04.960]   Or you might pick grapes and crush them under your feet and store them in a cool place and
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:11.000]   make wine out of them, which in some cases would be called medicine.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:18.480]   Or you might take the flight of electrons around the nucleus and so alter them that
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:25.360]   you create a beam which kills cancer cells on the other side of the fall.
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:34.020]   So the upshot of these five passages of Scripture, it seems to me, is that God has provided an
[00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:42.220]   endless array of strategies for subduing this world and making it serve our maximal usefulness
[00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:45.040]   and fruitfulness to his glory.
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:49.240]   And the key is, are we seeking the Lord?
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:54.000]   Are we depending on the Lord, trusting the Lord, praying to the Lord, loving the Lord
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   in all of this?
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:01.400]   Are we praying, trusting, loving, seeking to submit ourselves deeply to his sovereign
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:02.400]   will?
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:08.400]   For there's no doubt, his sovereign will will in fact be done.
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:15.000]   It will be done through prayer and through miracles and through medical intervention.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:22.520]   And what God is looking for is not the least intrusive strategy of dealing with disease.
[00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:28.680]   He's looking for the deepest, most joyful submission to his sovereign will, however
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:32.120]   we deal with our suffering.
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:35.600]   That's a really fascinating biblical theology of medicine of faith.
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.000]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.200]   We have a bunch of episodes on suffering in the podcast archive.
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.600]   If that's where you find yourself or if you have a follow-up question about what we talked
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:48.320]   about today, check out our past episodes in the Ask Pastor John archive.
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:57.280]   You can find that in the app for Apple and Android devices or at our web home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:01.680]   Well tomorrow we're going to talk about the end times, at least the urgency of the end
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:06.440]   times and our anticipation of Christ's soon return to earth.
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:08.520]   How then shall we live now?
[00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:12.540]   That's the question tomorrow on the table on the Ask Pastor John podcast with longtime
[00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:14.400]   pastor and author John Piper.
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.120]   I'm your host Tony Reinke, we'll see you then.
