[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.160]   A listener named David in Bristol, Connecticut writes in, "Pastor John, over the years,
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.280]   the DesiringGod.org website has published a few excerpts from your decades of personal
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.280]   journals.
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.760]   For you, what exactly is the purpose of journaling in the Christian life?"
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.280]   I think about journaling in two pretty distinct ways, although they overlap.
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:30.940]   Number one is the diary kind of journal keeping.
[00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:36.440]   That means that you come to the end of your day and you take a few minutes and you narrate
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.440]   your life.
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.640]   You just write down the important things that happened during the day and maybe some comments
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.640]   about them.
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.840]   Each day, you sum up what happened.
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:54.440]   I think if you reflect on God's hand in all of that, this can be enormously valuable as
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.920]   a record of God's faithfulness and a record of your own failures and successes for your
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.280]   own humility and encouragement.
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:10.040]   For example, Psalm 105 says, "Remember the wondrous works that God has done."
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:16.000]   Well, goodness gracious, how many thousands of wondrous works in my life that God has
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.400]   done have I forgotten?
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.140]   But wouldn't it be wonderful if they were recorded and periodically I could dip in and
[00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.640]   remind myself of God's wonderful kindness to me over the years?
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.680]   Or in another Psalm 78, 7, it says, "Do not forget the works of God."
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.480]   So remember and don't forget.
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:43.800]   So yes to the diary kind of journaling for at least those kinds of reasons.
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.560]   Here's the other way I think about it.
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.020]   This is mainly the way I do it.
[00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:58.100]   Journaling is a kind of thought notebook for the purpose of insight clarification and insight
[00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.620]   preservation.
[00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.860]   This is not so much for recording what's going on in your life as what's going on in your
[00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.280]   head and your heart.
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.280]   Not as if they're separable.
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.440]   In fact, most of my discoveries of head clarification and heart clarification are because of things
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:21.400]   I'm going through as a dad or a husband or pastor or friend or something like that.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:28.280]   Now of course, there are every manner of combination of those two ways of seeing journaling, life
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.160]   narration and thought preservation and clarification.
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:41.720]   I see what I do mainly in the second category, but very often it's life issues that prompt
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:42.720]   the insight.
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.960]   Let me just say a word about those two things, clarification of thought and preservation
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.640]   of thought.
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.520]   Not everyone is like me in this regard, but I think more are than know it.
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:04.320]   I think namely writing out your thoughts helps you know what you think.
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.280]   In fact, I've gone so far as to say sometimes, "I don't know what I think until I write it
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.280]   down."
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:21.440]   My mind is so muddled until I start to sort it out on paper or on the screen.
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:31.640]   Almost everything we're thinking through is more complex than I can hold in my head all
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.560]   at once.
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.120]   They say Einstein, I read this a few years ago and I thought, "Yeah, there are people
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.120]   like that."
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:50.560]   But I say Einstein's genius was that he could hold an idea in his mind for days and continually
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.960]   look at it from a hundred different angles.
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.760]   Well, not me.
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:06.040]   As soon as I'm on the third angle, the first one is starting to fade away and the connections
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:15.280]   between two and three and one are becoming so many and so tangled and interwoven.
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.040]   Everything is becoming an absolute jumble in my head.
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:27.240]   I have to sit down and write out the first thought, then the second thought, then the
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.600]   third thought.
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:36.320]   Amazingly, while I'm writing out one, two, and three, the connections between them become
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.760]   clearer and I can write those down and then those connections create other connections.
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.720]   Pretty soon, I'm thinking things I never would have begun to think had I not tried to put
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:47.720]   this down on paper.
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:54.000]   I would have just been lost in one big forest of muddled trees.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Idea or thought clarification is a huge reason for journaling in a thought notebook.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.280]   I would stress here that most of what I'm talking about here is Bible.
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.000]   I'm talking about what's the meaning of this passage?
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.440]   How does this passage relate to my marriage?
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:19.040]   How does this work with my daughter, with my sons in their situations?
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.840]   It's not kind of random theoretical stuff.
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.640]   I'm taking time to write about.
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:33.680]   Calvin wrote in the preface to Institutes, "I count myself to be among those who write
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.840]   as they learn and learn as they write."
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.280]   And I say, "Me too."
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:44.840]   So idea clarification is a huge reason for journaling for me.
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:49.240]   And then this last point, preservation.
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:57.600]   What a sad thing that God would illumine your mind one morning while you're having your
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:05.200]   devotions so that you saw something you had never seen before and it had a wonderful implication
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.600]   for worship and for life.
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:13.480]   And the next day, you could not remember what it was.
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:18.780]   That's bad stewardship of Holy Spirit illumination.
[00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:23.480]   And journaling is one way of preserving the gifts of God.
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.800]   And I'll just add one more thing.
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:32.440]   I think it's of huge significance for people in leadership to do this.
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:41.340]   Not only do leaders need to know clearly what they think, they need to say clearly.
[00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:46.680]   They need to express in clear and compelling language what they have thought.
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.520]   I think that's the essence of leadership.
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:54.760]   Think clearly about the future of your organization and the biblical foundations of it, and then
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:07:02.160]   articulate with compelling, clear, beautiful language the vision for the institution.
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:07.360]   Francis Bacon, I can't remember where I first heard this, but I checked it out online.
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:13.840]   Francis Bacon wrote, "Reading makes a full man.
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:23.040]   Conference," and he means conversation, "makes a ready man, and writing makes an exact man."
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:26.020]   Exact meaning, exact.
[00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:31.260]   He uses language with precision, which is the opposite of fog.
[00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:38.300]   Leaders that lead with fog are doing a disservice to their organization.
[00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:42.060]   They're going to drive their boat into an iceberg.
[00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:48.460]   But leaders whose mind is clear and who can express their ideas with precision and clarity
[00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:55.860]   steer the ship in the wonderful, lucid air of truth and openness.
[00:07:55.860 --> 00:08:00.540]   So I count journaling one of the most important habits of my life.
[00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:01.540]   Excellent.
[00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:05.040]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for the very good question, David.
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:11.540]   If you'd like to ask Pastor John a question of your own, please email it in to us at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:15.820]   And if you keep your question as brief and to the point as possible, I would be very
[00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:16.820]   grateful.
[00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:20.280]   And of course, we especially appreciate and welcome follow-up questions that come to mind
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:23.980]   after you listen to a previous episode in this podcast series.
[00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:28.820]   Well, we hear a lot of talk these days in Christian circles about idols.
[00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:33.400]   We may think of a golden calf or paganism, but what is a contemporary idol?
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:34.400]   What does it look like today?
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.820]   I'll ask Pastor John that question tomorrow.
[00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:37.820]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:39.620]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:40.120]   Bye.
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.120]   Bye.
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.120]   Bye.
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.120]   Bye.
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:43.120]   Bye.
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.120]   Bye.
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.120]   Bye.
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.120]   Bye.
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:46.120]   Bye.
