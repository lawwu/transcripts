[00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.040]   Welcome back to Latent Space.
[00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.480]   I'm very excited to have my good friend, Steve Ruiz,
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.040]   how are you this morning?
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.360]   Hey, how's it going?
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.200]   Evening for me, but yeah.
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.200]   Evening for you.
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.760]   Well, thanks for staying up.
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.400]   I have had the good fortune of knowing you before you got famous
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.720]   and actually hanging out in the precise office and studio
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.080]   that you're recording from right now.
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.280]   Congrats on Make It Real.
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.560]   Congrats on TL Draw.
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.320]   I think it's been something that's sort of years in the making,
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.880]   but it's probably looks like overnight success to a lot of people.
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.200]   Yeah, thank you.
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.400]   It's kind of a funny story.
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.960]   I don't know, where should we jump into it?
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.120]   Well, I like to people give you a little background on the person.
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.000]   You don't have a lot of detail on LinkedIn, just like myself.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.440]   I just found out just before recording that you're also a late entrance into tech.
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.600]   So maybe just like, you know, what's your background coming into something
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.320]   like TL Draw?
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.520]   What makes you so unique at doing sort of creative, collaborative experiences?
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:09.240]   Like, you know, I know you and I've actually used TL Draw.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.320]   So I have some appreciation for how hard this thing is.
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.200]   Like you said, I kind of came into this a little late
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.280]   and kind of came into it from a weird angle.
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.680]   My background is actually in like fine art and studio art.
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.000]   So I have my master's from University of Chicago in visual art
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.800]   and would write about contemporary art and put together exhibitions
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.400]   and do my own paintings and drawings.
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.160]   And that was back when I was living in Chicago.
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.560]   And then when I moved over to the UK,
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.120]   kind of, you know, got a new studio, kept that going.
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.840]   But when I turned 30, I kind of decided I should probably make some
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.760]   make some money and kind of work with other people closer than I was at the time.
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.560]   Studio art is primarily a solo thing.
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.440]   And I always had kind of like an analytical background or kind of side to me.
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.720]   My day jobs were, you know, I was working for lawyers.
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.800]   I was doing this writing, like magazines and stuff.
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:11.720]   And so when I when I did that, kind of that switch back
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.040]   eventually to to design and product design, it.
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.040]   I was also able to use a little bit of like a tiny little bit of technical skill
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.120]   that I had had just building like WordPress websites for myself
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.880]   and other artists as portfolios
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.840]   kind of take that and just some natural curiosity
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.320]   around the way that the products work and kind of create a career direction
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.320]   that was more around prototyping and like technical design and doing that
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.160]   kind of like doing the design on the bits of a product
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.400]   that really couldn't be designed otherwise.
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.120]   So the interactive bits, the bits which are
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.520]   maybe more there's more questions about them.
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.680]   There's no clear answer to terms of like, how should this work?
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.680]   You know, in all those places, you kind of have to build something
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.600]   in order to to figure out what you want to build.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.080]   It turns out, you know, to skip right to the end for a moment, like
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.040]   canvas is just full of those types of problems.
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.400]   So it's no surprise that I ended up there.
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.400]   It's like kind of an extreme form of the same problem.
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.280]   But yeah, so I was working.
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.840]   This was back in like 2017, 2018.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.600]   And I used at the time a product called Framer.
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.560]   That was back when it was more of like a more of like a code product
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.440]   than than what it is now, which is more of like a visual
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.000]   visual builder that is kind of backed by code.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.400]   And so I sort of just drilled into that.
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.280]   It was cool. Uber was using it.
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.120]   No one knew how it worked. No one could use it.
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.560]   So I got good at it and got a lot of advancement, early traction,
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.800]   whatever, in my career based on that.
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.520]   But it also, you know, taught me to code, taught me to think about,
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.800]   you know, building things that other people are going to use.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.320]   Taught me about
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.520]   kind of like the type of code that you write when you're in an exploratory phase
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.240]   rather than like in a like execution, like production phase.
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.480]   And that. Yeah.
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.720]   Kerry, I actually ended up working for Framer.
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.880]   I did their education for a year,
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.680]   which is very different than the type of product design that I was doing before that.
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:25.520]   I did a lot of video tutorials and writing and tweeting,
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:31.240]   trying to figure out some way to make technical design content interesting,
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.920]   you know, in little chunks that people could could consume.
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:41.040]   And I joke that like they probably got less out of me
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.400]   in that job than I got out of the job itself.
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.760]   Like because, yeah, I walked away from that.
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.000]   Not sure if I'd helped anyone really learn how to use Framer,
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.040]   but I certainly learned how to how to tweet
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.760]   and learn how to record a good gif and learn how to talk into a microphone
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.760]   and all that type of stuff.
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.720]   And so in the next roles that I had, which were
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.680]   I worked for a company called Play out in New York, who is also doing design tools.
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.920]   And I really wanted to work in design tools after that.
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.680]   Play's doing like a mobile, I guess, or now it's like just general iOS, Mac OS
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.240]   platform specific design tools where you're you're using actual elements
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.400]   from the kind of widgets from that that component or component collection.
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.440]   I don't know in your designs and kind of bringing that a lot closer to the end product.
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:34.080]   And at the same time, I started getting into open source.
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.440]   I'd kind of done some popular open source before.
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.000]   But this was now 2019.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.680]   It was it was locked down. I had a little bit more time.
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.920]   I also had a daughter, so not that much more time.
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.520]   Or I'm sorry, it was 2020.
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:54.400]   And yeah, I guess that open source that I started getting into
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.000]   started swinging back toward some of my kind of artistic interests
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.200]   or studio interests and kind of visual interests.
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.560]   Those are the parts where I felt like
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.920]   the problem space was was really underserved and really
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:11.600]   it wasn't necessarily like technical problems that were really hard.
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:16.280]   It was more subjective problems where I think the thing that was lacking
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.960]   was the taste or the opinions
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.400]   or the like the feeling for what good solutions were.
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.840]   So the first kind of problem like this that I got into was arrows.
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.160]   Like I had, you know, two boxes or two points arbitrarily placed.
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.640]   I want a good looking arrow, like a quote, Mark, like good looking arrow between the two.
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.840]   You know, well, that could be anything.
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.880]   That's not a math problem.
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.680]   Maybe it involves some angles and linear geometry and vectors and all that.
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.600]   But it's like the good looking part really was the
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:55.520]   was just like my own taste and my own eye and like tons and tons of iterations.
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.520]   And arrows are super tricky.
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.120]   And there's a million ways for this, you know, edge cases
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.280]   when things are overlapping or things are too far away or too close and all this.
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:08.120]   But I was working on this and I was working on this in public on Twitter,
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.640]   recording GIFs of boxes and arrows kind of squishing together and all that.
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:15.320]   And I think people really like that.
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:19.880]   And they liked kind of following me on this somewhat obsessive journey,
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:24.640]   which was technical, but it wasn't like it wasn't like trying to crack an algorithm.
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:29.400]   It was like trying to trying to figure out and identify the the rules
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.720]   governing an aesthetic experience or an aesthetic, you know,
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.800]   thing, which was a good looking arrow
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.960]   that became perfect arrows.
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.600]   And that was pretty popular.
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:43.800]   But the next one really is what what kind of broke my popularity
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.680]   on Twitter or just in the space, and that was a project
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:50.600]   that ended up being called Perfect Freehand. This is
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.960]   a little hard to describe.
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:57.960]   If you've ever used like an iPad pencil or drew with like a stylus
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:02.000]   and Photoshop or something like the harder you push,
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.800]   the thicker the line gets and the lighter you push, the thinner the line gets.
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.120]   It kind of is like this ink experience.
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:13.920]   And that's it's not a easy problem.
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:18.680]   But if you're doing it in a kind of a Photoshop style, like raster environment,
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.400]   you know, the solution is pretty straightforward.
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.520]   You just draw like.
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:27.400]   You interpolate like tons and tons of tons of whatever shape you're drawing
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.960]   in between each point that you've actually moved your mouse to.
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:34.320]   And you just change the size of that little stamp that you're making.
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.960]   So it's like a little circle, slightly bigger circle,
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.080]   slightly bigger circle, slightly bigger circle.
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.120]   But they're all really tightly packed together.
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.600]   And so it looks like a kind of a
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:46.040]   a line that's changing its width as it moves.
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:50.360]   My. Angle on this.
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.600]   The reason why I spent so much time about it
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.320]   was that I wanted to do that using vectors.
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:58.120]   I wanted to get a bunch of points in and then like a polygon
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:01.600]   that sort of defined the outside of that shape coming out,
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.200]   because I like to work in SVG and.
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:08.200]   And it turned out that this was like an insanely hard problem
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.160]   that no one had solved.
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:13.080]   And if they have solved it, they certainly didn't open source it.
[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:17.000]   But I couldn't find any good example of a variable width line
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.920]   that actually worked fast enough and
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:24.040]   consistent enough, et cetera, for for it to be digital ink.
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:27.240]   And so, again, I did this in public, did this on Twitter,
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:31.760]   a million GIFs of lines that look terrible,
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:36.480]   but, you know, like slowly attracting more like getting closer to the solution,
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.400]   attracting more people who had solved this problem or tried to do this
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.360]   or they wrote their Ph.D. on ink.
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:44.880]   And let me tell you about, you know, how arcs work in this environment
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:46.520]   and all this stuff. Wow.
[00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.160]   And I yeah, it was it was fantastic.
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.920]   Like I met so many good, you know,
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:56.400]   people who had like we're experts on this or or something like it.
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.440]   And slowly we made a
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:02.760]   like a really, really good, tight
[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:06.200]   little library for for doing exactly what I wanted.
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:09.560]   Like here are a bunch of mouse points or just arbitrary points.
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:11.600]   Like, give me back a polygon that surrounds them.
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:15.680]   And let me essentially draw a line around the edge of that polygon,
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.920]   fill it in, and it'll look like ink.
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.640]   And so that was perfect freehand.
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:25.360]   And that's now used in like Canva uses it like Draw.io uses it.
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.920]   ExcalDraw uses it. We use it at Tealdraw all over the place.
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:33.480]   Yeah, it's it's just like a significantly better
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.880]   than the next best solution in that space.
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:39.280]   And there really wasn't even any known solution in that space.
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:42.320]   So someday I'm going to be checking out at a hotel and see my own ink
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.240]   and, you know, a little iPad or something like that.
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:49.920]   And so. I might as well
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:53.400]   just kind of finish the whole origin story or something.
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:58.280]   But that's kind of led right into Tealdraw is that I had integrated my ink
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:02.600]   into ExcalDraw and I spent time in that that code base.
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.760]   And I'd also like created several
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:08.640]   like infinite canvas like tools to help me
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:12.840]   build perfect freehand and visualize it and sort of, you know,
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:17.040]   do my ink and pan and zoom in and program against this thing.
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:22.040]   And so I had done including Globstuck design, which I won't necessarily talk about.
[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:28.080]   But it's a yeah, it's kind of like a weird experimental design tool.
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.400]   But anyway, it was like as an infinite canvas.
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:33.160]   It was very much like, you know, Framer, Figma, et cetera.
[00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:37.120]   And after doing ExcalDraw and been working on these kind of projects
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:40.560]   that were in the same area, I was like, you know, maybe there's
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:44.440]   there's a market here for or not even a market.
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:47.800]   It was just like, I think the thing that I want to work on next is
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:52.880]   is like a general purpose, kind of like whiteboard like engine.
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:57.640]   Mostly for myself, I built globs, but the only thing that you could put
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:59.880]   on the canvas in globs was a glob.
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:04.040]   So I had all this like code and these solutions that I was like hanging around.
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:07.280]   It could kind of see how I would adapt it.
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:08.560]   And so that's what I started doing.
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:12.360]   And that was the next story that I was kind of telling on Twitter is that like,
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:16.720]   OK, here's how selection works in something like Figma or or something like Miro
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:19.000]   or Framer or Sketch.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.760]   These these kind of like not heuristics, these sort of conventions
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:27.720]   that are part of this really complicated thing called like the infinite canvas,
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:31.120]   you know, going all the way back to whatever
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:36.240]   Flash and before then, you know, Adobe Illustrator and before then all the way back.
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:40.040]   And they're all pretty consistent between products.
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:42.960]   Like if you're making a canvas this way, you have to kind of do them all.
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:45.200]   Like your undo, redo should work in a specific way.
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.960]   Your selection should work in a specific way.
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:50.360]   Like, you know, the camera position and how the camera moves
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:52.360]   should work in a certain way.
[00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:55.720]   All the modifier like option drag to clone and then all of those
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:59.840]   became their little vignettes of of how I was building this thing.
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:05.240]   This was now like spring of twenty twenty one.
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:08.280]   And I had everyone
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:12.960]   from any infinite canvas related creative product
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.800]   kind of like in my inbox being like, hey, can you come work for us?
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.920]   You know, like, let's talk. Let's do this.
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:20.720]   And so I was either going to go work for Figma or Adobe.
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:27.640]   And I ended up going with Adobe in part because I think FigJam had just come out.
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:33.480]   And the team at Figma were like, well, this this is competitive with with FigJam.
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.880]   I'm like, this thing is like nothing.
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:37.400]   It's like a little open source.
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.560]   You know, it's like no one uses this.
[00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:42.040]   It's just me trying to get to 10,000 Twitter followers.
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:44.280]   But, you know, it's mine.
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:48.320]   So, no. So I went with Adobe and I told but I told them, I'm like,
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:51.160]   I don't want to start for six months.
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.160]   Like, this is actually a pretty fun project for me.
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.560]   I want to get it out of my system.
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:58.600]   You know, let me start in January and just work on this.
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:00.680]   And so they said yes.
[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:04.680]   And I, you know, quit my working with play
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:09.000]   and and said, I'm going to go work on this little open source thing for six months.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.120]   I have some, you know, contracting money in the bank.
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:15.160]   Let's drain the company account and and do this.
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:16.480]   That's not what happened.
[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:22.920]   The like I went full time from a Wednesday on Thursday.
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:28.520]   I had a very large communications company say, hey, we're moving our
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:32.960]   whiteboard that we've designed for specific touchscreen devices.
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:35.680]   We're moving that into the browser.
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:38.640]   It turns out people want to use the whiteboard on their phones.
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:41.440]   And on their laptops and all that, like like they do with Miro.
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:46.960]   And so we need to make this thing that we wrote in C++ to be highly performant on these,
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:52.160]   you know, kind of tiny microcomputers that were part of these interactive touchscreen TVs.
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.360]   We have to make this work on the web and we don't think it's going to be good enough.
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:56.920]   We have to build from scratch.
[00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:59.480]   We don't have the team. Can we just build on what you're building?
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.040]   At the time, this thing was an open source.
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:03.160]   It was just sort of but it was getting there.
[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:04.760]   And I'm like, yeah, sure.
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:06.600]   Like, give me like seventy five thousand dollars.
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.160]   I'll let you see the source code.
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:12.120]   Just, you know, don't I don't want to talk to you very often.
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:14.080]   You know, I'm not working for you.
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:16.080]   I never want to see your code, but you can look at mine.
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:19.280]   And they said yes to that.
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:22.640]   And so I was, you know, funded for those those first six months.
[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:27.520]   And I got to work on this, you know, without having to feel bad about it.
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:32.960]   And I'd also opened up, eventually opened up TealDRAW to be
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:37.280]   like sponsorware that if you were sponsoring me on GitHub,
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:42.000]   you could you could access it, you know, in its kind of primitive state on TealDRAW.com.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.720]   And it had like a couple hundred people join that way and sponsor me.
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:51.600]   So at one point, like my sponsorship was, you know, over five thousand dollars a month,
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:55.360]   which is not massive money, but it's like I wasn't doing anything different.
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.440]   So it was pretty good as a kind of a passive thing.
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:06.800]   Anyway, I shipped it at the end of November 2021, and it was very popular.
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:08.000]   I just open source everything.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.880]   I was just like, you know, the TealDRAW.com app, the library, the canvas.
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:14.960]   And, you know, I was organized in a certain way.
[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:18.480]   I just made it all public.
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:19.840]   Everything was MIT.
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:23.040]   You know, let's just let's just throw this out into the world and see where it goes.
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:25.200]   Well, it went pretty far.
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:27.280]   It was like number one on Hacker News for a while.
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:29.280]   It was like the top trending repo on GitHub.
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:35.760]   A lot of people like 40,000 people showed up at TealDRAW.com to use it on that launch date.
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:37.520]   Which was all good.
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:41.600]   Like so far, this was all within my same narrative of, OK, this is cool.
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.680]   I'll make this and then I'll go do something else afterwards.
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:49.840]   The thing that really surprised me was how many teams wanted to build on this.
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:53.520]   And they weren't like they weren't building whiteboards.
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:56.720]   They weren't like Miro competitors or Figma competitors.
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:02.720]   They were just like apps that you wouldn't expect to have infinite canvases inside of them.
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:10.000]   But and they wouldn't have built it except that I had suddenly made this very easy.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.360]   And I had suddenly shrunk the development time of this like whiteboard like feature
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:21.120]   in their product from like three years and three people to three weeks and one person.
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:24.160]   And not even one person.
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:28.320]   Just like, you know, no new developers, no new team, no new graphics experts.
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:29.360]   No, no, no.
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:31.920]   Like computational geometry guys like, you know, we can do this.
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:34.480]   We the canvas itself is like React all the way down.
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:37.760]   So even if you wanted to customize it, you'd just be writing React components and then
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:39.200]   a little bit more code on top.
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:44.720]   It got like I was totally overwhelmed by inbound from companies who were like, I want to build
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:49.200]   this or I want to acquire you or I want to, you know, I want you to build something for
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:51.120]   me or, you know, I want this in my app.
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:54.080]   You know, how do you help me or how can I do this?
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:18:00.000]   And and people were shipping things also like within two weeks, three weeks, like production
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.400]   ready, like people had taken this and run with it.
[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:08.240]   And so the the story that I started to get around Tealdraw was that like, OK, well, this
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:15.120]   is this is a cool little whiteboard, but it's also kind of like filling a gap that no one
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:22.640]   knew was there, which was that like in the same way that like Mapbox or Google Maps,
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:26.400]   you know, provide maps for apps that would definitely not build maps themselves.
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:30.800]   Like maps are insanely hard, like your little local food delivery app like wouldn't just
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:32.720]   wouldn't have a map in it, you know, like easy.
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:35.040]   But it is a value add.
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:37.920]   If they can have it in there, then absolutely it is a value add.
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:40.800]   It's just completely impractical to do themselves.
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:47.840]   And what I learned talking to folks was that like every PM had used Miro or used Figma
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:51.200]   or used, you know, one of these other collaborative tools.
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:55.760]   And every creative product person was like, well, this is fun.
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:56.720]   Collaboration is fun.
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:59.040]   This canvas thing is pretty cool.
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:03.920]   Like, why don't we do why don't we why can't we put our information on, you know, why can't
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:07.520]   we put our CRM on the canvas or why can't we do our sales stuff here?
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:09.360]   Like we're already kind of using Miro for this.
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:12.640]   Like, why don't we give why couldn't we give this to our customers as well?
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:14.160]   Like, why don't we build a product around this?
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:23.600]   And it was just a technical no until, you know, November 24th, 2021, when suddenly it
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:29.760]   was like a technical maybe and yeah, there was there was absolutely demand.
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:35.440]   So hence the, you know, I had to call Adobe and say, no, I'm not going to come in on Monday.
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:40.960]   Like it turned out that the best possible outcome of this happened and there's actually
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:42.080]   a company here.
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:47.280]   And then I went out and I raised a seed round from Lux in New York and Amplify in California
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:48.800]   and a whole bunch of really great angels.
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:52.640]   You know, on the story of, yeah, this is this is cool.
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:54.480]   It's good app feels good.
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:57.120]   Companies want it.
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:02.080]   And, you know, by then I had had almost $200,000 of sponsorship, you know, and people were
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:05.360]   just signing up and signing up because there was no way to even be a customer.
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:09.600]   Like sponsorship, sponsorship.
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:14.560]   And but also, yeah, there's a massive 200, you're not saying 200k a month.
[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:16.240]   That's no, no, no.
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:22.480]   But like, I mean, I had had up to then, the amount of sponsorship that I had received
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:24.000]   was around $200,000.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:31.680]   I think some of the recurring stuff was like, like 5,000 a month.
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:33.200]   But yeah, like it was.
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.960]   Which is in the top echelon.
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:35.360]   A lot.
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:35.600]   Yeah.
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:37.840]   Oh, yeah, like, yeah, yeah.
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:44.640]   Certainly the but yeah, and just the amount of like kind of validation that had come in
[00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:48.080]   around this was like more than more than usual.
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:56.000]   So race company or race around, put together a team here in London, and basically had just
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.400]   been building this, this whiteboard SDK.
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:02.480]   Since then, you know, we reconfigured the project around, okay, we're going to be building
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:07.200]   this not necessarily for end users, but for teams to use as kind of an infrastructure
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:10.880]   product, a developer product, something closer to Mapbox.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.160]   And, you know, we were making demos to kind of like show different ways that it could
[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:16.640]   be used.
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:21.040]   Certainly the collaboration thing is a big one, but the fact that you could put anything
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:26.240]   on the canvas that you can put on a website, just because it is a, it is a web, like all
[00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:28.000]   HTML, CSS all the way down.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.560]   And that was going really well.
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:33.840]   It was already a good story.
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:39.200]   And then I just raised like a 2 million extension for the company.
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:47.520]   While I was on the final pitch for that, the Dev Day was happening at OpenAI.
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:53.360]   And in the morning I woke up and I was getting all this kind of action on Twitter because
[00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:58.480]   a developer at Figma had used teal draw to make this little demo where you could draw
[00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:05.120]   a website, click a button and get back a big pop up that had your website in there.
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:11.040]   It was like a prompt, like, you know, hey, you're a developer, you just got this wireframe
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.000]   from your designer.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.400]   Can you give it back as a single page HTML file?
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:18.400]   And it would do it and it could do it.
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:22.480]   And then you could show that website to whoever is using the app.
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:28.640]   And we took that and we're like, wow, you could do so much more with this, like with
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:32.560]   teal draw, just like it's only scratching the surface of the type of integration that
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:33.520]   you could do.
[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:36.640]   So again, we had just finished the race.
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:38.720]   Pressure was off a little bit.
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:40.240]   It was kind of getting towards the end of the year.
[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:42.720]   I was like, all right, let's let's just take this and have some fun.
[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:44.000]   Let's make some some viral shit.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.320]   Maybe we'll get like 200 likes or something like that.
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:49.280]   And it exploded.
[00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:55.920]   It was like, I think we're at like for this month, last 30 days, like 22 million views
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:56.640]   or something like that.
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:59.360]   It's just like it was Kanye West numbers.
[00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:02.000]   It was really, really, really popular for a couple of days.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.320]   If you're on Twitter and at all technical, you might have just seen a ton of teal draw
[00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:10.480]   stuff on your timeline or about two weeks ago, three weeks ago.
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:15.200]   Well, so, yeah, that kind of brings us up almost to today.
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:17.600]   You just released something two hours ago, which we'll talk about.
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:24.560]   But maybe this is a good time to bring up the screens, you know, for those who.
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:26.080]   Oh, yeah, yeah, let me share.
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:30.080]   Yeah, so we're recording a video as well.
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:32.720]   You can jump over to the YouTube to see stuff.
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:38.400]   But this is an inherently visual podcast, so we have to show stuff.
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:41.680]   OK, the incremental thing I got from your blog post.
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:45.200]   So you did do a write up, which thank you for that, because I actually didn't know that
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:45.840]   you did a write up.
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:47.280]   It was just drawn up.
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:47.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:49.040]   All the videos.
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:52.800]   This is the power of open source, right?
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:54.960]   That someone else had the idea.
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:56.480]   You weren't even focused on Dev Day.
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:03.120]   Someone else had the idea and just made it without your permission or talking with you.
[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:06.160]   And then the idea could spread back to you and you could run with it.
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:07.040]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:12.800]   And we had made a lot of the bits and pieces in place already based on, you know, I mean,
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:15.360]   it's well documented or it's documented.
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:16.720]   It's documented.
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:20.400]   It has tons of examples and all that.
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:28.400]   Yeah, and it's not, I mean, it's a big library as far as an open source library goes.
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:31.600]   But it is, yeah, you can work with it.
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:39.280]   And once this thing got popular, like the first thing we did was create like a starter
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:41.600]   kit so that someone could take it and like run with it.
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:42.160]   Yeah.
[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:47.680]   So this is normal teal draw where, yeah, you can, you know, you can draw, you can whatever,
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:48.480]   move things around.
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:54.320]   It works if you've used Figma, if you've used Miro, it's kind of familiar to that.
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:25:01.680]   And you can put pretty much anything on this canvas that you want, like YouTube links,
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:02.720]   etc.
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:14.480]   Just because it is, I always have to remember to open YouTube in a incognito window so that
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:18.000]   people don't see my embarrassing interests here.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:23.920]   So yeah, because this canvas is HTML and CSS and like divs and stuff all the way down,
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:26.160]   you can put things like YouTube videos on there.
[00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:27.440]   You can even make them play.
[00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:33.600]   Because again, like anything you can do in a website, you can do on teal draws canvas.
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:38.800]   What's fun is because it is a canvas all the way down, you can also like draw on top and
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:43.600]   like do the kind of canvas manipulation stuff that you might do with normal shapes, but
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:44.880]   also with this type of content.
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:54.640]   So that ended up becoming like a big part of why Make It Real got kind of popular.
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:57.040]   So anyway, I'll show you Make It Real now.
[00:25:57.040 --> 00:26:06.400]   This was a hastily built layer on top of the kind of teal draw engine SDK that we sent
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:06.560]   up.
[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:11.680]   And the idea here is that you can make a wireframe and we're going to send it to
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:18.320]   GPT-4 with vision with like a prompt like much like the original one that that Sawyer
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:21.520]   Hood had come up with, which is you are a web developer.
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:27.840]   You work with designers, they give you wireframes and notes and screenshots and all sorts of
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:28.800]   stuff could be anything.
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:35.280]   Your job is to come back with a single page or a single HTML file that has all the styles
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:42.080]   of the JavaScript, all the markup necessary in order to make a real working prototype
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:44.480]   based on what you've been sent.
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:50.240]   It also has slight emotional manipulation like you love your designers and you want
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:55.200]   them to be happy and like the better your prototype is, the happier they are and all
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:55.280]   that.
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:56.000]   Oh, in the prompt?
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.520]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:59.600]   Again, it's open source.
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:00.720]   You can read the prompt.
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:01.840]   It's kind of a funny one.
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:08.000]   But we do some other tricks that I'll like, for example, we'll have a second as I do this.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.600]   So you select something like this, you click the Make It Real button and you get back a
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:14.240]   little waiting box.
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:20.480]   We've considered running ads or like in this waiting moment, but no, I don't know.
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:21.040]   You could.
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:25.760]   Maybe like a kind of Zelda style like tips, you know, tips and tricks like here's different
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:27.280]   ways you can do.
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:32.240]   But yeah, for example, like we also send it.
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:35.760]   I mean, this is part of the joy of like a multimodal prompt is we send it the photo,
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:40.800]   which kind of looks like the same as if you had done a copy and paste thing.
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:42.240]   So like an image.
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:50.320]   And you have all this functionality worked out, you know, like that's what I find so
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:52.160]   poetic about this that we're just ready.
[00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:58.960]   Yeah, it's like it really I mean, it feels like we had gone off in this like this very,
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:02.960]   you know, as collaboration and AI and stuff was going in one direction, we kind of just
[00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:06.640]   went off in our own weird like, hey, the world is really going to need a whiteboard at some
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:12.720]   point direction and then and then it just they kind of met us where we were at and then
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:19.840]   we've been able to just be like show up like show up on day one of this new world of possibility
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:26.560]   with like the thing that like if I hadn't spent the last two years building this, I
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:31.680]   would spend the next two years building this like it is the right product for this type
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:32.960]   of type of feature.
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:38.240]   So anyway, they give us back a HTML, we stick it into an iframe, put that onto the canvas,
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:41.840]   just like we did with that YouTube link, and I can, I can interact with it.
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:46.160]   So it should be going from orange to pink, orange to pink.
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:50.960]   Hey, it's given us a hex code, I can click the hex code.
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:55.760]   And it gives me, you know, YouTube links, etc.
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:29:04.560]   Just because it is, I always have to remember to open this open YouTube in a way that in
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:10.640]   something like v0 or some of these other kind of prompting environments, like the only way
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.880]   for you to then make this better.
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:18.320]   Maybe you can do this with chat GPT or something and you could you could write like, oh, actually,
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:23.520]   you know, instead of or like you missed the labels like it should say orange and pink,
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:24.800]   you know, on top of this thing.
[00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:26.880]   And, and it doesn't.
[00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:33.520]   So you could go back here and like, you know, make, make sure that this is whatever you
[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:34.320]   can change the input.
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:40.720]   But because this is teal drawn, because you can draw on top of this stuff, you could also,
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:47.600]   you know, right on top, like you could kind of modify this, and maybe even give it so
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:54.320]   the same type of markup that you would give to a designer, you know, a designer or something
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:59.040]   like that, you know, draw some arrows, or maybe paste in a screenshot and say, hey,
[00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:01.760]   make it look more stylistically close to this other thing.
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:05.760]   And I'll say this as well.
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:14.320]   I'll say like full width for that, that button, and anything else that we, well, let's just
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:14.880]   see what it does.
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:23.120]   And then what you do is you select, you select the website that they gave you back the previous
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:25.120]   result along with all this markup.
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:28.400]   And you use that as the new input.
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:34.160]   And so that's going to give you something kind of like, yeah, it's going to give you
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:36.240]   an image that looks like this that you've now sent.
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:41.200]   But we've also kind of tweaked the prompt a little bit when you when you do include a
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:46.240]   previous result and say like, hey, this, you know, the, the, the wireframes coming back
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:51.120]   are annotations or markup based on, on what you sent before.
[00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:51.920]   And there, there you go.
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:58.080]   So now we have a new prompt that sure enough, the, the labels are there, you know, it still
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:02.400]   works just like before the button is full width and, and, you know, it still works just
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:02.800]   the same.
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:04.880]   So we send it back.
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:11.600]   Again, we send it the image, we send it the text, the prompt.
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:16.400]   We also send it all of the text items themselves separately, because ChetchiBT is not really
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:18.720]   great with, with recognizing text.
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:21.120]   So we say like, oh, by the way, your vision's not so good.
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:26.000]   So we've, we've ensured to have our copywriter, you know, list out all the, the copy that
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:26.480]   you can use.
[00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:32.400]   I think we even send it back the HTML that they used for the, the, the previous result.
[00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:39.200]   So we just dump like as much information as possible at this, the, the GPT-4 with vision.
[00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:44.400]   And that's how you're able to, to get these sort of iterative results.
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:55.600]   And the, it is, it is like legitimately good to, like, it feels like work.
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:59.360]   It feels like, like you're actually doing stuff when you're iterating through this way
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:05.440]   and, and slowly shaping and adding complexity and doing step-by-step, you know, as you're,
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:07.040]   you're, you're building something.
[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:12.640]   And when you're done, you can, you know, copy a link to that and, and open that in a new
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:15.040]   tab, like we, we host it, it's there forever.
[00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:19.520]   You can, you can bookmark this if, if you really just needed a slider between orange
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:19.920]   and pink.
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:24.720]   Well, now you have one, you, you, you know, whether you could code it or not, or you maybe
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:29.040]   not worth building or using a no code tool to build, but, you know, we just made that
[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:29.680]   in five minutes.
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:33.520]   If you are more on the coding side and you want to use this as a kind of a foundation
[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:39.760]   of, of a real project, or maybe just to like, see how it like, well, how did, how did, how
[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:40.720]   does that actually work?
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:44.960]   You can open it up in StackBlitz or CodeSandbox.
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:46.240]   I think tomorrow we'll have Replit.
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:53.760]   And yeah, see all the code, see what Chachapiti came up with and, and kind of use it or adapt
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:57.200]   it or, you know, keep it going or do whatever you want with it.
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:05.040]   But yeah, cause it is, it is like, it is real and yeah.
[00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:06.080]   You make real.
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:06.320]   Yeah.
[00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:07.600]   Yeah.
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:11.120]   It's, it's interesting that you can also, I've seen some of your other demos.
[00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:13.040]   It looks like you're, you're about to move us on to another.
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:14.880]   Yeah.
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:18.560]   I'm, I'm going to grab a couple of the, the ones that I have showed before.
[00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:22.720]   This one's a really interesting one because it is.
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:26.320]   Okay.
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:29.360]   So what's on the screen now just to, to kind of.
[00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:31.280]   Narrate.
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:38.640]   Describe it is, is I have a, I have a drawing of a stop, like a kitchen timer, you know,
[00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:43.040]   where you can add a minute, add a second, you know, start or stop the timer or, or reset
[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:43.520]   the timer.
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:49.840]   And then next to it, I also have a state chart, like state machine describing the three states
[00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:54.320]   of the timer starts or stopped running or complete.
[00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:59.440]   And like what each one of those buttons could, should do in terms of transitions or changing
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:33:59.840]   the state.
[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:05.440]   I think you can hand this to pretty much any designer or developer and get back a, you
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:06.560]   know, a working result.
[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:08.560]   Like it's fully, fully spec'd sort of, sort of.
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:12.480]   But what, what you can do with this.
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:14.400]   I made a friend that did it, David Crofied might say.
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:14.800]   Yeah.
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:17.280]   Develop a state chart first and then, you know, plug it into it.
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:17.920]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:24.720]   And what's cool this way is that you can, well, let's do a couple of things in parallel.
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:26.800]   First thing I'm going to do is I'm going to,
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:34.720]   I am just going to make a box over here and I'm going to say, kitchen timer.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:37.200]   Right in the middle of the box.
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:41.760]   And, and this is going to be the only prompt that I'm going to, I'm going to give it.
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:44.480]   I'm just going to click make real and just the, the kitchen timer box.
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:51.280]   Sometimes you see with these multimodal prompting, like someone will draw a calculator, like
[00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:55.280]   in, in a lot of complexity and, and say, you know, make this, make this real.
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:58.400]   And sure enough, you get back like a really complex full calculator.
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:04.160]   But if you did the same thing and you just said empty box, but just the word calculator,
[00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:07.200]   it would give you back the same thing is that it knows what a calculator looks like
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:09.680]   and it knows how it works and all that.
[00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:15.760]   So next, let's also give it the, just the, the user interface, like without the state chart.
[00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:19.280]   Well, we'll leave the state chart out, but we'll do just the user interface.
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:28.720]   And then we'll do just the state chart, you know, and say, Hey, make this real.
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:33.920]   And then we'll do both the state chart and the UI.
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:44.400]   So we have four different prompts with four potential different results based on, you know,
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:46.480]   variations of the same, same input.
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:52.960]   So first off our kitchen timer, where all we did was we sent it a box with the word
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:53.680]   kitchen timer.
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:58.560]   It has, I don't know what this box is for, but we have a time.
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:00.560]   We have start, stop and reset.
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:02.560]   I can double click in.
[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:03.440]   I can click start.
[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:05.520]   It doesn't do anything.
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:06.560]   Oh, what is this?
[00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:07.600]   Oh, whoa.
[00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:14.800]   This is the, if this, okay, well, if the number is there, yeah, then it'll, it'll stop.
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:17.200]   If I stop it, it goes, it stops.
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:17.920]   I can start it.
[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:19.040]   It'll keep going again.
[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:19.440]   Okay.
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:20.320]   And I can reset it.
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:21.280]   And there we go.
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:27.280]   The only weird thing is that it's, yeah, it has a, a number input field for the number
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:32.320]   of seconds that I can, I can type out, but yeah, you know what, in a pinch, in a pinch,
[00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:35.760]   I'll take it if I really needed just to count 60 seconds or something.
[00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:42.480]   Next, we have the input where, or the result where the input was just my drawing of a kitchen
[00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:43.280]   timer.
[00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:45.280]   I didn't tell it it was a kitchen timer.
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:49.280]   I didn't send it the words kitchen timer, and I didn't tell it how it should work, but
[00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:52.560]   it did produce something that kind of looks the same.
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:54.560]   Let's see if it works.
[00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:58.080]   So I'm going to click minute, second, start, reset.
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:36:58.240]   No.
[00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:05.120]   So unfortunately, it did not make any working UI, although it did, you know, put the buttons
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:06.480]   in the right place or something like that.
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:12.560]   Maybe it over focuses on the UI because you, you told it, you just, that's all you gave
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:13.520]   it, you know?
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:13.920]   Yeah.
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:14.240]   Yeah.
[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:19.760]   I mean, there is in the prompt kind of language around, like, you use what you know about
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:23.040]   the way that applications work in order to sort of fill in the blanks here in terms of
[00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:25.680]   the behavior and all that.
[00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:27.120]   But let's go to the next one.
[00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:29.680]   This one is where we only sent it the state chart.
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:33.760]   There's also something in the prompt that says like, if it's red, it's not part of the
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:34.640]   UI.
[00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:39.840]   Like if it's red, then like treat that as an annotation rather than like a, a thing
[00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:41.200]   that you should, should actually make.
[00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:43.200]   Uh, okay.
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:49.840]   So this time it actually looks a lot like the previous one, uh, but it does have these,
[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:52.400]   um, minute, second buttons.
[00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:54.080]   Oh, weird.
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:56.720]   It has plus and minus for minute, minute, seconds.
[00:37:56.720 --> 00:38:01.760]   Uh, and it also has this like stop state written at the bottom.
[00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:06.080]   So there's four buttons, you know, minus minute, minus second, plus minute, plus second, and
[00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:08.240]   then there's starts, uh, start and reset.
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:09.200]   So does it work?
[00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:11.360]   I can add a minute.
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:12.640]   I can also subtract a minute.
[00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:13.440]   All right.
[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:14.320]   I can add a second.
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:16.400]   I can also, yeah.
[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:18.800]   And if I press start, we're now in the running state.
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:21.840]   Uh, unfortunately it's going up rather than down.
[00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:27.040]   And I, and I can reset it and, and okay.
[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:32.240]   Uh, I'm just curious if I, if I do give it a, an additional prompt here and I say like,
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:37.760]   uh, uh, this should count down, not up.
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:42.320]   Uh, and just kind of do an arrow towards the start button here.
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:44.480]   Let me see if that, uh, that'll make a real one.
[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:48.400]   But, and then finally we look at the other example, which is where we sent the state
[00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:50.240]   chart and the UI.
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:55.360]   We get something that looks much, much more like our user interface.
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:56.480]   The question is, does it work?
[00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:58.080]   Yes, it does.
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:38:59.840]   Uh, perfect.
[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:02.240]   I can stop it and start it.
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:02.640]   Yep.
[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:03.680]   That's a reset it.
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:04.880]   Wonderful.
[00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:14.080]   Uh, and in this case, yeah, my, my, my, my feedback was accepted.
[00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:18.960]   I went back to the one where I, I'd asked it to count down and not up and it all looks
[00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:20.240]   the same, but now it's counting down.
[00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:28.800]   So I think for folks, especially who have like, uh, who have worked in design and who
[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:33.520]   have worked in sort of like user experience design in particular, like this should feel
[00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:38.160]   pretty familiar of, of kind of sketching out and trying to do your best to specify, like
[00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:41.840]   what it is you want and see what you get back from your designers.
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:43.520]   You can see what you get back from your developer.
[00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:50.480]   Um, but having like a, an environment in which to have that, like game loop, that like iteration
[00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:57.520]   cycle, uh, alone and in instantaneous and essentially free, uh, is really, really wild.
[00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:03.280]   And, uh, you end up spending a lot of time kind of like, uh, not only getting into the
[00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:07.680]   head of the, the AI and sort of being like, okay, well, why are they getting confused?
[00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:09.440]   You know, what am I sending that is confusing?
[00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:13.120]   How do I send more information in order to like produce a better result?
[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:19.680]   Uh, but also it really forces you to clarify your own expectations of like somewhere up
[00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:25.920]   here, I have a, uh, uh, uh, drag and drop list, you know, where you can drag list items
[00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:29.040]   between, and like, I started working on this and started specking it out.
[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:36.160]   I was like, man, this is like, actually like not only really hard to, um, like to produce
[00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:40.000]   a good result, but it's also like just really hard to describe is that like the failure
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:44.320]   was really on, on my end for just not knowing how to get the information in there because
[00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:46.480]   I didn't actually know how this thing should work.
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:50.400]   Um, but yeah, but you know, I could figure it out.
[00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:52.400]   I have an environment in which to figure that out.
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:55.920]   It's fun.
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:59.440]   That's amazing.
[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:01.440]   Uh, I'm still processing.
[00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:02.640]   Oh, you have a picture of it.
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:04.000]   Oh yeah.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.360]   All right.
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:11.120]   So this is, this is kind of like, uh, slightly obnoxious, but, uh, during this math, like,
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:14.080]   cause this thing went massively popular on, on Twitter.
[00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:20.240]   Uh, uh, yeah, like thousands of retweets type of level.
[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:25.360]   Um, and there, there were some folks who like were subtweeting it about like, you know,
[00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:25.920]   get over it.
[00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:29.520]   It's just a wireframing or no code tool or something like that.
[00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:34.480]   Uh, one guy did say like, you know, I prefer to, to wireframe like the old fashioned way
[00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:35.520]   with pen and paper.
[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:39.040]   And, uh, I was like, oh yeah, no, that, that works too.
[00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:40.800]   I like this works with screenshots.
[00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:45.520]   I can just take the screenshot here of, you know, that the, the dude posted of, of the,
[00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:50.880]   uh, the, the drawing that he had made, you know, it's not even like a good photo.
[00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:53.760]   There's a pen, you know, across one of the screens, et cetera.
[00:41:53.760 --> 00:42:02.000]   But if you just give that with no other information, uh, to like, as a prompt, uh, you get back
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:08.960]   a pretty good result, like it loading right now, but, uh, I've done this before and yeah,
[00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:15.200]   like you get back, um, you know, just from this like photo of a, of a piece of paper
[00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:25.760]   on the, the, the guy's desk, you know, you have a, um, like not, not completely arbitrary,
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:28.640]   uh, result like working website here.
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:33.200]   Um, that was, that was, that was inferred from just that picture with no other input,
[00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:34.800]   not, not even like titles or anything else.
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:37.440]   And of course it's like responsive and all this stuff.
[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:43.760]   Uh, and so the idea of like, yeah, like our tools, yes, I've, I've worked really hard
[00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:49.680]   to make all of our shapes, you know, really good in our arrows, obsessively good and all
[00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:50.080]   this stuff.
[00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:55.760]   But like the fun of the infinite canvas and teal draw in particular is that you could
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:43:04.000]   just dump like whatever you want onto the canvas, screenshots, text, images, other websites,
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:06.320]   uh, sticky notes, all that stuff.
[00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:12.480]   And, uh, the, the, the model, even as something that was in preview, like the very, very first
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:18.880]   sort of multimodal, um, model, uh, can do a really good job at just taking all that
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:20.160]   stuff as the input.
[00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:26.880]   And, um, and yeah, like, so we accidentally made a really, really good visual multimodal
[00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:34.160]   prompting, uh, uh, application environments or, or user experience byron.
[00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:35.840]   I'm not even sure what we're going to call this thing.
[00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:38.880]   It's a teal draw.
[00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:43.760]   You also had a, you know, pre-show prep.
[00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:45.520]   You also talked about parallel prompting.
[00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:48.560]   Is that basically just, uh, prompting and then moving on to something else?
[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:50.240]   Is that, is that what?
[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:50.480]   Yeah.
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:53.840]   That's kind of what we did up here with the, uh, the stopwatches, the fact that we could
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:58.480]   get multiple prompts going at the same time and like arrange them spatially.
[00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:06.320]   Uh, and, um, people have done this also with, with imagery, uh, to say, okay, well, here
[00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:13.200]   are, we're going to use Dolly and we're going to kind of like make a tree of prompts as
[00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:19.680]   you go, you know, different iterations based on, um, which, whatever you make for iterations,
[00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:22.960]   you pick your favorite one, you keep going kind of like what you do in mid journey.
[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:27.920]   But to have that spatial and to have that like, uh, arranged on a canvas so that it
[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:29.040]   actually can make sense to you.
[00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:33.760]   And you can kind of look back and follow it, follow forward that like, I don't know, like
[00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:37.520]   whiteboards, infinite canvas stuff is just really good for a lot of things.
[00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:44.720]   Um, and, uh, so organizing like a whole bunch of different content that is, uh, irregular
[00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:54.640]   or ephemeral or, um, or, or has a kind of like ad hoc meaning configuration, like, you
[00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:57.920]   know, things that are next to each other or things that are in a grid or in this case,
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:03.360]   you know, uh, just even what we're, what we have here for what we did with the stopwatch,
[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:07.920]   like there's an implicit meaning of like, okay, the source is on the left, the result
[00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:11.680]   is on the right and any further iterations are further on the right.
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:12.640]   Right.
[00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:14.640]   Like we didn't put that into a data model.
[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:16.640]   We didn't structure that in any way.
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:21.680]   It doesn't actually, that meaning relationship doesn't really exist in any part of the product.
[00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:25.520]   It just exists to us because we, we can make sense of it.
[00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:33.920]   Um, and yeah, so for, for this type of thing, not only is it cool that now a model can make
[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:41.680]   sense of it as well, but, uh, but yeah, for, for organizing, uh, complex iterations of
[00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:45.600]   imagery, complex iterations of, of, of outputs, et cetera.
[00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:49.440]   Like, yeah, the canvas is a place I really do believe that.
[00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:52.720]   Yeah.
[00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:55.360]   Um, I mean, that's, that's, that's really incredible.
[00:45:55.360 --> 00:46:02.400]   It's also, it's a little, you know, I think a few developers are kind of scared about,
[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:06.320]   you know, how much of this, uh, their jobs, uh, this does, obviously, uh, there's a lot
[00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:07.360]   more that they can't do.
[00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:07.920]   Yeah.
[00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:12.960]   So the, the, will this take my job story is, is interesting.
[00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:20.720]   I mean, I'm not actually concerned, but I think this augments, like, uh, my, actually
[00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:23.920]   my concern as a developer is that this is good, but not good enough.
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:26.560]   You know, like it's good for throwaway UI.
[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:31.120]   Um, but I, would I actually export the code and take that code?
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:32.240]   Um, I don't know.
[00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:38.720]   Uh, it, it looks like, uh, your first MVP was just HTML files, which, you know, if it's
[00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:41.760]   a single HTML file, it can, it can have some JS or some CSS.
[00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:47.920]   I saw some problems with layout, uh, in there, which I don't know how good it is at layout.
[00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:52.080]   Uh, it's, it looks like you could just prompt it for tailwind if you want tailwinds.
[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:53.920]   Uh, I assume it can generate react.
[00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:54.720]   Uh, I don't know.
[00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:56.400]   What are the limitations of this thing?
[00:46:56.400 --> 00:47:01.120]   Well, there's, there's the limitations that are in that particular demo, which is that
[00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:05.360]   like, well, it couldn't do react because it needs to just be a single compiled thing.
[00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:09.600]   Uh, you can't do any multi-page stuff or, or anything like that, but that's more of
[00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:16.640]   like how we're structuring the, uh, the project rather than like a specific requirement of,
[00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:17.600]   of the project itself.
[00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:23.520]   The, I mean, we've talked about having, well, there's, there's two kinds of things.
[00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:26.960]   There's one is like, how big is the input window and how big is the output window or
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:27.280]   something?
[00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:36.640]   Uh, so in theory, you could have, uh, the input be, here's a entire full stack react
[00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:41.200]   application, uh, together with all my UI and all this, all my components, et cetera.
[00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:50.000]   And here is a screenshot that I took of the landing page where the menu, uh, is in the
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:55.280]   wrong spot, you know, and I'm going to annotate that with some arrows and some text in order
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:58.800]   to say like, here's what I, where I want it to be, or here's what I want, et cetera.
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:06.720]   And for the output to be, um, you know, a diff that I can apply to my code base, like
[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:14.000]   produce the, the, the, the git, like basically like produce the commit, um, that would change
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:19.600]   this and have that commit be against multiple files and et cetera.
[00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:26.640]   Um, in order to, to have potentially like a solution that is just, uh, like ready to
[00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:36.320]   go applicable, like a patch or a PR that you can make, um, there really isn't any, any
[00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:37.200]   limit in that.
[00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:42.560]   And we've seen with copilot, et cetera, the challenge is more on the input side than the
[00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:43.760]   output side.
[00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:49.120]   Like, like absolutely you could figure out a way for this thing to spit out like a working
[00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:50.960]   iOS app or something like that.
[00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:56.080]   Uh, the question is like, how do you tell it what you want and, and how do you iterate
[00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:57.360]   when it gets it wrong?
[00:48:57.360 --> 00:48:59.760]   And, and just doing zero shot, zero shot, zero shot.
[00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:02.640]   It's like really a frustrating, um, process.
[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:06.800]   Uh, but if you do have a way of, of iterating, if you do have a way of kind of like step
[00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:11.600]   by step moving towards the, the solution that you want and kind of like, you know, getting
[00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:15.200]   it into like, okay, well, this is good, but it's not great.
[00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:16.960]   Could be better, et cetera.
[00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:23.120]   Um, that's, uh, that's how you actually make that type of complex output more practical
[00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:24.320]   or more realistic.
[00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:28.400]   Um, is that you probably won't get ever get the prompt just right.
[00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:33.040]   Even if you have like a really, really, really good, you know, three generations from now
[00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:36.000]   agent, like you, you still have to put that information in.
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:40.800]   Um, but you're never going to put the, all of the information in the first time you need
[00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:42.320]   to be able to, to iterate on it.
[00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:48.160]   And so with visual stuff, uh, I feel like the canvas, like what we were looking at,
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:54.080]   um, that's part of what it unlocks is that like space of iteration at space of, uh, um,
[00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:58.720]   you have a way of marking up the result and using that as the new prompt.
[00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:00.560]   Um, and that's, that's kind of new.
[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:02.800]   Yeah.
[00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:03.520]   Yeah.
[00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:09.200]   Um, multi-modal prompting is such a brilliant concept that, uh, you know, I think it's,
[00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:12.720]   uh, it's going to be a norm for, for, for some things.
[00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:19.600]   Um, in my mind, you demonstrated, you know, coming from Photoshop, there's this concept
[00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:20.160]   of layers.
[00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:24.000]   Um, you can, you can kind of simulate layers in, in TO draw.
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:30.560]   And I see like emergent property of layers in, in this kind of prompting, which is there's
[00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:31.600]   the UI layer.
[00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:33.120]   And then there's the state chart layer.
[00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:39.600]   Um, and those two things seem like pretty useful in, in, uh, spec specifying a prompt.
[00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:43.200]   I was just wondering if you've, if you thought a little bit about like other dimensions or
[00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:47.200]   other layers that would be useful in multi-modal prompt.
[00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:47.840]   Yeah.
[00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:57.280]   So, uh, one thing that we've done is to bring in screenshots of other apps, like here's
[00:50:57.280 --> 00:50:59.680]   stripe.com, like make it look like stripe, you know?
[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:04.720]   So that's sort of like, like, or like here's linear.com.
[00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:14.160]   Like let's, let's do it this way, uh, you should just, you should just like give a design
[00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:16.000]   and ask you to make pop instead of make real.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:17.440]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:20.880]   Make it, make it more, make it more, make more pop.
[00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:29.200]   Uh, so there, there's the idea of like bringing in style as like a, as another, um, another
[00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:33.600]   in like part of the input, uh, flow charts are absolutely useful.
[00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:38.080]   Uh, I mean, this is, it really just boils down to like, what would you really give a
[00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:41.200]   developer who you are working completely asynchronous with?
[00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:51.200]   You know, if you had to, uh, spec out a project and put that printed out on paper and mail
[00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:57.120]   it to a developer and they were going to mail back a disc with an HTML file on it, like
[00:51:57.120 --> 00:52:00.720]   what would you send, uh, if you were sending this to the moon or something?
[00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:07.040]   Uh, uh, so yeah, definitely like descriptions of how the state should operate and specs
[00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:07.440]   on that.
[00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:11.200]   Uh, we've, um, what else have we done?
[00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:16.160]   We've done flow charts, we've done screenshots of other apps.
[00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:24.320]   We've, uh, I think we've, we've even just pasted in code, like, like here's a whole
[00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:30.400]   bunch of Jason that you can use, um, and have it just read that as the, as the input data.
[00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:34.960]   Uh, we can, you can point it at specific endpoints.
[00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:40.560]   You can say like, I want you to hit this endpoint and then display the results, you know, as,
[00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:43.680]   uh, as cards or as items or something like that.
[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:47.120]   Uh, not, I mean, you don't even have to like wire this up.
[00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:51.360]   It's not like retool or anything where you, you have to register that or, you know, it's
[00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:52.400]   not built into the tool.
[00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:53.760]   You're just from an endpoint.
[00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:55.200]   Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:59.040]   I'm trying to think of, uh, what a good demo endpoint would be.
[00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:01.600]   We could, maybe we could do one more, uh, more test.
[00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:03.440]   What is it like dog.co?
[00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:04.240]   Is that?
[00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:06.160]   Yeah, it's a good demo.
[00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:06.560]   Yeah.
[00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:07.040]   Yeah.
[00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:07.680]   I've used that one.
[00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:13.280]   Um, I mean, this, this might be, this might be kind of like the box with the word calculator.
[00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:16.800]   Like it might just know because it's probably been a bunch of tutorials.
[00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:18.240]   Oh, it's in the beginning set.
[00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:18.740]   Yeah.
[00:53:18.740 --> 00:53:21.680]   Yeah, but, but, uh, you know what, we'll do it anyway.
[00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:25.040]   We'll, uh, I'll, I'll share it and, uh, we'll, we'll try.
[00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:31.600]   So for those who don't know, dog.co is, is one of those like, uh, demo APIs that, uh,
[00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:34.080]   you just set up just because it's not offensive.
[00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:37.520]   And, uh, yeah, exactly.
[00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:39.360]   You can, you can get dog.co.
[00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:40.400]   Yeah.
[00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:44.960]   Um, I'll try and think if there's a, there's a more complicated endpoint that we could
[00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:45.600]   hit.
[00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:48.400]   Uh, maybe, maybe while I'm doing this, if you want, it gives me more ideas.
[00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:49.920]   Yeah.
[00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:52.400]   It gives me more ideas of what to promise and what, what can go in.
[00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:57.840]   Uh, I definitely didn't think about hitting endpoints just because I, it's just not in
[00:53:57.840 --> 00:53:58.800]   any of the demos I've seen.
[00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:00.320]   Yeah.
[00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:02.400]   Uh, but it works.
[00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:04.160]   Um, let me see.
[00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:06.000]   I'll, I'll have a big button down here.
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:09.680]   Uh, show me a dog.
[00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:12.160]   Okay.
[00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:14.400]   So that's going to be our, show me a dog button.
[00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:18.480]   Uh, this should be a picture of a dog.
[00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:22.720]   Oh, that's a great dog.
[00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:24.160]   No, thank you.
[00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:26.160]   Oh yeah, yeah.
[00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:27.680]   Yeah.
[00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:33.920]   Uh, and, um, and then we'll, we'll do some annotations here.
[00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:37.520]   We'll say like, uh, uh, okay.
[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:42.240]   When, when this is clicked, get a new dog.
[00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:47.040]   Um, yeah, there's those perfect arrows coming in.
[00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:48.880]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:58.080]   When clicked, get a new dog from dog from, I'll just paste in this, um, and put the result
[00:54:58.080 --> 00:54:58.880]   in the image.
[00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:01.680]   Okay.
[00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:07.200]   So it's more of a, more of an instruction than you would normally, you know, I don't
[00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:07.360]   know.
[00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:08.720]   Yeah.
[00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:12.560]   One thing that it's going to have to guess is, uh, you know, the, the response format,
[00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:12.800]   right?
[00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:14.160]   Cause it could be anything.
[00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:16.160]   This is true.
[00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:17.600]   Let's see if it works.
[00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:20.720]   Well, Hey, all right.
[00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:22.240]   Yeah.
[00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:29.760]   And let's see if it, if it actually hit it, hit the, uh, the right, um, the end point
[00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:30.400]   in the right way.
[00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:33.920]   So, um, dog button.
[00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:34.960]   Yeah.
[00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:35.280]   Okay.
[00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:40.240]   It hit the right red endpoint, Jason dog image, uh, and then put it in.
[00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:41.600]   So there you go.
[00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:48.560]   Uh, you have yourself a, uh, JavaScript tutorial in a box ready to go.
[00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:54.240]   And I think like, I mean, we probably wouldn't do this on camera, but like, you can say,
[00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:58.480]   you know, like, like use the auth token, you know, whatever.
[00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:04.800]   And like, you know, go like really get, you know, real data back from this thing.
[00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:08.080]   Um, yeah, there's no reason why it wouldn't be able to do that.
[00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:14.080]   Uh, so yeah, it's really the only, yeah, yeah.
[00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:21.440]   Well, not really, because again, what inside of the prompt for this, we do give it like
[00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:24.400]   an array of all the texts that you've put in.
[00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:30.480]   We say like, look, I know your vision isn't so good, or you have a hard time reading texts
[00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:31.600]   sometimes when it's small.
[00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:35.920]   Uh, cause what are like the input that, that you get is pretty wild.
[00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:37.840]   It's like, it takes this as a PNG.
[00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:44.240]   And then it like, um, I can't do this in teal draw, but it, it resizes it.
[00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:49.360]   It squishes it into a 512 by 512 image or something like this.
[00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:50.320]   And tiles it, yeah.
[00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:57.440]   And then, yeah, so it's like, um, it, the text especially can get kind of like chunked
[00:56:57.440 --> 00:56:58.800]   up, especially if it's small.
[00:56:58.800 --> 00:57:05.600]   So we, we send those strings separately, uh, so that it can kind of reassemble, um, anything
[00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:07.920]   that it can't read, uh, right off the bat.
[00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:15.360]   Yeah, it's, it's a weird future that we've, uh, we've found ourselves in pretty cool.
[00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:17.680]   It's pretty cool.
[00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:17.840]   Yeah.
[00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:21.520]   I mean, you know what, one layer I automatically think of is, is backend, right?
[00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:28.640]   Like, uh, as someone who has, uh, works at AWS, um, I see a lot of systems diagrams,
[00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:32.320]   like cloud diagrams, um, entity relationship diagrams for database schema.
[00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:36.800]   So I wonder if like anyone's tackled extended in this to backend.
[00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:40.800]   And then obviously the next level from that is, uh, full stack apps where you have backend
[00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:41.360]   in front of it.
[00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:41.920]   Yeah.
[00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:44.560]   Um, short answer is yes.
[00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:50.960]   There's someone on Twitter that was using this to generate, um, yeah, like doing like
[00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:51.760]   flow charts.
[00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:55.760]   I'm not a backend guy, so I don't actually know exactly what the output was.
[00:57:55.760 --> 00:58:03.440]   Um, but I, I believe it was like a, like a configuration script for AWS, um, that was
[00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:04.400]   built off of this.
[00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:10.560]   Like, I think he just copy and pasted, uh, a diagram that he had made in teal dry anyway,
[00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:14.800]   and said, okay, well, let's throw this at this thing and see what it comes up with tweaking
[00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:21.520]   the prompt to say like you, um, rather than building single page websites, you just return
[00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:26.480]   the Jason, you know, description of this configuration or something like that, or return a script
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:27.280]   that would set this up.
[00:58:28.560 --> 00:58:34.320]   Um, you could tweak it to say like, here are like, yeah, all the entity relationships
[00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:40.880]   between, um, uh, different tables or items and tables, uh, and, and give me the, give
[00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:45.600]   me back the SQL, you know, like, you know, initialization or something that said that
[00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:49.440]   would make all these tables and, um, and set up these relationships.
[00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:57.760]   Uh, yeah, it's just, again, like the hard part is getting that information in, but we
[00:58:57.760 --> 00:59:00.480]   I don't know, pictures are really good.
[00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:06.720]   And yeah, if you can tell it that way, that works.
[00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:08.500]   Yeah.
[00:59:08.500 --> 00:59:09.760]   Awesome.
[00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:16.000]   Um, you are also part of, uh, so you were one of two, one on what I think about, uh,
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:19.360]   multimodal, um, viral hits in November.
[00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:23.360]   Uh, the other one also, you had to play a part to play in it, which is the local consistency
[00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:27.840]   models, uh, trends, uh, where I think you worked with Phal.
[00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:29.360]   Yeah.
[00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:32.800]   So we, uh, and actually I do have something to show here.
[00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:35.120]   We, we actually have a couple of things to show here.
[00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:42.800]   Uh, we connected with Phal because they used, um, TealDRAW to, to create a demo for, uh,
[00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:48.400]   for their, their, uh, LC, LCM, right?
[00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:49.600]   Yeah.
[00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:50.480]   Latency consistency.
[00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:50.980]   Yeah.
[00:59:50.980 --> 01:00:01.360]   Um, but we took that and we, we made a draw fast, uh, TealDRAW.com, which is, uh, basically
[01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:06.000]   you get a, these like shapes, these little draw fast shapes.
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:11.440]   Um, and it puts the result basically grabs that new image and puts it right next to it.
[01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:16.320]   And these are, um, these are extremely fast.
[01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:21.200]   So as I'm moving things, you should see the image, um, updating as well.
[01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:28.080]   Uh, and I think it, I think this was originally not a goat, you know, whatever, this is a,
[01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:35.040]   um, uh, uh, uh, wise princess.
[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:36.000]   I don't know.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.760]   I play this more with my, uh, my daughter than anything else.
[01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:45.920]   I like what this looks like, you know, and, um, oh my gosh, she, she does.
[01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:54.000]   And actually we had a lot of, uh, a lot of folks on, uh, Twitter, um, being like, this
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.200]   is, this is not good.
[01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:55.840]   Like, whatever.
[01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:58.640]   Like, cause I had a video of whatever my, my daughter drawing.
[01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:03.760]   And, you know, she made this awesome drawing of a mermaid and we turned it into like this
[01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:08.880]   really anonymous crappy version of like an illustration of a mermaid.
[01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:12.400]   And, uh, they're like, no, no, the children's drawing is much more interesting.
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:13.280]   And I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:13.920]   Come on.
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:14.640]   Who cares?
[01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:15.600]   Of course it is.
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:18.960]   But I, this is, uh, you know, this is, this is fun.
[01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:22.320]   So yeah, I think it's pretty wild.
[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:28.160]   Animations, like some kind of, like you could make, uh, some kind of, it's, it's, this is
[01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:29.760]   almost like stop motion film.
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:31.440]   Um, yeah, yeah.
[01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:36.880]   I mean, we need to do more work on consistency, but like, this is getting there.
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:45.920]   Yeah, uh, it is a car driving through a busy market marketplace.
[01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:51.120]   Uh, the fun is that like, you end up, uh, after playing this with this for a little
[01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:56.000]   while, you end up like, uh, getting really into the particularities of the input.
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.360]   Like the, uh, like what can you do with a design tool?
[01:01:59.360 --> 01:01:59.600]   Okay.
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:01.040]   You can move things around, right.
[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:02.720]   I can grab some of these and move them around.
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:06.960]   Um, and like, oh yeah, there's a highlighter here too.
[01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:10.640]   So we could like, we could do some highlighting, you know, that'll, that'll do stuff.
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:15.680]   Uh, and then you kind of like, we, we couldn't help ourselves.
[01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:17.520]   We started making these like stories.
[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:22.720]   So, uh, one thing you can do is kind of click this little button and that'll make the, the
[01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:26.080]   drawing and the result kind of on top of each other.
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:30.480]   All right, well then I'll move on to the other one that we, uh, that we released earlier
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:33.360]   today, which is called lens.taildraw.com.
[01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:35.520]   So that was drawfast.taildraw.com.
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:42.720]   Uh, and again, this is probably not making a good podcast audio, but it is, uh, the image
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:46.880]   updates as soon as possible based on what the input drawing is.
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:49.600]   Um, and it is pretty hypnotic.
[01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:53.520]   So the, uh, this one's a little riskier cause it's live.
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:59.680]   So this, this is, uh, we took a project called together, which is a vertically scrolling
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:02.240]   infinite drawing collaborative experience.
[01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:06.400]   Uh, a little bit like a chat room as you're drawing, everything's just sort of moving
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:08.640]   up and it just disappears off the top of the screen.
[01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:09.600]   Never to be seen again.
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:12.720]   So it's kind of just fun to play with.
[01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:17.440]   Um, by the way, one of the most magical chat experiences I ever had was with you.
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:21.520]   Uh, I think you were like with your daughter or something and I was, I was, whatever, showing
[01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:25.840]   off together and you started writing, I started writing and we had chat, uh, on together.
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:29.280]   Yeah, I was like, what is this?
[01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:31.920]   It's super cool.
[01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:35.520]   Like, you know, inevitably someone will write like, you know, where are you from?
[01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:40.720]   And, uh, and everyone's like chiming in and talking about, yeah, you are like, this is
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:42.880]   cool where, you know, yeah, you can chat.
[01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:52.000]   Um, so what I'll describe what's on the screen now, which is basically we've, we're taking
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:58.160]   like a screenshot of the center, uh, like a square out of the center of this chaotic
[01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:03.280]   vertically scrolling chat experience, and we're sending that to the, to the LCM and
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:09.680]   putting back the image based on like a prompt, uh, like, you know, desert scene or busy marketplace
[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:13.200]   or, uh, futuristic cityscape or something like that.
[01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:19.280]   And so it is updating like, you know, 10 times a second as, uh, as we go, but yeah,
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:23.600]   I would say like it's updating surprisingly quickly, like 10 times, 10 frames per second.
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:24.160]   Yeah, here we go.
[01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:32.240]   Yeah, yeah, uh, no, I think it's now like to 32 milliseconds basically, uh, as you go.
[01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:39.760]   And, um, so if I draw like a big orange thing down here, it's going to kind of show up into
[01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:40.320]   the drawing.
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:44.080]   Um, maybe I'll do a big black one so you can see better.
[01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:49.200]   Uh, like it just sort of becomes part of the, the input to this prompt.
[01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:54.000]   Um, and it is extremely hypnotic.
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.600]   Uh, this is again, like lens.tealdraw.com.
[01:04:57.600 --> 01:05:02.400]   Um, this isn't live, so no one should come on here and say hello, Steve, or anything
[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:11.600]   like that, but it is, uh, it is, yeah, it's like this like slow moving, um, collaborative
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:15.920]   kind of like hallucination experience and it just never ends.
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:22.320]   I mean, yeah, I'm probably going to be funding fell completely for the next, uh, you know,
[01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:24.960]   their series A or something like that.
[01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:27.440]   But the, uh, yeah.
[01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:29.200]   Are you on here, uh, Sean?
[01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:31.600]   I'm not, but maybe I should.
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:31.920]   Oh, yeah.
[01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:32.400]   Well, whatever.
[01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:38.160]   Yeah, I, I, I have like, I don't know.
[01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:42.320]   I have a healthy respect for like the amount of processing that must be going on behind
[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:42.800]   these things.
[01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:47.840]   Um, I just, yeah.
[01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:52.080]   Well, what's funny is that, uh, oh, cool.
[01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:52.560]   Perfect.
[01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:53.280]   Someone's doing that.
[01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:56.080]   It looks like I can't really draw the way I normally draw on Teal Draw.
[01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:57.360]   You, you blobbed it somehow.
[01:05:57.360 --> 01:06:00.480]   Yeah, it's, everything's a little bit bigger.
[01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:06.000]   Um, when there's 36 people, uh, it's, it's kind of slow as well.
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:13.280]   So, uh, yeah, we, um, what's funny is that like, yeah.
[01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:19.200]   We're using the Cloudflare workers to do the, uh, the, the, the updates and the CRDTs to
[01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:26.240]   do the collaboration and, you know, all this, like whatever LCM models to, to, to, to populate
[01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:27.520]   this image or create this image.
[01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:27.920]   Yeah.
[01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:34.080]   But, um, there's also a laptop in my living room right now, uh, that is doing the actual
[01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:36.640]   screenshotting, uh, and sending that up.
[01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:41.440]   And so there's a big note that I had to write, you know, for my family to say, like, don't
[01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:45.600]   turn off this laptop, don't close this laptop because, uh, this needs to be on in order
[01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:46.480]   for this thing to work.
[01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:52.800]   Uh, and yeah, so, you know, we'll, no matter how good our tech stack gets, we'll always
[01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:59.280]   come back to, uh, some, some laptops stuck in the corner that can't possibly be turned
[01:06:59.280 --> 01:06:59.520]   off.
[01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:01.760]   Uh, it's pretty fun.
[01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:02.000]   Yeah.
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.920]   I've heard of major businesses being run that way.
[01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:05.200]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:06.960]   There's a Raspberry Pi in the closet.
[01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:11.280]   Yeah, I, you know, it's weird because it's really funny because like, you know, you,
[01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:13.120]   you are inventing your own art form.
[01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:16.800]   Uh, this is a fine art, you know, going back to your degree.
[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:26.080]   Um, it's just a definitely a, uh, you know, it's funny because like the output of this,
[01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:29.920]   like, while it is like a visual output, the output like doesn't actually matter.
[01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:33.120]   Like it's gone in 16 milliseconds and it's not coming back.
[01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:39.040]   Uh, and I think with all this AI stuff right now, just where we are with it and just how
[01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:42.960]   completely unknown it is in terms of like, where is this useful?
[01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:48.800]   Uh, like the best thing that you can get out of this is like the experience.
[01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:53.200]   Uh, and so I think of this much more as like, you know, the thing that people will walk
[01:07:53.200 --> 01:08:01.600]   away from, from playing with like lens.tiltro.com, uh, should be more of like that experience
[01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:05.840]   of, of having interacted with this thing or interacted with it, you know, among, with
[01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:11.600]   others, uh, rather than like, oh, there's, it made my favorite image or something like
[01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:12.320]   that.
[01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:20.080]   So I think the, uh, yeah, I don't know, as a, as a former image maker, like the idea
[01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:27.600]   of having, having like an aesthetic experience where the image is, uh, a major part, but
[01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:32.800]   it's, it's not necessarily like the, the important part, uh, or any one of these images
[01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:33.600]   isn't the important part.
[01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:34.160]   I don't know.
[01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:41.440]   There's, there's some, like, there's some, uh, there's something, something new feeling
[01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:42.960]   about this kind of fun.
[01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:51.440]   Certainly I wish I was, uh, could do a big critique with all the new media artists, people,
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:56.640]   um, about this and about like, what, you know, where does this, where does this fit into
[01:08:56.640 --> 01:08:59.280]   the, sort of the, uh, yeah.
[01:08:59.280 --> 01:08:59.840]   Yeah.
[01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:00.480]   Like other people.
[01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:03.760]   Well, that's, that's for them to write and, you know, for you to build.
[01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:07.840]   Uh, and I think that's a, that's a, yeah, you know, I would encourage you to keep building
[01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:11.680]   there because, uh, you're definitely not done exploring with your explorations.
[01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:13.440]   Um, thank you.
[01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:15.200]   Cool.
[01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:15.680]   Yeah.
[01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:19.520]   Well, so I can kind of round it out by sort of looking towards the future.
[01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:24.240]   Uh, you hinted a little bit, uh, you're working towards TL draw 2.0.
[01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:30.560]   Um, so first of all, actually, so, uh, it seems like you're very focused on the core
[01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:31.520]   mission of canvas.
[01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:36.400]   Um, and the AI stuff is, is a side project for now.
[01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:42.080]   Um, why, why not pursue it as like a full, why not pivot and like be an AI company?
[01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:42.160]   Right.
[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:44.800]   Like that's, yeah, I guess a lot of those questions.
[01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:46.240]   Yeah.
[01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:50.960]   I mean, when you, when you get something as viral as, as Tiltraw got, like, I think I've
[01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:59.600]   talked to everyone, um, certainly every, every investor, uh, and, um, okay.
[01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:04.800]   So I guess the way that, the way that, yes, we, we probably could on for something like
[01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:11.360]   together or that draw fast thing, uh, make a tiny little SaaS app, you know, give me
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:12.800]   $10 a month, play with this thing.
[01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:16.960]   And, uh, you know, it could make it, make it good.
[01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:18.640]   We could go in that direction.
[01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:25.760]   Um, there's not much of a moat around any of this stuff.
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:30.400]   And we're seeing that just in, you know, I don't know, Gemini is going to come out in
[01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:32.960]   a couple of days, weeks or whatever.
[01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:38.400]   Um, and if it's better than people are just going to use that until the next better thing
[01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:38.880]   comes along.
[01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:45.280]   Like, it's not, there's not a lot of like unique, uh, it's not, there's nothing really
[01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:49.760]   defensible about like, Hey, it's an, it's a drawing app plus an LCM like model, uh,
[01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:52.560]   because there's going to be a lot of those models and there's going to be a lot of drawing
[01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:53.360]   apps.
[01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:59.600]   The, the thing that I think is really unique for teal draw, the thing that we have added
[01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:04.080]   that is not easily created is the canvas itself.
[01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:13.120]   Is that like this, uh, you know, web-based, uh, hackable, extendable, uh, super refined,
[01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:16.080]   um, interactions and, and all that stuff.
[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:21.520]   Like, you know, all the thousand table stakes features that drive people nuts when building
[01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:24.400]   something like this, like they're all there, they're all good.
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:29.360]   Day one, you could build a really great experience, uh, whether it's AI driven or not, like using
[01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:34.240]   teal draw, um, in a way that it's just not practical to do if you're building it yourself.
[01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:38.000]   And especially if you're not doing like graphic stuff, there's really not that much else out
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:41.280]   there, uh, oriented towards, towards this type of thing.
[01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:47.920]   Um, and I think in a world where like these types of experiences are going to, or not
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:52.400]   these experiences, these types of AI driven capabilities are just going to keep coming
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:53.600]   out faster and faster.
[01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:58.080]   And like, you know, I don't know, next, next year is going to be wild.
[01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:02.800]   Like every month there's going to be some new, uh, you know, capability or something.
[01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:12.160]   The, the thing that I would want to see both just me as a, as a person and as me as having
[01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:20.400]   built the business that I've built, uh, is for teal draw to sort of become the, the place
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:23.280]   where some of this prompting, some of these ideas are explored.
[01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:28.080]   Um, even if we decided to, okay, we're just going to close everything up.
[01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:31.920]   We're going to build a product, but based on this, and maybe it's a great product, but
[01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:39.280]   it's, it would only be one kind of one direction, one ray kind of into this infinite space of,
[01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:40.400]   of, of possibility.
[01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:49.200]   Uh, and that, that could be successful, good, but like the idea of building the, um, I mean,
[01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:53.440]   we've built the, the sort of the direct manipulation manipulation core, but there are so many,
[01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:59.040]   even like AI specific APIs that we could build around teal draw for having, you know, like
[01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:04.560]   a virtual collaborator, uh, or, or, or working with images in a, in a more, more rich way.
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:09.680]   Like there's just so much that we could build in order to make this the best possible place
[01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:14.480]   to explore, not just one direction, but like, you know, many, many, many directions.
[01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:20.160]   Um, and I think that, that narrative gets me out of bed in the morning in a much more,
[01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:23.360]   uh, that, that gets me much more excited.
[01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:27.920]   Um, and I think we're also just like the team that we have and the, the, the tech that we
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:32.880]   have and the skills that we have, we're more of the team to build that rather than like,
[01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:37.120]   to, um, become like a SAS product, uh, company.
[01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:42.080]   I'm not saying we'll never do like a, you know, a past 10 bucks a month and we can,
[01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:43.920]   you can play with our magic toy.
[01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:53.200]   Um, but, uh, primarily my goal is to make, uh, to draw the, either the place to explore
[01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:58.480]   these different models, or you might, you might think of it as like, um, the battleground
[01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:01.920]   on which the winners will be kind of identified.
[01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:05.440]   Um, like right now we're using open AI for the make real thing.
[01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:11.840]   Um, maybe next week we'll be using a Gemini and now it's, now it's a question of, okay,
[01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:16.320]   well now we have an environment in which to compare these two models, um, with the same
[01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:19.280]   input and a very advanced form of input.
[01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:23.040]   Uh, but yeah, like, let's see which one does better now.
[01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:27.280]   Nothing would make me happier than to be at sort of like the, the, the battlefield, um,
[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:30.640]   for multimodal prompting and multimodal, uh, uh, AI experience.
[01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:38.080]   I should also shout out Baklava as I want the open source, um, vision and, uh, multimodal
[01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:38.960]   model.
[01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:45.040]   Um, yeah, I mean, like, uh, so, so I fully understand you want to, you want to own the
[01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:47.200]   light cone of multimodal prompting.
[01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:49.840]   Uh, I think that that'll probably be the title of the episode.
[01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:53.440]   Um, what's, uh, what's coming up for TealDRAW 2.0.
[01:14:53.440 --> 01:15:01.040]   So really the TealDRAW that you are using now and that I'm using are, is basically 2.0.
[01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:03.200]   It's been in pre-release for a long time.
[01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:06.880]   Uh, really the only change that's going to happen once we launch it is, uh, we're going
[01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:09.120]   to start selling commercial licenses for it.
[01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:14.640]   Uh, so if you are using TealDRAW in a commercial product or if you want to, then, um, you know,
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:20.640]   if it's, if you're funded or if you have revenue, then, you know, you'll buy a license and I'll,
[01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:24.720]   um, add you to our, our special list of customers.
[01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:29.280]   Um, so yeah, it's mostly just go to market and the necessary changes around there.
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:34.160]   There will be some kind of fun changes, secret saucy changes that, that launch, but nothing
[01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:36.160]   substantial, nothing breaking.
[01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:41.840]   Uh, we've put a lot of effort in the last, like, it's crazy that we've only had an open
[01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:43.680]   source since May of this year.
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:46.080]   Uh, this, this new version, right.
[01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:51.040]   And yeah, it's, we've been very busy since then, but it is, uh, it's stable.
[01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:51.600]   It's robust.
[01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:58.400]   We put it through, you know, a lot of usage and caught a lot of the issues.
[01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:00.160]   So it's absolutely ready to go.
[01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:06.400]   Um, but I have, uh, one or two conversations with my lawyer before we, uh, we turn, turn
[01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:08.400]   over the license and start, start moving it that way.
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:10.320]   Gotcha.
[01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:14.960]   Um, and then, uh, maybe, uh, I think if I could get your commentary, uh, before we close
[01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:20.080]   on, on, um, just the, the competition out there, like, um, uh, so you are not, you are
[01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:22.000]   not the only sort of canvas tool.
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:26.720]   I, I think I get now that I was going to ask about like Figma, FigJam, and they have some
[01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:28.640]   AI thing that they're also doing.
[01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:30.960]   Adobe is also working on similar things.
[01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:34.000]   Canvas also working on similar things, but they're all individual point solutions.
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:39.920]   Whereas you're more of the open source, uh, uh, canvas to power all of them.
[01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:42.560]   Um, yeah, I feel like it's just Excalidraw.
[01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:46.480]   That's like the other alternative, uh, that remains.
[01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:50.160]   I think Excalidraw, and I like Excalidraw a lot.
[01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:54.000]   I, I contributed there and, you know, we, we retweet each other and tease each other
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:54.880]   on Twitter and stuff.
[01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:59.760]   And, uh, early on I was copying features from them.
[01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:01.680]   Now they're copying features from me.
[01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:10.800]   So I, uh, but no, it's, uh, it's like the collaboration space is so, has so many dominant
[01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:18.240]   players like, um, that I, uh, I think me and Excalidraw are tiny within that.
[01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:22.720]   Um, yeah, well, I, I, there's two things.
[01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:31.360]   One is that we made this very strange bet on using a kind of a web canvas that our canvas
[01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:34.800]   is not like an HTML element or HTML canvas element.
[01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:37.520]   It's like normal React components all the way down.
[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:42.480]   So if you wanted to add something interactive and have that participate in the sort of space
[01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:48.880]   of the canvas, uh, the way that we were doing our, our, um, iframes and kind of like being
[01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:52.880]   able to write on top of an iframe, you can't do that in Excalidraw.
[01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:54.560]   You can't do that anywhere.
[01:17:54.560 --> 01:18:01.040]   Um, that is like a very strange tech choice that we made around, uh, Tealdraw that is,
[01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:04.080]   you know, finding its home in, uh, in a few different ways.
[01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:10.080]   Most of the people who pick Tealdraw and approach me like the inbound that I get are folks for
[01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:14.480]   whom that's like the killer feature, um, to be able to, to put interactive widgets on
[01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:17.120]   the canvas using just React.
[01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:25.200]   Uh, the, yeah, I, I was kind of repeat the same point that you, you, you kind of suggested,
[01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:32.960]   which has said like, no matter how good Figma's, uh, like AI solution is, and I hope it's great
[01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:34.720]   because I love Figma and I use it.
[01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:38.960]   Um, it's not going to solve every possible problem in this space.
[01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:43.360]   It's not even going to like touch, you know, like, like you can't like none of these things.
[01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:49.680]   And I mean, I already had identified like, okay, uh, there was a point where like any
[01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:53.440]   Kanban board was like, uh, uh, was Trello, right?
[01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:56.480]   When you, when you talked about Kanban boards, you were talking about Trello.
[01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:59.360]   Kanban boards are in every productivity app now.
[01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:02.400]   Uh, I think the same thing is going to happen with collaborative whiteboards.
[01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:03.360]   It's like people like them.
[01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:05.440]   Uh, I'm making it easy.
[01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:10.480]   Uh, people are already doing it even without Tealdraw when it's hard.
[01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:14.960]   Like, uh, like, yeah, that's going to become a kind of a commodity user experience and
[01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:15.920]   a lot of different products.
[01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:22.480]   Um, probably, you know, give me a diagram from a text prompt.
[01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:25.600]   Like, yeah, that is probably going to be a commodity too.
[01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:26.960]   Give me an image from a text prompt.
[01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:28.320]   Like, yeah, that's just going to be everywhere.
[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:32.240]   We're just going to assume that that's, you know, it's like adding a gift to a, to a chat
[01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:34.400]   or something that there's no moat there.
[01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:40.880]   Um, I do hope that Figma has an amazing AI integration, but I think the thing that it
[01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:42.800]   will help you do is use Figma.
[01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:51.280]   Um, like, like generating an image won't be super useful, but like generating it, uh,
[01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:56.560]   extended and autocomplete this, uh, this, uh, design absolutely would be.
[01:19:56.560 --> 01:19:59.520]   And, and I hope that they launch something amazing there.
[01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:05.920]   Uh, but yeah, there's, uh, I, like I said, there's just a million different directions
[01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:06.960]   that this stuff could go in.
[01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:11.840]   Uh, the canvas is just like a input device.
[01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:15.040]   It's, it allows a certain type of user experience.
[01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:17.680]   Um, and that's certainly not limited to design.
[01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:19.040]   That's not limited to whiteboarding.
[01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:21.280]   It's not limited to collaboration or anything like that.
[01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:27.520]   So, um, yeah, my hope is that there are those like kind of 10,000 products that, that could
[01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:29.440]   be made with what we're making.
[01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:31.680]   Uh, yeah.
[01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:31.840]   Yeah.
[01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:34.400]   That's, that's a really, uh, great mission.
[01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:36.400]   And, uh, I, I see why you're so passionate about it.
[01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:37.600]   You're the right team for it.
[01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:38.560]   Um, okay.
[01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:41.520]   Uh, uh, you know, a couple of lightning round questions.
[01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:48.800]   Um, uh, one, which is like, if you had some AI capability that you would wish for that
[01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:50.400]   you don't have yet, what would it be?
[01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:52.880]   Oh, that's a really good question.
[01:20:52.880 --> 01:21:04.240]   Uh, helps people to do some research, I think probably related to, it's not quite a CRM,
[01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:08.240]   but like a human, uh, just normal relationship management.
[01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:14.160]   Um, this is something that I've never had a problem with until, uh, until I had a startup
[01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:17.680]   actually, where there's just a lot more people involved in my life.
[01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:21.600]   And it's, uh, um, it's hard to keep up with them all.
[01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:26.000]   And I think this is probably something that like an EA like kind of does of saying like,
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.400]   Hey, there's a birthday coming up or something like that.
[01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:33.440]   Um, but also just, you know, identifying opportunities to, to work together, uh, to,
[01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:38.160]   to connect or, you know, who's an expert on this thing that I'm working on.
[01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:40.080]   Like that doesn't always occur to me.
[01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:45.200]   Um, and I think there could be, I don't know.
[01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:51.760]   I think the, the, the value of your network, um, that even if you're good at that, you're
[01:21:51.760 --> 01:21:56.960]   probably only scratching the surface of like, you know, how, how you could be helping the
[01:21:56.960 --> 01:22:01.120]   people around you and how they could be helping you based on like the specific context of
[01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:04.320]   like what you're working on and the problems on your table today.
[01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:05.920]   Yeah.
[01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:10.480]   I've also wanted to build a CRM on top of Twitter, uh, because you have all the info
[01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:14.880]   there, but what people are working on your past conversations with each other, um, and
[01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:18.480]   your shared interests, you know, like it should be able to search, you should be like a bare
[01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:22.880]   minimum to search it, but to proactively suggest is, uh, the next layer.
[01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:30.160]   Um, and I guess AI chief of staff, AI executive assistant, you know, something like that.
[01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:30.720]   Yeah.
[01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:30.960]   Yeah.
[01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:31.440]   Yeah.
[01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:36.560]   Um, I think like some people are working on that, but the problem is so big that they're,
[01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:39.200]   they're working on like the automation piece.
[01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:44.080]   So like Lindy, I had at my conference, um, where they're, they're like, it's, it's, it's
[01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:49.040]   a virtual assistant that you can trigger on your desktop or via email.
[01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:53.120]   Um, and it's, it mostly deals with scheduling, um, but also it helps you do a little bit
[01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:54.160]   of research.
[01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:57.760]   Um, so that, yeah, I think the agents field will progress there.
[01:22:57.760 --> 01:22:58.960]   We might take 10 years to do it.
[01:22:58.960 --> 01:23:01.680]   Yeah, I can wait.
[01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:02.160]   It's all good.
[01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:07.040]   And then, and then finally, um, uh, invite your founders, like what, what has helped
[01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:10.720]   you the most, uh, as, as a founder, you know, you're two years into your journey.
[01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:12.560]   Yeah.
[01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:21.040]   I think the, uh, so this, this kind of comes a little bit out of, uh, like what you learn
[01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:23.040]   in art school, uh, type of thing.
[01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:30.800]   Um, but yeah, uh, but one thing is that, that basically like when you're a studio artist
[01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:33.520]   or you're in a studio or whatever, there's no external constraints.
[01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:36.880]   You just kind of are running on, well, what do I feel like working on?
[01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:41.360]   Uh, and the further you get away from like, what do I feel like working on kind of like
[01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:43.040]   the worse your work becomes.
[01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:48.960]   So having like a really good, uh, feeling for that sort of desire and being able to
[01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:55.840]   respect and follow that, that desire as like, uh, um, because it's not arbitrary.
[01:23:55.840 --> 01:24:03.360]   Is that like, if, if you really, really feel like working on, um, uh, on, on a thing, like
[01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:11.280]   it, that might be the sort of the, the tip of a very complex, uh, iceberg of analysis
[01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:16.400]   of like the field or like what people are talking about or, or something, uh, that you,
[01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:18.720]   directions and market or something like that.
[01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:25.040]   Like, I don't know, I think with, with Tealdraw and with, as, as a founder on this, um, the
[01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:31.200]   thing that I've tried to do and I've tried to preserve is like the, uh, being able to
[01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:33.920]   prioritize based on like, what is most interesting right now.
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:39.600]   Uh, and that is, that is true for, uh, what code we write and like what features we work
[01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:40.240]   on.
[01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:44.240]   That's true for like which partners we, you know, we spend time with in terms of who's
[01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:50.240]   using Tealdraw, uh, the types of problems that we want to solve, like using your own
[01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:55.840]   sort of sense of what's interesting as a filter, uh, and what you want to work on, like what
[01:24:55.840 --> 01:25:00.560]   sounds like a fun thing to work on right now as a filter is not, it's not naive.
[01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:04.480]   Um, and it can be kind of part of your, your secret sauce.
[01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:10.000]   And I think it's, uh, I think a lot of early founders are encouraged against that and to,
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:13.120]   to be working backwards from a certain outcome and all that.
[01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:15.440]   Um, and yeah, you, you do have to have to do that.
[01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:21.680]   You have to put that into the, um, into the mix as well, but, um, you know, be sure that
[01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:24.960]   you're, you're picking the best parts, um, out of that mix.
[01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:26.320]   I don't know the parts that you want to work on.
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:28.080]   Yeah.
[01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:32.000]   Well, I mean, what's the point of doing this if you don't have, uh, have some fun, indulge
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:32.720]   in curiosity.
[01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:35.920]   The worst case you'll, you'll build something that you love.
[01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:38.240]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:39.200]   Good things can come out.
[01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:45.040]   Good things can absolutely come out of like, uh, you had an 8,000% increase in your followers
[01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:45.440]   or something.
[01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:48.720]   Should I put this on camera?
[01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:49.760]   I'll, I'll share my screen.
[01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:51.440]   We'll look at my, uh, my Twitter analytics.
[01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:52.320]   It's on your sub stack.
[01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:52.820]   Yeah.
[01:25:52.820 --> 01:25:54.480]   Oh yeah, it is.
[01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:55.200]   It is.
[01:25:55.200 --> 01:25:56.240]   I need to update that image.
[01:25:56.240 --> 01:25:57.760]   I've done it once already.
[01:25:57.760 --> 01:26:02.880]   Uh, yeah, if you, if you're a, if you're a sub stack reader, the teal draw sub stack 72
[01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:09.680]   hours into this big make real virality explosion, I, I sat down and wrote a blog post and I,
[01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:14.640]   uh, I wanted to at least capture that, that vibe, um, of what it felt like in the middle
[01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:16.320]   of that, that hurricane.
[01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:18.240]   Uh, yeah, so it's, it's a pretty fun one.
[01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:19.920]   It's good to read back.
[01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:25.360]   Uh, well, I'm sure it's not the last time we'll see you do something crazy viral.
[01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:27.840]   Uh, I'm sure that a lot of people will be exploring to draw.
[01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:32.640]   I hope a lot of people, honestly, um, one thing I'm thinking about is like embedding
[01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:35.120]   tail draw into my, my input box.
[01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:39.680]   Like why can't, I can't see our job be like, you know, part of the, the input.
[01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:43.440]   Hey, I'm, I'm talking to, uh, the, the good folks over at open AI tomorrow.
[01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:45.200]   Fingers crossed.
[01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:49.600]   Maybe we, uh, maybe we get it in, inside of a chat GPT or something.
