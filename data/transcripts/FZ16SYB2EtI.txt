[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.760]   How do I lead someone to Christ?
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:08.760]   I love this question.
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:09.760]   It's so good.
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.360]   It comes from a listener named Brooke.
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.160]   "Pastor John, hello.
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.400]   For our online church services during the coronavirus season, I volunteer to reach
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.560]   out to people who have contacted us to let us know that they want to trust in Christ.
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.640]   Yet I don't really know how to do this.
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.160]   I've grown up seeing people walk through a written prayer, but I wrestle with the doctrine
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.720]   behind the idea that you can simply pray this prayer and you're good.
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.680]   When someone says they're ready to accept Christ, how do you lead them?"
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.680]   Great question.
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:42.680]   Great question.
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:43.680]   It is.
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:51.520]   Oh, that every Christian was ready and eager to declare the good news and to lead people
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.400]   into saving faith.
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.400]   So thanks for the question.
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:03.080]   It's very good for John Piper to go back and rehearse the basics of the gospel and the
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:09.920]   practicalities of a phone call like this or a Zoom chat or sitting across the table six
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.480]   feet apart maybe to share the gospel.
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.600]   It's helpful to have a simple plan.
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.040]   If we were all God, we wouldn't need to have a simple plan.
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.880]   We could just overflow spontaneously.
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:23.880]   We're not God.
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:31.040]   The picture I would like to use for my simple plan is that we all need four treasure chests.
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.160]   And I call them treasure chests because they're just packed with more than we could share
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.160]   at any given time.
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.160]   And that's good.
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.640]   We don't need to share everything in every treasure chest all the time.
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.800]   The reason I choose the term treasure chest is because Jesus said, "Bumping into the
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.080]   kingdom and being ready to walk into the kingdom and be saved is like a man who stumbles across
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.760]   a treasure chest hidden in a field."
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:02:01.880]   So our job as shepherds that lead new sheep into the fold is to unpack treasures.
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.840]   So before I give you my four treasure chests that you put in front of you on the table
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:14.000]   when you're talking or on the phone table, maybe the first thing I would say to a person—a
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.680]   total stranger—say that I've just called up to follow up would be something like this.
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:28.320]   I am so excited because you are about to enter into the hardest and happiest way of life
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.720]   that there is.
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.960]   Now they might be puzzled by that statement, and it might issue in a little conversation,
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.240]   but I think it strikes a very crucial balance.
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.660]   Hard and happy, hard and happy.
[00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.920]   You could explain from Psalm 37, 4, it's a happy way.
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.280]   Delight yourself in the Lord.
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.600]   The Lord is worthy of our joy.
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.340]   He wants us to be happy in him.
[00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.760]   In his presence is fullness of joy.
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.760]   At his right hand are pleasures forevermore, Psalm 16, 11.
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:07.040]   And from Matthew 16, 24, you might explain that Jesus said, "If anyone would come after
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:14.200]   me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me."
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.880]   You might say a few words about taking up the cross is not a vacation.
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.040]   It's where you die.
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.600]   It's where you suffer.
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:32.100]   In other words, you will say to them, "Jesus will lead you through some very hard things.
[00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.960]   Through many tribulations, we must enter the kingdom," Acts 14, 22.
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:42.680]   The reason for starting that way is the double truth, and they're both so crucial, is that
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.400]   the gospel is spectacularly good news.
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.360]   I mean, it's good news.
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.680]   News, news, news, really good, good, good news.
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.800]   The best news in the world.
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.560]   And we need to strike that note loud and clear.
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.520]   I am about to tell you the best news in the world.
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:09.320]   And Jesus said, Luke 14, 28 to 33, "Be sure to count the cost.
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.840]   You don't want to go out against an army that you can't beat, and you don't want to build
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.880]   a tower you can't finish.
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:22.900]   You need to tell everybody this involves total devotion to Jesus Christ who was crucified."
[00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:30.060]   So that's one possible way of starting the conversation, happy and hard.
[00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:35.880]   And you can follow up maybe later with lots more about what that means, because I think
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.800]   so many people are drawn into the Christian life with some naive prosperity notion that
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.880]   things are going to get better for them when in fact they might get worse in many ways,
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.400]   even though the joy is going to go down deeper than they ever imagined.
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:58.080]   Then I would begin to unpack my four treasure chests of biblical truth.
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:04.920]   There are four great realities that you need to know in order to be saved by Jesus Christ,
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:05.960]   and that's what you want.
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:12.640]   You want to close with Christ, receive Christ, believe Christ, engage with Christ, have Christ,
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.080]   and there are four things you need to know.
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:21.760]   And you can name your four chests with four words, and here's the basic simple plan—God,
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.200]   sin, Christ, faith.
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.880]   I've remembered those for decades.
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:31.940]   Oh, how they have served me so well—God, sin, Christ, faith.
[00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:38.180]   Those are my four chests of truth, and I call them treasure chests because every chest has
[00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:44.820]   dozens of passages of Scripture and dozens of ways to talk about God and sin and Christ
[00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:45.820]   and faith.
[00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.820]   And I don't want to give the impression that there's a one-size-fits-all presentation
[00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.220]   of the gospel.
[00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.220]   You have four chests.
[00:05:53.220 --> 00:06:00.280]   They're full of Bible truth, and our job is to trust the Spirit to guide us and then
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:08.780]   take out of each chest one or two Scriptures to show those riches to your new friend.
[00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.040]   So let's just walk through them real quick.
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.720]   Treasure chest number one, truth about God.
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.720]   Everything starts with God.
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.380]   Everything starts with the greatness of God, the glory of God.
[00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:25.560]   You might start with His holiness or His justice, because what we need to clarify here in this
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:30.720]   first treasure chest is that everything else is not going to make any sense if we don't
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:36.720]   have some sense of who God is and what He's like and how sin, which we're going to talk
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.920]   about in treasure chest number two, how sin is against God.
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:44.260]   It's not just against people, and we can't do that if we don't know who God is.
[00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:49.920]   So I like to start with God's glory, because Paul's going to define sin out of treasure
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.500]   chest number two as a falling short of God's glory.
[00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:59.760]   So I would like to say to my friend Isaiah 43,6, "Bring my sons from afar, my daughters
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:05.680]   from the ends of the earth, everyone whom I called by my name, I created for my glory."
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:12.720]   And I would say to them, "You were created, you exist to glorify God, to make God look
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.360]   glorious.
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:19.600]   You were created to show God's glory, His greatness, His beauty, His worth.
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.400]   That's our duty."
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:26.280]   First Corinthians 10, 31, "Whether you eat or drink, whatever you do, do all to the glory
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.280]   of God."
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.760]   That's treasure chest number one.
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:37.560]   Treasure chest number two, sin, truth about sin, namely, all of us have failed to live
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:38.820]   for the glory of God.
[00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:41.200]   You have, I have, everybody has.
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:48.000]   Romans 3, 23, "All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God," which I think means
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.840]   Romans 1, 23, "We have exchanged the glory of God for images."
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.680]   All of us have preferred other things to God.
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:59.600]   And so we've made the glory of God look worthless.
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:06.240]   We've dishonored God in so many ways, which means we've chosen the way of death.
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:12.760]   Romans 6, 23, "The wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.560]   Christ Jesus our Lord."
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:18.060]   And sin isn't just things we do, it's the way we are.
[00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:25.200]   We are by nature, Paul said, Ephesians 2, 3, "Children of wrath like the rest of mankind."
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.840]   None of us escapes this condition.
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:31.240]   None of us escapes the penalty of death and judgment and hell.
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:37.880]   "Whoever," Jesus said, John 3, 36, "does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:40.660]   wrath of God remains on him."
[00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:46.160]   So without salvation, we're all sinful by nature and we're all under God's wrath.
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.920]   That's treasure chest number two.
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:53.060]   Here's treasure chest number three, truth about Christ.
[00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:57.600]   The saying is trustworthy, deserving of full acceptance.
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:02.460]   Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.
[00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:04.520]   That's why this phone call is happening.
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:11.020]   First Timothy 1, 15, "Everything up till now is designed to make Christ and his way of
[00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:17.820]   salvation appear as great and beautiful and wonderful as it really is.
[00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:27.180]   God sent his Son, his divine, eternal Son, to bear the punishment we deserve."
[00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:28.500]   This is the heart of everything.
[00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:32.420]   This is the most glorious news in the world.
[00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:37.840]   There's no way we can save ourselves from our sin and from his wrath.
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:47.220]   So here's the wonder, Romans 8, 3, "God has done what the law could not do by sending
[00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:59.040]   his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin he condemned sin in the flesh."
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.200]   God condemned sin.
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.920]   He punished sin.
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:06.720]   The death of Jesus, his Son, is our punishment.
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:13.600]   All the sins of all those who would ever be united to Christ by faith were punished in
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:14.600]   Jesus.
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:20.680]   So he says, "There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ."
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.520]   This is spectacular news.
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:27.840]   No more guilt, no more punishment, no more wrath, no more condemnation, eternal life,
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.880]   peace with God forever.
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:35.880]   Romans 6, 23, "The gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord."
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:39.880]   That's treasure chest number three, Christ.
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:43.960]   And here's the last treasure chest, truth about faith.
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:49.180]   I think it helps at every point, by the way, along the way, to make these as personal as
[00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:50.840]   possible from your own experience.
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:58.840]   I might say my favorite verse in the Bible to help explain how to receive all of this
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.720]   is Ephesians 2, 8 and 9.
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:06.540]   "By grace you have been saved through faith."
[00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:08.680]   This is not your own doing.
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:15.840]   It is the gift of God, not a result of your works, so that no one may boast.
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:20.360]   In other words, you can't work for your salvation, can't earn it.
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.920]   It's a free gift.
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:23.600]   You can't deserve it.
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.820]   It comes from God's grace or God's love.
[00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:32.360]   Just a few verses earlier, it says, "God being rich in mercy because of the great love
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:39.640]   with which he loved us even when we were dead in our trespasses made us alive together with
[00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:42.920]   Christ by grace you have been saved."
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:48.600]   That means that even your faith is a gift of God right now in this moment.
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:54.520]   If you are reaching out to take Christ, if you are ready to have him as your Savior and
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:59.080]   Lord and the treasure of your life, you are a miracle.
[00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.840]   God has made you alive.
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.760]   It's called new birth.
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:03.760]   Trust him.
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:04.760]   Speak to him.
[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:06.400]   Tell him all your heart.
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.160]   Declare your faith to him.
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.600]   Welcome him as your friend.
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:14.520]   And you might ask at this point, "Do you have any questions?"
[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:16.400]   Of course they're going to have questions.
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:19.120]   You have to decide how long you're going to talk.
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:25.400]   And you might draw things to a close either by inviting them to pray or giving them the
[00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:27.920]   option of dealing with God in private.
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:30.080]   I've done it both ways.
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:31.080]   Send them away to pray.
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:34.960]   I said, "You need to get alone with God and deal with him on the basis of everything you've
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:38.480]   heard so that I don't do any manipulating here."
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:43.640]   And I remember one wonderful night at about 11 o'clock in my office, a man was just so
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:44.640]   ready.
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:51.120]   I forgot to send him away because he was just, "Oh, I want to get this over."
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:54.260]   And oh my, it was glorious the way it got over.
[00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:55.600]   But I didn't put words in his mouth.
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:13:00.280]   I mean, I've already put a hundred words in his mouth by sharing the gospel.
[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:05.000]   You'll suggest some texts that they should read when they hang up.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.560]   Maybe some places to go in the Bible, giving them particular scriptures.
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:14.480]   You may welcome them into a discipling relationship with yourself or with somebody else your church
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.640]   has arranged or invite them to a class.
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:23.080]   You want to encourage them to think about baptism and prepare for baptism in due time.
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:28.480]   And you're going to warn them that the devil is real and will put them to the test.
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:32.520]   You're going to say, "Resist him firm in your faith," and you're going to leave them with
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:33.520]   a promise.
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:35.700]   And oh my, there's so many you could choose.
[00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:37.720]   Maybe you'll leave them like this.
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.600]   Hebrews 13.5, "I will never leave you.
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:46.880]   I will never forsake you so we can confidently say, 'The Lord is my helper.
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:48.360]   I will not fear.
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.840]   What can men do to me?'"
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:53.840]   Incredibly simple and clear and glorious outline.
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:54.840]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:59.840]   Well, on Friday, we talked to new believers about how to first approach the Bible.
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.600]   It seems like a very intimidating book.
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:05.080]   It is an intimidating book with lots of places where you could start.
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:07.320]   So how do we approach the Bible for the first time?
[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:08.320]   Come back for that.
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.200]   That episode really pairs nicely with this one.
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.840]   It's going to be on Friday.
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:13.560]   But thanks for joining us today on the podcast.
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:21.560]   For our feed, our archive, or to send us your own question, go to our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:24.520]   Up next time, we're going to talk about John chapter 6.
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:30.120]   There you'll remember that Jesus miraculously fed 5,000 hungry mouths with five loaves and
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.440]   two fish.
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:37.940]   And the next day, Jesus told that very same crowd, "Do not work for the food that perishes,
[00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:43.220]   but for the food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you."
[00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:47.640]   So the question for all of us is, well, then should we labor and work to buy bread?
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:49.000]   Should we work at all?
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.080]   Or should we just trust God to supply all of our bread needs supernaturally?
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:58.480]   The answer to this question actually sheds a lot of light on what it means to work 9
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.620]   to 5 as a Christian.
[00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:01.620]   So that's the topic.
[00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:04.400]   Up next time on Wednesday when we return, I'm Tony Reinke.
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:05.200]   We'll see you then.
