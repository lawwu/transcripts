[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.500]   I should like to call attention once more to the verse that had to be found in Paul's
[00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:12.320]   epistle to the Ephesians in chapter 5, reading from verse 25 to the end of the chapter.
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:19.120]   Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:24.900]   it, that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, that
[00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.040]   he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.640]   such thing, but that it should be holy and without blemish.
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.840]   So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies.
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:47.240]   He that loveth his wife loveth himself, for no man ever yet hated his own flesh, but nourisheth
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.160]   and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church.
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.040]   For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:02.520]   For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife,
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.640]   and they too shall be one flesh.
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.560]   This is a great mystery, but I speak concerning Christ and the church.
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:18.000]   Nevertheless, let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself, and the
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.520]   wife see that she reverence her husband.
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.680]   Now in considering this great statement, we have seen that there are two main themes.
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.680]   One is the theme of the relationship between the Lord Jesus Christ and the church, and
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.720]   the other is the relationship between the husband and the wife.
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.440]   And the apostles' teaching is that we can only truly understand the relationship of
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:49.360]   husband and wife as we understand that great doctrine of Christ and the church.
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.200]   Therefore, we have first been considering the doctrine of Christ and the church.
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.560]   And having done so, we are now in a position to begin our application of that particularly
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.560]   to the husbands.
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.960]   Though, as you notice, the apostle is careful at the end to bring in again the whole question
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.440]   from the aspect and the standpoint of the wife.
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:23.240]   Well now, the theme, of course, is that which is expressed by this "so, even so, husbands
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.280]   love your wives even as," and then at the end, "Nevertheless, let every one of you
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.800]   in particular so love his wife even as himself."
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:41.600]   In other words, he is working out this comparison which he has unfolded before us of the relationship
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.360]   of Christ to the church in terms of the relationship of the husband to the wife.
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.800]   Now as we come to the application, it seems to me the best way of doing so is to divide
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.400]   it into two main sections.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:01.440]   The first is that clearly there are certain general principles taught here with respect
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:07.560]   to husbands and their wives, and then having laid down the general principles, we can move
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:14.640]   on to the detailed practical application of the principles to the concrete situation.
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:21.360]   Now the general principles as I see them are these, that first, we must realize in connection
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:27.120]   with marriage, as indeed with everything else in the Christian life, as indeed with the
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:36.120]   whole of life, that the secret of success is to think and to understand.
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:42.640]   That is something which is surely obvious on the very surface of the passage.
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.480]   Nothing happens automatically in the Christian life.
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:52.320]   Now that to me is a very profound principle, because I believe that most of our troubles
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:58.800]   arise from the fact that we tend to assume that they do happen automatically.
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:05.400]   We will persist in holding on to that notion of regeneration, that it really means this.
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.060]   That happened, and well, the rest of the story is quite simple.
[00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.400]   They all lived happily ever afterwards.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.760]   But of course we know that that isn't true.
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.400]   There are problems in the Christian life.
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:22.060]   And it is because so many don't realize that it isn't something that works automatically,
[00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.760]   that they get into troubles and into difficulties.
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:33.640]   And the antidote to that is, of course, to think, to have understanding, and to reason
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.680]   the thing out and through.
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.720]   Now the world doesn't do that.
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.520]   That is the real trouble with the world, ultimately the whole trouble with the world is that it
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.640]   doesn't think.
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.580]   If only people thought most of the problems would be solved.
[00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.720]   Take this problem of war, for instance.
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.340]   It is something which is inherently ridiculous.
[00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.340]   It is insane.
[00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.740]   Well why do people fight, you say?
[00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.000]   Well the answer is because they don't think.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   They act instinctively.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.860]   They are governed by some primitive instincts, desire and greed and anger and so on.
[00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.060]   And they hit before they think.
[00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.900]   If only they all stopped, well there would be no more war.
[00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.460]   Now the tragedy of the humanist is, of course, that he thinks therefore that all you have
[00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.460]   to do is to tell people to think.
[00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.300]   But as long as they are sinners, they won't think.
[00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:30.900]   These elemental forces are so much stronger than the rational forces, so that man in sin
[00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.700]   is always irrational.
[00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:38.700]   Now the point I am making is that even when we become Christians, we still need to enforce
[00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.940]   this selfsame principle.
[00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.780]   The Christian even doesn't think automatically.
[00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.580]   He has got to be taught to think.
[00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.460]   Hence these New Testament epistles.
[00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.980]   Why do you think they were ever written?
[00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.820]   If a man who becomes a Christian automatically does the right things, why did the apostles
[00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.180]   ever have to write these epistles?
[00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:03.140]   Or if you can receive your sanctification as one act, one blessing, why were these epistles
[00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.140]   ever written?
[00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:09.580]   Here they are, full of reason, full of argument, full of demonstration, full of analogies and
[00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:10.580]   comparisons.
[00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:11.580]   Why?
[00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.740]   In order to teach us how to think.
[00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:20.140]   In order to teach us how to work these things out and how to have understanding.
[00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:25.140]   Now this is very essential, as the apostle shows, in connection with this whole subject
[00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:27.380]   of marriage.
[00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:30.500]   The world, of course, views marriage like this.
[00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:35.740]   It first of all takes certain great things for granted.
[00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.400]   It relies upon what it calls love.
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.180]   It relies upon feeling.
[00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:45.820]   People say they fall in love with one another, on the strength of that they get married.
[00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:47.900]   They don't stop to think and to ask questions.
[00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.300]   That's a very exceptional thing for them to do.
[00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:54.100]   They're moved and animated and carried away by this feeling.
[00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.520]   Everything's going to be all right.
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.520]   This is bound to last.
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.780]   This can never fail.
[00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:02.980]   This marvellous thing, which is idealised and lyricised, as you know, and sang about
[00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:06.380]   and dramas exalted, oh, it's so wonderful.
[00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:07.380]   It can never fail.
[00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:12.300]   And then, of course, you get your newspapers and you read your reports and you find that
[00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.160]   it does fail.
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.480]   And why does it fail?
[00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:22.940]   Well, the answer is, I say, that it fails because they've never thought the thing through.
[00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:28.460]   And therefore it cannot stand up to the tests and the stresses and the strains that must
[00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:35.400]   inevitably come, as life is lived from day to day with its weary round and its physical
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:40.000]   tiredness and all the many other things that produce difficulties.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.760]   No, it is because such people have never thought the thing through that they've got nothing
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.400]   to fall back upon.
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.680]   They've acted on a feeling, on a kind of impulse.
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.760]   They've acted immersionally.
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:56.040]   The mind doesn't come in.
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:00.360]   And as I say, when they're confronted by difficulties, they have no arguments to fall back upon.
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.360]   They don't know what to do.
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:04.500]   The whole thing seems to have gone, and so they back out of it.
[00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:09.160]   They have their divorce immediately, and then repeat the same process properly.
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.720]   Now, that is the whole cause of the trouble.
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.400]   It's an absence of understanding.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.240]   It's a lack of thought.
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:25.080]   Now, when you come to the Christian standpoint, the main difference is this, that the Christian
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:31.240]   is exalted to think and to understand so that he will have reason.
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:35.160]   That's the whole meaning, I say, of this teaching which is provided for us.
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:36.440]   We are left without excuse.
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:41.880]   Now, the world has no such teaching, but we are no longer in that position.
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:47.280]   So the first thing that we are reminded of by this paragraph is that we must think, and
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:52.720]   we are even told how to do it, and it is put before us in detail.
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.080]   There's my first principle.
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:09:01.040]   The second is this, that as Christians, our conception of marriage must be positive.
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.960]   It must always be a positive conception.
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.640]   I mean something like this.
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:13.800]   The danger is, of course, that we should think of marriage amongst Christians as just essentially
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:18.960]   marriage as it is with everybody else, the only difference being that the two people
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.920]   here happen to be Christians, whereas the others were not.
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:27.120]   Now, if that's our conception of marriage still, well, then we have considered this
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:32.000]   great paragraph entirely in vain.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.440]   Christian marriage, the Christian view of marriage, is something that is essentially
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:40.880]   different from the other, and that's the thing, surely, which must have been emerging
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.560]   as we have gone on from Sunday to Sunday.
[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:48.280]   So the position is not that here are two people getting married and there are two other people
[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:49.280]   getting married.
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.560]   What's the difference?
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:53.720]   Ah, the first two were not Christians, these two are Christians.
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:55.640]   Marriage, of course, is exactly the same.
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:57.280]   No, it isn't.
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.600]   It is essentially different.
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:09.440]   Here, we get a view of marriage which is not possible anywhere else at all.
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:16.380]   It is lifted up to this whole ideal position of the relationship between the Lord Jesus
[00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:19.880]   Christ and the Church.
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:23.960]   So that the Christian's attitude towards marriage is always this positive one.
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:28.960]   He should always be straining after this ideal.
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:34.640]   The Christian view, I say, mustn't be negative, in the sense that, well, there are certain
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:38.840]   different factors which have come in, and therefore this marriage ought to hold, whereas
[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:40.560]   the other one is not likely to do so.
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.600]   That's purely negative, then.
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.520]   It isn't merely that we avoid certain things that are true of the others.
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:51.440]   No, no, we must have this ideal, positive conception of marriage.
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:57.440]   It is something that we must always think of in terms of the relationship of the Lord
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:01.000]   Jesus Christ and the Church.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.120]   And therefore, we see that we have to go on thinking about it.
[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:10.320]   We have to go on testing ourselves constantly by asking that question, "Well, is my married
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.560]   life really corresponding to that?
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:14.760]   Is it manifesting that?
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:16.760]   Is it being governed by that?"
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:23.760]   Now, in other words, in the Christian position, you don't stop thinking about these things
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:25.360]   when you've been married a few months.
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:27.720]   You go on thinking, and you think more and more.
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.600]   And the more Christian you become, and the more you grow in grace, the more you think
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:37.440]   of your marriage, and the more you are concerned that it should conform to this heavenly pattern,
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:45.480]   to this glorious ideal of the relationship between the Lord Jesus Christ and the Church.
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.960]   This is a matter which is difficult to put into words.
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:54.000]   What I am trying to convey is this, that the great difference between the marriage of Christians
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.760]   and the marriage of non-Christians should be that in the case of the Christians, the
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:05.080]   thing becomes progressively more wonderful, more glorious, as it sees and attains to the
[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:10.120]   ideal increasingly.
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:16.040]   We all surely see the significance of that, as we apply it to what is so commonly true
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:23.440]   of marriage, not only amongst non-Christians, but alas, amongst Christians also.
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:29.280]   But here is a conception that goes on growing and developing and increasing.
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:33.800]   Then my third and last general principle is this one, and it's come out, of course, in
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:42.280]   the whole of the exposition, that the real cause of failure ultimately in marriage always
[00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:50.360]   is self, self, and the various manifestations of self.
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:56.560]   Of course, that is the cause of trouble everywhere and in every realm.
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:03.760]   Self and selfishness are the greatest disrupting forces in the world this morning.
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:08.520]   All the major problems confronting the world, whether you look at it from the standpoint
[00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:15.060]   of nations and statesmen, or from the standpoint of industry and social conditions, or whatsoever
[00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:21.760]   standpoint, all these troubles ultimately come back to self.
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:26.520]   My rights, what I want, who is he, or who is she?
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:34.120]   You see, it's self, with its hurried manifestations, that always leads to the trouble.
[00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:43.000]   And of course, it inevitably leads to trouble, because if you have two selves, well, there's
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.320]   bound to be a clash.
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:47.280]   Self always wants everything for itself.
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:51.560]   All right, that's true of me, but it's equally true of the other self.
[00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:57.200]   You've got two autonomous powers here, and each is concerned only about himself or herself,
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.920]   well, a clash is inevitable.
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:06.040]   And that is why you get clashes at every level, from two people right up to great communities
[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:11.640]   and empires and nations, and indeed, the world divided into two sections.
[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:20.120]   Now, the whole teaching here is designed to show us how to avoid the calamities that result
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:22.440]   from self.
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:28.040]   You see, that is why I was at great pains to emphasize verse 21 before we began to consider
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:29.560]   this whole question of marriage.
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:37.640]   It's the key to the entire paragraph, "Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God."
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:40.640]   That's the basic principle.
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:44.720]   That is what is to be true of all members of the Christian church, whether married or
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:52.320]   unmarried, we are all to be submitting ourselves one to the other in the fear of Christ.
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:57.000]   And then, of course, the apostle comes to apply that to this position of men and women,
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.840]   husband and wife.
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:04.840]   But in this particular section we are dealing with, he has made that, I would imagine, so
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:10.880]   plain and clear that surely no one can miss it.
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.480]   What is the essential thing about marriage?
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:16.440]   Well, he says, it's this, unity.
[00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:23.080]   These two, these twain, shall become one flesh.
[00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:26.760]   He says you must stop thinking of them as two, they are one.
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:32.080]   Therefore, any tendency to assert self immediately is breaking the fundamental conception of
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.080]   marriage.
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:37.600]   Now, you can, we can see this principle operating everywhere else, he's put it there in general
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:38.600]   in verse 21.
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:45.040]   If only we remember this in all cases where we are two separate individuals, master and
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:50.100]   servant, or parents and children, or two states, there we are to remember it.
[00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:54.440]   But here, says the apostle, there should be no question of it.
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:16:00.480]   Because here, to think of these two as two is denying the very fundamental principle
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:04.320]   of marriage, which is that they are one.
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:07.700]   These two shall be one flesh.
[00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:12.800]   The bride, the wife, is the body of the husband, even as the church is the body of Christ,
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:14.080]   and so on.
[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:23.040]   So that here we have, above everywhere else, the final denunciation of self and all its
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:31.080]   horrid assertions, and we are shown the one and only way whereby we can finally be delivered
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.080]   from that.
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:37.120]   Well now, there are three big general principles that have come out very clearly as we have
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:42.880]   been considering the doctrine of the relationship of the Lord Jesus Christ to the church.
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:51.240]   Now then, the husband is to be governed by those principles.
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:55.280]   Now how does this work itself out in practice?
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:17:02.920]   The first statement which I find is that the husband, therefore, must realize that his
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:07.720]   wife is a part of himself.
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:11.700]   Now he's got to realize that, he's got to understand that.
[00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:14.720]   He won't feel that instinctively.
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:16.960]   He's got to be taught that.
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:22.280]   And the Bible teaches him that, Old Testament and New, as we've seen.
[00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:28.760]   In other words, we have to grasp this principle, that husband and wife are not two, they're
[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:29.760]   one.
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:33.160]   And it keeps on being repeated here.
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:35.440]   So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies.
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:37.920]   He that loveth his wife loveth himself.
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:41.440]   These two shall be made one flesh.
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:44.520]   We are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.
[00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:49.280]   That's all true of our relationship to the Lord, it's true in this other relationship.
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:57.380]   Therefore, I would put it like this, that it is not sufficient even for us to regard
[00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:00.680]   our wives as partners.
[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:04.040]   They are partners, but they're more than partners.
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:08.520]   You can have two men in business who are partners, but that's not the analogy.
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:11.080]   The analogy goes higher than that.
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:14.200]   It isn't a question of partnership, though it includes that.
[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:18.280]   There is another phrase that is often used, at least used to be often used, which puts
[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:19.840]   it so much better.
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:25.720]   And it seems to me that it's an unconscious repetition of Christian teaching by large
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:27.380]   numbers of people.
[00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:29.680]   Men refer to their wives as "my better half."
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:31.820]   Now that's exactly right.
[00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:33.520]   That is precisely right.
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:37.260]   She's not a partner, she is the other half of the men.
[00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:40.920]   These twain shall be one flesh, my better half.
[00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:46.960]   Now the very word "half" puts the whole case which the Apostle elaborates here.
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.960]   You're not dealing with two units, two entities.
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:52.600]   No, no, you're dealing with two halves of one.
[00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.000]   These twain shall be one flesh.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:04.840]   Therefore, in the light of that, the husband must no longer think singly or individually.
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:11.360]   "The thing is quite impossible," says the Apostle, because here it is, "he that loveth
[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:17.560]   his wife loveth himself."
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:21.000]   He is in a sense not loving somebody else, he is loving himself.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.520]   That is the difference that marriage makes.
[00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:29.000]   So that when you come to the practical level, we put it like this.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:36.280]   All this man's thinking must include his wife also.
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:40.120]   He must never think of himself in isolation or in detachment.
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:45.320]   The moment he does that, he's broken the fundamental thing about marriage.
[00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:49.280]   There it is, you see, on the intellectual and the spiritual level.
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:51.840]   Everybody sees it when it happens on the physical level.
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:56.720]   But the real damage is done there away, back at the intellectual and the spiritual level.
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:02.600]   The moment a man thinks of himself in isolation, he's broken the marriage in a sense.
[00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:03.960]   He has no right to do that.
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:09.120]   There is a sense in which he cannot do that, because the wife is a part of himself.
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:12.160]   And if he does that, he's going to hurt the wife, there's going to be damage.
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:16.520]   It's a damage in which he himself will be involved, because she is a part of him.
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:21.920]   He is therefore acting even against himself, did he but realize it.
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:26.880]   His thinking, therefore, I say, must never be personal in the sense of individualistic.
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:32.760]   He's only the half, and what he does involves of necessity the other half.
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:36.720]   The same applies to his desires.
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:41.760]   He must never have any desires for himself alone.
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:46.800]   He's no longer one man, he's no longer free in that sense.
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:52.860]   His wife is involved in all his desires, and it is his business to see that he is conscious
[00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:53.860]   of that.
[00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:57.500]   He must always be thinking about this.
[00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:03.360]   He must never think of his wife, in other words, as an addition.
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:10.120]   Still less, I'm sorry that I have to use such an expression, as an encumbrance.
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:12.680]   But there are so many who do.
[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:16.200]   In other words, to sum it all up, you see, this is again a great indication that a man
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:18.600]   must never be selfish.
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:20.300]   Neither must a wife, of course.
[00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:24.520]   Everything applies on the other side, but here we are dealing particularly with husbands.
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:27.520]   We've already seen that the wife submits herself there, she's done that.
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:28.520]   The same thing.
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:31.740]   This is the husband's side of this.
[00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:37.560]   So that he must deliberately remind himself constantly of what is true of him in this
[00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:42.160]   married state, and it must govern and control all his thinking, all his wishing, all his
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:50.200]   desiring, indeed the totality of his life and of his activity.
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:53.280]   But now we can go further and even put this more strongly.
[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:56.600]   There it is there, he that loveth his wife loveth himself.
[00:21:56.600 --> 00:22:01.440]   But we remember that the apostle, in describing the relationship between the Lord and the
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:07.000]   church, has used the analogy of the body.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:15.240]   So he says in verse 28, first half, "So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies."
[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:21.520]   Then he elaborates it in verse 29, "For no man," he says, "ever yet hated his own flesh,
[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:27.240]   but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church."
[00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:31.440]   Well, now here is the teaching.
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:35.960]   That we not only have to realize that the husband and wife are one, but the husband
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:42.520]   must realize that the wife is actually a part of himself.
[00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:49.640]   This analogy of the body, a man's attitude, says the apostle here, to his wife should
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:54.520]   be his attitude, as it were, to his body, and this is an analogy.
[00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:57.120]   And yet it is more than an analogy.
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:02.400]   Now we have already gone into that as it is taught at the end of Genesis chapter 2, how
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:06.960]   the woman was originally taken out of the men, and there we have the proof of the fact
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:15.880]   that she is a part of the men, and that describes to us the relationship of the unity.
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:25.840]   Now the man is therefore told this, "Husbands, so ought men to love their wives as their
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:26.840]   own bodies."
[00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:34.800]   Now that little word "as" is a very important and a very vital one, because we can misunderstand
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:35.800]   it.
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:41.920]   He doesn't say this, "So ought men to love their wives in the same way as they love their
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:42.920]   bodies."
[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:43.920]   That isn't the meaning.
[00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:54.980]   The meaning is this, "So ought men to love their wives because they are their own bodies."
[00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:58.320]   A man loves his wife as his body, that's what he's saying.
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:01.000]   Not as he loves his body, so must he love his wife.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   No, no.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.560]   A man must love his wife as his body, as a part of him, as Eve was a part of Adam, as
[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:14.560]   she was taken out of his sight, so the wife is to the men still, because she is a part
[00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:17.060]   of him.
[00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:20.960]   And I'm impressing this, of course, for the reason that the apostle clearly did so, which
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:28.600]   is this, is to show that there is, in this sense, this element of indissolubility about
[00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:35.920]   marriage, which, as I understand the biblical teaching, can only be broken by adultery.
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:40.920]   But what we are concerned about here is to say this, that the apostle puts it in this
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:45.160]   form in order that a man may see that he cannot detach himself from his wife.
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:50.320]   You can't detach yourself from your body, so you can't detach yourself from your wife.
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:52.100]   She's a part of you, says the apostle.
[00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:53.880]   Now, remember that always.
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:59.000]   You cannot live in isolation, you cannot live in detachment.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.220]   So then, if you realize that, there'll be no danger of your thinking in detachment,
[00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:07.100]   no danger of your wishing and willing and desiring in detachment.
[00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:10.840]   Still less can there ever be any antagonism or hatred.
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:12.280]   You notice how he puts it.
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:18.920]   No man, he says to ridicule the thing, no man ever yet hated his own flesh, but nourisheth
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:21.280]   and cherisheth it, even as the Lord.
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:25.840]   So any element of hatred between husband and wife, well, it's sheer madness.
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:30.360]   It just shows that the man has no conception of what marriage means at all.
[00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:34.740]   No man ever hated his own flesh, but his wife is his own flesh.
[00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:35.740]   She is his body.
[00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:41.720]   He is to love his wife as his own body.
[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:44.180]   Very well.
[00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:47.760]   What does this lead to in practice?
[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:54.040]   So here I come to very detailed teaching, which is needed by everybody, Christian people
[00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:55.800]   as well as others.
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:26:01.880]   God knows we all have failed, we all have sinned, by failing to understand this teaching
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:04.880]   and then applying it in detail.
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:11.120]   The principle is that the wife is, as it were, the body of the man.
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:16.960]   As what his body is to his personality, his wife should be to him.
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:21.120]   So here, you see, is the Apostle's detailed teaching.
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:24.880]   How is a man to treat his wife?
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:27.920]   Let me give you some negatives first.
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:32.880]   He is not to abuse her.
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:37.160]   It is possible for a man to abuse his body, isn't it?
[00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:44.320]   And many men do abuse their bodies by eating too much, by drinking too much, and in various
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:46.640]   other ways.
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:54.080]   That is to abuse the body, to maltreat it, to be unkind to it.
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:27:01.600]   Now, says the Apostle, a man who does that is a fool, because if a man maltreats his
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:05.720]   body and abuses it, he himself is going to suffer.
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:09.720]   You can't detach yourself from your body.
[00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:13.200]   And if you think you can and abuse your body, you'll be the one to suffer.
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:17.780]   Your mind will suffer, your heart will suffer, the whole of your life will suffer.
[00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:21.040]   You may say, "I don't care about the body, I'm living a life of the intellect."
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:24.040]   Well, you go on doing that and you'll soon find that you won't have the intellect you
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:25.040]   once had.
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:26.840]   You won't be able to think as you did.
[00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:30.400]   You abuse your body, you are the one who's going to suffer, not only the body, you'll
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:31.400]   suffer as well.
[00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:35.440]   Well, it's exactly the same in the married relationship.
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:40.040]   If a man abuses his wife, he'll suffer as well as the wife.
[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:46.300]   But the Apostle says the thing should be unthinkable.
[00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:52.960]   And if a man does abuse his wife, there's going to be a breakdown, not only in the wife,
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:57.280]   but also in the man, and in the relationship between the two.
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:01.080]   And it is the thing that is happening so commonly around and about us.
[00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:06.800]   I needn't stay with this, surely.
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:13.400]   It should be unthinkable that a Christian man should abuse his wife.
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:16.080]   But let me come to something else.
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:23.480]   Not only should he not abuse her in the second place, he shouldn't neglect her.
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:29.120]   Coming back again to the analogy of the body, you see, a man can neglect his body.
[00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:31.480]   It often happens.
[00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:33.960]   And again, it always leads to trouble.
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:37.640]   Instead of abusing the body, neglect of the body is a bad thing.
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:39.080]   It is a foolish thing.
[00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:40.760]   It is a wrong thing.
[00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:45.200]   Man has been so constituted that he is body, mind, and spirit, and the three things are
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:47.120]   in relationship to one another.
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:50.200]   God knows we are well aware of this, the frailty of the body.
[00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:53.440]   If I've got laryngitis, I can't preach, though I may want to.
[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:58.960]   I may be brimful of ideas and of a desire, but if my throat is bad, I can't speak.
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:28:59.960]   And it's so with the whole of the body.
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:04.120]   If you neglect the body, you will suffer for it.
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:05.200]   Many a man has done that.
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:07.240]   Many a scholar has done that.
[00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:10.000]   And through neglect of body, his work has had to suffer.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   Why?
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:16.720]   Well, because of this essential unity between these parts of our personality.
[00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:24.760]   Now, it's exactly the same in this married relationship, says the apostle.
[00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:31.200]   How much trouble, I wonder, is caused in the realm of marriage simply because of neglect?
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:36.640]   Why during this very last week, you probably read evidence in the paper, medical men have
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:42.960]   reported that large numbers of wives today have been driven to excessive chain smoking.
[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:43.960]   Why?
[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:47.120]   Simply because they've been neglected by their husbands.
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:51.680]   The husbands spend their nights out at sports, or in their public house, or playing games
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:56.320]   with their men friends, and the poor wife is just left at home with the children and
[00:29:56.320 --> 00:30:01.880]   the work, and the husband just comes home a night in time just to go to bed and to sleep,
[00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:04.360]   and gets up and goes out in the morning.
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:08.800]   Neglect of the wife is leading to these nervous conditions that are manifesting themselves
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:13.440]   in this excessive smoking and things of that kind.
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:20.160]   It's a terrible thing that a man should get married and then proceed to neglect his wife.
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:24.240]   In other words, here is a man who's got married but who still, in essential matters, goes
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:27.960]   on living as if he were still a bachelor.
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:30.720]   He's still living his own detached life.
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:33.200]   He still spends his time with his men friends.
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:40.400]   Now, I could elaborate this very easily, but I take it that it is unnecessary.
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:45.280]   But I have a feeling that I detect a tendency, even in Christian circles and even in evangelical
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:50.840]   circles, to forget this particular point.
[00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:54.840]   A man no longer acts as if he were a single man.
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:31:01.920]   His wife should be involved in everything.
[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:06.640]   Only this last week I received an invitation to a social occasion, if you please, from
[00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:13.600]   an evangelical organization, a social occasion, but the invitation was addressed to me only
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:19.920]   and not to my wife, I automatically refused it, and I always do.
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:23.960]   But you see, there is an evangelical organization that clearly isn't thinking clearly about
[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:24.960]   these matters.
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:29.760]   I venture to lay it down that a Christian man should not accept an invitation on a social
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:34.080]   occasion without his wife.
[00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:39.240]   There is irreparable damage done to marriages because men meet alone in their clubs without
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:40.240]   their wives.
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:41.240]   I think it's wrong.
[00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:43.920]   I think it's a denial of this principle.
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:45.280]   Men and wives should do things together.
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:49.440]   Of course, the man in his business has to be alone, and there are certain other occasions
[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:54.160]   when he has to be alone, but if it's a social occasion, I say, if it is something into which
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:59.680]   the wife shall come, can come, she should come, and it is the business of the husband
[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:02.440]   to see to it that she does come.
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:08.280]   And therefore I suggest to all Christian husbands that they automatically refuse every invitation
[00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:13.160]   which comes to them alone and does not include their wives.
[00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:19.400]   But there is another aspect of this that at times causes me grave concern.
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:26.720]   I am constantly hearing of what has sometimes been called evangelical widows.
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:27.720]   What does that mean?
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:29.760]   It means this.
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:33.840]   It means that the husband of that particular type of woman is a man who is out somewhere
[00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:36.640]   or another every night at some meeting or other.
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:41.960]   Of course, he says he is doing such a lot of good Christian work, but he seems to forget
[00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:43.760]   that he is a married man.
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:50.480]   Now, there is another extreme I know of, the sort of man who does nothing, but who just,
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:53.760]   in indolence and laziness, spends all his time at home.
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:55.400]   Both extremes are wrong, always.
[00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:58.280]   I am condemning this particular extreme at the moment.
[00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:01.320]   The men who are so busy with Christian work, I have known cases of this.
[00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:06.160]   I was told of one only about a fortnight ago in the north of England of a man who was out
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:09.200]   speaking at meetings, organizing this and that every night.
[00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:13.280]   The men told me that he had been intending to do the same thing, but that suddenly he
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:18.280]   had been arrested when he had met the wife of this particular man about whom everybody
[00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:19.280]   was talking.
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:23.720]   He said, "The poor little woman looked like a slave.
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:31.080]   She looked exhausted and weary and tired and neglected and unhappy and ill in her heart."
[00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:36.520]   Now, that is a terrible sin, though it is done in the name of active Christian work.
[00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:41.200]   A man cannot contract out of his married relationship like this.
[00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:47.560]   The wife is in the relationship of the body, I say, and therefore Christian husbands must
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:49.920]   examine themselves in this matter.
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:53.160]   The home is not a mere dormitory where a man goes home to sleep.
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:54.160]   No, no.
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:58.560]   There is this active, ideal, positive thing, and we must never be holding it in the forefront
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:33:59.560]   of our minds.
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:04.640]   A man, therefore, must seek wisdom from God to know how to divide himself up in this respect.
[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:06.340]   But I care not what a man is.
[00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:11.680]   If he is a married man, he must not behave as a single man, even in connection with Christian
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:17.920]   work, because he is denying the very teaching of the gospel which he claims to be preaching.
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:24.360]   There can be untold selfishness just at that point, which is inevitably, I feel, always
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:27.440]   the result of nothing worse than thoughtlessness.
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:30.840]   But thoughtlessness always leads to selfishness.
[00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:36.920]   So I move on to my third principle, which is this, my third practical outworking.
[00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:40.760]   The husband, I say, must not abuse his wife, he must not neglect his wife.
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:45.800]   Thirdly, he must not even take her for granted.
[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:47.960]   The positive notion must always be there.
[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:53.240]   A man's wife is not just his housekeeper.
[00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:55.160]   There is this positive element.
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:56.760]   Very well, then, how can I bring it out?
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:35:00.240]   Well, let me take the Apostle's own terms.
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:03.480]   He puts it like this, "So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies.
[00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:05.800]   He that loveth his wife loveth himself.
[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:09.000]   No man ever yet hated his own flesh, but what?
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.660]   Well, nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the Church."
[00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:17.640]   You remember when we looked at that, we were amazed and staggered at the way in which the
[00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:19.640]   Lord nourishes and cherishes us.
[00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:25.360]   Yes, but that's the way a husband has got to behave towards his wife, nourisheth and
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:27.680]   cherisheth.
[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:32.400]   Now you can't do this again without thinking, you see, as you have to do this with your
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:33.400]   body.
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:38.240]   The analogy is a man doesn't hate his own body, but he nourishes his body, he cherishes
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:39.240]   his body.
[00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:40.240]   How does he do it?
[00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:42.440]   Well, let's divide it up simply like this.
[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:45.440]   First of all, the question of diet, food.
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:49.320]   A man has got to think about his diet, about his food.
[00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:53.760]   He's got to take sufficient nourishment, he's got to take it regularly and so on.
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:58.560]   Now, work out all that in terms of husband and wife.
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:04.640]   The man should be thinking of what will help his wife, what will strengthen his wife.
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:10.520]   And you and I, as we take our food, we don't only think in terms of calories or protein,
[00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:11.520]   fat and carbohydrate.
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:14.080]   We're not purely scientific, are we?
[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:16.480]   Another element comes into this question of food.
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:18.280]   What do I like?
[00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:19.860]   What appeals to my palate?
[00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:22.200]   What gives me pleasure?
[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:26.160]   So ought the husband to treat his wife.
[00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:30.240]   He should be thinking of what pleases her, what gives her pleasure, what she likes, what
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:31.240]   she enjoys.
[00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:35.920]   Of course, before he got married he was doing nothing else, but then he gets married and
[00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:36.920]   he stops doing it.
[00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:37.920]   Isn't that the difficulty?
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:42.080]   "Very well," says the apostle, "you don't stop, you go on thinking.
[00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:45.920]   And as you're a Christian you make yourself think, and it becomes more and more, not less
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:46.920]   and less."
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:49.800]   That's his argument.
[00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:53.120]   Are we not all condemned this morning?
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:37:00.080]   But this is the apostolic teaching, the New Testament teaching, diet, considering our
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:03.720]   whole personality and her soul.
[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:09.840]   There has got to be this active thought about the development of the wife and her life in
[00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:14.840]   this amazing relationship which God himself has ordained.
[00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:17.720]   Secondly, the question of exercise.
[00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:23.880]   The analogy is the body, you see, food, then exercise.
[00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:26.120]   Exercise to the body is essential.
[00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:30.040]   Exercise is essential in the married relationship.
[00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:31.040]   What does that mean?
[00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:35.280]   Well, you know, it can mean a simpler thing as this, just talking.
[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:43.860]   "Alas, I've known trouble in marriages so often simply because of an absence of talk."
[00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:50.320]   Oh, we all know how much there is to be said of a man's tired, he's been in his work or
[00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:54.840]   his office all day and he comes home weary and tired, yes, but the same thing is all
[00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:58.720]   true about his wife.
[00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:03.840]   Whether we feel like it or not, we must talk.
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:06.880]   The wife needs exercise in this sense.
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:09.760]   Tell her about your business, about your worries, about her affairs.
[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:10.760]   Bring her into it.
[00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:11.760]   She is your body.
[00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:12.760]   She is a part of you.
[00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:17.800]   Allow her to speak concerning it, consult her, let her bring her understanding to bear.
[00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:18.800]   She is a part of your life.
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:21.040]   Bring her into the whole of your life.
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:22.240]   Make yourself talk.
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:24.280]   In other words, one has to think.
[00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:29.800]   I am saying once more that I know all the excuses and how difficult it often is, but
[00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:31.520]   let me put it to you like this.
[00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:35.280]   I think it's a fair argument.
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:41.480]   This man was equally tired and working equally hard before he got married.
[00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:45.540]   But in the days before marriage, whatever he'd been doing, he was most anxious to talk
[00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:47.660]   to his wife and to bring her into everything.
[00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:50.120]   Why should that stop when they get married?
[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:51.800]   It shouldn't, says the apostle.
[00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:52.800]   The wife is one.
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:53.800]   Look at her as your body.
[00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:57.680]   Well, therefore, remember this element of exercise.
[00:38:57.680 --> 00:39:01.280]   Bring her into your life deliberately.
[00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:04.040]   It will be wonderful for her, for her development.
[00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:09.080]   It will also be good for you yourself, because the whole marriage will grow and develop as
[00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:10.360]   you do so.
[00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:16.120]   And that brings me to my third point, which is the element of protection.
[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:17.120]   Here is this body.
[00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:18.120]   It needs food.
[00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:19.120]   It needs exercise.
[00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:24.880]   Yes, but every man has got to learn to understand his own body.
[00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:27.040]   And the apostle works out the argument.
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:29.040]   You notice that Peter puts it like this.
[00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:34.040]   He tells the man to remember that his wife is the weaker vessel.
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:35.040]   What does that mean?
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:36.040]   Well, it means this.
[00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:38.880]   These bodies of ours are subject to certain things.
[00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:42.720]   We are all different, you see, even in a physical sense.
[00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:47.320]   And some of us are subject, perhaps, to colds or to chills, as it doesn't seem to worry
[00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:48.320]   the other men.
[00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:52.640]   But some of us are so constituted that we have these minor differences, and we are subject
[00:39:52.640 --> 00:40:00.560]   to these odd infections and colds and these various things that come to try us.
[00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:02.200]   Now, what does a wise man do?
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:05.920]   Well, he takes care about that.
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:08.640]   He puts on a heavy overcoat in winter.
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:10.440]   He may put on a scarf.
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:12.320]   He doesn't do certain things.
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:17.900]   He is protecting himself and his weak constitution against some of these hazards that come to
[00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:20.280]   meet us in life.
[00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:25.520]   So ought men to love their wives.
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:31.520]   Have you discovered that your wife has got some peculiar temperamental weakness?
[00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:36.200]   Have you discovered that she has got certain characteristics, and are you just irritated
[00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:39.140]   by them, and are you just annoyed by them?
[00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:41.880]   Is she nervous and apprehensive, or is she too outspoken?
[00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:44.400]   It doesn't matter which it is, nor on which side.
[00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:48.400]   She has certain characteristics which, in a sense, are weaknesses.
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:49.800]   What is your reaction to them?
[00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:50.800]   Are you irritated?
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:51.800]   Are you annoyed?
[00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:54.120]   Do you tend to condemn them and to dismiss them?
[00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:58.480]   "Do what you do with your body," says the Apostle, "protect her against them,
[00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:01.840]   help her to overcome them, guard her against them."
[00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:06.760]   If your wife is given like this, to this worrying temperament, well, save her from them, protect
[00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:08.600]   her.
[00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:15.560]   Do everything you can to safeguard the weaknesses and the infirmities and the frailties.
[00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:17.640]   As you do it for your body, do it for your wife.
[00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:23.400]   Then, of course, there are great infections that come, waves of influenza, fevers, things
[00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:26.600]   that kill people by the thousand.
[00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:35.040]   And they come in the married life, trials, troubles, tribulations, problems, which are
[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:40.540]   going to test to the very limit and to the uttermost.
[00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:42.160]   And what do we do about these?
[00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:47.000]   Well, what do you do with your body when you get this kind of illness?
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.240]   When you get this attack of influenza with a raging temperature, what do you do?
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:54.280]   Well, you put yourself to bed.
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:57.200]   And you take your hot water bottle and you give yourself the appropriate diet.
[00:41:57.200 --> 00:42:00.880]   You do everything you can to treat the fever, this acute thing.
[00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:05.660]   So ought men to love their wives, even as their own bodies.
[00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:11.680]   If there is some peculiar, exceptional trial or anxiety or problem or something that is
[00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:17.360]   testing to the uttermost limit, then I say the husband is to go out of his way.
[00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:24.480]   In order to protect his wife and help her and aid her, she is the weaker vessel.
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:30.520]   And that includes my last point, which was illness.
[00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:35.840]   You try to protect your body against infections, you have your inoculations, well, apply all
[00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:37.560]   that in the married state.
[00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:42.720]   Do everything you can to build up the resistance, to prepare your wife to face the hazards of
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:43.720]   life.
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:45.260]   You've got to build her up, don't you?
[00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:48.880]   Do everything as it were, but build her up so that she will be able to also, so that
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:51.440]   if you're taken away by death, she's not left stranded.
[00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:56.080]   We've got to think these things out, think them ahead, build up the resistance.
[00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:59.800]   And if the illness comes, oh, take extra care.
[00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:05.720]   Give the appropriate medicaments, go out of your way to do these extra things, which will
[00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:10.320]   produce a restoration of health and vigor and of happiness.
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:13.680]   Well, there, I'm afraid we've got to leave it for this morning.
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:19.680]   But there is the one big principle at Interet that I was anxious to deal with.
[00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:26.080]   A man is to love his wife even as, because she is his own body.
[00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:33.000]   No man ever yet had his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:37.240]   Even as the Lord, the body.
[00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:44.960]   Husbands love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church.
[00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:46.520]   Amen.
[00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:50.440]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
