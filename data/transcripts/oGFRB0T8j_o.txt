[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   (audience applauds)
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.560]   You're gonna get Paul Merriman,
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.960]   because Paul Merriman is here, and I'm excited about that.
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.280]   He's a nationally recognized authority
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.520]   on mutual funds, index investing, and asset allocation.
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.780]   He retired in 2012 from Merriman Wealth Management,
[00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.920]   which he founded in 1983,
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.720]   and basically dedicated himself at that point
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.240]   to just educating as many people as he possibly could
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.280]   for free about financial literacy.
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.840]   He's the author of eight books.
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.360]   He writes a regular column for MarketWatch,
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.460]   and produces a multi-award-winning weekly podcast,
[00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.720]   Sound Investing, and he's got over 30,000 subscribers
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.520]   to his twice-monthly newsletter.
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.480]   More recently, he has made a massive donation
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.000]   to boosting financial literacy at a university in his state.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.560]   So thank you for that, Paul, and congratulations on that.
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.240]   - I really am excited to be here.
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.400]   This is on my bucket list.
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.840]   Some people want to go to other parts of the world
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.200]   when they retire.
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.000]   I've been waiting to be here for 10 years.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.040]   So I am, I, yeah. (audience applauds)
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.780]   It's really, it's very exciting,
[00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.300]   and I am not here, really, to debate Rick Ferry.
[00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.740]   I really am here to share some information
[00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.840]   that I think could help you make more money
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.840]   with your portfolios, nothing more than that.
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.000]   We are simply a nonprofit organization
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.120]   feeding people information that we hope
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.880]   will help them understand ways to combine
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.880]   different kinds of equity asset classes.
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.320]   We are not investment advisors.
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.960]   We are not financial planners.
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.920]   We are teachers, and that is all we are.
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.240]   So as your teacher for a few minutes here today,
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.880]   I want to make the case for small-cap value
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.480]   as a factor in your portfolio,
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.400]   and I want to make it based on information that I trust,
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.160]   and I mention that because I ran into a gentleman last night,
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.400]   a friend from many, many years ago.
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.640]   He doesn't believe in small-cap value.
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.880]   It was not Rick. (audience laughs)
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.920]   And I wanted to know why,
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.560]   because there's so much great information.
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.520]   He doesn't trust the path, the returns,
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.200]   or the studies that have been done,
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.040]   and we are in a faith-based industry, like it or not,
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.520]   and since that's the way it is,
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.800]   if he doesn't trust those numbers,
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.300]   then I understand that he shouldn't be using small-cap value.
[00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.540]   I use numbers that I'll share with you,
[00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.420]   many more than many people like,
[00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.860]   that make me trust it, that come from people
[00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.700]   that I trust have developed the numbers from the past
[00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.680]   that I can recommend, in a sense, to other people.
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.680]   So let me talk about the truth of small-cap value,
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.520]   the good, the bad, and the ugly, and let me tell you,
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.800]   the ugly is about as ugly as it can get,
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.820]   and if a person's not ready for that ugliness,
[00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.280]   then they shouldn't be in it,
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.600]   and by the way, that could be true
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.480]   of the stock market as well.
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.840]   It all starts with this simple table
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.400]   that shows the long-term return
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.200]   for the four major U.S. equity asset classes.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.780]   I started making this table in 1995,
[00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.680]   and every year, we update it,
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.080]   and what it shows is that large-cap blend,
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.080]   or the S&P 500, is compounded at about 9.8%,
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.280]   large-cap value higher, small-cap blend higher,
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.640]   small-cap value at 13.2.
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.760]   Now, what's fascinating to me is
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.840]   a lot of people don't trust that 13.2,
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.160]   because if you trusted it,
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.160]   wouldn't you wanna have some of it
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.680]   if it didn't take your risk over the top,
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.880]   which, of course, is the big question.
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.880]   So, if we could believe that short-term bonds
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.560]   make less than intermediate bonds, or long-term bonds,
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.560]   or governments make less than corporate,
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.760]   or junk bonds make more than high-grade,
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.260]   if we could believe all of those things,
[00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.700]   why is this such a big leap of faith?
[00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.960]   So, I'm going with what I'm seeing here,
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.600]   and I want some of that 13.2.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.000]   I want it for my portfolio,
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.980]   and I've got a brand-new granddaughter.
[00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.200]   We gave her money last November when she was born,
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.560]   half in S&P 500, half in small-cap value
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.960]   for the rest of her life.
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.880]   And if you wanna know why half in S&P 500,
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.040]   I don't have time.
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:55.120]   This is one of the greatest teaching tools I've ever seen.
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.160]   Daryl Balls is our director of analytics,
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:04.400]   total volunteer, as is Chris Patterson,
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.360]   who also works with me on this project.
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.240]   What this shows is the rate of return.
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.560]   I know it's too small.
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.280]   Many of you don't have your computers,
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.400]   but let me just tell you what it shows.
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.320]   One year at a time since 1928,
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.040]   how did the S&P 500 do?
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.400]   How did small-cap value do?
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.400]   How did large-cap value do?
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.440]   How did all of the major asset classes do?
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.800]   And he color-coded them for us.
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.300]   So, when you get home and you pull up the PDF on this,
[00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.800]   you can look at these,
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.440]   and you're gonna be able to look at 90-plus years of returns
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.080]   and see how wild and crazy it is.
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.200]   I mean, there's nothing low-risk about the S&P 500.
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.800]   It's at the top, it's at the bottom.
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.520]   I mean, it's all over the place.
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.120]   So is small-cap value.
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.780]   And so, one of the things this does,
[00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.680]   because the green is the S&P 500,
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.320]   by the way, the green is supposed to give us
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.360]   the lowest rate of return.
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.180]   Why?
[00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.080]   Because it's the highest quality of the four.
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.320]   But Daryl surprised me.
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.280]   He's always got a surprise in a new table.
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.880]   He threw in the four-fund strategy.
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.680]   What would happen if you put those four asset classes,
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.400]   including the small-cap value,
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.160]   if you put them together in one portfolio,
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.520]   and you rebalanced them every year?
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.920]   How much more risky would that be than the S&P 500?
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.960]   That is the pink.
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.420]   And where is the pink?
[00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:32.880]   The pink is in the middle.
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.340]   Why is it in the middle?
[00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.800]   Because it picks up some of the value of all four,
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.080]   but it's never the best and it's never the worst.
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.860]   So if you had a portfolio that was 25% small-cap value,
[00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:49.860]   that's a lot, and 75% these other three assets,
[00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.520]   and you were running around the middle all the time,
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.160]   if the rate of return was better than the S&P 500,
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.680]   would it not be a better investment?
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.560]   Anybody vote for yes?
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.120]   Not enough.
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.680]   So then a couple years later, he does another table,
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.600]   but this time, and I'm just giving you the results,
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.480]   so you'll see why I think this is so powerful.
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.240]   Here, what we have at the top,
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:20.720]   we have U.S. small-cap value, 13.4%
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.560]   over that whole period of time.
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.280]   At the bottom, we have the S&P 500.
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.520]   I want you to notice something here.
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.920]   Those two are normally at the top or at the bottom
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.860]   because the other three are combinations
[00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:37.000]   of these major asset classes.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.660]   What I love is the S&P 500 is 10.2.
[00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:44.060]   The two-fund strategy that my granddaughter
[00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:48.860]   is going to retire on is 12.2.
[00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:52.820]   Every half a percent would mean at least
[00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:56.620]   a couple million more dollars to her, that difference.
[00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.980]   And so I think that's a slam dunk
[00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:02.280]   because that too, it doesn't end up at the top,
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:03.700]   it doesn't end up at the bottom.
[00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:07.620]   The two-fund strategy, that's what we're looking for.
[00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:11.260]   Less volatility, better returns.
[00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:12.480]   I call that Ben Felix.
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:15.180]   I think one of the finest educators,
[00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:16.460]   could we agree on that?
[00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:22.380]   Ben Felix is the finest, one of the finest educators,
[00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:24.780]   I'm talking about YouTube pieces, on investing.
[00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:26.620]   How many follow Ben out of curiosity?
[00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:29.860]   Yes, and I just think he does a marvelous job.
[00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:34.320]   I called Ben, I said, "Ben, I've gotta face Rick.
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.140]   "Give me something I could bring here
[00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.820]   "that Rick isn't prepared for."
[00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:43.180]   And he gave me something that's just marvelous.
[00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:45.940]   He gave me a study he was working on that showed,
[00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:49.020]   remember the lost decade from 2000 to 2009?
[00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:50.040]   That was a big surprise.
[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.420]   That kind of stuff doesn't happen very often.
[00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:54.140]   He went back to 1927.
[00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:59.140]   He looked at every 120 month consecutively
[00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:01.100]   to call those all decades.
[00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:05.700]   He found out that there were 145 lost decades
[00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:09.560]   for the S&P 500 over that period of time.
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.660]   So lost decades are not uncommon.
[00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.860]   And by the way, there's a lot of repeats there
[00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:16.580]   because you're going one month at a time
[00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.540]   to start a new period of time.
[00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:20.700]   But here's what I like.
[00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:25.320]   Even if small cap value does not make you a lot richer,
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.860]   we do at least know this, that looking backward,
[00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:32.140]   if we looked at the 145 lost decades for the S&P 500,
[00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:37.100]   how did small cap value do for those same periods?
[00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:42.100]   And it turns out in 78, 74%, 108 of the 145,
[00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:48.640]   small cap value made money.
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:52.660]   And that if you looked at every one of those 145 decades
[00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:55.300]   that the S&P 500 on average lost 2.3,
[00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:00.660]   small cap value made 6.45.
[00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:03.420]   And I'm thinking, I mean, I can't tell you
[00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:05.880]   that every little number that was ever added up
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.740]   in all of these studies is exactly right.
[00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:09.900]   I'm a salesperson.
[00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:13.860]   We don't focus on details, right?
[00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:15.940]   The bottom line is this tells me
[00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:19.580]   there is something there worth, oh, and I love this.
[00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:25.500]   We have over 200 tables that kind of look like this.
[00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.580]   So they aren't for today, and I understand that.
[00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:30.020]   But I wanted to give you something
[00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:31.780]   that where you'd have a piece of paper,
[00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:36.020]   you could compare small cap value in the S&P 500.
[00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:37.900]   You could look at it one year at a time.
[00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:41.380]   You could look at it all small cap, all S&P,
[00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:44.580]   50, 50, 40, 60, 60, 40, 80, 20, you got it?
[00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:49.580]   Every combination here, all those years going from 1970,
[00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:54.960]   I'm sorry, yeah, 1970s through 2022,
[00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:57.660]   and we can find out how did they each do.
[00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:00.980]   And then we could even pretend we invested in them.
[00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:03.140]   And here's what I like.
[00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:06.840]   I mean, this really, I think, is mind-bending.
[00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:11.640]   By adding 10%, on the far left, we have the S&P 500.
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:14.100]   You can't see it, it's 10.4%.
[00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:15.720]   That was the compound rate of return.
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:18.860]   The worst 12 months was a loss of 43.3.
[00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:22.500]   The worst drawdown was a loss of 51.
[00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.580]   If you were adventuresome enough
[00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:27.420]   to put 10% into that portfolio,
[00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:30.780]   instead of 10.4, you have gotten 10.8.
[00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:31.980]   Instead of, oh, well, of course,
[00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:33.600]   now you're gonna have bigger losses.
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:37.460]   Yeah, 6/10 to 1% in both cases.
[00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:40.540]   Standard deviation is still the same.
[00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:42.980]   In fact, personally, I don't mind moving
[00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:45.260]   further over to the right and saying,
[00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.100]   look, this is not taking big risk.
[00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:51.380]   This is not like cryptocurrency.
[00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:55.100]   In fact, what we're doing, if you think about it,
[00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.220]   if we add it to the S&P 500,
[00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:59.300]   we go from having 500 stocks
[00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:02.820]   to maybe having 2,000 or 1,500.
[00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:05.940]   And yeah, one by one, they aren't great quality,
[00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:09.140]   but not are all the S&P 500 companies.
[00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:15.460]   Hey, are you keeping time?
[00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:16.980]   By the way, I have no idea.
[00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:20.380]   I wanna look at it two ways,
[00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:21.880]   'cause I'm not gonna get through all the slides.
[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.940]   By the way, if you do look at the PDF
[00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:27.220]   that we provided to the folks here,
[00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:29.160]   it not only has these slides,
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:32.100]   but two nights ago, I made a 45-minute presentation
[00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:34.380]   about this to AAII.
[00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:36.460]   All the slides are in the PDF,
[00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:39.320]   and there are some killer slides I can't show you today.
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:44.800]   Here we have the S&P 500 on one side,
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.260]   small-cap value on the other.
[00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.700]   Same thing, except we put money to work.
[00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:51.900]   Starting in 1970, $1,000.
[00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:53.180]   This is something your grandkids
[00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:55.460]   or your kids need to know about.
[00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:59.340]   And you put away monthly, $83.33,
[00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:02.220]   and then every year, you up that by 3% a year
[00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:03.820]   so that you were kind of replicating
[00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:05.960]   what inflation might have been.
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:11.300]   And then what happened is you put it into the S&P 500 only.
[00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:13.380]   That's the far left-hand column.
[00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:16.180]   And at the end of that period, I don't read well,
[00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:20.460]   but I think it's around three-plus million dollars.
[00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:23.780]   Well, I do read well, but not from this distance.
[00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:25.700]   If I look at the small-cap value,
[00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:30.700]   it's a holy moly, it looks like well over 20.
[00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:33.080]   - Can you actually read that?
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.400]   - Yes, I can.
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.500]   Of course, I sleep with this, understand?
[00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:41.940]   But every time you add a 10% small-cap value,
[00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:44.900]   you can see what happens to the bottom line.
[00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:49.900]   It goes up by about $500,000 a year, I mean, per column.
[00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:54.380]   That's important, and that's good.
[00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:55.600]   But if you think that's good,
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.620]   I wanna talk to any fire movement.
[00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:00.220]   Is Brad Barrett here today by chance?
[00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:02.900]   And no fire movement people here?
[00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:06.220]   Well, let me tell you, they're standing behind you
[00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:08.380]   because they're trying to learn how to invest
[00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:10.860]   like you're investing, but they're young
[00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:14.060]   and they wanna retire at 40, 45, or 50.
[00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:18.200]   This next chart, table I'm gonna show you,
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:21.140]   instead of being a accumulation table,
[00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:23.500]   it's gonna be more aligned to what we might be thinking,
[00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:27.400]   and that is distributions in retirement.
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.340]   Now, yes, this is all equity on this page,
[00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:34.700]   but please understand that I'm having this replicate
[00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:38.660]   the equity portion of your portfolio, okay?
[00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:40.820]   So you may only have 20% in equity,
[00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:43.820]   but I want you to see what happens here.
[00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:45.820]   And what we have with the S&P 500,
[00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:48.700]   starting with a million dollars, taking out $40,000,
[00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:51.820]   increasing that by real inflation every year
[00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:53.600]   over this period of time,
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:56.380]   you would have taken out about $8.5 million
[00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:58.540]   over that 53-year period,
[00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:02.300]   and at the end of that period with the S&P 500,
[00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:04.980]   you would have been left with about $9 million.
[00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:07.340]   I do not know anybody I've ever met
[00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:11.800]   that would say that was not a good outcome.
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:14.000]   Now, it's all equity, so I'm not recommending
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.400]   we go put all of our money in equity for retirement,
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:19.800]   but that shows in the equity part.
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:23.520]   But I just wanna go one tiny step to the right
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:28.240]   and add 10% small-cap value.
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:31.660]   And when I first saw this, I actually didn't believe it.
[00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:34.520]   I said, "Daryl, there's something wrong."
[00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:35.960]   And then he went through the whole thing,
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:39.320]   line item by line item, confirmed everything was right.
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:42.360]   Instead of $9 million, it's about $25 million.
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:49.000]   Because that's that impact of that 4/10 of 1%,
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.320]   and I'll tell you what else it is,
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:53.920]   and this is why I love adding other asset classes
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:56.640]   to the S&P 500,
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:00.600]   that when we look at that period, 2000 through 2009,
[00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:05.640]   what we know is that was not good for the S&P 500.
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:09.840]   And so you actually, over that period of time,
[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:10.960]   you went from about, let's say,
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:14.520]   $6 million down to about $3.7 million.
[00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:16.800]   Over in the, let's take the 50-50,
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.960]   you were at $22 million in the beginning,
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:20.560]   and you ended at $31.
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:25.560]   How can the S&P 500 be dropping like a rock?
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:27.000]   Oh, I didn't see your fingers.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:27.840]   Mike, I've got five.
[00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:29.600]   - [Mike] We're running out of time.
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:30.440]   - Okay.
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:33.940]   Look at the table.
[00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:35.440]   (audience laughing)
[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.540]   And I am out of time, but I want you to see this,
[00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:39.080]   and look at the PDF.
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:43.500]   Here is why people can shy away from small-cap value.
[00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:45.120]   Every time you see a green area,
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.560]   small-cap value's doing well,
[00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:48.560]   but every time you see it moving sideways
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:50.360]   next to the S&P 500,
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:53.400]   it means it's not doing better than the S&P 500,
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:55.040]   which means over half of the time,
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:58.340]   you were not doing any better than the S&P 500.
[00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:03.720]   And if you're an advisor, and you're advising clients,
[00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:05.520]   and you're not doing well,
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:06.340]   and they're looking at that,
[00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:09.600]   what's that small-cap value in there for?
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:11.840]   And it's because they don't wanna hold it
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:14.140]   for 17 years to get the premium.
[00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:15.640]   It is not easy.
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:18.840]   And then I'm gonna go forward here and just show one more.
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:22.800]   And that is, Avantos did this study.
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:23.720]   We're gonna write it up.
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.260]   I think it's a beautiful study.
[00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:29.600]   Show the return of six different small-cap value indexes,
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:32.160]   six different small-cap growth indexes,
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:35.920]   six different small-cap blend indexes.
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:40.560]   And the difference between the best index over 15 years
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:44.160]   and the worst was about 2 1/2%.
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:47.840]   I mean, you could be in growth or small-cap or core,
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:52.280]   small in an index, and simply be in the wrong index,
[00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:55.160]   which it means that we need to understand
[00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:57.280]   how indexes are being constructed
[00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:59.320]   if we're gonna be an index investor.
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:04.300]   That's Boot Camp on our website.
[00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:06.460]   That's me teaching classes.
[00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:07.920]   These are free books.
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:08.920]   My time is up.
[00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:10.600]   Thank you, Jim, and thank you all.
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:13.760]   (audience applauding)
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:16.340]   (upbeat music)
[00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:26.340]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
