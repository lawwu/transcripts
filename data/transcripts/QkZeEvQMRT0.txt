[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.760]   I have a lot of people coming my way
[00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:03.200]   and they're freaking out.
[00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.920]   I'm not getting any deep sleep.
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.240]   I'm not getting any REM, et cetera.
[00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.440]   Usually the application nowadays is that we're tracking
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.520]   with some sort of element of a sleep tracker.
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.560]   The problem is, is that this is the least accurate data
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.960]   on our wearables.
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.200]   It's using its own algorithm within each wearable
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.800]   to make its best guess on, are you in deep sleep?
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.720]   Are you in REM?
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:27.760]   Are you in light sleep?
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.760]   And the problem is, is that because it's that best guess,
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.480]   if the algorithm is changed,
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.440]   your results with your sleep staging
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.360]   is going to be markedly shifted.
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.040]   So my big message for people, if they are tracking,
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.040]   is one, to not get too crazed about the REM deep sleep
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.720]   and your light sleep.
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.560]   Instead, you can look from a trends perspective
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.240]   within each wearable.
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.560]   You can start to notice particular trends
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.040]   and see are there patterns that you can help support
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.360]   based on those trends.
