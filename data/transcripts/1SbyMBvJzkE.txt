[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120]   probably the modern human lineage leading to the great majority of the ancestors of people today
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:11.040]   was in sub-Saharan Africa for the last 500,000 years at least, and maybe much more. Certainly
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.960]   our main lineage was in Africa probably 3 million, 5 million, 7 million years ago. But in a period
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.640]   between about 2 million to 500,000 years ago, I think it's not at all clear where the main
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.920]   ancestors leading to modern humans were. There were humans throughout many parts of Eurasia and
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:35.440]   throughout many parts of Africa with a parallel increase in brain size and not obviously closer
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.880]   ancestrality to modern humans in one place than in the other. It's not clear where the main
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.760]   lineages were. Maybe they were in both places and mixed to form the lineages that gave rise
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.000]   to people today. So I think there's been an assumption where Africa has been at the center
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.880]   of everything for many, many millions of years. And certainly it's been absolutely central at
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:00.720]   many periods in human history. But in this key period when modern humans developed from Homo
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.840]   habilis and Homo erectus all the way to Homo heidelbergensis and the shared ancestor of
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.840]   Neanderthals, modern humans, and Denisovans, that time period, which is when a lot of important
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.600]   change happens, it's not clear as I understand it based on the archaeology and also certainly
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.160]   based on the genetics where that occurred. The evidence that our lineage was mostly in
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.840]   Africa is based on an idea, I think, an assumption, a kind of inertial idea that
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.120]   our lineage must have always been in Africa because Africa is the center of human history.
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.840]   But if you look at the archaeological evidence, it's not incredibly clear. And if you look at
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.360]   the genetic evidence, we have many early branches from Eurasia and only one from Africa and
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:52.240]   complexity and branching in Eurasia that's sampled in the DNA record. DNA from Denisovans, DNA from
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.120]   unknown archaic lineages that contributed to Denisovans, Neanderthals, and all of those are
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.200]   represented in the Eurasian record, not in the African record. Part of that is the fact that
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.440]   ancient DNA is preserved in Eurasia. But maybe actually there's a period when our lineage resides
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.120]   in Eurasia. It's not obviously wrong. So I think that hypothesis is out there as a possibility.
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.560]   The simplest model would be one in which an extension of the modern human substructure
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.520]   leading to us, the ones that some of those lineages coalesce to form people living today,
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.200]   the great majority of the ancestors, gets into the Near East several hundred thousand years ago,
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.920]   and then mixes there with the ancestors of what we have now sequenced as Neanderthals,
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.920]   and the skeletons that we have now are Neanderthals, and that that gene flow event
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.440]   occurs there. And it's modern humans from Africa or the part of the African population that extends
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.120]   into the Near East, pushing into Neanderthals at that time. We have evidence of modern human
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.720]   incursions since that time into Neanderthal parts of Western Eurasia, also in intermediate periods
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:01.040]   from the skeletal record, and maybe even claims recently in the DNA data. But certainly the
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.720]   genetic data attest to a very strong event a few hundred thousand years ago.
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.880]   So basically the whole world, even hundreds of thousands of years ago,
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.040]   can be thought of as having gene flow and being one global population.
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.880]   I think that's almost certainly true. We don't yet know the frequency of exchange
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.760]   between Africa and Eurasia, but this is 2 million years. It's a lot of time. You know,
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.720]   Paul Salopek is like walking around the planet in like seven years or something like this. People
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:33.120]   move incredibly quickly. And Africa and Eurasia are not really separated by barriers that mean
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:39.200]   anything very important to a species like ours over periods of even dozens or hundreds or thousands
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:45.280]   of years. So the idea that being in Eurasia or Africa is such a profound barrier that you would
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.080]   not expect people to move from one region to the other in periods of tens of thousands of years or
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:56.400]   hundreds of thousands of years, that's a strange idea. What we need is DNA from Africa. So we need
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.560]   old DNA from 50,000 years ago, 100,000 years ago, 200,000 years ago from all over Africa,
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.200]   because it's super clear that our lineage is complicated within Africa. There's archaic
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:13.200]   forms in the archaeological record, and modern human data is extremely substructured with evidence
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.720]   of having come together from many different lineages, which must have been different archaic
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.920]   forms in Africa, contributing to people living today. So having that would crack our understanding
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.320]   of how modern human lineages braided together and relate to the other archaic lineages we
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.960]   have data from.
