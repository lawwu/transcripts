[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   that portion of scripture which we read at the beginning in the Book of the Acts of the
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:22.880]   Apostles, chapter 19, and reading again, verses 13 to 16, verses 13 to 16, in the 19th chapter
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:30.840]   of the Book of the Acts of the Apostles. "Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:38.840]   upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying,
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:47.760]   We adjure thee by Jesus, whom Paul preacheth. And there were seven sons of one Siva, a Jew,
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.760]   and chief of the priests, which did so. And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:03.480]   know, and Paul I am acquainted with; but who are ye? And the men in whom the evil spirit
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.200]   was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:16.360]   out of the house naked and wounded." I read those verses in particular, but naturally
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:22.720]   I am anxious to consider with you the entire incident as it is reported to us in these
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.960]   verses, in this 19th chapter of the Book of the Acts of the Apostles. Now this particular
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.760]   incident is, I take it everybody will agree with me, one of the most extraordinary, one
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:41.160]   of the most curious of the many incidents which are recorded in the history of the early
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:48.320]   church in this book, and in the ministries of the various servants of God who figure
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:57.440]   here. It is in every way, I say, a most remarkable incident, and one as I hope to show you which
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:03.000]   is full of instruction and of profit to us, every one of us gathered together in this
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   house of God this evening. Now one thing about this incident which makes it of great value
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.200]   and makes it very easy for us to follow it is, that it is a picture which presents us
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:26.960]   with a contrast. The contrast is of course between the failure of these sons of Siva,
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:33.040]   and the phenomenal success of the apostle Paul. Because what we read of him is this
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:39.520]   in verse 11, "And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul," indeed it was as
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:46.360]   remarkable as this as verse 12 tells us, "so that from his body were brought into the sick
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:55.400]   handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:02.440]   out of them." Now there is our basic contrast therefore, the lamentable and pathetic failure
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:08.520]   of these Jewish exorcists. These were people, you remember, who had the kind of power to
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.400]   deal with certain cases of devil and demon possession, people who had evil spirits in
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:19.880]   them. They were able to cast out certain types of devils and deal therefore and heal certain
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:26.200]   cases of this type. They were known as Jewish exorcists because they were Jews, and because
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:33.560]   they had this power to exorcise or to drive out certain evil spirits from those who were
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.680]   possessed. Well now there I say on the one hand is the failure of these and the phenomenal
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:46.920]   success on the other hand of the apostle Paul, the minister of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:54.480]   Christ. But the contrast is not only given us thus explicitly and in words, it is also
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:07.840]   of course implicit in this disastrous failure of these sons of Siva. Now this I say is a
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:14.800]   record, a history, and it is one that has a great deal to say to us at this present
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:23.120]   time. It has a great deal to say to the Christian church as a whole, and it has a great deal
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:32.560]   also to say to many individuals about their relationship to Christianity. What I mean
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:42.320]   is this. Don't you see here in this picture about the sons of Siva, a far too accurate
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:48.560]   picture of the Christian church speaking generally at the present time. Here you see these men
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.480]   were confronted by this problem, these men who were possessed of devils, or at least
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:59.680]   had one powerful devil within them. And their problem was what they attempted and they said
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:07.080]   to do was to drive out this devil from these men and to heal him. There I see a picture
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:13.440]   of the Christian church confronting this world in which we are living tonight. The ills of
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:21.560]   society, the problems with which we are increasingly being made familiar—juvenile delinquency,
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:29.400]   breakdown of marriage and home life, theft and robbery and violence, conflict, confusion,
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:36.120]   international problems, racial problems—the world is full of problems. There it is, devil-possessed
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:43.400]   evil. And here is the Christian church trying to deal with the problem, trying to cast out
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:48.800]   this evil. So you see it has a great deal to say to the church in general, but at the
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:56.280]   same time it has the same lesson to teach to many an individual. There are many people
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:04.520]   in the world tonight dealing with the problem of their own life. They are unhappy, they
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:12.200]   are ill at ease, they are conscious of failure, they are mastered by some particular sin.
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:18.240]   It gets them down, they are failing. They are in chains, they are slaves to it, they
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:26.560]   are dominated by it, as this poor man was dominated by the evil spirit that was in him.
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:31.480]   It is a perfect picture, therefore, of such people trying to deal with the problem of
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:36.560]   their own personal lives, trying to get rid of this devil that is within them. It is a
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:44.480]   picture, I say, of this quest for happiness and peace and joy and satisfaction and victory.
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.880]   So we can look at it in both ways. There is a great picture of the church in general,
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:55.640]   a picture also, I say, of many individual people, some inside the church, some outside
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:00.760]   the church, but all who have some general interest in Christianity and who by means
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:06.800]   of it are trying to get rid of this devil that is in them and trying to solve their
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:13.480]   problem. Now then, this is the tragedy, isn't it? That
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:23.640]   far too often the Christian church today rarely does resemble the sons of Siva. You know what
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:30.640]   happened to them? They said, "We adjure thee by Jesus, whom Paul preaches, to come
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:37.520]   out." But far from coming out are the men that the devil used the men to attack, at
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:44.160]   any rate, two of these sons of Siva, and not only overpowered them, but caused them to
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:50.600]   escape for their lives. In other words, the picture is one of a dismal failure. They were
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:55.680]   not successful. But not only were they not successful, but you notice the tables were
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:01.640]   turned upon them. And instead of their being able to cast out the devil, the devil attacks
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:05.840]   them and here they are on the defensive, fighting for their lives and having to escape, losing
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:09.960]   part of their clothing, and you see them vanishing outside with the men possessed running after
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:19.040]   them. I'm not here to pass judgments, but I wish
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:25.280]   that I didn't feel quite as unhappy as I do about the Christian church speaking generally.
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:31.920]   Is the Christian church dealing with a problem of evil in the world? Is she successful at
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:38.280]   the present time? Who would like to claim that she is? Indeed, isn't this unfortunately
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:44.280]   the true picture? The church seems to be on the defensive. It's the world who is on the
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:48.520]   aggressive, and the church is painfully and weakly trying to defend herself and her doctrine
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:52.400]   and retreating all along the line. You hear it in the debates about the doctrines of the
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:56.320]   Christian faith and other things on the wireless and on your television. The church on the
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:02.240]   defensive, the church being laughed at. The enemy is successful and the church is retreating
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:08.240]   painfully and pathetically, and in the end looking almost ridiculous. So that the vast
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:13.880]   majority of sophisticated people today, when they even hear of the church, just smile.
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:17.000]   And if you should happen to tell them that you spend your Sunday evening by going to
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   a place of worship, well really, they do feel that you're an object of pity and of compassion.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.040]   The church is feebly, weakly failing and retreating, and the enemy seems to be successful and the
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:36.140]   church is disappearing as it were, going out through the door. The statistics prove that.
[00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:42.120]   The power seems to be on the other side, and the church seems weak and ineffective and
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:48.080]   powerless. But it's not only true of the church, isn't that equally true of so many
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:55.800]   in their personal lives? Do you know anything about victory in your life? Are you afraid
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:10:03.760]   of life? Are you afraid of death? Are you afraid of tomorrow? How are you standing up
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:08.280]   to the problem of life and living as it comes to you from the outside and as it comes to
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:14.640]   you from inside? What of all these powers that are within you? Are you mastering them?
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:20.800]   Are you getting a victory? What about jealousy and envy, lust and passion, and all these
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:25.560]   various other things? Isn't it true to say that there are so many who, while using the
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:31.420]   Christian terminology, present pictures of failure and of defeat, and rather give the
[00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:37.600]   impression that the Christian faith is something which, far from helping a man to solve his
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:42.800]   problem, seems to increase the problem and the burden? Very well, there is the picture
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:48.680]   that is presented here, and what we must do this evening is to analyze this. Why is this?
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:53.960]   Why did the Sons of Siva fail? Why were they discomfited and defeated, and have to beat
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:59.420]   their hasty retreat? Why is it that the church in general is failing today? Why is it that
[00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:04.960]   individuals know the same failure? Well, we've nothing to do but to analyze what the record
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:10.640]   tells us. We can divide it very simply like this. We look at the Sons of Siva and listen
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:15.000]   to what we are told about them, and we'll soon understand the reasons for their failure.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:21.720]   Then we look at the Apostle Paul, and we remind ourselves of what is true about him, and we
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:28.040]   shall have no difficulty in understanding the secret of his great, his remarkable, his
[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:36.760]   phenomenal success. What is it? Very well, let's look first at the Sons of Siva. Some
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:40.600]   of these different versions seem to indicate that the seven were not present, it was just
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:44.280]   two of them. It doesn't matter at all whether they were two or seven. At any rate, they
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:50.680]   were two of them at a minimum. The Sons of Siva. What was the matter, I say, with these
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:56.760]   people? What was the cause of their failure, their discomfiture, their being made to look
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:04.440]   ridiculous as they beat their hasty retreat half-clad? There can be no question at all
[00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:13.320]   as to the answer to that question. Their main trouble, indubitably, was this, that they
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:21.800]   had nothing but a second-hand belief. What was true of them is the thing that is true
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:27.040]   of so much of the Christian Church today, and of so many individuals, particularly those,
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:32.120]   if I may say so, who have been brought up in the realm of the Christian Church, but
[00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:38.320]   who know nothing about the power of the Gospel and whose lives are failures. I say it's nothing
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:42.320]   but a second-hand belief. Look at it, listen to these people. "Certain of the vagabond
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:47.680]   Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits, the name of the
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:57.520]   Lord Jesus," saying, but listen to what they said, "We are juried by Jesus whom Paul preaches."
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:02.600]   Second-hand, you see. They couldn't do it directly. They have to put it in terms of
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:11.200]   the Jesus that Paul preaches. This was their position. They'd been hearing about this phenomenal
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:14.560]   success of this man, and they said, "Well, what's it due to? He seems to have succeeded
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:18.880]   in cases where we had failed. What's his secret?" "Oh, well," they say, "you go and listen to
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:22.760]   him, and you'll find that he always does it in the name of this Jesus that they're always
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:27.720]   talking about." So then they try it, you see, and say, "In the name of the Jesus whom Paul
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:37.160]   preaches." Second-hand belief. This is the essential cause of their trouble. Well, now
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:46.440]   then, let us look at this, because this is surely the main cause of trouble still. Am
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:51.920]   I speaking to somebody—I know I am—who has always regarded himself or herself as
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:59.160]   a Christian? You say, "Of course I'm a Christian. I've always been a Christian. I was brought
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:03.920]   up to be a Christian." And yet you know, and you admit it, that there are other people
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:09.160]   who also call themselves Christians who seem to be very different. They seem to know what
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:13.000]   they believe and in whom they believe. They seem to have a new kind of life. They seem
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.400]   to have power in their lives, which you know nothing at all about. And you're beginning
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:22.000]   to see that there's something wrong with you, obviously. What is it? I'm suggesting it's
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:28.080]   this very thing, this second-hand belief. And indeed, I am suggesting it is the trouble
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:33.400]   speaking generally with the Christian Church as a whole tonight, and that that is why she
[00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:39.160]   is failing. I mean something like this. All these sons of Seavord got was something that
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:43.280]   they'd heard about, something that had been done by this man Paul, and something that
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:49.280]   he was saying. And there are so many like that in the Church. They've got nothing but
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:54.080]   tradition. They know the Christian Church has been going a long time. They've heard
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:58.600]   something of the history of the past, of certain great saints, certain great preachers, certain
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:03.040]   great movements of the Spirit, certain great revivals in the past. And they've heard something
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:06.680]   about this, and they've come into it. But it doesn't get any further than that. They've
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:10.640]   got nothing but tradition. They say, "But I've always been brought up to go to places
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:14.400]   of worship, always taught to say my prayer, I've always tried to read a certain amount
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:20.880]   of the Bible." So they use the name of Christ, they use the Christian terminology, they use
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:27.640]   these phrases that are used by the others. But it doesn't seem to get any further than
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:34.960]   that. This Jesus, about whom they've heard vaguely, that was the name that they invoked,
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:39.760]   in the name of this Jesus. They'd heard of Jesus, so they used the name, and there are
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:44.480]   many I say using the name in as vague a manner as that. And they've not only heard of Jesus,
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:50.880]   but to whom this Paul preaches. Oh yes, there have been the names about, they've heard of
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:55.720]   Martin Luther, and they say we are followers of Luther. Others have heard of John Knox,
[00:15:55.720 --> 00:16:00.320]   followers of Knox. Others have heard of John Wesley, we are Methodists they say. And Wesley's
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:03.960]   are great men, they've heard about these men, and they use their names, they think they're
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:11.680]   their followers. But I say so often in practice it's nothing but the use of the name as the
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:17.400]   sons of Siva used it. I wonder what Luther and Knox and Wesley and many another whom
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:21.360]   I could mention would think of such people if they met them now. Well we know what they
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:25.800]   did with such people when they met them in the days of their lives here in this world.
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:29.440]   They put them out of the church, they say don't use my name, you don't belong to me,
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:35.320]   you're not in my position. But the names are being used, in the name of Jesus which Paul
[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:43.480]   preaches. Tradition, some second-hand knowledge and belief. What's the trouble? Well I say
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:49.560]   the trouble is this. These men you see were using the name of Jesus Christ as a sort of
[00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:57.600]   incantation. They as exorcists you see they've got their phrases. All these magicians, exorcists
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:02.800]   and various people, they've got certain phrases which they repeated, much as conjurers
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:08.280]   do now. Certain phraseology and terminology that they use. And these, but now they say
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:12.520]   here's a new one for us, let's try this. In the name of Jesus whom Paul preaches, try
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:20.520]   this, an incantation. But nothing happened. And there are many I say who are doing the
[00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:27.480]   same thing still. They're simply using Christian phrases, Christian terminology. They're
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:33.200]   talking about Christ and they do, they talk about salvation, they use all these terms.
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:38.080]   But they have no idea as to what they mean by them. Go and ask them what they mean by
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:46.600]   salvation, as to how it happens. Go and ask them the meaning of the term justification
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:52.480]   or sanctification. Go and ask them to tell you what it means to be born again. They know
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:58.440]   nothing about it at all. They talk about Christian and about Christ and about these things, but
[00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:04.400]   they have no understanding, they have no definitions, they have no direct knowledge at all. Like
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:09.760]   these people, they have to put it in the name of Jesus whom somebody else preaches. They
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:14.360]   can't say in the name of Jesus in whom I believe and preach. No, no, the Jesus that
[00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:20.160]   Paul preaches, it's indirect, it's somebody else. They're riding on some vague tradition.
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:23.960]   They don't understand it, they don't know what they've got. They're repeating a phrase
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:29.960]   as if it's going to act magically because of its terminology. That was certainly the
[00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:38.400]   trouble with the sons of Saba. They had no direct knowledge of Jesus or of his faith
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:44.520]   and of his teaching, nor of his power. So they have to put it in this indirect manner.
[00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:52.760]   I ask you in the name of God, my friend, tonight, is your faith yours? Or have you just gone
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:56.280]   on repeating phrases that you were taught when you were a child? Do you know what you're
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:00.000]   talking about? Do you know what you mean? When you say, "I'm a Christian," what do
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:07.520]   you mean? What's the content of that? What does it mean to be a Christ-man, man, person,
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:12.480]   believer, follower? Do you know what it means? If you don't, you're repeating phrases like
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:16.680]   the sons of Saba. And it's not surprising that your Christian faith doesn't help you
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:20.720]   very much and doesn't make any difference between you and the man who's right outside
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:26.720]   in the world and who doesn't call himself a Christian. That was their essential trouble,
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:32.800]   indirect second-hand belief. Well now, how had they got into that position? Why should
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:41.680]   anybody ever be in this position? And the answer is, brought out very plainly, it was
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:50.120]   due to the fact that their whole approach to Christianity was entirely wrong. Now I
[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:55.760]   want to repeat that, because I'm going to prove it to you. Their whole approach was
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:20:03.440]   entirely wrong. Let me analyze it. The first mistake they made with regard to the power
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:07.960]   of Christianity was this. They thought that Christianity was something that a man can
[00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:13.360]   take up when he wants to do so. Now here's the significant and key phrase in the whole
[00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:22.800]   paragraph. "Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:29.240]   them which are evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus." They took upon them to do this.
[00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:33.040]   Exactly. And from the minute they did that, they were all wrong and couldn't be right
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:38.400]   again. They'd started along the wrong road. They took upon them. What does it mean? Well,
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:46.760]   it means this. They, as I say, kept on hearing about this Paul and his wonderful success
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:51.080]   and the cause of it and this preaching. They said, "Now this is very interesting. This
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:55.160]   is very good. This may be of value to us in our business and what we are doing." So they
[00:20:55.160 --> 00:21:01.080]   became interested in this. And then, of course, the next step was that, well, they said, "We'll
[00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:05.880]   take this up. This is rather good. You see, you hear of somebody whose life has been changed.
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:09.640]   I say, that person looks much happier than he or she used to. I'm going in for this.
[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:14.080]   I'd rather, I want to take this." So you approach the whole of Christianity in this
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:18.920]   way. Religion, what is it? Well, it's something that a man takes up. Christianity, what is
[00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:24.440]   it? Something a man goes in for. "I decided," says the man, "to be a Christian." You see
[00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:32.400]   the trouble he is doing it all. It's something that he hears about and is a bit intrigued,
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:37.440]   interested in it. And he looks on now and he examines it and, "Wow, well, yes, I'm
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:47.920]   going to take this up. I'm going in for this." They took upon themselves to use this incantation
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:56.360]   and the name of the Lord Jesus. Is your view of Christianity that it's something that
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:22:03.400]   you can take up and put down as you like? That you can look at it in entire detachment?
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:08.920]   You sit with folded arms, with your great intellect, and you're going to consider it.
[00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:13.400]   "Shall I take this up or not? Oh, well, yes, it seems a pretty good philosophy to
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:17.440]   me, this. It's all right. It does a lot of good. I'll go in for this." So you take
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:27.880]   up Christianity. You decide to go in for religion. My dear friend, if that is your position,
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:32.400]   you are not a Christian any more than the sons of Siva were. You know nothing about
[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:42.720]   it. You can't take up this. Do you know why? This is something that takes you up. And if
[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:47.520]   this hasn't taken hold of you, and you think you're taking hold of it, I say you haven't
[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:52.920]   begun to understand it. You're all wrong. And everything you say from that point forward
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:23:06.480]   is irrelevant because it's futile. Certain of the sons of Siva took upon them of God.
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:13.320]   People have so often decided to join the Christian Church. Why, it's even worse than that.
[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:17.520]   So often the decision isn't even taken by the people themselves, but by their parents.
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:24.320]   I'm a living instance of that. I was told that I had to join the Christian Church. Why?
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:27.280]   Because there'd been a conversation between the minister of the church where I was brought
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:36.000]   up and my parents. Even it was as remote as that from me. I was put into it. I was told
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.560]   that the time had now come and that I'd reached an age when I could do this and become a member
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:46.280]   and take it up. I'd never been taken hold of, and I wasn't a Christian. But I was received
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:58.280]   into the membership of the Christian Church of God. Took upon themselves. Have you been
[00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:05.960]   taken hold of? Or are you in charge this evening? Are you looking on? Are you judging and estimating
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:12.200]   and taking this and that? Are you at the center? Are you deciding? Are you the one, I say,
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:19.760]   who counts vitally? That's not Christianity. And that always leads to nothing but dismal
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:25.320]   and almost ridiculous failure. But wait a minute, let's follow it on. That was only
[00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:30.040]   the first thing. The second thing is in a sense even more important. It follows, of
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:37.480]   course, from the first. It's this. Their whole attitude to the Christian faith was
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:46.240]   entirely wrong. And this I want to show in two ways. The first was this. They regarded
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:51.200]   Christianity obviously as something which could be added on to what they'd already
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:56.760]   got and already believed. Did you notice it? Here they are. Now remember, these men are
[00:24:56.760 --> 00:25:03.800]   Jewish exorcists. These were the sons of one Siva, a Jew and chief of the priests. They
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:09.400]   were Jews. They believed the Jewish religion. They were Judaizers. I mean by that that they
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:13.760]   were brought up in Judaism. There was their position. And what to them is Christianity?
[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:17.880]   Oh, Christianity is to them something that they add on to what they've got. They hadn't
[00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:22.800]   ceased to be Jews, you see. But they added on this name of Jesus whom Paul preaches to
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:28.120]   what they'd already got and what they already believed. Now that is, I say, the basic and
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:36.040]   the essential fallacy. We can describe the position of the sons of Siva in this way.
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:45.040]   What did they got? Well, they had Judaism plus Christian terminology. And there had
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:53.520]   been no change in their basic belief or their basic position. In the name of God I want
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:59.800]   to assert this evening, and this is to me the tragedy of the days in which we live,
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:07.120]   that that unfortunately is the simple truth about so much that passes as Christianity
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:12.640]   in this and in every land at this present hour. And it is the position of thousands
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:19.000]   of people who call themselves Christians. Can I establish my point? I think I can. I
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:26.800]   do it like this. The Christian Church today is prepared to enter into what is called a
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:33.160]   Congress of World Faiths and World Religions. What does that mean? Well, it means this,
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:40.400]   you see, that you all go together, Christianity, Judaism, Mohammedanism, Confucianism, and
[00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:47.960]   so on, Buddhism, Hinduism, and you all meet together. And what do they say? Well, they
[00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:52.440]   say now every one of these has got a sort of insight into truth. And what we need is
[00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:57.320]   of course a great world religion. Yes, of course we want the Christian insight, the
[00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:01.400]   Christian emphasis, the Christian point of view, but not to the exclusion of the others.
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:08.320]   You add it to the others, and you add the others to it. A kind of eclecticism, syncretism,
[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:12.880]   an addition of all the insights and the faiths. Christianity is not something exclusive, but
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:18.040]   something that can be added to the others, exactly as the Sons of Siva added it to the
[00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:24.060]   others. Congress of World Faiths, World Religions. Yes, but you see it also when you look at
[00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:32.880]   individuals and their point of view. I'll tell you what so much of what passes as Christianity
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:43.240]   today is in reality. It is nothing but philosophy, using Christian terms and Christian terminology.
[00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:47.520]   How do they arrive at a knowledge of the truth? Not by accepting the Bible as divine revelation.
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:52.720]   Oh no, no, they read the philosophers. They get their real fundamental view of life from
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:58.000]   the philosophers, and then they just add on some of the teaching of Christ that they happen
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:05.120]   to like. But basically it's nothing but philosophy, what man thinks, what man believes, what science
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:10.800]   teaches. So out go your miracles, out goes your virgin birth, out goes the physical resurrection,
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:18.800]   out goes the atonement. What's controlling? Philosophy. Philosophy is the basis and the
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:24.240]   center, but they add on certain Christian terms and Christian terminology. It's no more
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:28.240]   than that. Then in the case of others, to put it in a slightly different form, what
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:34.240]   passes as Christianity is nothing but sheer humanism. And humanism, of course, is again
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:44.960]   a result of philosophy. The man, the good man's view of life, the altruist, the philanthropist,
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:50.120]   the man who believes in the uplift of society, in the betterment of the race, in law and
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:56.360]   order and decency, this good natural man, he's a humanist. Now I say there are so many
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:29:00.800]   who pass as Christian who are nothing but sheer humanists, but they add on certain Christian
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:05.160]   phrases and a bit of the Christian terminology. They still use the name of Christ. It's no
[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:10.240]   more than that. Take others. What is their position? Well, theirs is nothing but pure,
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:17.480]   unadulterated socialism. That's the basic thing, socialism. But they, unlike the vast
[00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:24.320]   majority of socialists, use the name of Christ and talk about the Christian church, and use
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:30.000]   certain Christian phrases and terminology. And I could go on adding to my list. Now there
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:36.760]   are some of the common ones. In other words, this is my point, the basic belief is not
[00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:42.280]   determined by Christianity, it's by something else, Jewish exorcists, Judaism, but they
[00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:47.960]   add on the Jesus whom Paul preaches. And so there are so many today, I say, who are in
[00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:54.640]   that position. Their real basic belief is what is provided by philosophy or humanism
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:30:00.800]   or socialism or any one of these isms, but they happen to put it in a Christian form
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:07.000]   and using the great Christian term. Can you prove what you're saying, sir, somebody?
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:12.440]   Unfortunately I can prove it but too easily. If you watch the public press you will find
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:17.640]   that ever and again there are various letters published in the papers protesting against
[00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:24.000]   this or that, on some social or war-like question or racialism or something like that. Now have
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.600]   a look at the names of the people who've signed the letter and you know what you'll
[00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:34.760]   find? Well, what you will most commonly of all find is this. The names will be Bertrand
[00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:41.400]   Russell, who has written a book saying why I'm not a Christian, Julian Huxley, the
[00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:48.400]   Christian, the scientific humanist who dismisses Christianity altogether, J. B. Priestley,
[00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:53.120]   the rationalist who does the same thing, J. P. Taylor, the historian, who does the same
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:31:00.760]   thing. There are the names of these deniers of the faith, these infidels, these skeptics,
[00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:06.640]   these agnostics. And then amongst them you get one or two men who are known as ministers
[00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:13.360]   of the Christian church. There's no need to argue about this, is there? The basic
[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:17.920]   belief, you see, is that which is held by the Bertrand Russells and the Huxleys and
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:23.080]   the Priestleys, otherwise they could never sign the document. The basic belief is not
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:29.000]   Christianity but it's humanism or socialism or philosophy, but you add to it the Jesus
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:37.960]   whom Paul preaches. But what matters is a man's basic belief. And when that is truly
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:43.160]   Christian these other men can't sign because they don't believe it, they deny it. But
[00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:47.520]   that is what is passing as Christianity today, isn't it? This kind of talk which these
[00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:52.000]   others can join in. And so you sometimes read in the papers that really the great fight
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.240]   for Christianity today is not being fought so much by the Christian church as by these
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:32:03.760]   men who are outside the church. That's the view of Christianity. Judaism plus Christian
[00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:10.360]   terminology. Or to put it in the second place, I put it like this. The trouble with these
[00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:15.320]   sons of Siva was that they believed that they could pick and choose and select and extract
[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:20.280]   out of the Christian faith that which suited them. Christianity, they don't believe it,
[00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:24.720]   they're not interested in it. Ah yes, but at this point it seems to be valuable and
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:29.000]   helpful so we'll take that out. We'll use it as the incantation to drive out devils.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   Reject the rest. That's why the Christian church is as she is today. That is why so
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:46.320]   many people who use the name Christian know nothing at all about its power in their daily
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:51.200]   lives. They simply take out of it what they like. They say, "Ah, the Son of Man, that's
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:54.160]   what I believe in." But they don't take the whole of that, you see. They don't take
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:57.680]   the beatitudes. They start with turning the other cheek, as if the Sermon on the Mount
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:05.200]   only said that. They pick and choose and extract and reject the deity of Christ they throw
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:13.400]   out. Virgin birth gone. Miracles, ridiculous science, makes it impossible. Atonement, nonsense.
[00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:18.400]   Resurrection, of course these things don't happen. And they approach Christianity like
[00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:22.840]   that and think they can take and pick and choose, do the same with the Bible, and still
[00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:28.520]   expect to see the results of the Christian faith. And of course they don't. That is
[00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:33.560]   the second great cause of trouble, which leads me to my third and my last point about these
[00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:42.160]   sons of Siva, which is this. They not only regard Christianity as something which they
[00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:48.480]   can take up like that and pick and choose, they think, you see, that it is something
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:55.640]   which they can use to serve their own ends. What were they interested in? Not in Christ,
[00:33:55.640 --> 00:34:00.800]   not in God, not in Christianity. In what? In their own business as exorcists. "Oh,
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:03.760]   this is something that looks as if it's going to help me. Take it up. I'm going to
[00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:12.480]   use it to suit my own ends." And that is being done today with the Christian faith.
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:17.920]   The state, the cabinet, governments, members of parliament come and appeal to the church
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:23.360]   to help them with this and that. Not a bit of it. You can't use Christianity to serve
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:29.080]   your own ends, even though you be the state. "Oh," they say, "now then, there's
[00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:33.640]   a war on and we've lost a number of dreadnoughts. Let's have a national day of prayer. Civic
[00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:40.320]   service, coronation, this or that. Use Christianity." No, no, my friend. You'll get the result
[00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:47.520]   that the sons of Siva achieved if you try that. You can't pick up Christianity and
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:51.920]   use it to suit your own ends, even though you be the state. But look at the individuals
[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:56.320]   who do this. There are many people who go to church for one reason only, and that is
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:35:01.000]   because it's a social custom. If you're at the house party, it's expected of you
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:11.360]   on Sunday morning, so you go. A part of the social round, a part of the procedure. People
[00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:21.160]   have very strange reasons for taking up Christianity and using it. Why do people go to a place
[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:28.600]   of worship, do you think? The real reason is to worship God, but people come sometimes
[00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:38.520]   to meet one another. Their idea is purely selfish. Marriage may result from this. Some
[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:45.280]   position I want may result from this. I'll be somehow bettered if I do this, so I take
[00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:52.680]   it up to suit my own ends. You know, that was the curse of the last century. When people
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:56.720]   went to the house of God because it would help them to get a job or to retain their
[00:35:56.720 --> 00:36:02.000]   job or to get some social work to do or to get an outlet for their personality, they
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:09.240]   did it solely for themselves and out of self-interest, and it's still done. On a slightly higher
[00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:16.200]   level, there are people who come to it and look to it because they would like to feel
[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:20.600]   that their sins are forgiven. They have a lurking fear of death still. They're looking
[00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:25.360]   for happiness or healing or something else, guidance. They want to know what to do, so
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:29.520]   they come to it in order that they may use it to solve their immediate problem, and they're
[00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:34.680]   interested in nothing else. There's no surrender. They're living the life of worldlings,
[00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:40.920]   but they pick out forgiveness or this or that. Their basic life is not changed and is not
[00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:47.040]   surrendered to God and to the Lord Jesus Christ. That's my analysis of the Sons of Siva.
[00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:52.240]   What does that sort of attitude to Christianity lead to? Here's the answer. Complete, absolute
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:37:00.280]   failure, ridicule, contempt, banishment. Oh, I like the way in which it's put here.
[00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:06.440]   "There were seven sons of Siva, Jew and chief of the priests, which did this thing.
[00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:13.680]   And the evil spirit answered and said to them, 'Jesus, I know. I know him and I tremble
[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:21.120]   at him.'" Paul—the translation isn't very good here—Paul, "I am acquainted
[00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:27.040]   with. I've heard of him. He atonerate means something. He is atonerate to men who achieve
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:34.040]   success. But who are you?" "And he turned upon them. And in whom the
[00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:38.280]   evil spirit was leaped on them and overcame them and prevailed against them, so that they
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:44.000]   fled out of that house naked and wounded." Listen to what the devil says. "Jesus, I
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:50.320]   know. And Paul, I'm acquainted with. But who are you?" Contemptible as you are,
[00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:57.960]   get out. And I have a terrible feeling that that is what the devil is saying to the Christian
[00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:04.200]   church today. He is laughing at her. He is ridiculing her. She is weak and ineffective.
[00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:07.960]   She is powerless. She is being attacked and she is running away. She doesn't know where
[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:16.240]   she is nor what she's got. Why is this? Well, there's only one answer.
[00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:25.080]   The devil in that man is greater than the power of any incantation. And the evil in
[00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:34.240]   the world and in the individual human heart tonight is too much for this kind of thing.
[00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:40.600]   We are not wrestling against men, against flesh and blood, but against principalities
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:46.720]   and powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness
[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:55.280]   in high places. And if you've got nothing but a bit of tradition and a second-hand belief
[00:38:55.280 --> 00:39:01.240]   and an indirect knowledge, I say it won't give you authority, it won't give you power,
[00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:07.160]   it won't give you the strength that you need. Christian terms are of no value. It's the
[00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:15.600]   power of the living Christ that counts. And I suggest that this is what we are witnessing
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:22.480]   at the present time. The Church is like the sons of Siva. The devil is laughing and triumphing.
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:26.560]   He's prevailing and ridiculing the Christian Church.
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:39.640]   Before our very eyes, that is the explanation and the analysis of the failure of the sons
[00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:52.680]   of Siva, let us turn to the apostle Paul. And oh, what a change, what a difference,
[00:39:52.680 --> 00:40:06.440]   what a contrast. Special miracles were wrought by God through the hands of Paul. What's
[00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:12.360]   the secret? What is the difference? Well, I needn't keep you because it is the exact
[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:24.800]   opposite of everything that I've been saying. The first answer is simply this. Paul never
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:32.360]   took it upon himself to do any of these things. Listen to him writing his epistles. How does
[00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:41.560]   he start them? Here, "Paul called to be an apostle." Paul. He didn't take it up.
[00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:46.200]   He didn't take it on. "Called to be an apostle." What's it mean? Well, it's
[00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:54.320]   the whole story, the great story again, of the road to Damascus. You are not looking
[00:40:54.320 --> 00:41:01.400]   at a man here who decided to take up Christianity. You are looking at a man who thought he was
[00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:07.680]   pleasing God by persecuting Christians and Christianity, and who went down breathing
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:12.120]   out threatenings and slaughter in a desire to do so. What made the difference? How did
[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:18.920]   he ever become an apostle? He tells us, "I was apprehended." He was arrested on
[00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:25.920]   the road to Damascus. He was taken hold of. He was convicted. He was humbled, humiliated,
[00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:30.960]   condemned, lying helpless on his back, crying out, "Who art thou, Lord? And what would
[00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:42.920]  est thou have me to do?" He didn't take up Christ. Christ took hold of him and dealt
[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:49.320]   with him and convicted him and converted him. Christ worked upon him. "I am what I am,"
[00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:54.760]   he says, "by the grace of God. I am done it." He didn't take it on himself. God
[00:41:54.760 --> 00:42:00.360]   apprehended and arrested him and changed him. Have you been in the hands of God? Are you
[00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:04.480]   in this building tonight because you know that God has taken hold of you? I can't
[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:09.840]   see you're a Christian unless you're aware that God has dealings with you, has had dealings
[00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:16.560]   and still has dealings with you. Have you felt the hand of God upon you, calling you?
[00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:23.240]   That's the first thing about the apostle Paul. Let me hurry to the second. Unlike these
[00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:31.400]   and others, he has a true belief. He didn't hold on to his Judaism. He was brought up
[00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:36.200]   in it and he was an expert, a Pharisee of the Pharisees, excelling over all others in
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:41.720]   his knowledge of the law. Judaism, like the sons of Sabaoth. But look at him as the apostle,
[00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:47.880]   special miracles. What does he believe now? Is it his old Judaism plus the name of Christ?
[00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:54.760]   Just a bit of it. "What things were gained to me, them I counted but loss that I might
[00:42:54.760 --> 00:43:02.840]   gain Christ." Dung and breaking. He turned his back upon it, he shed it. He is no longer
[00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:07.840]   a Pharisee, he no longer holds on to the Jews, the religion he had. He busted of it at the
[00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:18.560]   time he's left it. There is a complete change. What has he come to believe? Jesus, as the
[00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:31.640]   Son of God. Jesus, whom he persecuted as the Lord of glory. He came to believe that this
[00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:41.480]   man of Nazareth whom he despised was none other than God incarnate. So you see he writes
[00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:47.600]   about him and says, "When the fullness of the times was come, God sent forth his Son
[00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:54.200]   made of a woman, made under the law, that he might redeem them that are under the law.
[00:43:54.200 --> 00:44:01.720]   Although he was in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, nevertheless
[00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:09.800]   humbled himself, made himself of no reputation. The incarnation, the virgin birth, God coming
[00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:15.000]   down in the flesh, that's what he believed. The sons of Siva never believed it. They knew
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:21.600]   nothing about it and when they did hear they rejected it. What else did he believe in?
[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:32.640]   Oh, the atonement. He saw that he was a vile and a hopeless and a wretched sinner, but
[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:38.000]   that God had so loved him as to send his only begotten Son into the world. What for? To
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:44.040]   take his sins upon him, to bear Saul of Tarsus' sins and to be punished for them. The Son
[00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:52.360]   of God, he says, who loved me and who gave himself for me. No man ever expressed it more
[00:44:52.360 --> 00:45:02.200]   gloriously. God hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we might be made
[00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:08.880]   the righteousness of God. In him God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of my
[00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:14.480]   Lord Jesus Christ by which the world is crucified unto me and I unto the world. That's what
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:21.160]   he believed, that the sons of Siva didn't. Paul did. What else? The resurrection. None
[00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:25.800]   of the Jews believed it. They believed it was a fake and they tried to bribe the soldiers
[00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:31.960]   to say that they had faked it and so on. But Paul believes resurrection, declared to be
[00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:37.400]   the Son of God with power according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from
[00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:46.120]   the dead. Jesus, dead, risen, manifesting himself unto him on the road to Damascus as
[00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:53.240]   one born out of due time. What else? Oh, the same Jesus ascended, seated at the right hand
[00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:59.440]   of God in glory and majesty and power, waiting until his enemies be made his footstool. What
[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:04.540]   else? That he's reigning and that he will reign and then he will come in the fullness
[00:46:04.540 --> 00:46:10.200]   of the times and rout his enemies, destroy them, judge the whole world in righteousness
[00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:20.680]   and set up his everlasting kingdom. And that when he did go back into heaven, he sent down
[00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:28.440]   his Holy Spirit upon the church and gave him as a gift to men who believed. So you see
[00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:33.400]   when he came to Ephesus he asked these people, "Did you receive the Holy Ghost when you believed?"
[00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:36.840]   They hadn't understood this, they didn't know the Holy Ghost had been given. So he
[00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:40.860]   preached to them and then he baptized them in the name of the Lord Jesus. And then when
[00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:49.520]   Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came upon them. He believed in the power,
[00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:55.400]   the living power and activity of the Holy Ghost. Now that, you see, is his belief, not
[00:46:55.400 --> 00:47:06.400]   something he adds on to his basic Judaism, but a revolution, something entirely and altogether
[00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:21.880]   new. And that in turn led to the third thing, which is that Christ became his Lord. He never
[00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:34.560]   thought of using Christianity to serve his own ends. He surrendered himself utterly and
[00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:44.240]   absolutely to the Lord. His first words were, "What wilt thou have me to do, Lord?" He gave
[00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:58.080]   up all, counted it as dung and loss. He sacrificed everything, reputation, prospects, future,
[00:47:58.080 --> 00:48:05.480]   all for Christ. His one ambition was, "That I might know him and the power of his resurrection
[00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:11.080]   and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death." He called
[00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:17.280]   himself the bond-slave of Jesus Christ. Christ, he says, is all in all the beginning and the
[00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:31.280]   end. This wasn't a second-hand belief. This wasn't a vague, nebulous knowledge. Listen
[00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:44.480]   to him. "I know him whom I have believed. I know him." In a way, not the Jesus that somebody
[00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:57.280]   else preaches. "My Jesus, my gospel, my Lord, my God, I know whom I have believed." That's
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:05.480]   all. And that is the explanation of the difference between Saul of Tarsus becoming the apostle
[00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:16.920]   Paul and the sons of Seva. This man is filled with the Spirit, filled with power, filled
[00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:26.760]   with the might of God, through the Spirit. And what is the result? Success, phenomenal
[00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:34.440]   success. Handkerchiefs that had touched his body could heal, the power that was in him,
[00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:40.560]   because he believed in this Christ and in God through him, and was filled with the Spirit
[00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:52.600]   and of power. That was his secret. That has always been the secret of the Church in every
[00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:59.520]   period of revival. That has been the secret of every individual, saint and servant of
[00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:06.400]   God, whom he has used throughout the centuries. That was the secret of Augustine. That was
[00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:11.680]   the secret of Martin Luther. Look at him trying as a monk and failing. What's the change?
[00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:16.560]   How did he become the great Reformer? He saw the truth about this Jesus and the way of
[00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:22.160]   salvation in Christ alone, justification by faith. And the Spirit came upon him, and he
[00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:30.960]   preached like a giant. Not only Luther, but all the English Reformers, the Puritans, Whitefield,
[00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:37.320]   Wesley, Rolands, Harris, every one of them, here is the secret. They had been trying,
[00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:42.960]   they had failed, they were ineffective, and the devil was ridiculing them. Suddenly they
[00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:49.080]   believed truly on the Son of God, and they are filled with the Spirit, and they are irresistible,
[00:50:49.080 --> 00:51:00.240]   and the devil is cast out. That is not only the teaching of the Scripture, you see. It
[00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:08.480]   is the teaching of the entire history of the Christian Church.
[00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:17.640]   What are we to do then, says someone? The answer is quite simple. When this happened,
[00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:25.280]   you remember what followed? Many people who were in the Church were convicted of their
[00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:31.680]   wrongness and of their failure. You remember what they did? They came and they confessed
[00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:36.480]   it, that they had been living a double life, that they hadn't really given themselves.
[00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:41.440]   And many brought their books, their books on exorcism and magic and on philosophy, and
[00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:51.680]   they made a bump out of it, they burnt the lot. And they gave themselves to a simple,
[00:51:51.680 --> 00:52:06.320]   unreserved belief in and trusting Jesus of Nazareth as Savior and her as Lord. That is
[00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:20.400]   what they did. And what followed? Mightily grew the Word of God and prevailed. And it
[00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:30.840]   still comes to the same thing. The Church can use the name of Christ in Christian phrases
[00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:40.400]   as much as she likes, but while she denies the basic truths concerning him, she will
[00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:47.200]   not be blessed. She will have no power. The position will go from bad to worse, and the
[00:52:47.200 --> 00:53:00.080]   devil will be glorying and ridiculing the Church. She must repent, believe the gospel,
[00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:10.920]   and give herself to her Lord. And what is true for the Church is equally true for any
[00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:21.680]   individual that is in this service. Would you like to know the power of the gospel?
[00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:29.320]   Would you like the comfort of the gospel? Would you like to know your sins forgiven?
[00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:35.680]   Would you like to know the loss of the fear of death? Would you like to feel that you're
[00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:45.000]   a new being, that there's new life in you, that you know Christ and know God as your
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:51.280]   personal Father? Would you like victory over things that have crippled you and made you
[00:53:51.280 --> 00:54:03.960]   ashamed? This is what you were called upon to do. Confess your wrong approach, your incomplete
[00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:14.120]   surrender. Acknowledge and confess your sin. Burn your books. Throw away your philosophy
[00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:20.960]   and believe this. Throw away your science in this respect. Come to this as a little
[00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:26.600]   child. Believe it, the revelation, the word of God. Accept it. Submit to it as Saul of
[00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:33.600]   Tarsus did. Say, "Speak to me, what thou hast thou have me to do, Lord?" Come, repent,
[00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:44.760]   believe, surrender, rise up and go after him. And you will receive the Spirit, and new life
[00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:53.680]   and power will come into you. And where you were formerly a ridiculous failure, you will
[00:54:53.680 --> 00:55:05.720]   become a triumphant and a joyful saint. Let us, by the grace of God, learn the lessons
[00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:15.440]   of the sons of Stephen. And let us, with the Apostle Paul, humbled, convicted, smashed
[00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:30.520]   and hopeless, look up and say, "Who art thou, Lord?" What wouldst thou have me to do? Repent,
[00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:42.040]   believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved. Amen.
