[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.240]   the first epistle of Peter, in the second chapter, and reading particularly this evening
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.640]   verses 4, 5, and 6.
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:20.600]   Verses 4, 5, and 6 in the second chapter of the first epistle of Peter.
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:28.040]   To whom coming as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God and precious,
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:35.440]   ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house and holy priesthood to offer up spiritual
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.480]   sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:47.080]   Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, "Behold, I lay in Zion a chief cornerstone,
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:53.840]   elect, precious, and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded."
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.720]   But those who attend here regularly will know that we are really making a study of the first
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.360]   twelve verses of this second chapter of the first epistle of Peter.
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:11.840]   He goes on to say that this Lord Jesus Christ, who is this chief cornerstone, unto you therefore
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.840]   which believe he is precious, but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.200]   builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner, and the stone of stumbling
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.840]   and the rock of offense, even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient, whereunto
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.720]   also they were appointed.
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:36.800]   But he are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, and a holy nation, a peculiar people, that
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.480]   ye should show for the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:48.320]   light, which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God, which had not
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.080]   obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.120]   Now then, what is the matter here?
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.440]   What is this subject that the apostle here puts before these people to whom he was writing
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.520]   and which I put before you once more this evening?
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.440]   Well here it is, if you like.
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:11.200]   He that believeth on him shall not be confounded.
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.200]   That's the thing.
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:21.080]   The whole problem, the whole art of life, if you like, is how not to be confounded.
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.520]   How can we go through this world with all its perplexities and problems and uncertainties,
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:33.360]   and all its dread and terrible possibilities, without being disappointed, without being
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.960]   put to shame, without being made to look ridiculous, without being left at the end without anything
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:40.960]   at all?
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.400]   That's the problem.
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.080]   It surely must be the problem on the minds of everybody in this congregation at this
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.200]   very moment.
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.560]   How is it possible for one never to be put to shame?
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.800]   Because here we are told that that is possible, and that is the thing surely which we all
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.760]   must long to know and to discover.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:12.920]   This place of rest, this place of assurance, this place of certainty in a world which is
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.160]   nothing but quicksand, shifting sand.
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.720]   When we think we've got a foothold it suddenly goes.
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:27.400]   And everything as it is at this moment is in a state of fluidity and confusion and unutterable
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.400]   uncertainty.
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.760]   Now then, that's the question.
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.680]   Well what we've seen is this, that there is nothing in the world this evening that
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.520]   offers us this place where we shall never be confounded except the message of this Christian
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.160]   gospel.
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.160]   Nothing else can give us this.
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.160]   We've looked at them, we've examined them.
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.400]   None of them can come up to the test.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:59.400]   There is no philosophy known to man which can give this which is offered here.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.880]   The world's never had it.
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.320]   This is the only place.
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.720]   All your great religions, they've got nothing to offer you in a sense except that death
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.760]   is somehow going to deliver you.
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.680]   People you see in their desperation today are turning back to some of these Eastern
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.800]   religions and that's all they've got to give you.
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.680]   Death is your only way of escape.
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:19.680]   They're all hopeless.
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.680]   They're all negative.
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.120]   Well now, this is the only thing.
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.480]   And so the question before us is this.
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.440]   How can we know that this is so sure and certain?
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.440]   What is this?
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.120]   Well, we've seen this much.
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.800]   We have seen that this book is a unique book.
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.440]   It's unlike every other book.
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.440]   It's the book of God.
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:48.120]   Wherefore also, he says, it is contained in the scripture, the writing.
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.920]   This was called the writing, the writing.
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.880]   It's the oracles of God.
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:59.280]   It is God's word as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:05.200]   The word of the Lord, as he calls it in the previous chapter, the word of God.
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.500]   Word of the Lord endureth forever and this is the word which by the gospel is preached
[00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:10.500]   unto you.
[00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:11.500]   Now, here's the thing.
[00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:16.200]   Don't you think it's about time, my friend, you began to listen to God?
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.000]   You've listened to men, but they've brought you nowhere because they can't go themselves
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   anywhere.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   They don't know where they are.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.200]   Here's a word from God with a unique authority.
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:33.840]   We've seen that it tells us and it alone tells us the cause of our troubles, why we are in
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.680]   our present predicament.
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.640]   Nothing else really has an explanation of this.
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:43.520]   It's only this biblical doctrine of the fall of men and of sin that accounts for the state
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.600]   of the individual and of the whole world at this present moment.
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.440]   It alone explains the position.
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.760]   But thank God it doesn't stop at that.
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:06:02.960]   It goes on to tell us God's way of putting us on this rock which guarantees that we shall
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.200]   never be confounded.
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.480]   Well no, then this is the question that is before us.
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.480]   What is that?
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:17.040]   Well, we've seen that it's this, that God is calling out a people unto himself who in
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:21.360]   time past were not a people but are now the people of God.
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:26.560]   We are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people, a people
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.600]   for God's particular care and position.
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.600]   That's it.
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:35.320]   The whole secret in this world is to become one of the people of God.
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:39.120]   For if we're one of God's people, nothing can finally harm us.
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.120]   Why?
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:45.320]   Well, because God has got a great program for his people.
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.040]   And the main part of this program lies in the future.
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.040]   This is only a passing world.
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:55.200]   Peter reminds these people that they're but strangers and pilgrims.
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:59.560]   But God has a great plan, a great purpose, a great program for his people.
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:05.920]   Death and hell and everything that is set against us cannot touch that and cannot affect
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.280]   it in any possible way.
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:16.440]   Very well then, I say, the main question for us is, are we a part of this people of God?
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.320]   Do we know that we are God's people?
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.400]   Have we got this sense of security tonight?
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.680]   Can we look at the world as it is and as it's likely to be, at its blackest and darkest
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.840]   and starkest, and say, "It's all right.
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.760]   This doesn't affect my position at all.
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.880]   I've never banked in this world.
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.440]   I've never expected much from it.
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:40.240]   I don't expect anything in the future except that it gets worse and worse, that there shall
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:46.480]   be wars and rumors of wars and confusion and pestilences as the Lord Jesus Christ prophesied."
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:47.480]   That's what I expect.
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.480]   I'm not disappointed.
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.480]   I'm not surprised.
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:55.480]   And I know that finally, whatever the world may do to me, it can never separate me from
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:58.680]   the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:02.640]   If you're one of the people of God, you've got security, you've got certainty, you've
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:07.000]   got a foundation which will never shift.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.080]   So the question I ask is this.
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:13.880]   Are you one of these people, my friend?
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:19.120]   Can you say definitely tonight that you know you'll never be confounded, never disappointed,
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.200]   never be put to shame?
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:26.520]   Now that to me is the most urgent question in the world tonight.
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:31.200]   And thank God it's a question which is dealt with here.
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:35.880]   How does one become one of these people of God?
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:36.880]   That's the question.
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:44.440]   Now the whole business of the Christian gospel is to answer that one question.
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:49.080]   I think I showed last Sunday night that this is the one big message running in the Bible
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.560]   from beginning to end.
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:56.840]   God calling out his people, this separation of Abels from Cain's, Jacob's from Esau's.
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:59.480]   Here it is everywhere.
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:04.600]   And the great question is, do we know this separation?
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:08.400]   Are we among this people of God?
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.400]   That's the place of safety.
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:15.760]   Well now, then let's hear what it has to say about how to become one of these people.
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:22.680]   How does one enter into this community of God, this kingdom of God which shall never
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:23.680]   be moved?
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:31.680]   Well, let me give you the answers, let me tabulate the answers as they're given here.
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:39.280]   The first thing we've got to realize is this, that it is something we can never do for ourselves.
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:40.280]   Never.
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:45.240]   That's absolutely basic to the whole position.
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:48.160]   You can't just decide to become one of the people of God.
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.160]   Why?
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:55.000]   Because these people are characterized by a new nature, as newborn babes.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.440]   Here's the sincere milk of the word.
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:03.440]   I don't go into that this evening, but I'm simply concerned to remind you of the fact
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:07.560]   that this is quite basic.
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:12.280]   Because the first thing that is essential before we can become children of God and the
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:20.120]   people of God is that we get into the right relationship with God, that we get to know
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.120]   God.
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:25.440]   Now that's the first thing according to the Bible.
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:30.040]   All men's troubles arise from the fact that he doesn't know God and he isn't receiving
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:31.760]   God's blessing.
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:33.760]   The way of the transgressor is hard.
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:37.520]   "There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked."
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.040]   And there's no peace in the world tonight.
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.040]   Why?
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.000]   Well, because it's wicked.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.880]   And you see, the first thing we have to consider if we want to know this rest and peace is,
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:50.480]   how can we know God?
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:54.960]   How can we get into that relationship with God, which means that we are his people, he's
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.920]   our Father, he's our God, and he's going to bless us?
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:00.880]   Here's the first great question.
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:06.600]   And I'm simply emphasizing this point, that it is something we can never achieve in and
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.600]   of ourselves.
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.160]   Never.
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:16.720]   The Bible emphasizes that right away through from the very beginning to the very end.
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:21.000]   People talk liberally about finding God and listening to him and talking to him.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.240]   According to the Bible, it's something that a man can't do for himself.
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.240]   Impossible.
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:29.640]   Well, very well, let me leave that at that and come to the second thing, which is, of
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:35.000]   course, as is emphasized here everywhere, that it is something that God does.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:44.640]   "Wherefore also it is contained in the Scripture, 'Behold, I lay in Zion, a chief cornerstone,
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:45.640]   elect precious.'
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:48.240]   It's God that's speaking.
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:52.960]   Or take it as it's put in the fourth verse, 'To whom coming as unto a living stone, disallowed
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:58.280]   indeed of men, but chosen of God and precious.'
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.280]   God does it.
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:03.720]   Now, we saw that, of course, from a different angle last Sunday night.
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:07.480]   But let me put it once more like this.
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:14.520]   The whole message of the Bible is to tell us what God has done about us and about our
[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:15.520]   salvation.
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:21.400]   Now, I've got to emphasize that for this reason, that for the last hundred years or so, the
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:27.520]   popular teaching has been this, that the Bible is nothing but an account of man searching
[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:28.520]   for God.
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:31.440]   You see, the evolutionary principle brought that in.
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:35.040]   That's where the whole thing went wrong a hundred years ago, this whole teaching of
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.920]   evolution and development.
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:41.760]   So they describe, you see, man coming out of that primitive slime and beginning to use
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:42.760]   his brain.
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:48.200]   And then in this mysterious universe, he begins to feel that there are forces and powers and
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.200]   influences.
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:54.600]   And he feels that they're in the trees and in the running brooks.
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.800]   He feels they're in the sun and the moon and the stars.
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:00.600]   Of course, he's quite wrong, but he passes through these stages.
[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:03.920]   And then he gradually goes on in his quest and in his search.
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:09.960]   And at last, in the Hebrew people especially, he arrived at this belief in the one God.
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:11.680]   It's a process of development.
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:19.680]   Man seeking and searching for God, and at last arriving at the knowledge.
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:23.320]   But according to the Bible, it's the exact opposite.
[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:28.160]   This isn't an account of men seeking and searching for God.
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:31.280]   It's God seeking and searching for lost men.
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:36.960]   Man, as I reminded you last Sunday, created perfect, falls, goes and hides himself.
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:39.720]   God comes down, Adam, where art thou?
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:40.720]   That's it.
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:41.720]   That's the whole of the gospel.
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:47.680]   God seeking lost men, telling him his purpose and his program.
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:49.720]   It's God's work.
[00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:53.240]   And this is emphasized right through the Old Testament.
[00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:54.240]   It's God who called Abraham.
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:58.880]   Abraham didn't decide to leave our other Chaldeans and to live a different life.
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.800]   God took him out, and he didn't understand.
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.880]   He went out not knowing where he was going.
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:05.840]   You see, it's God who led him.
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.920]   It's God who's done it all.
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:13.200]   Why don't people read their Old Testament, I wonder, instead of talking about it?
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.240]   And as you read it, this is what you find.
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:20.480]   You find the best men in the Old Testament rebelling, failing to understand, falling
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.680]   into sin, doing wrong things.
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:26.720]   And it would have all come to an end if God hadn't been leading them on.
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:29.280]   It's always the action of God.
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:32.840]   And then, of course, in the New Testament, it's still more clear.
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:38.000]   God, as I'm going to show you, sending forth his Son.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:45.640]   And the whole of salvation is something that is done and given to us by God.
[00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:48.320]   We are his workmanships, says Paul to the Ephesians.
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:51.000]   Isn't he who has done it?
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.280]   You have he quickened God when you were dead in trespasses and sins.
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:56.280]   God's done it.
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:57.280]   We are his workmanship.
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:03.320]   Now then, here is the message that's unfolded before us in this paragraph.
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:07.920]   Peter puts it here, very much as he did in that sermon of his on the day of Pentecost
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.600]   in Jerusalem.
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:16.520]   He tells us what God has done, how God can put us in this place of safety where we shall
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:18.680]   never be confounded.
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:19.680]   How has he done it?
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:25.120]   Well, he does it supremely, and this is the thing that must engage us tonight, through
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:32.680]   this person, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:34.240]   You notice how it's put here.
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:44.960]   "Behold, I lay in Zion a chief cornerstone, elect precious, and he that believeth on him
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:47.880]   shall not be confounded."
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:55.400]   It is, I say, something that God does, especially in and through this person, the Lord Jesus
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:56.400]   Christ.
[00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:05.040]   He is the chief cornerstone of the whole thing.
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:08.800]   My friend, did you realize this?
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:15.560]   You never can, you never will know God except in and through this person.
[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:19.440]   He is the chief cornerstone.
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:21.760]   There is no message apart from him.
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:27.120]   Let me show you how this is emphasized everywhere in the Scriptures.
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:30.120]   This same point as is made here.
[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:33.200]   Listen to it in the famous John 3.16.
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:40.800]   "God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:44.800]   in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.120]   Yes, but go on.
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:50.160]   "For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:52.400]   him might be saved.
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:58.400]   He that believeth on him is not condemned, but he that believeth not on him is condemned
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:06.840]   already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God."
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:08.720]   Listen to the last verse in John 3.
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:17.920]   "He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life, and he that believeth not the Son shall
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:26.200]   not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him."
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:27.200]   Isn't it clear?
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.520]   Isn't it plain?
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:31.000]   Listen to the Lord putting it again.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   "I am the door."
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.800]   He's the only door into this fold.
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:39.560]   You see, the images are used to help us.
[00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:43.040]   Sometimes we're called people, sometimes we're called a building, sometimes we're called
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:44.400]   a flock of sheep.
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:48.360]   This people of God, there it is, a flock.
[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:49.920]   There's only one door of entry.
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:52.640]   "I am the door.
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:56.280]   All who come before me," he says, "are thieves and robbers.
[00:17:56.280 --> 00:18:00.160]   But by me, if any men enter in, he shall be saved.
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:04.720]   He shall have life, and he shall go in and out and find pasture.
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:10.760]   For I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly."
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:13.040]   He and he alone is the door.
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:16.360]   Listen to him still more explicitly in John 14.6.
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:20.480]   "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
[00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:25.880]   No man cometh unto the Father but by me."
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:31.880]   And I could keep you by quoting you scripture after scripture, his own statements, making
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:33.360]   this unique claim.
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:35.080]   God does it all, I say in him.
[00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:38.960]   Now, the apostles, when they began to preach, they preached exactly the same thing.
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:40.960]   Did you notice it there in Peter's sermon?
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:44.520]   It was all about this Jesus.
[00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:51.000]   But because of that sermon partly, and because Peter and John later on healed men sitting
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.960]   at the beautiful gate of the temple, they got into trouble and were arrested and appeared
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:58.680]   before the authorities, who wanted to know what this preaching meant.
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:02.880]   Why did they talk about this Jesus as they did?
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:05.560]   And this is how Peter answered them.
[00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:14.120]   "There is none other name under heaven given amongst men whereby we must be saved."
[00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:16.680]   He and he alone.
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:19.240]   No other name, no second name.
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:22.320]   Christ, Christ alone.
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:24.160]   He is the only way.
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:26.680]   Paul does the same thing.
[00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:30.280]   Listen to him reminding the Corinthians of what he preached to them.
[00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:38.080]   "I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified."
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.360]   He could have talked many other things to them.
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:42.120]   He knew a bit about Greek poetry.
[00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:43.440]   He knew about philosophy.
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:45.040]   He was very learned in Jewish law.
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:50.680]   "I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified."
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:55.320]   Later on he says to them, "Other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which
[00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:59.040]   is Christ Jesus."
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:03.320]   He reminds them in the 15th chapter of that first epistle of exactly the same thing, what
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:09.880]   he preached to them when he first went there, the thing he put in the forefront of his message,
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:14.520]   how that Christ died for our sins according to the scripture, how he was buried, how he
[00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:16.520]   rose again, and so on.
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:18.440]   Always the same thing.
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:23.640]   And then he puts it in that second epistle to the Corinthians in chapter 5 in verse 19
[00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:31.800]   in that central phrase, "God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself."
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:37.320]   Now some people put the emphasis like this, "God was in Christ reconciling the world
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:38.320]   unto himself."
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:39.760]   It doesn't mean that it means this.
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:46.160]   It was through Christ, by means of Christ, in what he did with Christ that he was reconciling
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:47.160]   the world unto himself.
[00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:54.480]   Now here it is, and again I would say that I could go on quoting further scriptures for
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:56.720]   a very long time indeed.
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:01.760]   What I'm emphasizing, my friend, is this.
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:05.880]   And I say it with reverence.
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:16.040]   There was no other way whereby even the Almighty God could have prepared a people for himself
[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:23.880]   and put them on this rock on which they shall never be confounded apart from this same person,
[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:27.480]   the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:31.280]   Very well, it comes to this.
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:36.040]   If we are anxious to become one of these children of God, this people of God, which shall never
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:45.360]   be confounded, we come immediately face to face with the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:47.920]   Don't waste a second about anything else.
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:50.220]   Don't listen to any other teaching.
[00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:55.280]   Don't waste your time with Hinduism or Mohammedanism or Buddhism or Confucianism or all these other
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:56.920]   isms that people are turning to.
[00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:58.360]   Not one of them will help you.
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:01.720]   Here's the only one, the only way to God.
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:06.200]   Of course I know that that's unpopular today, that even the Christian church herself is
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:10.800]   often saying that that isn't true, that there are insights and ways apart from this.
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:13.100]   But he said that this was the only way.
[00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:16.800]   And the whole of the apostolic preaching says precisely the same thing.
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:20.680]   There is no other way but this.
[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:24.440]   And that is why I preach it.
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:27.840]   Have you come to terms with him?
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:33.540]   Here's another way of putting the most urgent question for everybody in the world tonight.
[00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:37.760]   What think ye of Christ?
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:41.240]   Where does the Lord Jesus Christ come into your calculations?
[00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:44.200]   Where does he enter into your whole outlook upon life?
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:47.400]   Where is he in your experience at this moment?
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:54.800]   According to this message, he must be absolutely central, vital, the all and in all.
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:57.320]   That's precisely what Peter is saying here.
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:00.920]   "Behold, I lay in Zion a chief cornerstone."
[00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:07.640]   Yes, "unto you that believe he is precious, but unto them which be disobedient, the stone
[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:13.960]   which the builders disallowed, the same is made, the head of the corner."
[00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:14.960]   That's what he is.
[00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:15.960]   There's nothing without him.
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:17.880]   There's no building, everything collapses.
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:19.640]   Take him out, there's nothing left.
[00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:23.600]   This is the whole teaching, not only here but everywhere in the scripture.
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:27.680]   Now what does this mean?
[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:32.840]   I make no apology for taking you through these first principles of the gospel of Christ this
[00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:33.840]   evening.
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:41.240]   I'm alarmed, my friends, at what I see and hear of the misrepresentation of this blessed
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:42.240]   gospel.
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:51.040]   So I start by saying that the message is about him, the person himself.
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:54.680]   It is not primarily about his teaching.
[00:23:54.680 --> 00:24:01.240]   I'm tired of all this talk about Christianity, which doesn't mention Christ.
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:06.000]   I'm alarmed at all this identification of this message with Western civilization as
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.440]   opposed to Eastern civilization behind the Iron Curtain.
[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:11.440]   That's not it.
[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:14.600]   You see, that's a vague teaching.
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:16.400]   That's a philosophic attitude.
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:17.400]   That's a kind of culture.
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:20.080]   I'm not here to speak against Western culture.
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:28.320]   All I'm saying is this, that Western culture and this message are not identical.
[00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:33.480]   This consists of this person himself.
[00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:35.040]   What is this Christian message?
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:38.560]   Well, I say it's entirely about him.
[00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:43.080]   Now did you notice that sermon preached by the Apostle Peter on the day of Pentecost?
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:46.600]   That's very important, that for this reason.
[00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:51.440]   That was the first sermon preached under the auspices of the Christian church as we know
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:53.720]   her.
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:58.680]   And therefore it should be a model and a pattern to every preacher.
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:01.640]   What did Peter preach about?
[00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:05.320]   Did he preach about the conditions obtaining in the Roman Empire at the time?
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:07.560]   Not a word of it.
[00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:11.560]   Did he preach about the injustice of the Jews and the land of Palestine being under the
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:12.560]   Roman domination?
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:14.640]   He doesn't mention it at all.
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:15.880]   It was true at the time.
[00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:16.880]   He doesn't deal with it.
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:19.560]   He doesn't mention it.
[00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:22.120]   He doesn't do any of the things that are being done today.
[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:23.120]   What does he do?
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:28.960]   He talks about this person.
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:32.960]   But you see what's passing as Christianity is this.
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:36.680]   I mentioned in my sermon this morning about a cutting that a man had given me out of one
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:41.040]   of the Sunday newspapers last Sunday, supposedly a sermon.
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:42.040]   And what was the sermon saying?
[00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:43.040]   It was saying this.
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:47.600]   "It was an attack upon the doctrine of the fall and of sin to start with."
[00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:49.640]   That was its negative message.
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:50.960]   Well then I went on reading it.
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:52.360]   It was sent to me by a friend.
[00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:56.680]   I wondered what the positive message of this man was in the name of Christianity.
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:59.720]   And this is what it came to.
[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:06.000]   That we'd all got to try to do good and live a good life and hope that things would get
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.240]   better.
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:11.480]   That was a Christian message supposedly.
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:14.720]   There was nothing about this person and what God did in him.
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:15.720]   Not a word.
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:20.920]   You needn't be a Christian to talk about doing good and trying to make things better and
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:23.160]   hoping that things will get better.
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:24.160]   Anybody can do that.
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:26.800]   But that was represented as Christianity.
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:30.360]   That's why I'm going through all this in detail, my friend.
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:34.560]   That's the road to hell as I see it.
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:38.400]   That's not telling people about the one person who can save them.
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:41.320]   It's the person himself, not even his teaching.
[00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:42.920]   Did you notice that sermon of Peter?
[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:47.000]   He doesn't expound the teaching of Jesus, which is what they're all doing today.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   No, no.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.080]   He talks about Jesus himself.
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:51.960]   And what happened to him.
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:54.440]   Because you see, what saves us is not the teaching.
[00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:57.480]   It's what God did with him and through him and in him.
[00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:58.480]   That's what Peter talks about.
[00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:01.160]   That's what he's talking about here in his epistle.
[00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:03.840]   That's what I must talk about tonight.
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:07.200]   It is the person himself.
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:10.640]   Don't be bogged down by Christian attitude to this, that, and the other.
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:14.040]   Before you can talk about a Christian attitude, you must become a Christian.
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:17.680]   And you can only become a Christian by meeting this person.
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:19.640]   The person himself.
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:21.880]   Very well, what are we told about this person?
[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:26.920]   Well, here it is all before us.
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:32.760]   The first thing I'm told about him is that he's chosen of God for this work.
[00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:39.600]   "For whom coming as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God.
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:45.960]   Behold, I lay in Zion a chief cornerstone, chosen, elect."
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:49.600]   Well then, what does this mean?
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:55.600]   Well, let me put it to you like this.
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:28:01.320]   The work is, I say, to prepare a people for God.
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:08.360]   The work is to make us the people of God so that we shall never be confounded.
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:13.320]   So that when the world becomes a living hell, as it may well become if they let off these
[00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:19.480]   idiotic bombs, you and I shall not be surprised, nor disappointed, nor feel we've lost everything.
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:24.720]   We know we are going on to the glory in that new world that's coming.
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:28.320]   How does God produce this people?
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:30.480]   Well, he does it through this son of his.
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:31.880]   He's chosen him to do it.
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:35.040]   When did he choose him to do it?
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:39.840]   According to this scripture, he chose him to do it before he'd ever made the world.
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:41.400]   I can give you one statement of that.
[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:42.960]   There are many in these scriptures.
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:46.960]   Let me content myself with just one this evening from the Apostle Paul in the first epistle
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:51.320]   to the Corinthians, chapter 2 and verse 7, which expounds our text tonight.
[00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:55.720]   He says, "We speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom which God
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:29:03.120]   ordained before the world unto our glory, which none of the princes of this world knew,
[00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:06.480]   for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory."
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:07.480]   That's it.
[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:10.080]   So this is the message, you see, of Christianity.
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:16.880]   This is the message of the Bible, that God in his infinite foreknowledge, before he'd
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:19.520]   ever made the world, saw what was going to happen.
[00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:20.520]   He made it perfect.
[00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:22.000]   He gave men free will.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.240]   Men had absolute choice at the beginning to do good or evil, absolute free will.
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:32.240]   God knew that men was going to make the wrong choice and make himself the slave of the devil
[00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:36.720]   and bring down calamity upon his own head.
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:40.760]   But God, and this is where you see the love and the grace and the mercy and the compassion
[00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:48.440]   of God, God, when he saw that, when he knew that, he decided he was going to do something
[00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:56.440]   about this salvation, to save this people for the new world that he was yet to reproduce.
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:30:00.040]   And he appointed his own son to do this.
[00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:06.040]   He chose, before the foundation of the world, to do this very work.
[00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:11.320]   Now then, the moment you grasp that principle, you begin to understand your Old Testament.
[00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:12.520]   Because what have you got here?
[00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:14.920]   Well, what you've got in the Old Testament is this.
[00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:17.440]   God, as I say, comes after man.
[00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:19.440]   There's men in his misery, in his sin.
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:21.480]   God comes down and begins to speak to him.
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:22.480]   What does he say to him?
[00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:24.000]   Well, this is what he said.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.400]   You read Genesis 3, you'll find it.
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:29.160]   He said, "You see what you've done?
[00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:31.080]   And you're going to be punished for what you've done.
[00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:33.520]   I'll curse the ground.
[00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:35.680]   You're going to have to sweat from now on.
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:38.400]   But it's all right.
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:43.080]   The seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head."
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:47.120]   The serpent that dragged men down, his progeny is going to be fighting men.
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:48.120]   The seed of the woman.
[00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:49.120]   "It's all right," says God.
[00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:54.680]   "I promise you, the seed of the woman, someone coming out of this woman ultimately, is going
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:59.880]   to bruise that serpent's head and give deliverance."
[00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:04.760]   Now then, you see, God was able to make that promise because he'd already decided before
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:09.320]   he'd ever created the world that his son was going to do this.
[00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:10.840]   There's the first promise.
[00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:17.600]   You don't understand prophecy unless you understand that God chose his own son before the world
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:19.680]   in order to say this.
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:24.880]   So having made the decision, having chosen him, when man falls, God begins to tell them.
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:30.480]   He begins to throw out a promise and he gives promise after promise after promise.
[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:35.760]   He told Abram, you remember, "Through thee and through thy seed are all the nations of
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:41.200]   the world going to be blessed," which made Christ say later on, "Abram rejoiced to see
[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:42.200]   my day.
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:44.480]   He saw it and was glad."
[00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:49.440]   God gave Abram a preview of the day when his son should come and be the Savior.
[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:52.960]   And on he went giving these promises.
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:56.720]   People sometimes say to me, you know, "It's all right, I believe in reading the Bible,
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:00.920]   but when I come to those books of Leviticus and Numbers and all about these burnt offerings
[00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:02.200]   and sacrifices, I'm lost.
[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:03.200]   I don't know where I am."
[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:07.880]   All right, my friend, I agree, it's difficult, but you, don't you go too much into the details.
[00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:12.240]   Take a big view of it and this is what you find.
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:17.400]   God is just teaching there everywhere that a man can't go into his presence whenever
[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:20.680]   he feels like it, just when he wants to and get his blessing.
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:21.680]   No, no.
[00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:24.800]   God says, "I'm a holy God.
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:28.520]   I'm a God who hates sin and punishes sin.
[00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:30.640]   And an atonement has to be made for sin.
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:34.920]   So you've got to take your animal, put your hands on his head, transfer your sins to him
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:40.160]   symbolically, kill your animal, get the blood, bring the blood before me, and then I'll
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:43.080]   pass over your sin."
[00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:48.960]   You remember the lamb, the Paschal lamb, before they went out of Egypt, the blood and the
[00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:51.320]   lintel and the doorposts.
[00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:54.400]   And wherever the blood was seen, the house was spared.
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:57.280]   Where the blood was not seen, the house and the people were destroyed.
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:58.920]   What's God doing in that?
[00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:03.320]   Well, he's giving another prophecy about this Deliverer that is going to come.
[00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:07.960]   A lamb was slain morning and evening, regularly in all this Levitical ceremonial.
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:08.960]   What's it mean?
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:10.840]   Well, it's pointing forward.
[00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:15.280]   All those burnt offerings and sacrifices and all the rest of them are just pale shadows
[00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:17.880]   of this coming Christ, this Deliverer.
[00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:18.880]   What's it mean?
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:23.120]   God's telling the people, encouraging them with the promise.
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:28.120]   He is going to lay in Zion a chief cornerstone, elect, precious.
[00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:31.240]   You get exactly the same thing taught in the prophets.
[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:36.760]   Oh, there's nothing more wonderful in the Bible than some of these great prophetic statements.
[00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:42.360]   Listen to it in Isaiah 9, a passage which I'm sure is familiar to all of you.
[00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:47.680]   Isaiah, writing, remember, about 800 years before the birth of Christ.
[00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:53.280]   "For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given, and the government shall be upon
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:58.320]   his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, the Mighty God, the Everlasting
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:00.960]   Father, the Prince of Peace.
[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:04.120]   Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end.
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:09.440]   Upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:12.560]   and with justice from henceforth even forever.
[00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:16.360]   The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this."
[00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:18.320]   That's it.
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:23.240]   Just another preview, just another confirmation of the promise, and on and on it goes.
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:30.120]   Isaiah 40, "Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make a way, a highway for him in the wilderness.
[00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:32.760]   This great personage is coming.
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:36.640]   Let every mountain be brought low and every valley exalted.
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:38.800]   Why well to prepare the way for him?
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:39.800]   He's coming."
[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:45.080]   Here it is, you see, God having decided, having chosen his Son before the foundation of the
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:49.880]   world, he's just telling the people that he's coming, keeping them going, as it were, at
[00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:54.240]   the very thought and anticipation of it.
[00:34:54.240 --> 00:35:02.040]   And on and on the prophetic message goes until a time comes when a strange message is given
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:05.640]   to a priest called Zacharias who was doing his duty.
[00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:08.240]   An angel appeared to him, said, "You're going to have a son."
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:10.880]   "Impossible," he said, "my wife is old and I'm old.
[00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:11.880]   You'll have a son.
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:15.880]   He's going to be the forerunner of the Messiah."
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:16.880]   He didn't believe it.
[00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:17.880]   He staggered.
[00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:18.880]   It became done.
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:20.280]   Later on the child was born.
[00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:22.720]   His tongue was loosed and he began to speak.
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:23.720]   What is this?
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:29.320]   He says, "Oh God, that visited and redeemed his people and you, my little son, are going
[00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:33.240]   to be his forerunner, the preparer of the way."
[00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:34.240]   What else?
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:40.200]   An archangel Gabriel visits Mary, this virgin, tells her something similar.
[00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:41.440]   What's all this?
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:43.680]   Well, this is this prophetic message.
[00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:47.520]   Wherefore, it is also contained in the scripture.
[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:48.520]   That's it.
[00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:52.840]   I've been giving you a resume of what is called the scripture, the Old Testament scripture.
[00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:54.440]   God speaking the whole time.
[00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:58.560]   It's God doing it, what God is doing, what God's going to do, and especially in the coming
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:01.240]   of this person.
[00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:06.800]   In other words, let me summarize it by putting it like this.
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:11.200]   All about him in embryo and all that he was going to do and all that was determined with
[00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:16.920]   respect to him was already known to God before the foundation of the world and it's been
[00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:17.920]   foretold.
[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:18.920]   Very well.
[00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:19.920]   Here he is.
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:20.920]   He comes.
[00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:25.360]   A baby is born to the virgin.
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:26.840]   He's laid in a manger.
[00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:27.840]   Who is this?
[00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:30.160]   Well, what I'm told about him is this.
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:35.960]   Chosen, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God and precious.
[00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:43.000]   Behold, I lay in Zion a chief cornerstone, elect, precious.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.520]   Who is this?
[00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:48.000]   This person is very precious.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.560]   You see, this is the prophecy concerning him and it's verified.
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:56.800]   I've already quoted to you Isaiah 40.
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:01.480]   All flesh shall see the salvation of God.
[00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:04.200]   This glorious person is going to come.
[00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:07.640]   He's come, precious.
[00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:11.200]   The words to Mary say exactly the same thing.
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:14.560]   There's something unusual about this child.
[00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:17.120]   He's not going to be born in the ordinary way.
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:20.560]   That's the thing Mary stumbled at, you remember.
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:27.720]   The archangel comes to Mary and he says, "Hail, thou art highly favored.
[00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:29.240]   The Lord is with thee.
[00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:32.320]   Blessed art thou among women."
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:34.360]   The angel said unto her, "Fear not, Mary.
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:36.480]   Thou hast found favor with God.
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:39.960]   And behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son, and thou shalt call
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:41.120]   his name Jesus.
[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:45.920]   He shall be great and shall be called the Son of the Highest, precious.
[00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:50.320]   And the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David, and he shall reign over
[00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:55.120]   the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there shall be no end."
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:56.800]   Precious.
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:58.360]   But Mary couldn't understand.
[00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:03.440]   She said, "How shall this be, seeing that I know not a man?"
[00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:07.520]   And the angel answered and said unto her, "The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and
[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:10.680]   the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee.
[00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:16.520]   Therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of
[00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:19.060]   God, precious.
[00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:24.520]   This is not just a man, not born out of wedlock, born of a virgin, born miraculously.
[00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:29.320]   The Holy Ghost has caused Mary to conceive, not man, the Holy Ghost.
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:31.480]   The power of the Highest shall overshadow thee.
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:34.120]   The power of God, precious.
[00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:36.920]   There's never been anybody like him.
[00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:41.000]   Wonderful counselor, prince of peace, everlasting father.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   What's it mean?
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.640]   Well, you see, there's never been anybody like this in the whole universe before, in
[00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:46.640]   the whole of history.
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:50.120]   Born of a virgin, precious.
[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:58.760]   Later on he grows up, and God three times says something like this about him, "This
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:04.520]   is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased."
[00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:07.920]   He never said it about anybody else.
[00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:12.240]   On the Mount of Transfiguration he said it again, "This is my beloved Son in whom I
[00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:13.240]   am well pleased.
[00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:16.500]   Hear him, listen to him.
[00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:25.520]   This is no man, this is my Son, my only begotten, my beloved Son."
[00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:28.120]   This person is precious.
[00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:30.880]   The world didn't understand him, it was perplexed.
[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:31.880]   It couldn't follow him.
[00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:34.480]   He had no training and yet he was learned.
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:38.720]   He seemed to be nobody, a carpenter, and yet he worked with authority and spoke with authority
[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:39.720]   and worked miracles.
[00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:40.720]   Who is this?
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:41.720]   Oh, he's precious.
[00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:43.720]   Don't try to understand him.
[00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:46.000]   He's Son of God as well as Son of Man.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.280]   He's born of a virgin.
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:48.840]   He is God in the flesh.
[00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:52.840]   "The Word was made flesh and dwelt among us."
[00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:53.840]   Precious.
[00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:57.320]   This is the one that God has chosen, his only Son.
[00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:59.120]   He sent him into the world.
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:04.680]   When the fullness of the times was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made
[00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:08.560]   under the law, to redeem them that are under the law.
[00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:12.000]   My dear friend, don't talk to me about the Christian view of this or that.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.280]   What think you of Christ?
[00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:17.300]   Have you seen the preciousness of Jesus?
[00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:19.940]   Do you see his uniqueness, his apartness?
[00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:25.840]   Do you see that he stands alone as Son of God and Son of Man?
[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:29.520]   But he's also tried, attested, stoned.
[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:34.880]   The apostle here is quoting Isaiah 28, 16, and if you turn that up when you go home,
[00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:40.920]   you'll find it reads like this, "Behold, I lay in Zion a chief cornerstone, tried,
[00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:44.480]   attested, and precious."
[00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:50.640]   Another scripture puts it like this, "He hath laid help on one that is mighty."
[00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:54.120]   If I may put it with reverence, God knew what he was doing.
[00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:58.240]   There was only one that was big enough and powerful enough and strong enough to take
[00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:03.000]   the sins of men upon him and to fight the world, the flesh and the devil, and not fail.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.080]   He hath laid help on one that is mighty.
[00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:07.600]   Men couldn't do it.
[00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:11.400]   All your ancient patriarchs and prophets have failed.
[00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:12.400]   Everything has failed.
[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:18.920]   It needs God in the flesh to be strong enough to stand the strain and the test of it all,
[00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:24.040]   and God has chosen his only Son, and he's put him as the chief cornerstone.
[00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:28.640]   And it is in him and through him alone that he saves us and makes us his people.
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:31.640]   How does this happen?
[00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:36.720]   I'm giving you a bird's eye view of the message of the gospel tonight, exactly as Peter did
[00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:38.280]   on the day of Pentecost.
[00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:39.720]   How does God do it in him?
[00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:45.080]   Here he is, precious, because he's the Son of God, the only begotten.
[00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:47.400]   How does God form the people through him?
[00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:48.400]   He does it like this.
[00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:51.880]   He first of all gives him a people.
[00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:55.800]   That is why our Lord, you see, at the end of his life, offered up his great high priestly
[00:41:55.800 --> 00:42:01.400]   prayer and this is what he says, "Father, the hour has come.
[00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:05.160]   Glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee.
[00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:09.900]   As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many
[00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:13.040]   as thou hast given him."
[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:16.600]   As many as thou hast given him.
[00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:22.920]   Later on he says, "Thine they were, and thou gavest them me."
[00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:25.800]   This is the gospel, my friend.
[00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:31.400]   God there before the world, before time, gave his Son this people.
[00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:34.360]   He then said to him, "Go and save them."
[00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:37.580]   And the Son came into the world in order to save them.
[00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:46.320]   And so we read in Hebrew too, "Behold me and the children whom thou hast given me."
[00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:49.040]   He's not ashamed to call them brethren.
[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:51.880]   God has given these people to him.
[00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:52.880]   What then?
[00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:56.680]   Well, in this way he saves them.
[00:42:56.680 --> 00:43:02.360]   God has made his own Son the representative of these people.
[00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:05.960]   That's why the scripture calls him the last Adam.
[00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:09.160]   That's why it calls him the second man.
[00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:12.560]   You see, the first man Adam, he fell and we all fell with him.
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:15.180]   God has sent another man, the second man.
[00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:18.160]   That was the first Adam, here's the last Adam.
[00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:26.640]   Here is one who is to represent this new people, this new generation, this new family of God.
[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:34.520]   God sends down his own Son to take on human nature, to start a new humanity, a new people.
[00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:40.040]   So he now comes and he acts as our representative.
[00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:42.240]   This is how he saves us.
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:44.000]   We can't save ourselves.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:45.600]   Nobody's ever done it.
[00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:47.240]   Everybody failed before he came.
[00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:51.000]   He comes, he becomes man, my representative.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.400]   He's going to save me and make me one of the people of God.
[00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:54.400]   How does he do it?
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:57.960]   He does it like this.
[00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:03.280]   He first of all lived a life of perfect obedience to God and his law.
[00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:05.480]   That's what I'm asking you.
[00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:07.040]   God has given his law.
[00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:11.200]   And the law is thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and all thy soul and
[00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:13.140]   all thy mind and all thy strength.
[00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:15.720]   The second is thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself.
[00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:17.640]   Ten commandments summarized there.
[00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:18.640]   That's it.
[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:19.920]   That's what you and I are supposed to do.
[00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:22.520]   And because we don't do it, we are under condemnation.
[00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:27.160]   We are under the wrath of God and the world is as it is because it's breaking the commandments
[00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:28.160]   of God.
[00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:31.800]   Hence your adultery and all the rest of it.
[00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:37.640]   The coveting, the selfishness, the greed, breaking the commandments of God.
[00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:42.020]   And we'll never be blessed, we'll never be the people of God until we keep his commandments
[00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:43.160]   and obey them.
[00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:45.360]   We can't.
[00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:52.040]   This precious one, this only begotten son of God, this second person in the blessed
[00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:56.880]   holy trinity who came down and took unto him human nature and was born as a helpless babe
[00:44:56.880 --> 00:45:01.440]   in Bethlehem and put into the manger, he's come to do it for me.
[00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:02.440]   And he did it.
[00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:05.160]   He never failed in any one of the commandments.
[00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:08.220]   He was made under the law and he kept the law.
[00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:09.640]   He kept every iota.
[00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:11.120]   He kept every tittle of it.
[00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:13.000]   There was nothing in which he failed.
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:14.840]   No one can put a charge against him.
[00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:16.840]   He's absolutely sinless.
[00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:24.040]   He's obeyed God and honored his law down to the minutest detail.
[00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:26.680]   What else has he done for me?
[00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:31.840]   Well, we all of us, as we know, are the slaves of the devil.
[00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:34.060]   I trust that you knew that, my friend.
[00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:39.000]   If you didn't, come back some other Sunday night, I'll prove it to you.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.840]   Take it for granted from me tonight.
[00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:42.360]   We are all slaves of the devil.
[00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:44.560]   That's why we live as we do by nature.
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:47.200]   That's why you can't give up that sin that gets you down.
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:50.400]   That's why when you say on Sunday morning, "I'll never do that again," which you did
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:55.120]   last night and which makes you feel a fool and a cad, you go back and do it again.
[00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:56.120]   Why?
[00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:59.240]   Because you're a slave of the devil.
[00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:00.600]   The whole of humanity is.
[00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:04.040]   The devil is the god of this world.
[00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:07.840]   And you can't be a slave of the devil and a slave of God at the same time.
[00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:10.200]   You can't serve God and mammon.
[00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:13.040]   You can't be in the kingdom of Satan and the kingdom of God.
[00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:15.120]   We want to be in the kingdom of God.
[00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:17.320]   We want to be children of God and the people of God.
[00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:21.560]   Well, very well, I've got to get out of the clutches of the devil, and I can't do it,
[00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:25.200]   nor of sin and evil.
[00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:28.240]   But this precious one has done it for me.
[00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:34.280]   I lay in Zion, the chief cornerstone elect, precious.
[00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:39.800]   He met the devil in single and mortal combat more than once, and he defeated and routed
[00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:47.760]   him every time without any difficulty at all, tempted in all points like as we are, yet
[00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:48.760]   without sin.
[00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:49.760]   It's a tested stone.
[00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:52.520]   It's a tried stone.
[00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:58.440]   He met the devil and hell with all their malignity, hurled at him, and he routed them and defeated
[00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:02.980]   them in life and in death.
[00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:04.640]   This is how he saves me.
[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:07.280]   This is how he makes me one of the people of God.
[00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:08.840]   He's got to defeat these enemies.
[00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:10.440]   He's got to keep the law for me.
[00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:15.120]   He's got to defeat the enemy, the world and the flesh, and all hell that's set against
[00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:16.400]   me.
[00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:22.080]   He's done it all, but we haven't finished.
[00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:24.720]   What about my sin that I've already committed?
[00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:26.760]   What about the guilt that is upon me?
[00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:29.120]   Ah, thank God he's dealt with this.
[00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:32.000]   Did you notice the thing that Peter here mentions twice?
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:33.560]   Disallowed indeed of men.
[00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:36.920]   He means rejected of men, crucified of men.
[00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:41.000]   The stone which the builders disallowed, same thing.
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   The crucifixion.
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:46.040]   Men sent him to the cross.
[00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:49.400]   They condemned him with all their pomposity.
[00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:54.760]   The Jews and the Romans joined in doing it, and they nailed him to a tree, and he died
[00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:56.920]   and they buried him.
[00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:59.400]   How does that save me, says someone?
[00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:02.720]   You know what's happening there?
[00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:07.360]   What's your explanation of Christ's death upon the cross?
[00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:10.480]   Is that just the death of a martyr?
[00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:15.440]   Is that just the death of someone who talked in a very big way, but died in weakness?
[00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:18.440]   What's your view of that?
[00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:22.360]   Well I read to you that sermon of Peter on the day of Pentecost, in order that you might
[00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:23.360]   have the answer.
[00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:25.360]   This is how Peter puts it.
[00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:28.920]   "Ye men of Israel, hear these words.
[00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:34.280]   Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you, by miracles and wonders and signs which
[00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:37.800]   God did by him in the midst of you, as you yourselves also know."
[00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:38.800]   Listen.
[00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:39.800]   Him?
[00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:49.920]   "Being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, you have taken and
[00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:52.920]   by wicked hands have crucified and slain."
[00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:56.160]   That's it.
[00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:59.720]   Was it just men who crucified him?
[00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:02.440]   Is the death of Christ merely the action of men?
[00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:04.360]   No, no, says Peter.
[00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:11.240]   Him being delivered by the predeterminate counsel and foreknowledge of God.
[00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:20.320]   "Behold, I lay in Zion, a chief cornerstone, elect, precious."
[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:22.920]   That was the decision before the world was ever made.
[00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:24.240]   What's involved in that?
[00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:27.440]   Oh, his death upon the cross.
[00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:31.160]   Being delivered by the predeterminate counsel and foreknowledge of God.
[00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:32.640]   Men thought they were doing it all.
[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:35.460]   It was God who was really acting on Calvary.
[00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:37.840]   It was God who sent him to that.
[00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:39.360]   Listen to Paul putting that.
[00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:46.080]   "God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing unto them their
[00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:54.880]   trespasses; for he God hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we might
[00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:57.160]   be made the righteousness of God in him."
[00:49:57.160 --> 00:49:58.160]   What is happening on Calvary?
[00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:00.160]   Let John the Baptist answer.
[00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:06.640]   "Behold, the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world."
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:08.400]   He's God's Lamb.
[00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:10.640]   People are to take lambs, the Paschal Lamb.
[00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:14.280]   Kill him, paint the blood on the lintels and the doorposts.
[00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:17.240]   Ah, that was the action of men foreshadowing this.
[00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:19.760]   Here is God's Lamb.
[00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:22.960]   This is how God saves us through Christ.
[00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:27.800]   This is how God gives us this foundation stone which will never shift and which will mean
[00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:29.280]   that we'll never be confounded.
[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:33.920]   "God hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.
[00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:35.800]   By his stripes we are healed."
[00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:39.440]   Peter puts it at the end of this chapter, the very chapter we are considering.
[00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:46.520]   Verse 24, "Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we being
[00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:49.720]   dead to sins should live unto righteousness.
[00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:52.960]   By whose stripes we are healed.
[00:50:52.960 --> 00:51:00.200]   For ye were as sheep going astray, but ye are now returned unto the shepherd and bishop
[00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:01.200]   of your souls."
[00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:03.480]   Do you get it, my friend?
[00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:04.480]   That's how God does it.
[00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:07.960]   Elect, precious, before the foundation of the world.
[00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:08.960]   Calvary was planned.
[00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:09.960]   Why?
[00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:11.920]   It's the only way.
[00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:13.840]   Sin must be punished.
[00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:15.600]   God's holy nature demands it.
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:17.240]   He's done it.
[00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:22.160]   And because he's done it in him who alone was big enough and strong enough to take it,
[00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:24.760]   he offers us free pardon and forgiveness.
[00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:28.280]   Elect, precious, here's the foundation stone.
[00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:30.920]   And then his resurrection.
[00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:35.240]   "Disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God and precious."
[00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:41.840]   The stone which the builders disallowed has become the head of the corner.
[00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:43.840]   Raised again in resurrection.
[00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:44.840]   And what's that?
[00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:48.920]   Well, that's the way you see in which God declares that this was none other than his
[00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:49.920]   son.
[00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:51.840]   No one has ever written like this from the dead before.
[00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:57.680]   Here is the son of God, seed of David according to the flesh, but declared to be the son of
[00:51:57.680 --> 00:52:04.240]   God with power according to the spirit of holiness by the resurrection from the dead.
[00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:07.520]   He's conquered not only the devil, but hell and the grave.
[00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:09.520]   "O death, where is thy sting?
[00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:11.440]   O grave, where is thy victory?"
[00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:13.040]   That's why I'm not afraid of death.
[00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:15.440]   That's why I'm not afraid of the grave.
[00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:16.680]   Resurrection.
[00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:17.680]   He's conquered it.
[00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:18.800]   He's done it before me.
[00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:27.040]   He's gone beyond the veil, an anchor within the veil, the forerunner, even Jesus.
[00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:28.040]   What a theme.
[00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:32.520]   Are you surprised I preach long sermons?
[00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:36.600]   The amazing thing is that they're as short as they are.
[00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:41.520]   How monstrous, how ridiculous when we're handling things like this.
[00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:44.520]   I can't let you go without telling you this wonderful thing.
[00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:45.520]   Listen to this.
[00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:59.200]   "To whom coming, their son to a living stone, he's alive, not only crucified, dead, and
[00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:05.240]   buried, not only risen again, he ascended upon high, he's seated on the right hand
[00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:12.320]   of God in the glory, in the majesty eternal, a living stone, he's there.
[00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:16.600]   And he's there at this moment, and this is an essential part of his work on my behalf.
[00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:18.200]   How am I to live in this world?
[00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:23.240]   Even though I believe he died for me and I'm a new man, I need help, I need sustenance,
[00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:24.600]   I need strength.
[00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:31.960]   He is living, he ever liveth to make intercession for us, and that is why he saves us to the
[00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:37.800]   uttermost until everything is perfect and complete.
[00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:46.280]   He is our great high priest, he is our advocate, it is through him alone I can pray to God,
[00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:51.800]   to whom coming as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God and precious,
[00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:57.440]   he also as lively stones hath built up a spiritual house and holy priesthood, what for?
[00:53:57.440 --> 00:54:07.040]   To offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.
[00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:09.060]   You can't pray without him.
[00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:12.360]   If he was not living and there at the right hand of God, we couldn't pray.
[00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:14.480]   And what would you be like if you couldn't pray?
[00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:18.360]   When you're ill, when your loved one's ill, when there's death, when the bombs come, when
[00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:22.120]   war comes, when the end comes, what if you couldn't pray to God?
[00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:24.680]   But you can.
[00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:30.240]   You can offer up spiritual sacrifices which are acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.
[00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:34.840]   God heareth not sinners, but if you come in his name, he will listen to you, you will
[00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:35.840]   be accepted.
[00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:41.320]   And here he is between us and God, the one and only mediator.
[00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:42.320]   That's the message.
[00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:53.160]   Behold, I lay in Zion a chief cornerstone, elect, precious, and he that believeth on
[00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:58.960]   him shall not be confounded.
[00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:02.480]   How can you get to the place in which you'll never be confounded?
[00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:06.440]   Well here it is quite simply, isn't it?
[00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:12.920]   Do you believe what I've been saying and putting before you?
[00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:18.120]   You believe in him?
[00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:23.480]   You believe that Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God?
[00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:30.800]   You believe that he came into this world in order to save you by living a life of perfection,
[00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:36.920]   by defeating all your enemies, by bearing your sins and your punishment in his own body
[00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:42.360]   on the cross on Calvary's hill, by being buried in your grave, by conquering death
[00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:48.800]   and bursting asunder its bands and rising triumphantly and returning to God and there
[00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:50.520]   living to make intercession for you.
[00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:56.440]   Do you believe that?
[00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:59.920]   You either believe it or you don't.
[00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:06.880]   If you believe that, you're one of the people of God and you're on this foundation that
[00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:07.880]   can never be moved.
[00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:12.360]   You'll never be confounded, never.
[00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:20.600]   Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved.
[00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:23.920]   Whatever you've been in the past, it doesn't matter at all.
[00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:34.960]   You shall be saved and you'll be safe because he ever liveth to make intercession for you.
[00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:45.600]   Come if you've never come before to this living stone that was indeed disallowed of men but
[00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:55.960]   which is chosen of God and oh, how precious in all his glory and perfection.
[00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:56.960]   Come to him.
[00:56:56.960 --> 00:57:04.920]   Come unto the rock so that whatever may happen, you shall never be confounded.
[00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:05.920]   Come.
[00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:12.080]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
