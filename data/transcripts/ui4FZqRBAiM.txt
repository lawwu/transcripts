[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.980]   - All right, what do we got here?
[00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:08.600]   Who's our next question?
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.500]   - Next question's from Greg
[00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.000]   and it's about information overload.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.960]   - Hi Cal, I struggle with information overload.
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.060]   Basically, I think I read too much.
[00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.520]   All the amazing articles, books, papers,
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.760]   newsletters and blogs that are available by the thousands,
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.440]   no matter how narrow a person's interest is.
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.640]   I mean, I'm interested in programming Haskell
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.960]   and just for that, I have a dozen papers,
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.840]   three books and about 50 bookmarks.
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.320]   Even if I try to drive my reading backwards from goals
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.840]   and have a philosophy of just in time, not just in case,
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.880]   there are other reasons to read widely,
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.320]   like the responsibility of being a good citizen,
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.440]   the steward of family wealth,
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.000]   or even being the head of the household.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.920]   This all means keeping up is important
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.560]   and that involves a lot of general reading.
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.260]   Have you thought about this much?
[00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.900]   It seems like FOMO, but is less frivolous.
[00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:00.740]   Thank you.
[00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.880]   - Yeah, Greg, it's a good point.
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.560]   It sounds like you probably are reading too much,
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.260]   but more importantly,
[00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.100]   you're probably putting too much pressure on yourself
[00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.100]   about all these different things that you need to master.
[00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.900]   And so I'll give you a couple of practical suggestions
[00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.660]   for structuring what I think is like a reasonable,
[00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.380]   aggressive, but reasonable life of reading.
[00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.380]   So you have your books
[00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.820]   and you wanna read a fair number of books each month,
[00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:32.660]   that's fine.
[00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:33.480]   So you have some sort of goal like that.
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.140]   I read five, whatever you want your goal to be.
[00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.620]   Don't care too much about what they are,
[00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.220]   diverse different types of books, different genres, examples.
[00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.860]   So you're kind of keeping that intellectual life going.
[00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.540]   When it comes to mastering a topic,
[00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.420]   so you have a personality type, which is common,
[00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.700]   but not everyone has it,
[00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.180]   where you really like mastering a topic,
[00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.660]   reading a lot about a topic and mastering it.
[00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:55.660]   I think that's fine.
[00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.420]   And you wanna lean into that, but do it sequentially.
[00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.340]   Sequentially, it's a hard word.
[00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.900]   So what's the thing I'm trying to master now?
[00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.140]   Okay, I'm doing Haskell now,
[00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.500]   or there's a personal finance thing
[00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.780]   I'm gonna obsess about now,
[00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.240]   or I wanna learn about whatever,
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.840]   some new hobby or something like that.
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.420]   I think that's fine, but just do it one at a time.
[00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.020]   Like here's my obsession of the moment.
[00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.180]   And if that's your personality type,
[00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.660]   it's fine to have an obsession, but just do one at a time.
[00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.140]   And maybe have a nice place
[00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.260]   for actually keeping notes on that if you want.
[00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.620]   You can use some sort of system
[00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.420]   where you type up a lot of notes
[00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.960]   and keep track of them and do your research
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.660]   so that you're not losing that information, and that's fine.
[00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.340]   But you just do one of those things at a time,
[00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.260]   so you don't feel this pressure
[00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.980]   if I have to keep up with everything.
[00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.900]   So now, so we have books.
[00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.040]   I wanna keep reading books, wide variety.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.080]   Your singular obsession, only one at a time.
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.340]   Now that obsession might include books
[00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.780]   that will influence what some of your books are,
[00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:46.620]   but don't let your obsession
[00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.500]   take over your monthly book quota.
[00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.720]   The final thing to add in there
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.940]   is serendipitous, entertaining, or shorter form reading.
[00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.740]   So you have newsletters and magazines,
[00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.940]   and there's these type of things.
[00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.700]   And you find some benefit to this.
[00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.860]   A Cal Newport article that I get
[00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.740]   might get me thinking about this,
[00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.200]   and maybe I subscribe to Ben Thompson's "Strategery,"
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.820]   and that gives me some interesting insight
[00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.560]   into the world of business.
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.220]   And maybe you subscribe to "The New Yorker,"
[00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.260]   and there's a YouTube channel of someone you like to watch
[00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.100]   but it's more funny.
[00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.380]   So you have all this type of stuff too.
[00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:21.380]   So what do we do with that?
[00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.660]   And I would say for that third category,
[00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.560]   work backwards from time slots.
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.080]   So you see that all as programming,
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.620]   like on a TV channel, like HBO or something.
[00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.400]   And you put aside time you watch HBO.
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.860]   Like, okay, it's Saturday mornings,
[00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.080]   and I like to take a long lunch break on Fridays,
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.500]   or end my day early on Fridays, or whatever.
[00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.420]   Like you have it figured out.
[00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.500]   There's certain times where I just wanna expose myself,
[00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.660]   and I don't wanna overthink it,
[00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.700]   to the interesting, the random, the serendipitous,
[00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.220]   the funny, all what the internet has to offer.
[00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.300]   And maybe this is where social media comes into play too.
[00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.780]   There's this platform I like to go on.
[00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.620]   I follow these people, I wanna see what they're up to.
[00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.980]   Set the times, and then work backwards
[00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.300]   to what am I drawing from in those times?
[00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.380]   So when I'm out of time, I'm out of time.
[00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:05.780]   So that leads to a natural curation.
[00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.900]   Like, okay, well, I don't usually pull
[00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.300]   from these four podcasts, so I'm gonna stop,
[00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.140]   you know, listening to those.
[00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.460]   And these email newsletters I don't read,
[00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.100]   but I usually like this guy's email newsletter,
[00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.420]   so I'll keep subscribed to this guy,
[00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.060]   I'm not gonna subscribe to those.
[00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.780]   You can use tools like Flipboard, et cetera.
[00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.380]   There's a lot of tools like this where you go Instapaper,
[00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:24.980]   where you can kind of pull information
[00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.460]   from the web in various places
[00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.900]   into like a clean, easy format.
[00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:29.860]   You can put it on your tablet,
[00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.500]   and bring that tablet to the coffee shop,
[00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:32.700]   and that's where you sit and read.
[00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.340]   I'm a big fan of that, so pull it out of context.
[00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.900]   But you have a set amount of time,
[00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.540]   and that puts back a natural curation.
[00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:40.540]   For someone like you, Greg,
[00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.460]   that's interested in information, likes information,
[00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.580]   likes having obsessions, like understanding things,
[00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.860]   that's my three-pronged suggestion.
[00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.860]   Of a fixed number of books you read,
[00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.660]   have an obsession, but you only do one obsession at a time,
[00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.460]   and for the serendipitous, random, and funny,
[00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.340]   have set times you do that.
[00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.260]   And if it doesn't fit in that time, you don't get to it,
[00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.340]   and that will naturally curate
[00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.180]   what you actually pull from.
[00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.780]   Do those things, I think you have,
[00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.100]   you're keeping up with your responsibilities,
[00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.180]   you're keeping life interesting,
[00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.060]   you're gonna be exposed to a lot of interesting things,
[00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.700]   but you're not gonna have that stress
[00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.820]   of I can't keep up with everything,
[00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.660]   and you're not gonna have the accidental side effect
[00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.220]   of, let's say the frivolous or serendipitous
[00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.900]   takes over all your time from the deeper book
[00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.700]   you wanted to read, or the obsession gets in the way
[00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.100]   of anything interesting in your life.
[00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.460]   This gives you a nice balance.
