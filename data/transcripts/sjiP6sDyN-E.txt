[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.820]   Today, I want to turn our attention towards the world of
[00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:14.520]   careers, and do a core idea deep dive on the idea that you should
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:22.000]   not follow your passion. Here's a core idea. Don't follow your
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.360]   passion. Let me give some background here. What do I mean
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.240]   by don't follow your passion? Well, this all goes back to a
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.400]   book I published in 2012. It was called So Good They Can't Ignore
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:42.040]   You. And the whole premise of this book was to take a look
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.040]   from scratch at the core question of how do you end up
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.040]   loving what you do for a living. I wrote this book as a postdoc
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.920]   at MIT before I took my first professorship at Georgetown.
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.520]   Because professorships, if done right, is a job you have for
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.440]   life. My thinking was, if there was any time in which I would
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.180]   get a lot of leverage out of understanding what makes people
[00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.280]   end up loving what they do for a living, this was the time that
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.760]   I would get the most leverage out of it. This was the time I
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.320]   needed an answer to that question. This was a time in
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.800]   which I was cementing what my professional life was going to
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.960]   look like. And I said, I better understand how people end up
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.840]   loving their work before I start setting into stone career
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.800]   trajectories that are hard to otherwise later change. And so I
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.400]   went and I researched and wrote this book as a postdoc at MIT,
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.560]   trying to answer the question, how do people end up loving what
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.240]   they do? At the time, and continuing till today, the
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:43.000]   common answer to that question was follow your passion. That's
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.040]   by far the most common answer, especially in the American
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.680]   context. There are definitely some regional differences here,
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.600]   but definitely in the American context. It didn't take much
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.400]   pushing to realize that there are problems with this advice.
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.320]   Number one, a lot of people and by a lot, I mean, most don't
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.720]   have clearly defined pre existing passions that they can
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.600]   identify to then follow. Real issue if you talk to a bunch of
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.800]   let's say 22 year olds just coming out of school, and say,
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.800]   look, you got to follow your passion, or you're going to be
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.960]   you know, a miserable sad sack and say, well, what's my
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.400]   passion? I don't know. That's a problem. Second, there is not a
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.040]   lot of good evidence that matching the content of your
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.120]   work to a pre existing interest is a major driver of
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.240]   satisfaction in that job. We just assume that's true. That
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.960]   advice just assumes that true. Oh, I like this thing. So if I
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.200]   do that for my job, I'll like my job. But we actually don't have
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.760]   a lot of evidence that's true. We have a ton of evidence that
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.040]   other factors are much more important. Things like autonomy
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.520]   seems like mastery seems like impact things like connection.
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.360]   A lot of other things that are really important for job
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.040]   satisfaction have nothing to do with is the content of my work
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.040]   matching a pre existing interest. And we of course have
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.880]   plenty of counterexamples of people who build jobs out of
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.920]   hobbies and are miserable. I mean, these are cliches that the
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.520]   baker, the amateur baker who's miserable as a professional
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.760]   baker, the amateur photographer, who's miserable, doing six
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.520]   wedding photography gigs per week. This is so common, it's a
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.840]   cliche that when you take what you love and say, let me make a
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.240]   job about it, you no longer love that thing. And that's because
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.360]   the things that makes you really love a job is not me
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.080]   really like this topic. Me job now has this topic in it. Me now
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.120]   really like my job. It's way more complicated than that. The
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.960]   final issue I'll throw in a third here that I noticed when
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.200]   I was researching So Good They Can't Ignore You is that if you
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.520]   just go out there and grab a bunch of people who love what
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:53.200]   they do for a living, and look at their actual stories, nine
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.360]   times out of 10, they were not following a clear pre existing
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.120]   passion. So if this is the universal advice we give, you
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.840]   would expect that it's what most people who love their job
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.600]   did. That's why we give this advice. Most people don't. And
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.040]   the reality is when you just ask someone casually who loves
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.680]   their work, what's your advice? And they say, follow your
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:19.280]   passion. What they really mean is follow the goal of ending up
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.080]   passionate about your work. They don't mean identifying
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.840]   advance what you're passionate about, match that to your job,
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.280]   and then you will love your work. That's not really what
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.040]   they mean. It's not really what they did. It's just a
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.600]   shorthand. But we interpret it as meaning we're wired to do
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.760]   one thing, match our work to that one thing, then we will
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.080]   love our work. That's not actually the way it works. And
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.480]   you know what, we can't blame people for falling back on that
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.280]   shorthand, because the reality of what really matters for
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.440]   building a career love is complicated. We're about to get
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.280]   into it took me a year of research to really untangle this
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.440]   storyline. So we should not expect it when we grab some
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.480]   entrepreneur in a magazine interview and say, what's your
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.320]   advice that they'll have this all figured out? They just say
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.400]   follow your passion, but they don't really mean it, because
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.680]   it's not really what they did. They followed the goal about
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.680]   being passionate about their work and how they got there was
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.880]   complicated. All right, let's get into it. How do you get
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:15.840]   there? What I uncovered in my work is that the skill that the
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.520]   what we call attributes of a job that makes it great, the
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.000]   properties of a career that makes it something that you
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.680]   love, are almost always in demand. They're rare and
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.920]   valuable, most jobs don't have them. And so if you want those,
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.400]   if you want those in your job, you have to have something rare
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.720]   and valuable to offer in return. The world doesn't care
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.280]   that you want to be happy in your job, and you think those
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.880]   things will be good for you, and you just want them in your
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.880]   job, it doesn't care, you have to have something to offer in
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.680]   return. And almost always the things you have to offer in
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.480]   return is rare and valuable skills. So if you want the rare
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.440]   and valuable traits that makes great jobs great in your job,
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.480]   you have to have rare and valuable skills to offer in
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:03.520]   exchange. And therefore the whole game in building a career
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.880]   you love is skill acquisition. Step one, get really good at
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:11.280]   things. Step two, use those skills as leverage to shape
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.920]   your career towards the elements that resonate in a way
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.320]   from the elements that don't. Get good uses leverage, get
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.040]   better uses even bigger leverage. You cultivate over
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.280]   time a career that then is a real source of meaning and
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.160]   satisfaction for you. It has nothing to do for nine out of
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:29.920]   10 people with leaving college at 22 and saying, I am wired,
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.400]   and I just know this, I've known this my whole life, I am
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.680]   wired to be a social media brand manager for a major hotel
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.800]   chain. If I could just go get that job, I'm going to be
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.200]   passionate. And if I don't, I'm going to be miserable. It's not
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.240]   how it works. Get good uses leverage, get good use as
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.440]   leverage. I ended up calling this career capital theory.
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:51.920]   My metaphor is, as you get good at things that are rare and
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.040]   valuable, you are acquiring more career capital, you then
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.720]   must invest that capital to get returns in your job that are
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.880]   positive. So I use that metaphor of career capital.
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:08.240]   Two quick follow up. One, how do you do that? How do you get
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.400]   good at things? How do you build rare and valuable skills?
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.920]   The short answer is deliberate practice. You need to very
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:17.120]   careful, carefully figure out what's valuable in your current
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:22.640]   career or job area, and then train to get better at that
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.680]   deliberately like an athlete adding a new jump shot to the
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.640]   repertoire or a chess player mastering a new in game
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:34.320]   strategy. Specific activities designed to stretch you past
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.560]   where you're comfortable on things you know are valuable.
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.520]   You got to be training yourself to get better. That's how you
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.600]   get career capital fast. That's how you move towards passion
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:46.560]   very quickly. Two, how do you know what to do with that career
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:51.600]   capital? How do you know, like, what do I want to invest that
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.640]   career capital to get in exchange? When I, when I say you
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:57.040]   want to invest that capital to move your work towards things
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:00.480]   that resonate and away from things that don't, you might be
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.520]   suspicious that I'm just being circular here. And somehow it
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.520]   all comes back to some pre-existing passion. But no,
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.680]   it's much more complicated here. What do I mean by moving
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:09.680]   your work towards things that resonate away from things that
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:13.840]   don't? What you need to do here is what we call on this show,
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:19.200]   lifestyle centric career planning. You have to, through
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:24.160]   reflection and experimentation, fix in your mind a very clear
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.280]   image of what you want your life to be like. All the elements
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:30.000]   of your life. You're really like imagining typical days in a
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.320]   way that just, you feel this intimations of that's right.
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:35.040]   That's what I want my life to be like. Where do you live? What
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:37.840]   type of place do you live? Where are you working? How much
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.840]   work are you doing? What else are you doing with your time?
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:42.080]   What's happening with your family or your community? Are
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.720]   you in the woods all day? Are you in a high rise? Are you in
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:47.200]   this vision? Are you a master of the universe type that's
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.720]   making deals and moving things? Or are you a Bill McKibben type
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:55.040]   cross-country skiing in the snow for three weeks before
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.120]   writing one article the next week? You really just want to
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:01.200]   have this feel of what type of lifestyle resonates with me as
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:07.440]   deep. What I want. And then you work backwards from that. Okay.
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:10.160]   What I'm trying to do now is build up rare and valuable
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.240]   skills in my job so that I have leverage and then use that
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.880]   leverage to shape the way my work unfolds. What I work on,
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:18.080]   when I work on, the arrangement for my work, all of that. So it
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:21.040]   is pushing me more towards this image of the optimal
[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:24.560]   lifestyle for me and away from things that are contrary to
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:27.440]   that to that lifestyle. So you're working backwards from a
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:30.560]   clear image of a lifestyle. And the way you get there is not by
[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:33.680]   saying at 22 to your boss, I want to live in the woods. I
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:36.560]   want a lot of free time. I'm going to cross-country ski all
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:40.160]   day. So I want my work to be just stuff I'm interested in.
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.080]   And I only work on on Monday and Fridays and they get paid
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:46.720]   really well. The boss will say in that context, that's great.
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:50.240]   Good luck with that. Can you get your stuff off the desk
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.160]   there? Because the person we just hired to replace you is
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.800]   here and they need to get back to work. That's not how you do
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.760]   it. How you do it is you become so good. You can't be ignored.
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.480]   They're desperate to keep you. And now you're able to start
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:04.720]   adjusting. Well, you know, I'm going to work part-time or I
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.800]   don't do this type of work that goes to the entry level. I'm
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:10.400]   not at the entry level anymore or pay me by my performance. I
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.720]   want to shift to a pseudo consulting type contract. You
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:16.720]   pay me by my performance. All of that requires. I have gotten
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:20.880]   very good and that requires that you train. All right. So
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:23.920]   let me pull together these pieces. This is not as sexy as
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:27.680]   the Disney version fairy tale of you were wired for one job.
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:31.440]   And if you can figure out what that is, there will be fairy
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.520]   dust in the air and you'll be happy in your career from then
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:36.400]   on out. And conversely, if you don't like your job, if you
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.080]   find it hard, or there's anything that's hard about it,
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.720]   that's because you have the wrong position. You just quit
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.360]   and try something else. You're almost there. Then everything
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:46.800]   will be easy when you get the right job. The storyline I'm
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.680]   going to give you is much harder than that, but it actually
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.560]   works. So the compress everything I just said here,
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:57.120]   don't obsess too much about what job you take. Yes, the
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:00.720]   choice matters, but you know, any job that matches your
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.560]   interest in some sense, and it's going to give you good
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:04.480]   options. If, and when you get better is good enough. Don't
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:07.360]   obsess over them dream job or having just the right job to
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:11.200]   train like an athlete, what matters. I'm going to
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:14.720]   systematically improve that skill. No one else in your job
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.560]   is going to be doing that. So you're going to start getting
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:21.680]   advantages opening up really soon. Three, use the resulting
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:26.320]   career capital to as leverage to push your career towards
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.240]   things that resonate and things and away from things that
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:31.520]   don't. And you, your compass for that is lifestyle centric
[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:34.240]   career planning, very clear image of what you want your
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.720]   days to be like all the elements of your days. And so
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.760]   what can I do to make my life more like that and get away
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.400]   from the stuff that gets in the way, do those three things,
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:46.640]   give yourself five years, you will probably be pretty happy
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:48.560]   in your job, give yourself another five years, you might
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.880]   be downright passionate about it. But then just what you
[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:53.760]   have to do for me is when someone fresh out of college
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.480]   looks up at you and says, well, how did you do it? How do
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:59.840]   you have this cool job where you ski all day or whatever?
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:03.600]   Don't just say, follow your passion. Say, it's kind of
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:07.360]   complicated. Go watch this video at Cal Newport's YouTube
