[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Okay, so tomorrow on Tuesday, the 21st of February,
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.600]   I'm going to be introducing a talk or a webinar
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.640]   on the OP SAC, so the OpenAI Pinecone SAC.
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.120]   I'm just gonna be giving my thoughts on,
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.440]   I suppose, industry that we find ourselves in.
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.440]   You know, it's exciting times, there's a lot to talk about.
[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.200]   And I'm also then going to be joined by a couple of people
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.160]   that are actually using the OP SAC in production.
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.800]   So I think that would be pretty interesting
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.880]   to see what they're actually doing with the OP SAC.
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.280]   So I think that'll be really cool.
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.120]   If you are obviously interested in large-range models,
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.640]   joint AI, drivel augmentation,
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.040]   I think it will probably be pretty interesting
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.200]   for you as well.
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.600]   So if you'd like to join, I will leave a link
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.440]   to the webinar registration in the comments below,
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.760]   and hopefully I will see you there.
