[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.520]   Rob Portman, a Republican senator from Ohio, wrote a commentary published today in the
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:10.880]   Columbus Dispatch.
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.200]   Formerly, Senator Portman opposed marriage for same-sex couples.
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.000]   Now today he has switched his view on this and claims he changed his view in part because
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.680]   of his faith and because of what he reads in the Bible.
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.360]   As you can imagine, this is causing quite a stir online.
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.320]   Pastor John, what are your thoughts on Senator Portman's editorial today?
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:36.880]   Rob Portman has said that for conservative reasons, like the Prime Minister David Cameron,
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:43.880]   now he's going to switch his view from supporting traditional man-woman marriage to supporting
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.840]   so-called same-sex marriage.
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:57.640]   It's a very sad article and I just want to flag two things that he said which I think
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:06.080]   are very serious for us to think about, watch for, be aware of, that are swaying people
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.600]   in that direction.
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:20.120]   His son came out as having same-sex attraction and he says that, this is a quote, "I'm
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:29.480]   a dad who wants all three of his kids to lead happy, meaningful lives with people they love,
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.960]   a blessing Jane and I have shared for 26 years."
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:46.760]   He infers from that that for his son to be happy, he must be given the right to marry
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.560]   so-called another man.
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:59.080]   So he's elevating happiness, as he understands it, above biblical guidelines of what makes
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.080]   you happy.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:08.800]   The first observation I have is the absolutizing of self-defined long-term happiness as opposed
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:15.080]   to God's definition of long-term happiness is right at the heart of how people are changing
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.800]   their minds here.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:23.680]   They're simply abstracting the term happiness out of its biblical context and definition,
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.600]   giving it a meaning that they want and then using it as a warrant to justify a certain
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.400]   kind of relationship that the Bible proscribes.
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:40.680]   That's observation number one, absolutizing self-defined long-term happiness as you see
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.720]   it over against God's definition.
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.280]   Here's the second observation.
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:54.080]   He then goes on to say, "For me, it came down to the Bible's overarching themes of love
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:03.880]   and compassion and my belief that we are all children of God."
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.840]   What's happening there is that a hermeneutical strategy, a way of interpreting the Bible,
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.040]   is being used.
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:20.240]   I would call it the absolutizing of self-defined biblical themes in such a way that they nullify
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.520]   biblical particulars or biblical commands.
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:31.120]   So he takes compassion and he takes love, he defines them his own way, then he brings
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:38.160]   that definition to 1 Corinthians 6 where it says that those who act out their homosexual
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:44.400]   desires will not go to heaven, and he says, "We won't live by that.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.560]   It can't mean that, or I won't accept that."
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:53.960]   But he's nullifying biblical commands and biblical particulars by absolutizing his definition
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.920]   of broader biblical themes.
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.680]   So those two things are what is at work over and over again in this whole debate, and have
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.240]   been at work, of course, for generations.
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.640]   I just want to alert the folks who listen to this to watch for that.
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:15.840]   Where is there a self-defined view of happiness that is then used to justify making a person
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.240]   happy without regard to biblical guidelines?
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:26.480]   And secondly, where is there a way of interpreting the Bible so that self-defined big biblical
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.040]   themes are used to cancel out particular biblical commands?
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:39.240]   So I think if we Christians are alert to the kind of illegitimate uses that are being made
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:45.560]   of the Bible in this way, we might be more cautious, more careful, and not be swept away
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:51.080]   quite as easily into unbiblical ways of life.
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:58.280]   And what's so tragic about this is that if the Bible is really true, according to 1 Corinthians
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.240]   6, for example, 9 and 10, that those who do such things, that is, those who go ahead and
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:09.440]   practice same-sex sexual relations, will not enter the kingdom.
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:15.400]   This is not love, it's not compassion, and it's not going to lead to happiness, and that's
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.400]   tragic.
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.280]   Thank you, Pastor John.
