[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800]   Hey, can you introduce yourself?
[00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.600]   I'm Luan Johnson, pastor of Grace Bible Church of Oxnard.
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.960]   All right, and Luan, you've been reading the LSB for a bit.
[00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.360]   What do you think?
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.520]   Love the LSB.
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:16.400]   And it's clear, it's simple, and my family loves it.
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.800]   So I had no choice but to jump on it fully.
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.840]   How long have you been preaching from it?
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.240]   I've been preaching from it now for about six months
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.600]   and trying to get our church adjusted from the NASB 95
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.520]   into the legacy.
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.960]   So it's been a very smooth transition.
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.000]   And has there been a particular passage
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.960]   that you've really enjoyed, the highlights of the LSB,
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.360]   where accuracy or precision, consistency comes into play?
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.160]   It's in Jude, I believe it's verse 5, 6,
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.760]   where it talks about in the NASB,
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.200]   it says the Lord has delivered a people from slavery,
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   from Egypt, but the LSB uses Jesus,
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.320]   which is a more accurate translation.
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.080]   Yeah, I like that a lot.
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.200]   Thanks for sharing with us.
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.760]   Appreciate it.
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.360]   You're very welcome.
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:05.860]   Thank you.
[00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.200]   And how many LSB Bibles do you own?
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.840]   I'm going to just say this.
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.200]   My wife tells me there's greater addictions
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.520]   in the world than mine.
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.160]   So I'll just leave it at that.
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.520]   Thank you.
