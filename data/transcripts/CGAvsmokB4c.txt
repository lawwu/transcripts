[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880]   The following is a conversation with Clara Souza Silva,
[00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.880]   a quantum master chemist at Harvard,
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.560]   specializing in spectroscopy of gases
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.180]   that serve as possible signs of life on other planets,
[00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.160]   most especially the gas phosphine.
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.120]   She was a co-author of the paper that in 2020
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.340]   found that there is phosphine in the atmosphere of Venus
[00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.560]   and thus possible extraterrestrial life
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.800]   that lives in its atmosphere.
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.880]   The detection of phosphine was challenged, reaffirmed,
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.640]   and is now still under active research.
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.280]   Quick mention of our sponsors,
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.960]   Onnit, Grammarly, Blinkist, and Indeed.
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.320]   Check them out in the description to support this podcast.
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.080]   As a side note, let me say that I think the search for life
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.840]   on other planets is one of the most important endeavors
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:47.920]   in science.
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.560]   If we find extraterrestrial life and study it,
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.200]   we may find insights into the mechanisms
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.480]   that originated life here on Earth,
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.200]   and more than life, the mechanisms that originated
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.680]   intelligence and consciousness.
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.240]   If we understand these mechanisms, we can build them.
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.280]   But more than this, the discovery of life on other planets
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.800]   means that our galaxy and our universe is teeming with life.
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.840]   This is humbling and terrifying, but it is also exciting.
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.800]   We humans are natural explorers.
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.600]   For most of our history, we explored the surface of the Earth
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.720]   and the contents of our minds.
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.200]   But now, with space-faring vessels,
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.740]   we have a chance to explore life beyond Earth,
[00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.880]   their physics, their biology,
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.120]   and perhaps the contents of their minds.
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.320]   This is the Lux Friedman Podcast,
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.740]   and here is my conversation with Clara Sousa Silva.
[00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:44.120]   Since you're the world expert in, well, in many things,
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.800]   but one of them is phosphine,
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.040]   would it technically be correct
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.920]   to call you the Queen of Phosphine?
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.200]   - I go for Dr. Phosphine.
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.880]   Queen is an inherited title, I feel.
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.880]   - But you still rule by love and power,
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.320]   but while having the doctor title.
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.480]   I got it. - Kindness.
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.660]   - Kindness, kindness.
[00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.300]   In September 2020, you co-authored a paper
[00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.440]   announcing possible presence of phosphine
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.320]   in the atmosphere of Venus,
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.320]   and that it may be a signature of extraterrestrial life.
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.000]   - Big maybe.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.960]   - Big maybe.
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.240]   There was some pushback, of course,
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.200]   from the scientific community that followed.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.120]   Friendly, loving pushback.
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.280]   Then in January, another paper from University of Wisconsin,
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.360]   I believe, confirmed the finding.
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.480]   So where do we stand in this saga,
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.560]   in this mystery of what the heck is going on on Venus
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.220]   in terms of phosphine and in terms of aliens?
[00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.600]   - Okay, let's try to break it down.
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.940]   The short answer is we don't know.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.720]   I think you and the rest of the public
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.020]   are now witnessing a pretty exciting discovery,
[00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.400]   but as it evolves, as it unfolds,
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.040]   we did not wait until we had years of data
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.400]   from 10 different instruments
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.040]   across several layers of the atmosphere.
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.200]   We waited until we had two telescopes
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.840]   with independent data months apart.
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.800]   But still, the data is weak, it's noisy, it's delicate,
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.480]   it's very much at the edge
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.360]   of instrument sensibility, sensitivity.
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.080]   And so we still don't even know if it is phosphine.
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.480]   We don't even really know if the signal is real.
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.600]   People still disagree about that.
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.040]   And I think at the more philosophical end
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.160]   of how this happened, I think it is a distinction,
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.840]   and myself and other co-authors were talking about this,
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.520]   it's a distinction between hypotheses generation
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.520]   and hypotheses testing.
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.560]   Now, hypothesis testing is something that I think
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.080]   is the backbone of the scientific method,
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.480]   but it has a problem, which is if you're looking
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.440]   through very noisy data and you wanna test the hypotheses,
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.400]   you may by mistake create a spurious signal.
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.960]   The safest, more conservative approach
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.680]   is hypothesis generation.
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.520]   You see some data and you go,
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.920]   what's in there with no bias?
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.000]   Now, this is much safer, much more conservative.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.880]   And when there's a lot of data, that's great.
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.920]   When there isn't, you can clean the noise
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.280]   and take out the signal with it.
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.080]   The signal with a bathwater,
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.200]   whatever the equivalent of the analogy would be.
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.400]   And so I think the healthy discourse
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.240]   that you described is exactly this.
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.520]   There are ways of processing the data,
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:40.640]   completely legitimate ways,
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.840]   checked by multiple people and experts,
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.720]   where the signal shows up and then phosphine
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.640]   is in the atmosphere of Venus,
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.080]   and somewhere it doesn't.
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.400]   And then we disagree what that signal means.
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.520]   If it's real and it is an ambiguously phosphine,
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.520]   it is very exciting because we don't know
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.880]   how to explain it without life.
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.800]   But going from there to Venusians is still a huge jump.
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.120]   And so- - Venusians.
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.800]   So that would be the title for the civilization
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.200]   if it is a living and thriving on Venus's Venusians.
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.120]   - Until we know what they call themselves
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.520]   and that's the name, yes.
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.960]   - So this is the early analysis of data
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.320]   or analysis of early data.
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.600]   It was nevertheless, you waited until
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.680]   the actual peer-reviewed publication to-
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.320]   - Of course, and analysis of the two different instruments
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.840]   months apart, so that's ALMA and JCMT, the two telescopes.
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.200]   - I mean, it's still, I mean, it's really exciting.
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.360]   What did it feel like sort of sitting on this data?
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.440]   Like kind of anticipating the publication
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.360]   and wondering and still wondering, is it true?
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.560]   Like how does it make you feel that a planet
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.880]   in our solar system might have phosphine in the atmosphere?
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.800]   - It's nuts, it's absolutely nuts.
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.440]   - In a- (laughs)
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.520]   - I mean- - In the best possible way?
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.820]   - I've been working on phosphine for over a decade.
[00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.000]   - Before it was cool.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.560]   - Way before it was cool.
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.160]   Before anyone could spell it or heard of it.
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.560]   And at the time people either didn't know what phosphine was
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.400]   or only knew it for being just possibly
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.720]   the most horrendous molecule that ever graced the earth.
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.320]   And so no one was a fan.
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.800]   And I had been considering looking for it
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.480]   because I did think it was an unusual and disgusting
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.840]   but very promising sign of life.
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.120]   I've been looking for it everywhere.
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.320]   I really didn't think to look in the solar system.
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:47.320]   I thought it was all pretty rough around here for life.
[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:52.480]   And so I wasn't even considering the solar system at all,
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.120]   nevermind next door Venus.
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.840]   It was only the lead author of the study, Jane Greaves,
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.400]   who thought to look in the clouds of Venus
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.860]   and then reached out to me to say,
[00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:05.280]   I don't know phosphine, but I know it's weird.
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.680]   How weird is it?
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.000]   And the answer is very weird.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.800]   - And so the telescopes were looking at,
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.200]   this is visual data.
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.400]   - That's what I mean by visual.
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.880]   You wouldn't see the phosphine.
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:18.920]   - Well, but I mean, it's a telescope.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:19.760]   - It's remote.
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:20.800]   - It's remote.
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.760]   You're observing, you're what,
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.800]   zooming in on this particular planet.
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.840]   I mean, what does the sensor actually look like?
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.680]   How many pixels are there?
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.720]   What does the data kind of look like?
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:36.020]   It'd be nice to kind of build up intuition
[00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:40.080]   of how little data we have based on which.
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.920]   I mean, if you look at like,
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.520]   I've just been reading a lot about gravitational waves
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:48.560]   and it's kind of incredible how from just very little,
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.600]   like probably the world's most precise instrument,
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.320]   we can derive some very foundational ideas
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.280]   about our early universe.
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.480]   And in that same way, it's kind of incredible
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:03.080]   how much information you can get from just a few pixels.
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.440]   So what are we talking about here
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:09.600]   in terms of based on which this paper
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:13.560]   saw possible signs of phosphine in the atmosphere?
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.480]   - So phosphine, like every other molecule,
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:18.160]   has a unique spectroscopic fingerprint,
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.880]   meaning it rotates and it vibrates in special ways.
[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:25.040]   I calculated how many of those ways it can rotate
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:28.520]   and vibrate in 16.8 billion ways.
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:32.320]   What this means is that if you look at the spectrum of light
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.820]   and that light has gone through phosphine gas
[00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:39.820]   on the other end, there should be 16.8 billion tiny marks
[00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:43.840]   left, indentations left in that spectrum.
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:48.840]   We found one of those on Venus, one of those 16.8 billion.
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:53.320]   So now the game is, can we find any of the other ones?
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:54.160]   - Yeah.
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:55.080]   - But they're really hard to spot.
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.080]   They're all in terrible places
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.560]   in the electromagnetic spectrum.
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:02.440]   And the instruments we use to find this one
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:04.320]   can't really find any other one.
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:07.020]   There's another one of the 16.8 billion we could find,
[00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:10.460]   but it would take many, many days of continuous observations
[00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:13.160]   and that's not really in the cards right now.
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.500]   - I mean, how do you, there's all kinds of noise,
[00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:16.340]   first of all.
[00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:17.160]   - Yes.
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.820]   - There's all kinds of other signal.
[00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:24.500]   So how do you separate all of that out
[00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:28.520]   to pull out just this particular signature
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.960]   that's associated with phosphine?
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.840]   - So the data kind of looks somewhat like a wave
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.760]   and a lot of that is noise and it's a baseline.
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.400]   And so if you can figure out the exact shape of the wave,
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.120]   you can cancel that shape out
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:44.240]   and you should be left with a straight line
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:48.760]   and if there's something there, an absorption, so a signal.
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:49.600]   So that's what we did.
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.680]   We tried to find out what was this baseline shape,
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:54.760]   cleaned it out and got the signal.
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:55.600]   That's part of the problem.
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.940]   If you do this wrong, you can create a signal.
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:03.640]   But that signal is at 8.904 wave numbers
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:06.960]   and we actually have more digits than that,
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.240]   but I don't remember by heart.
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:12.520]   And an ALMA in particular is a very, very good telescope,
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:15.080]   array of telescopes and it can focus
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.840]   on exactly that frequency.
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:20.160]   And in that frequency, there are only two known molecules
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.360]   that absorb it all.
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:23.320]   So that's how we do it.
[00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:27.200]   We look at that exact spot where we know phosphine absorbs.
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.680]   The other molecule is SO2.
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:32.520]   - If there is extraterrestrial life,
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:36.160]   whether it's on Venus or on exoplanets
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:40.440]   where you looked before, how does that make you feel?
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.200]   How should it make us feel?
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.280]   Should we be scared?
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:44.740]   Should we be excited?
[00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:47.840]   Let's say it's not intelligent life.
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.220]   Let's say it's microbial life.
[00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:53.240]   Is it a threat to us?
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:54.920]   Are we a threat to it?
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.680]   Or is it only, not only, but mostly,
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:00.600]   possibly to understand something fundamental,
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:04.200]   something beautiful about life in the universe?
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.040]   - Hard to know.
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:07.080]   You would have to bring on a poet
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.860]   or a philosopher on the show.
[00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:11.640]   - You don't feel--
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:12.720]   - I feel those things.
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.880]   I just don't know if those are the right things to feel.
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.520]   I don't, certainly don't feel scared.
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:19.000]   I think it's rather silly to feel scared.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.720]   Definitely don't touch them.
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:24.680]   Sometimes in the movies, don't go near it.
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.240]   Don't interfere.
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:31.240]   I think one of the things with Venus is because of phosphine
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:35.200]   now there is a chance that Venus is inhabited.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:38.920]   And in that case, we shouldn't go there.
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:42.920]   We should be very careful with messing with them,
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:46.780]   bringing our own stuff there that contaminates it.
[00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:49.600]   And Venus has suffered enough.
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.680]   If there's life there,
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:54.640]   it's probably the remains of a living planet
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:59.040]   the very last survivors of what once was
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.800]   potentially a thriving world.
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:03.120]   And so I don't want our first interaction
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:06.600]   with alien life to be massacre.
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.560]   So I definitely wouldn't want to go near out of a,
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:13.400]   let's say galactic responsibility, galactic ethics.
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:17.200]   And I often think of alien astronomers watching us
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:20.440]   and how disappointed they would be if we messed this up.
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:23.360]   So I really want to be very careful
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:25.060]   with anything that could be life.
[00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:28.040]   But certainly I wouldn't be scared.
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:30.320]   Humans are plenty capable of killing one another.
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:34.560]   We don't need extraterrestrial help to destroy ourselves.
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:36.000]   - Scared mostly of other humans.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:36.840]   - Exactly.
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:40.320]   - But this life, if there is life there,
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:43.100]   it does seem just like you said, it would be pretty rugged.
[00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:46.700]   It's like the cockroaches or Chuck Norris.
[00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:47.540]   I don't know.
[00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:50.880]   It's some kind of, it's something that survived
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:53.080]   through some very difficult conditions.
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.680]   That doesn't mean it would handle us.
[00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:58.120]   It could be like war of the worlds.
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:01.280]   You come just because you're resilient in your own planet
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:02.880]   doesn't mean you can survive another.
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:06.000]   Even our extremophiles, which are very impressive,
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.480]   we should all be very proud of our extremophiles.
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:11.920]   They wouldn't really make it in the Venetian clouds.
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.960]   So I wouldn't expect, because you're tough,
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.880]   even Chuck Norris tough,
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:19.600]   that you would survive on an alien planet.
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:22.320]   - And then from the scientific perspective,
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:26.360]   you don't want to pollute the data gathering process
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:27.880]   by showing up there.
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:31.760]   The observer can affect the observed.
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:32.840]   - How heartbreaking would it be
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:34.280]   if we found life on another planet
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:37.120]   and then we're like, oh, we brought it with us.
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:38.280]   It was my sandwich.
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:40.480]   - But that's always the problem, right?
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.120]   And it's certainly a problem with Mars
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:47.120]   because we visited, if there is life on Mars
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:49.880]   or like remains of life on Mars,
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:51.920]   it's always going to be a question of like,
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:53.600]   well, maybe we planted it there.
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:54.960]   - Let's not do the same with Venus.
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:57.520]   It's harder 'cause when we try to go to Venus,
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:59.120]   things melt very quickly.
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:03.960]   And so it's a little harder to pollute Venus.
[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:08.000]   It's very good at destroying foreigners.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.840]   - Yeah, well, in terms of Elon Musk and terraforming planets,
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:15.320]   Mars is stop number one, then Venus maybe after that.
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:19.520]   So can we talk about phosphine a little bit?
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:20.360]   So you mentioned it's a pretty--
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.800]   - I love phosphine.
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:23.640]   - What's your Twitter handle?
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:24.840]   It's like Dr. Phosphine?
[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.360]   - It's Dr. Phosphine, yes.
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:27.320]   You'll be surprised here.
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:28.440]   It wasn't taken already.
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.360]   I could just, I just grabbed it.
[00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.800]   Didn't have to buy it off anyone.
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:34.840]   - Yeah, so what is it?
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:36.360]   What's phosphine?
[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:40.720]   You already mentioned it's pretty toxic and troublesome.
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:42.760]   What, and--
[00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:43.600]   - Troublesome.
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:44.640]   - Troublesome, sorry.
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:45.480]   - No, I love it.
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.440]   I'm gonna stop calling it troublesome.
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:51.120]   - The, so maybe what are some things
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:53.880]   that make it interesting chemically
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:58.240]   and why is it a good sign of life
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.280]   when it's present in the atmosphere?
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:02.240]   Like you've described in your paper,
[00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:06.200]   aptly titled the phosphine as a biosignature gas
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:08.280]   in exoplanet atmospheres.
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:10.960]   I suppose you wrote that paper before Venus.
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:11.800]   - I did, yes.
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:13.480]   I did.
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:14.440]   And no one cared.
[00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:16.440]   You know, in that paper I said something like,
[00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:19.080]   if we find phosphine on any terrestrial planet
[00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:20.160]   can only mean life.
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:21.520]   And everyone's like, yeah, that sounds about right.
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:22.360]   Let's go.
[00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:24.400]   And then Venus shows up and I was like, are you sure?
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:27.600]   I'm like, I was sure before I was sure.
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:31.680]   Now that it's right here, I'm less sure
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:35.760]   now that my claims are being tested.
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:38.600]   So phosphine, phosphine is a fascinating molecule.
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:41.920]   So it's shaped like a pyramid with a phosphorus up top
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:43.840]   and then three hydrogens.
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:46.400]   It's actually quite a simple molecule in many ways.
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:50.760]   And you know, it's the most popular elements in the universe
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:54.720]   carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur.
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:57.480]   When you add hydrogen to them, it makes quite simple,
[00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:59.800]   quite famous molecules.
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.920]   You do it to oxygen, you get water.
[00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:03.920]   You do it to carbon, you get methane.
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:06.000]   You do it to nitrogen, you get ammonia.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.280]   These are all molecules people have heard of.
[00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:11.280]   But you do it to phosphorus, you get phosphine.
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:12.680]   People haven't heard of phosphine
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:15.640]   because it's not really popular on earth.
[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:19.120]   We really shouldn't find it anywhere on earth
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:22.240]   because it is extremely toxic to life.
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:24.800]   It interacts with oxygen metabolism
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:29.800]   and everything you know and love uses oxygen metabolism
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:31.680]   and it interacts fatally.
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:35.360]   So it kills in several very imaginative
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.600]   and very macabre ways.
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:41.040]   So it was used as a chemical warfare agent
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:43.760]   in the first world war and most recently by ISIS.
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:47.040]   So really bad, most life avoids it.
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.520]   Even life that might not avoid it.
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:53.320]   So life that doesn't use oxygen metabolism, anaerobic life
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:56.040]   still has to put crazy amounts of effort into making it.
[00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:58.080]   It's a really difficult molecule to make
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.280]   thermodynamically speaking.
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:01.600]   It's really difficult to make that phosphorus
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:04.000]   want to be together with that hydrogen.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.600]   So it's horrible, everyone avoids it.
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:08.680]   When they're not avoiding it,
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:10.400]   it's extremely difficult to make.
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.160]   You would have to put energy in,
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.040]   sacrifice energy to make it.
[00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:16.920]   And if you did go through all that trouble and made it,
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:20.560]   it gets reacted with the radicals in the atmosphere
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:22.120]   and gets destroyed.
[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:24.360]   So we shouldn't find it anywhere and yet we do.
[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:29.360]   It's kind of weird molecule that seems to be made by life
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:31.520]   and we don't even know why.
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:33.520]   Life clearly finds a use for it.
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:35.280]   It's not the only molecule that life is willing
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:36.600]   to sacrifice energy to make,
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.680]   but we don't know how or why life is even making it.
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:44.560]   So absolutely mysterious, absolutely deadly,
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:46.840]   smells horrifically when it's made,
[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:48.800]   it produces other kind of diphosphenes
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:51.320]   and it's been reported as smelling like
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.760]   garlicky fishy death.
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:56.440]   Once someone referred to it as smelling like the,
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:57.560]   let me see if I remember,
[00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:00.600]   the rancid diapers of the spawn of Satan.
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:01.520]   - Oh, very nice.
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:03.440]   - Yeah, very, very vivid.
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:04.280]   And so-
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:05.800]   - See, you're a poet after all.
[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:08.040]   - I didn't call that, someone else did.
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:10.560]   And so it's just this horrific molecule
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:13.920]   that it is produced by life, we don't know why.
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:15.720]   And when it is produced by life
[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.720]   is done with enormous sacrifice
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:22.360]   and the universe does not sacrifice, life sacrifices.
[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:25.480]   And so it's this strange contradictory molecule
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:26.800]   that we should all be avoiding
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:30.280]   and yet seems to be an almost an ambiguous sign of life
[00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:31.460]   on rocky planets.
[00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:34.600]   - Okay, can we dig into that a little bit?
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:36.640]   So on rocky planets,
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:40.800]   what, is there biological mechanisms that can produce it?
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:41.880]   And is there,
[00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:48.440]   you said that why is unclear, why life might produce it,
[00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:51.800]   but is there an understanding of what kind of mechanisms
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.080]   might be able to produce it,
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:55.960]   this very difficult to produce molecule?
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:57.200]   - We don't know yet.
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:00.120]   The enzymatic pathways of phosphine production by life
[00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.920]   are not yet known.
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:04.480]   This is not actually as surprising as it might sound.
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:08.640]   I think something like 80% of all the natural products
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:11.480]   that we know of, so we know biology makes them.
[00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:12.680]   We don't know how.
[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:14.960]   It is much easier to know life produces something
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:17.360]   'cause you can put bacteria in a Petri dish
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:19.520]   and then watch and then that gas is produced,
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:21.200]   you go, oh, life made it.
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:23.360]   That actually happened with phosphine.
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:25.200]   But that's much easier to do, of course,
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:29.420]   than figuring out what is the exact metabolic pathway
[00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:33.000]   within that life form that created this molecule.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.960]   So we don't know yet.
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:37.040]   Phosphine is really understudied.
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:40.520]   No one had really heard of it until now-ish.
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:42.440]   - What you were presenting is the fact
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:44.720]   that life produces phosphine,
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:47.680]   not the process by which it produces phosphine.
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:49.840]   Is there an urgency now?
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:53.440]   Like if you were to try to understand the mechanisms,
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:54.760]   the, what did you call them,
[00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:58.440]   enzymatic pathways that produce phosphine,
[00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:00.760]   how difficult is that of a problem to crack?
[00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:02.240]   - It's really difficult.
[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:05.760]   If I'm not mistaken, even the scent of truffles,
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:09.240]   obviously a billion dollar industry, huge deal,
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:11.920]   until quite recently, it wasn't known exactly
[00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:13.840]   how those scents, those molecules
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:16.200]   that create this incredible smell were produced.
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:18.640]   And this is a billion dollar industry.
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:21.040]   As you can imagine, there is no such pressure.
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:22.960]   There's no phosphine lobby or anything
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:25.760]   that would push for this research.
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:29.040]   But I hope someone picks it up and does it.
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:32.200]   And it isn't crazy because we know
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:33.560]   that phosphine is really hard to make.
[00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:36.400]   We know it's really hard for it to happen accidentally.
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.760]   Even lightning and volcanoes
[00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:41.560]   that can produce small amounts of phosphine.
[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:42.400]   It's extremely difficult
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.680]   for even these extreme processes to make it.
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:47.480]   So it's not really surprising that only life can do it
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:51.080]   because life is willing to make things at a cost.
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:54.920]   - So maybe on the topic of phosphine,
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:58.840]   what, again, you've gotten yourself into trouble.
[00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.320]   I'm gonna ask you all these high level poetic questions.
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:02.200]   I apologize.
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.240]   - No, I would love it.
[00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:04.080]   - Okay.
[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:08.000]   When did you first fall in love with phosphine?
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.440]   - It wasn't love at first sight.
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:16.440]   It was somewhere between a long relationship
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:19.000]   and Stockholm syndrome.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.360]   - Yeah.
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:22.280]   - When I first started my PhD,
[00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:25.160]   I knew I wanted to learn about molecular spectra
[00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:26.560]   and how to simulate it.
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:28.640]   I thought it was really outrageous
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:32.200]   that we as a species couldn't detect molecules remotely.
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.800]   We didn't have this perfect catalog ready
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.760]   of the molecular fingerprint of every molecule
[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:38.920]   we may want to find in the universe.
[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:41.200]   And something as basic as phosphine,
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.880]   the fact that we didn't really know
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:44.320]   how it interacted with light,
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:48.280]   and so we couldn't detect it properly in the galaxy,
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:50.040]   just, I was so indignant.
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:53.760]   And so initially I just started working on phosphine
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:55.840]   because people hadn't before.
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:59.600]   And I thought we should know what phosphine looks like.
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.160]   And that was it.
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:02.440]   And then I read every paper
[00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:04.320]   that's ever been published about phosphine.
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:07.480]   It was quite easy 'cause there aren't that many.
[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:11.000]   And that's when I started learning about
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.280]   where we had already found it in the universe
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:14.160]   and what it meant.
[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:17.920]   I started finding out quite how little we know about it
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:20.320]   and why.
[00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:22.240]   And it was only when I joined MIT
[00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:25.120]   and I started talking to biochemists
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:28.760]   that it became clear that phosphine
[00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:30.960]   wasn't just weird and special
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.440]   and understudied and disgusting.
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:36.800]   It was all these things for oxygen loving life.
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:40.600]   And it was the anaerobic world that would welcome phosphine.
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:43.920]   And that's when the idea of looking for it
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:46.400]   on other planets became crystallized
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:50.120]   because oxygen is very powerful and very important on Earth,
[00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:52.960]   but that's not necessarily going to be the case
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:54.120]   on other exoplanets.
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:56.520]   Most planets are oxygen poor.
[00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:59.720]   Overwhelmingly, most planets are oxygen poor.
[00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:01.840]   And so finding the sign of life
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:05.260]   that would be welcomed by everything
[00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:10.260]   that would live without oxygen on Earth seemed so cool.
[00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:12.560]   (Lex laughing)
[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:14.520]   - But ultimately the project at first
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:15.560]   was born out of the idea
[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:17.920]   that you wanna find that molecular fingerprint
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:21.320]   of a molecule.
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:24.520]   And this is just one example.
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:29.520]   And that's connected to then looking for that fingerprint
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:33.480]   elsewhere in a remote way.
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:35.140]   And obviously that then,
[00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:37.080]   at that time where exoplanets already,
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:38.260]   when you were doing your PhD,
[00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:41.520]   and by the way, I should say your PhD thesis was on phosphine.
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:44.760]   - It was all on phosphine, 100% on phosphine.
[00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:45.880]   With a little bit of ammonia.
[00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:48.400]   I have a chapter that I did
[00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:51.280]   where I talked about phosphine and ammonia.
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:53.040]   So I-- - Got it.
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:55.400]   - But no, phosphine was very much my thesis.
[00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:58.160]   - But at that time when you were writing it,
[00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:01.080]   there was already a sense that exoplanets are out there
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:04.800]   and we might be able to be looking for biosignatures
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:08.280]   on those exoplanets?
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:09.120]   - Pretty much.
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:11.540]   So I finished my PhD in 2015.
[00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:15.680]   We found the first exoplanets in the mid to late '90s.
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:17.600]   So exoplanets were known.
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:20.120]   It was known that some had atmospheres.
[00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:22.120]   And from there, it's not a big jump to think,
[00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:23.520]   well, if some have atmospheres,
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:25.640]   some of those might be habitable.
[00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:27.940]   And some of those may be inhabited.
[00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:33.120]   - So how do you detect, you started to talk about it,
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:35.000]   but can we linger on it?
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.880]   How do you detect phosphine on a far away thing?
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:41.680]   Rocky thing, rocky planet?
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:45.700]   What is spectroscopy?
[00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:47.720]   What is this molecular fingerprint?
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:49.360]   What does it look like?
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:50.920]   You've kind of mentioned the wave,
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:52.880]   but what are we supposed to think about?
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:54.400]   What are the tools?
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:55.800]   What are the uncertainties?
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:57.280]   All those kinds of things.
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:59.720]   - So the path can go this way.
[00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:03.820]   You've got light, kind of pure light.
[00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:06.280]   You can crack that light open with a prism
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:09.620]   or a spectroscope or water and make a rainbow.
[00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:12.840]   That rainbow is all the colors
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:17.120]   and all the invisible colors, the ultraviolet, the infrared.
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:19.320]   And if that light was truly pure,
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:20.640]   you could consider that rainbow
[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:24.760]   to just cover continuously all of these colors.
[00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:26.760]   But if that light goes through a gas,
[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:28.080]   we may not see that gas.
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:31.120]   We certainly cannot see the molecules within that gas,
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:36.120]   but those molecules will still absorb some of that light.
[00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:38.120]   Some, but not all.
[00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:41.160]   Each molecule absorbs only very specific colors
[00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:42.720]   of that rainbow.
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:44.160]   And so if you know, for example,
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:48.280]   that shade of green can only be absorbed by methane,
[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:52.080]   then you can watch as a planet passes in front of a star.
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:54.240]   The planet's too far away, you can't see it.
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:55.680]   And it has an atmosphere.
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:56.960]   That atmosphere is far too small.
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:58.740]   You definitely can't see it.
[00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:01.160]   But the sunlight will go through that atmosphere.
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:03.080]   And if that atmosphere is methane,
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:06.080]   then on the other side, that shade of blue,
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:07.280]   I can't remember if I said blue or green,
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:11.800]   but that color will be missing because methane took it.
[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:14.440]   And so with phosphine, it's the same thing.
[00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:18.960]   It has specific colors, 16.8 billion colors,
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:21.920]   that it absorbs it and nothing else does.
[00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:25.140]   And so if you can find them and notice them missing
[00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:27.640]   from the light of a star
[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:30.000]   that went through a planet's atmosphere,
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.160]   then you'll know that atmosphere contains that molecule.
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:34.000]   How cool is that?
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.040]   - That's incredible.
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:39.520]   So you can have this fingerprint within the space of colors
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:40.720]   and there's a lot of molecules.
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:42.200]   And I mean, I wonder,
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:44.560]   it's a question of like how much overlap there is.
[00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:48.160]   How close can you get to the actual fingerprint?
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:52.320]   Like can phosphine unlock the iPhone with its lights on?
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.640]   He says 16.8 billion.
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:58.840]   So presumably this rainbow is discretized
[00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:00.560]   into little segments somehow.
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:01.400]   - Exactly.
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:02.960]   - How many total are there?
[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:06.520]   How a lot is 16.8 billion?
[00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:07.880]   - It's a lot.
[00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:11.040]   We don't have the instruments to break these,
[00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:14.120]   break any light into this many tiny segments.
[00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:16.520]   And so with the instruments we do have,
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:18.560]   there's huge amounts of overlap.
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:20.480]   Methane, as an example,
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:24.080]   a lot of the ways it's detectable
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:26.720]   is because the carbon and the hydrogens,
[00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:28.640]   they vibrate with one another,
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:30.560]   they move, they interact.
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:34.880]   But every other hydrocarbon, acetylene, isoprene,
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:39.160]   has carbon and hydrogens also vibrating and rotating.
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:41.120]   And so it's actually very hard to tell them apart
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:42.720]   at low resolutions.
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:45.880]   And our instruments can't really cope
[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:48.960]   with distinguishing between molecules particularly well.
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:53.560]   But in an ideal world, if we had infinite resolution,
[00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:57.400]   then yes, every molecule's spectral features will be unique.
[00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:02.120]   - Yeah, like almost too, like it would be too trivial.
[00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:04.120]   - At the quantum level, they're unique.
[00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:07.040]   At our level, there's huge overlap.
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:09.240]   - Yeah, but then you can start to then,
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:15.000]   what, try to disambiguate like what the miss,
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.760]   the fact that certain colors are missing,
[00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:17.960]   what does that mean?
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:20.560]   And hopefully they're missing in a certain kind of pattern
[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:21.400]   where you can say,
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:23.480]   with some kind of probability that it's this gas,
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:24.640]   not this gas.
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:28.480]   So you're solving that gaseous puzzle.
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:29.320]   I got it, okay.
[00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:31.560]   - We can go back to Venus actually and show that.
[00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:34.440]   So with this, I mentioned those two molecules
[00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:36.360]   that could be responsible for that signal,
[00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:37.720]   the resolution that we have,
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:41.720]   it was phosphine and SO2, sulfur dioxide.
[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:46.040]   And at that resolution, it could really be one or the other,
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:47.440]   but in that same bandwidth,
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:49.680]   so in the kind of the same observations,
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:52.360]   there was another region where phosphine does not absorb,
[00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:55.000]   we know that, but SO2 does.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.560]   So we just went and checked and there was no signal.
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:01.840]   So we thought, oh, then it must be phosphine.
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:03.440]   And then we submitted the paper.
[00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:05.560]   (both laughing)
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:07.240]   The rest is history.
[00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:08.080]   - I got it.
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:12.920]   Well, yeah, that's beautifully told.
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:15.920]   Is there, so the telescopes we're talking about
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:17.000]   are sitting on earth.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:22.160]   What, can it help solving this fingerprint,
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:25.840]   molecular fingerprint problem if we do a flyby?
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:28.320]   Does it help if we get closer and closer?
[00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:31.440]   Or are telescopes pretty damn good
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:33.960]   for this kind of puzzle solving?
[00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:34.960]   - Telescopes are pretty good,
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:37.960]   but the earth's atmosphere is a pain.
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:39.840]   I mean, I'm very thankful for it,
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:43.240]   but it does interrupt a lot of measurements
[00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:46.080]   and a lot of regions where phosphine would be active.
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:47.160]   They are not available.
[00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:52.120]   The earth is not transparent in those wavelengths.
[00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:55.240]   So being above the atmosphere would make a huge difference.
[00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:57.160]   Then proximity matters a lot less,
[00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:00.960]   but just escaping the earth's atmosphere would be wonderful.
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:03.120]   But then it's really hard to stay very stable.
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:06.040]   And if there is phosphine on Venus,
[00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:08.560]   there's very little of it in the clouds.
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:11.240]   And so the signal is very weak
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:14.440]   and the telescopes we can use on earth
[00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:16.520]   are much bigger and much more stable.
[00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:18.320]   So it's a bit of a trade-off.
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:22.280]   - So is it, are you comfortable
[00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:24.440]   with this kind of remote observation?
[00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:29.440]   Is it at all helpful to strive for going over to Venus
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:34.200]   and grabbing a scoop of the atmosphere?
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:38.280]   Or is remote observation really a powerful tool
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:39.120]   for this kind of job?
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:40.800]   Like the scoop is not necessary.
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:43.400]   - Well, a lot of people want to scoop.
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:44.840]   I get it.
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:47.400]   I get it completely. - That's my natural inclination.
[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:50.600]   - I don't want to scoop specifically because if it is life,
[00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:54.680]   I want to know everything I can remotely before I interfere.
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:58.080]   So that's my, I've got ethical reasons against the scoop
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:00.720]   more than engineering reasons against the scoop.
[00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:03.200]   But I have some engineering reasons against the scoop.
[00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:04.480]   Scoop is not a technical term,
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:06.000]   but I feel like now it's too late.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.520]   - Thank you for going along with this.
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:08.920]   - It's too late to take it back.
[00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:09.960]   - I appreciate it.
[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:11.920]   - We don't understand the clouds well enough
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:14.160]   to plan the scoop very well.
[00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:16.600]   - Because it's not that saturated.
[00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:19.000]   Like there's not that much of it present.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.680]   - No, and the place is nasty.
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:24.960]   You know, it's not going to be easy to build something
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:29.280]   that can do the task reliably and can be trusted.
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:31.120]   The measurements can be trusted
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:33.080]   and then pass that message on.
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:35.520]   So actually I'm for an orbiter.
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:36.760]   I think we should have orbiters
[00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:39.320]   around every solar system body
[00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:42.200]   whose job is just to learn about these places.
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:45.320]   I'm disappointed we haven't already got an orbiter
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:47.400]   around every single one of them.
[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:49.200]   A small, it can be a small satellite.
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:50.880]   Just getting data, figuring out, you know,
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:52.000]   how do the clouds move?
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.160]   What's in them?
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:54.680]   How often is there lightning
[00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:56.080]   and volcanic activity?
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:57.120]   Where's the topography?
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:58.840]   Is it changing?
[00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:02.000]   Is there a biosphere actively doing things?
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.960]   We should be monitoring this from afar.
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:08.520]   And so I'm for over the atmosphere,
[00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:10.120]   hopefully around Venus.
[00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:12.680]   That would be my choice.
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:16.540]   - Okay, so now recently Venus is all exciting
[00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:18.240]   about a phosphine and everything.
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:21.120]   Is there other stuff maybe before
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:22.440]   we were looking at Venus
[00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:26.720]   or now looking out into other solar systems?
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:29.120]   Is there other promising exoplanets
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:32.040]   or other planets within the solar system
[00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:34.160]   that might have phosphine
[00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:38.560]   or might have other strong biosignatures
[00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:41.620]   that we should be looking for like phosphine?
[00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:45.840]   - There's a few, but outside the solar system,
[00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:48.340]   all are kind of promising candidates.
[00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:49.920]   We know so little about them.
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:52.320]   For most of them, we barely know their density.
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:54.960]   Most of them, we don't even know
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:56.160]   if they have an atmosphere,
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:59.200]   nevermind what that atmosphere might contain.
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:00.720]   So we're still very much at the stage
[00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:03.840]   where we have detected promising planets,
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:05.400]   but they're promising in that
[00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:07.080]   they're about the right size,
[00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:08.700]   about the right density.
[00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:10.640]   They could have an atmosphere
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:12.200]   and they're about the right distance
[00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:13.440]   from their host star.
[00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:15.040]   But that's really all we know.
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:17.440]   Near future telescopes will tell us much more,
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:21.160]   but for now, we're just guessing.
[00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:22.240]   - So you said near future.
[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:24.520]   So there's hope that there'll be telescopes
[00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:26.080]   that can see that far enough
[00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:28.400]   to determine if there's an atmosphere
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:31.240]   and perhaps even the contents of that atmosphere?
[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:32.080]   - Absolutely.
[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:34.360]   JWST launching later this year
[00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:37.880]   will be able to get a very rough sense
[00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:42.280]   of the main atmospheric constituents of planets
[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:44.320]   that could potentially be habitable.
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:45.880]   And that's this year.
[00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:46.920]   - What's the name of the--
[00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:49.520]   - JWST, the James Webb Space Telescope.
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:50.360]   - Okay.
[00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:51.760]   And that's going to be out in space,
[00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:53.200]   past the atmosphere?
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:54.040]   - Yes.
[00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:55.240]   - Is there something interesting to be said
[00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:58.120]   about the engineering aspect of the telescope?
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:33:59.760]   - It's an incredible beast,
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:01.920]   but it's a beast of many burdens.
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:04.160]   So it's going to do--
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:05.960]   (laughs)
[00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:07.040]   - See, you are a poet.
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:08.080]   (laughs)
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:09.560]   Yeah, I love it.
[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:11.160]   This is very eloquent.
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:13.240]   You're speaking to the audience, which I appreciate.
[00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:15.240]   (laughs)
[00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:17.800]   So yeah, so it's a giant engineering project.
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:19.920]   And is it orbiting something?
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:20.760]   Do you know?
[00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:22.640]   - So it's going to be above the atmosphere
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:26.160]   and it will be doing lots of different astrophysics.
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:31.160]   And so some of its time will be dedicated to exoplanets,
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:35.560]   but there's an entire astronomy field fighting for time
[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:40.320]   before the cryogenic lifetime of the instrument.
[00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:43.480]   And so when I was looking for the possibility
[00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:46.000]   of finding phosphine on distant exoplanets,
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   I used JWST as a way of checking with this instrument
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.240]   that we will launch later this year,
[00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:56.600]   could we detect phosphine on an oxygen-poor planet?
[00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:59.360]   And there I put very much a hard stop
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:01.520]   where some of my simulations said,
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:02.640]   yes, you can totally do it,
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:05.920]   but it will take a little under the cryogenic lifetime
[00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:06.880]   of this machine.
[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:09.560]   So then I had to go, well, that's not going to,
[00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:11.920]   no one's going to dedicate all of JWST
[00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:15.280]   to look for my molecule that no one cared about.
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:17.940]   So we're very much at that edge,
[00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:21.080]   but there'll be many other telescopes in the coming decades
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:23.600]   that will be able to tell us quite a lot
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:26.680]   about the atmospheres of potentially habitable planets.
[00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:28.320]   - So you mentioned simulation.
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:29.840]   This is super interesting to me.
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:33.580]   And this perhaps could be a super dumb question, but-
[00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:35.480]   - Not such a thing.
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:38.840]   - I am going to prove you wrong on that one.
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:41.280]   You simulate molecules to understand
[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:43.600]   how they look from a distance is what I understand.
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:46.660]   Like, what does that simulation look like?
[00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:50.720]   So it's talking about which colors
[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:52.080]   of the rainbow will be missing.
[00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:54.600]   Is that the goal of the simulation?
[00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:56.800]   - That's the goal, but it's really just a very,
[00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:59.440]   very nasty Schrödinger's equation.
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:01.520]   So it's a quantum simulation.
[00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:03.720]   - Oh, so it's simulating at the quantum level.
[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:06.360]   - Yes, so I'm a quantum astrochemist.
[00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:07.200]   Hi, I'm Clara.
[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:08.400]   I'm a quantum astrochemist.
[00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:10.840]   It's how we should have started this conversation.
[00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:14.200]   Can you describe the three components of that,
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:16.320]   quantum, astro, and chemist,
[00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:18.720]   and how they interplay together?
[00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:22.720]   - So I study the quantum behavior of molecules,
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:25.560]   hence the quantum and the chemist,
[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:29.780]   specifically so I can detect them in space, hence the astro.
[00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:35.500]   So what I do is I figure out the probability
[00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:38.480]   of a molecule being in a particular state.
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:41.520]   There's no deterministic nature to the work I do,
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:45.800]   so it's every transition is just a likelihood.
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:48.560]   But if you get a population of that molecule,
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:50.520]   it will always happen.
[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:52.320]   And so this is all at the quantum level.
[00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:55.900]   It's a Schrödinger equation on, I think, 27 dimensions.
[00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:57.800]   I don't remember it by heart.
[00:36:57.800 --> 00:36:59.560]   And what this means is I'm solving
[00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:03.600]   these giant quantum matrices,
[00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:05.840]   and that's why you need a lot of computer power,
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:10.760]   giant computers, to diagonalize these enormous matrices,
[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:14.120]   each of whom describes a single
[00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:17.300]   vibrational behavior of a molecule.
[00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:22.300]   So I think phosphine has 17.5 million
[00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:24.660]   possible states it can exist in.
[00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:29.960]   And transitions can occur between pairs of these states.
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:31.920]   And there's a certain likelihood that they'll happen.
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:32.880]   This is the quantum world.
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:34.560]   Nothing is deterministic.
[00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:36.440]   There's just a likelihood that it will jump
[00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:38.400]   from one state to another.
[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:41.440]   And these jumps, they're transitions,
[00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:44.080]   and there's 16.8 billion of them.
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:45.840]   When energy is absorbed,
[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:47.480]   that corresponds to this transition.
[00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:48.920]   We see it in the spectrum.
[00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:50.760]   This is more quantum chemistry than you had asked for.
[00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:51.600]   I'm sorry.
[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:52.680]   - No, no, I'm sorry.
[00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:53.680]   Brain's broken.
[00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:57.460]   So when the transitions happen between the different states,
[00:37:57.460 --> 00:38:00.920]   somehow the energy maps the spectrum.
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:01.760]   - Exactly.
[00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:04.240]   Energy corresponds to a frequency,
[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:06.160]   and a frequency corresponds to a wavelength,
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:08.040]   which corresponds to a color.
[00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:11.800]   - So there's some probability assigned to each color then?
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:12.640]   - Exactly.
[00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:14.440]   And that probability determines how intense
[00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:16.960]   that transition will be, how strong.
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:20.840]   - And so you run this kind of simulation for particular,
[00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:23.560]   let's say that's 17.5 squared or something like that.
[00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:24.400]   - Exactly.
[00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:26.840]   17.5 million energies,
[00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:30.480]   each one of whom involves diagonalizing a giant matrix
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:32.160]   with a supercomputer.
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:33.760]   - Actually, I wonder what the most efficient algorithm
[00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:35.840]   for diagonalization is.
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:37.040]   But there's some kind of-
[00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:37.880]   - There's many.
[00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:38.700]   - There's many, yeah.
[00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:41.800]   - Depends on kind of the shape of the matrix.
[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:43.480]   So they're not random matrices.
[00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:45.160]   So some are more diagonal than others.
[00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:48.320]   And so some need more treatment than others.
[00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:51.640]   Most of the work ends up going in describing the system,
[00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:53.360]   this quantum system in different ways
[00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:56.760]   until you have a matrix that is close to being diagonal,
[00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:59.360]   and then it's much easier to clean it up.
[00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:03.760]   - So how hard is this puzzle?
[00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:06.560]   So you're solving this puzzle for phosphine, right?
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:10.840]   Is this, are we supposed to solve this puzzle
[00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:13.840]   for every single molecule?
[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:14.920]   Oh boy.
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:18.720]   - Yes, I calculated if I did the work I did for phosphine,
[00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:22.440]   again, for all the molecules for which we don't have spectra,
[00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:24.760]   for which we don't have a fingerprint,
[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:28.280]   it would take me 62,000 years, a little over.
[00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:30.040]   - 62,000 years.
[00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:31.680]   Well, time flies when you're having fun.
[00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:36.320]   Okay, but you write that there are about 16,000 molecules
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:39.360]   we care about when looking for a new earth
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:42.960]   or when we try to detect alien biosignatures.
[00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:45.360]   If we want to detect any molecules from here,
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:49.240]   we need to know their spectra, and we currently don't.
[00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:53.400]   Solving this particular problem, that's my job.
[00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:54.360]   - Well, it's the hat.
[00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:55.920]   I mean, that's absolutely correct.
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:58.040]   I could have not said it better myself.
[00:39:58.040 --> 00:39:59.280]   Did you take that from my website?
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:00.600]   - Yeah, I think I stole it.
[00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:02.160]   And your website is excellent,
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:05.160]   so it's a worthy place to steal stuff from.
[00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:07.320]   How do you solve this problem
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:11.160]   of for the 16,000 molecules we care about,
[00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:12.680]   of which phosphine is one?
[00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:13.520]   - Yes.
[00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:18.520]   - And so taking a step a little bit out of phosphine,
[00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:21.440]   is there...
[00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:23.680]   - But we were having so much fun.
[00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:24.760]   - We were having so much fun.
[00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:26.320]   No, we're not saying, bye.
[00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:27.440]   It's sticking around.
[00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:30.560]   I'm just saying, more friends coming to the party.
[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:33.040]   How do you choose other friends to come to the party
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:35.240]   that are interesting to study
[00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:37.720]   as we solve one puzzle at a time
[00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:40.200]   through the space of 16,000?
[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:41.560]   - So we've already started.
[00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:44.200]   Out of those 16,000, we understand water quite well,
[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:47.680]   methane quite well, ammonia quite well, carbon dioxide.
[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:49.520]   I could keep going.
[00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:52.200]   And then we understand molecules like acetylene,
[00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:54.440]   hydrogen cyanide, more or less.
[00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:59.160]   And that takes us to about 4% of those 16,000.
[00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:02.000]   We understand about 4% of them, more or less.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.240]   Phosphine is one of them.
[00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:08.080]   But the other 96%, we just really have barely any idea
[00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:11.680]   at all of where in the spectrum of light
[00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:13.400]   they would leave a mark.
[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:18.320]   I can't spend the next 62,000 years doing this work.
[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:22.280]   And I don't want to, even if somehow I was able,
[00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:26.320]   that wouldn't feel good.
[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:29.400]   So one of the things that I try to do now
[00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:32.520]   is move away from how I did phosphine.
[00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:36.080]   So I did phosphine really the best that I could,
[00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:36.960]   the best that could be done
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:38.760]   with the computer power that we have,
[00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:42.400]   trying to get each one of those 16.8 billion transitions
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:44.760]   mapped accurately, calculated.
[00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:49.920]   And then I thought, what if I do a worse job?
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:52.080]   What if I just do a much worse job?
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:55.360]   Can I just make it much faster
[00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:57.480]   and then it's still worth it?
[00:41:57.480 --> 00:42:01.960]   How bad can I get before it's worthless?
[00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:05.280]   And then could I do this for all the other molecules?
[00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:10.280]   So I created exactly this terrible, terrible system.
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:12.440]   - So what's the answer to that question,
[00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:14.600]   that fundamental question I ask myself all the time
[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:15.560]   in other domains?
[00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:17.240]   - How crappy can I be before I'm useless?
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:19.280]   - Before somebody notices.
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:21.320]   - Turns out, pretty crappy.
[00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:23.720]   - Because no one has any idea
[00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:26.120]   what these molecules look like,
[00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:28.520]   anything is better than nothing.
[00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:30.600]   And so I thought, how long will it take me
[00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:32.960]   to create better than nothing spectra
[00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:34.400]   for all of these molecules?
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:36.160]   And so I created RASCAL,
[00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:40.200]   Rapid Approximate Spectral Calculations for All.
[00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:45.360]   And what I do is I use organic chemistry
[00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:48.560]   and quantum chemistry and kind of cheat them both.
[00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:49.880]   I just try to figure out
[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:52.680]   what is the fastest way I could run this?
[00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:57.440]   And I simulate rough spectra for all of those 16,000.
[00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:59.480]   So I've managed to get it to work.
[00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:00.980]   It's really shocking how well it works,
[00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:03.000]   considering how bad it is.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.080]   - Is there insights you could give
[00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:08.480]   to the tricks involved in making it fast?
[00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:13.480]   Like what are the, maybe some insightful shortcuts taken
[00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:16.600]   that still result in some useful information
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:18.080]   about the spectra?
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:22.140]   - The insights came from organic chemistry from decades ago.
[00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:24.480]   When organic chemists wanted to know
[00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:25.720]   what a compound might be,
[00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:27.920]   they would look at a spectrum and see a feature
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:30.960]   and they would go, "I've seen that feature before."
[00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:32.120]   That's usually what happens
[00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:35.960]   when you have a carbon triple bonded to another carbon.
[00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:37.200]   And they were mostly right.
[00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:39.640]   Almost every molecule that has a carbon triple bonded
[00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:41.400]   to another one looks like that.
[00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:44.040]   Has other features different
[00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:45.840]   that distinguish them from one another,
[00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:49.280]   but they have that feature in common.
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:51.200]   We call these functional groups.
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:55.200]   And so most of that work ended up being abandoned
[00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:57.040]   because now we have mass spectrometry,
[00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:59.080]   we've got nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
[00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:03.080]   So people don't really need to do that anymore.
[00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:06.040]   But these ancient textbooks still exist
[00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:09.480]   and I've collected them all, as many as I could.
[00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:11.420]   And there are hundreds of these descriptions
[00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:12.920]   where people have said,
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   oh, whenever you have a iodine atom connected to this one,
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.960]   there's always a feature here.
[00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:22.840]   And it's usually quite sharp and it's quite strong.
[00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:24.920]   And some people go, oh yeah, that's a really broad feature
[00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:28.120]   every time that combination of atoms and bonds.
[00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:29.360]   So I've collected them all
[00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:31.080]   and I've created this giant dictionary
[00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:34.120]   of all these kind of puzzle pieces,
[00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:36.440]   these Lego parts of molecules.
[00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:39.920]   And I've written a code that then puts them all together
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:43.640]   in some kind of like Frankenstein's monster of molecules.
[00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:45.520]   So you ask me for any molecule and I go,
[00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:48.480]   well, it has these bonds and this atom
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:51.840]   dangling off this atom and this cluster here.
[00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:55.160]   And I tell you what it should look like.
[00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:57.240]   And it kind of works.
[00:44:57.240 --> 00:45:00.000]   - So this creates a whole portfolio
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.560]   of just kind of signatures that we could look for.
[00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:05.120]   - Rough, very rough signatures.
[00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:08.560]   - But still useful enough to analyze the atmospheres,
[00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:13.720]   the telescope generated images of other planets.
[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:18.880]   - Close, right now it is so complete.
[00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:22.080]   So it has all of these molecules that it can tell you,
[00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:24.120]   say you look at an alien atmosphere
[00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:26.240]   and there's a feature there.
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:29.040]   It can tell you, oh, that feature, that's familiar.
[00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:32.040]   It could be one of these 816 molecules.
[00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:33.040]   - And there's the megalo. - Best of luck.
[00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:34.000]   - Yes.
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.440]   - So I think the next step, which is what I'm working on
[00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:38.600]   is telling you something more useful
[00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:41.160]   than it could be one of those 816 molecules.
[00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:43.720]   That's still true, I wouldn't say it's useful.
[00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:47.080]   So it can tell you, but only 12% of them
[00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:49.640]   also have a feature in this region, so go look there.
[00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:53.320]   And if there's nothing there, it can't be those and so on.
[00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:55.320]   It can also tell you things like,
[00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:57.120]   you will need this much accuracy
[00:45:57.120 --> 00:46:00.160]   to distinguish between those 816.
[00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:04.400]   So that's what I'm working on, but it's a lot of work.
[00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:06.520]   - So this is really interesting,
[00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:09.000]   the role of computing in this whole picture.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.080]   You mentioned code.
[00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:14.760]   So you, as a quantum astrochemist,
[00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:18.760]   there is some role for programming in your life,
[00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:20.640]   in your past life, in your current life, in your group.
[00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:22.000]   - Oh yeah, almost entirely.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.960]   I'm a computational quantum astrochemist,
[00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:25.760]   but that doesn't roll off the tongue very easily.
[00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:28.440]   - So this is fundamentally computational.
[00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:30.760]   Like if you wanna be successful in the 21st century
[00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:32.400]   in doing quantum astrochemistry,
[00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:33.720]   you wanna be computational?
[00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:35.000]   - Absolutely, all quantum chemistry
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:36.480]   is computational at this point.
[00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:37.960]   - Okay.
[00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:40.480]   Does machine learning play a role at all?
[00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:43.640]   Is there some extra shortcuts that could be discovered
[00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:46.680]   through, like you see all that success
[00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:48.320]   with protein folding, right?
[00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:51.960]   A problem that thought to be extremely difficult
[00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:55.340]   to apply machine learning to because it's,
[00:46:55.340 --> 00:47:01.360]   I mean, mostly because there's not a lot
[00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:04.840]   of already solved puzzles to train on.
[00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:07.120]   I suppose the same exact thing is true
[00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:08.480]   with this particular problem,
[00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:11.240]   but is there hope for machine learning to help out?
[00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:12.240]   - Absolutely.
[00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:14.920]   Currently you've laid out exactly the problem.
[00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:18.280]   The training set is awful.
[00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:21.280]   And because there's so, a lot of this data
[00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:23.960]   that I'm basing it on is literally many decades old.
[00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:26.520]   The people who worked on it and data that I get,
[00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:27.720]   often they're dead.
[00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:30.720]   And the files that I've used,
[00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:34.840]   some of them were hand drawn by someone tired in the 70s.
[00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:39.320]   So I can of course have a program training on these,
[00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:41.240]   but I would just be perpetuating these mistakes
[00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:43.680]   without hope of actually verifying them.
[00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:48.680]   So my next step is to improve this training set by hand
[00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:52.120]   and then try to see if I can apply machine learning
[00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:54.960]   on the full code of the full 16,000 molecules
[00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:56.020]   and improve them all.
[00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:59.440]   But really I need to be able to test the outcomes
[00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:00.760]   with experimental data,
[00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:02.840]   which means convincing someone in a lab
[00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:07.080]   to spend a lot of money putting very dangerous gases
[00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:11.120]   in chambers and measuring them at outrageous temperatures.
[00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:13.360]   So it's a work in progress.
[00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:15.040]   - And so collecting huge amounts of data
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:16.840]   about the actual gases.
[00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:22.400]   So you are up for doing that kind of thing too.
[00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:27.400]   So actually like doing the full end to end thing,
[00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:31.440]   which is like having a gas, collecting data about it
[00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:33.920]   and then doing the kind of analysis
[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:35.520]   that creates the fingerprint
[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:38.480]   and then also analyzing using that library,
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:40.440]   the data that comes from other planets.
[00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:41.560]   So you do the full.
[00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:44.080]   - Full from birth to death.
[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:45.320]   - Interesting.
[00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:47.560]   - Yes, I worked in an industrial chemistry laboratory
[00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:50.300]   when I was much younger in Slovenia.
[00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:52.040]   And there I worked in the lab,
[00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:55.420]   actually collecting spectrum and predicting spectrum.
[00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:58.400]   - What's it like to work with a bunch of gases
[00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:00.720]   that are like not so human friendly?
[00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:03.040]   - Terrifying, it's horrific.
[00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:03.960]   It's so scary.
[00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:06.320]   And I love my job.
[00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:08.800]   I'm willing to clearly sacrifice a lot for it.
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:13.800]   You know, job, stability, money, sanity.
[00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:17.680]   But I only worked there for a few months.
[00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:20.320]   It was really terrifying.
[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:22.760]   There's just so many ways to die.
[00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:24.280]   You know, usually you only have a handful
[00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:26.040]   of ways to die every day, you know,
[00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:28.720]   but if you work in a lab, there's so many more,
[00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:30.680]   like orders of magnitude more.
[00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:32.960]   And I was very bad at it.
[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:35.880]   I'm not a good hands-on scientist.
[00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:40.580]   I want a laptop connected to a remote supercomputer
[00:49:40.580 --> 00:49:43.320]   or a laptop connected to a telescope.
[00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:46.880]   I don't need to be there to believe it.
[00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:48.600]   And I am not good in the lab.
[00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:51.960]   - Yeah, when there's a bunch of things that can poison you,
[00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:54.120]   a bunch of things that could explode and they're gaseous
[00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:57.320]   and they're often, maybe they might not even have a smell
[00:49:57.320 --> 00:49:59.640]   or they might not be visible.
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:00.480]   It's like-
[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:02.160]   - So many of them give you cancer.
[00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:03.560]   It's just so cruel.
[00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:05.500]   And some people love this work,
[00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:08.920]   but I've never enjoyed experimental work.
[00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:12.920]   It's so ungrateful, so lonely.
[00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:15.760]   - Well, most, I mean, so much work is lonely
[00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:19.880]   if you find enjoying it, but you enjoy the results of it.
[00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:20.840]   - Yes.
[00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:23.740]   I'm very thankful for all the experimentalists in my life.
[00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:26.980]   But I'll do the theory, they do the experiment,
[00:50:26.980 --> 00:50:30.420]   and then we talk to one another and make sure it matches.
[00:50:30.420 --> 00:50:31.540]   - Okay, beautiful.
[00:50:31.540 --> 00:50:34.260]   What are spectroscopic networks?
[00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:35.420]   Those look super cool.
[00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:37.540]   Are they related to what we were talking about?
[00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:38.900]   The picture looked pretty.
[00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:40.780]   - Oh, yes, slightly.
[00:50:40.780 --> 00:50:44.340]   So remember when I mentioned the 17.5 million energy levels?
[00:50:44.340 --> 00:50:45.260]   - Yes.
[00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:47.620]   - There are rules for each molecule
[00:50:47.620 --> 00:50:51.540]   on which energy levels it can jump from and to
[00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:53.780]   and how likely it is to make that jump.
[00:50:53.780 --> 00:50:57.580]   And so if you plot all the routes it can take,
[00:50:57.580 --> 00:51:02.300]   you get this energy network, which is like a ball.
[00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:04.900]   - So these are the constraints of the transitions
[00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:05.860]   that could be taken.
[00:51:05.860 --> 00:51:07.860]   - Exactly, for each molecule.
[00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:08.700]   - Interesting.
[00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:11.340]   And so it's not a fully connected,
[00:51:11.340 --> 00:51:14.180]   it's like it's sparse somehow?
[00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:15.740]   - Yes, you get islands sometimes.
[00:51:15.740 --> 00:51:18.140]   You get a molecule can only jump
[00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:20.220]   from one set of states to another,
[00:51:20.220 --> 00:51:22.060]   and it's trapped now in this network.
[00:51:22.060 --> 00:51:24.340]   It can never go to another network
[00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:27.620]   that could have been available to other siblings.
[00:51:27.620 --> 00:51:29.980]   - Is there some insights to be drawn from these networks?
[00:51:29.980 --> 00:51:31.780]   Like something cool that you can understand
[00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:33.960]   about a particular molecule because of it?
[00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:36.140]   - Yes, some molecules have what we call
[00:51:36.140 --> 00:51:38.980]   forbidden transitions, which aren't really forbidden
[00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:39.860]   'cause it's quantum.
[00:51:39.860 --> 00:51:40.700]   There are no rules.
[00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:42.180]   No, I'm not, there are rules.
[00:51:42.180 --> 00:51:44.820]   It's just the rules are very often broken
[00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:45.660]   in the quantum world.
[00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:48.420]   And so forbidden transitions doesn't actually mean
[00:51:48.420 --> 00:51:49.260]   they're forbidden.
[00:51:49.260 --> 00:51:50.220]   - Low probability.
[00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:52.660]   - Exactly, they just become deeply unlikely.
[00:51:52.660 --> 00:51:53.700]   - Yeah, cool.
[00:51:53.700 --> 00:51:55.500]   And so you could do all the same.
[00:51:55.500 --> 00:51:57.700]   Like I'm coming from a computer science world,
[00:51:57.700 --> 00:51:59.900]   you know, I love graph theory.
[00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:02.620]   So you can do all the same like graph theoretic
[00:52:02.620 --> 00:52:05.700]   kind of analysis of like clusters or something like that.
[00:52:05.700 --> 00:52:06.540]   - Exactly.
[00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:09.220]   - All those kinds of things and draw insights from it.
[00:52:09.220 --> 00:52:10.060]   Cool.
[00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:10.880]   - And they're unique for each molecule.
[00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:13.120]   So the networks that you mentioned,
[00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:17.700]   that's actually not too difficult a layer of quantum physics.
[00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:19.900]   By then all the energies are mapped.
[00:52:19.900 --> 00:52:23.280]   So we've had high school children work on those networks.
[00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:24.580]   And the trick is to not tell them
[00:52:24.580 --> 00:52:26.780]   they're doing quantum physics until like three months in
[00:52:26.780 --> 00:52:29.060]   when it's too late for them to back out.
[00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:30.940]   And then you're like, you're a quantum physicist now.
[00:52:30.940 --> 00:52:32.220]   And it's really nice.
[00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:33.060]   - Yeah, okay.
[00:52:33.060 --> 00:52:36.060]   But like the promise of this, even though it's 16,000,
[00:52:36.060 --> 00:52:38.140]   even just a subset of them, that's really exciting
[00:52:38.140 --> 00:52:40.940]   'cause then you can do as the telescope data
[00:52:40.940 --> 00:52:43.600]   get better and better, especially for exoplanets,
[00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:44.940]   but also for Venus.
[00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:49.220]   You can then start like getting your full,
[00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:50.900]   like you know how you get like blood worked on
[00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:52.580]   or like you get your genetic testing
[00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:54.700]   to see what your ancestors are.
[00:52:54.700 --> 00:52:58.180]   You can get the same kind of like high resolution information
[00:52:58.180 --> 00:53:01.460]   about interesting things going on on a particular planet
[00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:02.740]   based on the atmosphere, right?
[00:53:02.740 --> 00:53:03.580]   - Exactly.
[00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:06.740]   How cool would that be if we could scan an alien planet
[00:53:06.740 --> 00:53:08.980]   and go, oh, this is what the clouds are made of.
[00:53:08.980 --> 00:53:10.520]   This is what's in the surface.
[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:12.420]   These are the molecules that are mixing.
[00:53:12.420 --> 00:53:14.260]   Here are probably oceans
[00:53:14.260 --> 00:53:16.580]   because you can see these types of molecules above it.
[00:53:16.580 --> 00:53:19.140]   And here are the Hadley cells.
[00:53:19.140 --> 00:53:22.220]   Here are how the biosphere works.
[00:53:22.220 --> 00:53:24.420]   We could map this whole thing.
[00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:25.740]   - Wouldn't it be cool if the aliens
[00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:27.400]   like are aware of these techniques
[00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:29.760]   and like would spoof like the wrong gases
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:32.640]   just to like pretend that's how they can be.
[00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:34.580]   It's like an invisibility cloak.
[00:53:34.580 --> 00:53:37.420]   They can generate gases that would throw you off
[00:53:37.420 --> 00:53:39.380]   or like, or do the opposite.
[00:53:39.380 --> 00:53:42.140]   They pretend they will artificially generate phosphine.
[00:53:42.140 --> 00:53:46.420]   So like the dumb apes on earth again,
[00:53:46.420 --> 00:53:48.740]   like go out like flying in different places
[00:53:48.740 --> 00:53:49.580]   'cause it's just fun.
[00:53:49.580 --> 00:53:53.460]   It's like some teenager alien somewhere just pranking.
[00:53:53.460 --> 00:53:54.660]   Yeah.
[00:53:54.660 --> 00:53:57.020]   - I was asked that exact question this Saturday
[00:53:57.020 --> 00:53:59.740]   by a 70 year old boy in Canada.
[00:53:59.740 --> 00:54:00.580]   - Oh, old seven?
[00:54:00.580 --> 00:54:01.420]   - Seven, yes.
[00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:03.900]   (laughing)
[00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:05.780]   But it was the first time I'd been asked that question.
[00:54:05.780 --> 00:54:07.520]   This is the second in a week.
[00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:12.440]   - We're kindred spirits, him and I.
[00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:14.240]   - We can.
[00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:16.600]   They can prank us to some extent,
[00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:20.560]   but this work of interpreting an alien atmosphere
[00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:23.600]   means you're reading the atmosphere as a message.
[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:27.360]   And it's very hard to hide signs of life in an atmosphere
[00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:30.440]   because you can try to prank us,
[00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:33.120]   but you're still going to fart and breathe
[00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:36.720]   and somehow metabolize the environment around you
[00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:39.240]   and call that whatever you call that
[00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:41.080]   and release molecules.
[00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:43.000]   And so that's really hard to hide.
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:44.740]   You can go very quiet.
[00:54:44.740 --> 00:54:49.080]   You can throw out some weird molecule to confuse us further,
[00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:51.680]   but we can still see all your other metabolites.
[00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:53.320]   - It's hard to fake.
[00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:56.520]   Is there, so you kind of mentioned like water.
[00:54:56.520 --> 00:55:01.520]   What other gases are there that we know about
[00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:06.000]   that are like high likelihood as biosignatures
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:07.200]   in terms of life?
[00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:09.200]   I mean, what are your other favorites?
[00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:12.720]   So we've got phosphine,
[00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:16.400]   but like what else is a damn good signal
[00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:19.400]   to be, that you think about that we should be looking for
[00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:21.320]   if we look at another atmosphere?
[00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:22.800]   Is there gases that come to mind
[00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:26.320]   or are there all sort of possible biosignatures
[00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:28.060]   that we should love equally?
[00:55:28.060 --> 00:55:30.040]   - There's many.
[00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:31.480]   So there's water.
[00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:33.360]   We know that's important for life as we know it.
[00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:35.240]   There's molecular oxygen on earth.
[00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:37.240]   That's probably the most robust sign of life,
[00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:40.280]   particularly combined with small amounts of methane.
[00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:41.960]   And it's true that the majority of the oxygen
[00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:44.600]   in our atmosphere is a product of life.
[00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:47.300]   And so if I was an alien astronomer
[00:55:47.300 --> 00:55:49.160]   and I saw earth's atmosphere,
[00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:52.680]   I would get a Nobel, I think.
[00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:53.520]   - What would you notice?
[00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:55.240]   I mean, this is a really.
[00:55:55.240 --> 00:55:57.280]   - I would be very excited about this.
[00:55:57.280 --> 00:55:58.400]   - About the oxygen.
[00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:02.120]   - About finding 20%, 21% of oxygen atmosphere.
[00:56:02.120 --> 00:56:03.320]   That's very unusual.
[00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:05.520]   - So would that be the most exciting thing to you
[00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:07.160]   from an alien perspective about earth
[00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:10.160]   in terms of the tech, like analyzing the atmosphere?
[00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:12.760]   Like what are the biosignatures of life on earth,
[00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:15.400]   would you say, in terms of the contents of the atmosphere?
[00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:19.620]   Is oxygen, high amount of oxygen, pretty damn good sign?
[00:56:19.620 --> 00:56:21.640]   - I mean, it's not as good as the TV signals
[00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:22.960]   we've been sending out.
[00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:27.320]   Those are slightly more robust than oxygen.
[00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:30.100]   Oxygen on its own has false positives for life.
[00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:32.120]   So there's still ways of making it.
[00:56:32.120 --> 00:56:35.600]   But it's a pretty robust sign of life
[00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:37.240]   in the context of our atmosphere
[00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:40.240]   with the radiation that the sun produces,
[00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:42.360]   our position in relation to the sun,
[00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:44.560]   the other components of our atmosphere,
[00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:46.560]   the volcanic activity we have,
[00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:49.840]   all of that together makes the 20% of oxygen
[00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:53.760]   extremely robust sign of life.
[00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:55.200]   But outside that context,
[00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:58.460]   you could still produce oxygen without life.
[00:56:58.460 --> 00:57:01.720]   But phosphine, although better in the sense of,
[00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:04.840]   it is much harder to make, it has lower false positives,
[00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:06.160]   still has some.
[00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:10.720]   So I'm actually against looking for specific molecules,
[00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:12.520]   unless we're looking for like CFCs.
[00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:14.520]   If we find CFCs, that's definitely aliens,
[00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:15.480]   I feel confident.
[00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:18.120]   Chlorofluorocarbons, and so,
[00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:19.760]   if aliens had been watching us,
[00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:22.520]   they would have been going, "Oh no, CFCs,
[00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:25.060]   "I mean, they're not gonna last long.
[00:57:25.060 --> 00:57:27.220]   "Let's, everyone's writing their thesis
[00:57:27.220 --> 00:57:30.360]   "on the end of the earth."
[00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:33.280]   And then we got together, we stopped using them.
[00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:35.600]   I like to think they're really proud of us.
[00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:38.200]   They literally saw our ozone hole shrinking.
[00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:40.200]   They've been watching it and they saw it happen.
[00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:41.320]   - I think to be honest,
[00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:43.800]   they're more paying attention to the whole nuclear thing.
[00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:46.380]   - I don't think they care, it's not gonna bother them.
[00:57:46.380 --> 00:57:48.040]   Oh, I mean, worried about us, oh yes.
[00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:49.440]   - No, worried about us.
[00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:52.440]   I mean, this is why the aliens have been showing up recently.
[00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:53.280]   (Sohla laughs)
[00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:55.680]   Like if you look at, I mean, there is,
[00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:56.640]   I mean, it's probably,
[00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:58.760]   there's a correlation with a lot of things,
[00:57:58.760 --> 00:58:02.080]   but what the UFOlogists quote unquote often talk about
[00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:06.160]   is that there seems to be a much higher level
[00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:09.600]   of UFO sightings since like in the nuclear age.
[00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:12.520]   So like if aliens were indeed worried about us,
[00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:14.720]   like if you were aliens, you would start showing up
[00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:18.360]   when the living organisms first discovered a way
[00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:22.520]   to destroy the entire colony.
[00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:26.820]   - Couldn't the increase in sightings not have to do
[00:58:26.820 --> 00:58:29.720]   with the fact that people now have more cameras?
[00:58:29.720 --> 00:58:31.580]   - It's an interesting thing about science,
[00:58:31.580 --> 00:58:33.480]   like with UFO sightings,
[00:58:33.480 --> 00:58:38.480]   it's like either 99.9% of them are false
[00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:40.120]   or 100% of them are false.
[00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:44.480]   The interesting thing to me is in that 0.01%,
[00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:46.400]   there's a lot of things in science
[00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:50.320]   that are like these weird outliers
[00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:52.000]   that are difficult to replicate.
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:54.080]   You have like, there's even physical phenomena,
[00:58:54.080 --> 00:58:55.000]   ball lightning.
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:57.620]   There's difficult things to artificially create
[00:58:57.620 --> 00:59:01.780]   in large amounts or observe in nature in large amounts
[00:59:01.780 --> 00:59:02.980]   in such a way that you can do it
[00:59:02.980 --> 00:59:05.260]   to apply the scientific method.
[00:59:05.260 --> 00:59:07.060]   That could be just things that like,
[00:59:07.060 --> 00:59:11.040]   happen like a few times, like or once,
[00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:13.260]   and you're like, what the hell is that?
[00:59:13.260 --> 00:59:16.260]   And that's very difficult for science to know what to do it.
[00:59:16.260 --> 00:59:18.380]   I'm a huge proponent of just being open-minded
[00:59:18.380 --> 00:59:22.000]   'cause when you're open-minded about aliens, for example,
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:25.500]   is it allows you to think outside of the box
[00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:27.420]   in other domains as well.
[00:59:27.420 --> 00:59:28.980]   And somehow that will result,
[00:59:28.980 --> 00:59:31.500]   like if you're open-minded about aliens
[00:59:31.500 --> 00:59:34.580]   and you don't laugh it off immediately,
[00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:37.220]   what happens is somehow that's gonna lead to a solution
[00:59:37.220 --> 00:59:39.580]   to P equals NP or P not equals NP.
[00:59:39.580 --> 00:59:42.220]   Like in ways that you can't predict,
[00:59:42.220 --> 00:59:45.460]   the open-mindedness has tertiary effects
[00:59:45.460 --> 00:59:47.620]   that will result in progress, I believe,
[00:59:47.620 --> 00:59:49.660]   which is why I'm a huge fan of aliens
[00:59:49.660 --> 00:59:53.280]   'cause it's like, 'cause too many scientists
[00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:57.200]   roll their eyes at the idea of aliens, alien life.
[00:59:57.200 --> 01:00:00.600]   And to me, it's one of the most exciting possibilities
[01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:05.400]   in the biggest, most exciting questions
[01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:08.080]   before all of human civilization.
[01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:12.440]   So to roll your eyes is not the right answer.
[01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:14.780]   To roll your eyes presumes that you know anything
[01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:16.840]   about this world as opposed to just knowing
[01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:19.460]   0.0001% of this world.
[01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:21.460]   And so being humble in the face of that,
[01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:26.460]   being open to the possibility of aliens
[01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:28.000]   visiting Earth is a good idea.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.220]   Not everything though.
[01:00:30.220 --> 01:00:33.620]   I'm not so open-minded to the flat Earth hypothesis
[01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:37.220]   as there's a growing number of people believing in,
[01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:38.380]   but even then-
[01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:39.300]   - Or the inner Earth,
[01:00:39.300 --> 01:00:42.140]   I've got shouted at in a public talk about it.
[01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:44.140]   - So like the Earth is hollow?
[01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:46.940]   - Yeah, my understanding is that there's
[01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:50.300]   this conspiracy theory that as far as I can tell
[01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:52.020]   has no grounding in reality
[01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:55.260]   is that there's a slightly smaller Earth inside this one,
[01:00:55.260 --> 01:00:56.980]   which is just too cute as a concept.
[01:00:56.980 --> 01:00:57.820]   - That's awesome.
[01:00:57.820 --> 01:01:00.540]   - And you can access it, I think from Antarctica.
[01:01:00.540 --> 01:01:02.900]   And that's where we keep, and I quote,
[01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:04.720]   "The mammoths and the Nazis."
[01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:09.540]   - Yeah, I mean, that one is ridiculous, but like I do like-
[01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:11.700]   - Hey, I thought you were keeping an open mind.
[01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:12.860]   - This is-
[01:01:12.860 --> 01:01:14.780]   - I genuinely think that's more likely
[01:01:14.780 --> 01:01:16.020]   than aliens visiting the Earth.
[01:01:16.020 --> 01:01:19.740]   And I say this as someone who has dedicated her life
[01:01:19.740 --> 01:01:21.380]   to finding alien life.
[01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:26.380]   And so that's how improbable I think the visitations are.
[01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:30.940]   Because interstellar distances are so huge
[01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:32.660]   that it's just not really worth it.
[01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:34.600]   - See, I have a different view on this whole thing.
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:39.140]   I think the aliens that look like little green men
[01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:43.020]   are like extremely low probability event.
[01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:44.740]   - Like mammoths and Nazis under?
[01:01:44.740 --> 01:01:47.240]   - Yeah, yeah, that's similar.
[01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:52.240]   But other kind of ideas, like the sad thing to me,
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:57.500]   and I think in my view,
[01:01:57.500 --> 01:02:00.020]   if there's other alien civilizations out there
[01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:01.900]   and they visited Earth,
[01:02:01.900 --> 01:02:04.500]   neither them or perhaps just us
[01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:06.780]   would be even able to detect them.
[01:02:06.780 --> 01:02:10.260]   Like we wouldn't be open-minded enough to see it.
[01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:15.260]   Like if, because our understanding of what is life,
[01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:20.740]   and I just talked to Sarah Walker, who's-
[01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:21.580]   - You know Sarah?
[01:02:21.580 --> 01:02:23.860]   - Yeah, we talked for three hours
[01:02:23.860 --> 01:02:25.980]   about the question of what is life.
[01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:29.140]   - Sarah's a good person to talk to about what is life.
[01:02:29.140 --> 01:02:31.080]   - But like the whole point is we don't really,
[01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:34.140]   we have a very narrow-minded view of what is life.
[01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:38.060]   And when it shows up, and it might be already here,
[01:02:38.060 --> 01:02:39.860]   trees and dolphins and so on.
[01:02:39.860 --> 01:02:42.820]   (both laughing)
[01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:46.260]   And, or mountains, or I don't know,
[01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:49.220]   or the molecules in the atmosphere,
[01:02:49.220 --> 01:02:53.260]   or like I, people make fun of me,
[01:02:53.260 --> 01:02:56.520]   but I do think that ideas are kind of aliens themselves,
[01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:58.480]   or consciousness could be the aliens,
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:00.540]   or it could be the method by which they communicate.
[01:03:00.540 --> 01:03:03.340]   We don't know shit about the way our human mind works.
[01:03:03.340 --> 01:03:05.380]   And the fact that this thing is-
[01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:07.020]   - It could be a quantum process.
[01:03:07.020 --> 01:03:09.460]   - Please, no, I understand this.
[01:03:09.460 --> 01:03:11.820]   It's not woo-woo, I'm not, I,
[01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:12.940]   but it very well could be.
[01:03:12.940 --> 01:03:16.020]   There could be something at the physics level, right?
[01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:18.140]   It could be at the chemical, at the biological level,
[01:03:18.140 --> 01:03:19.980]   things that are happening that we're just close,
[01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:23.220]   too close-minded, because our conception of life
[01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:26.500]   is at the level of like us,
[01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:29.860]   like at the jungle level of mammals,
[01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:32.340]   and on the time scale that's the human time scale,
[01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:34.500]   we may not be able to perceive
[01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:37.680]   what alien life is actually like,
[01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:42.720]   the scale at which their intelligence realizes itself,
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:44.820]   we may not be able to perceive.
[01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:46.780]   And the other thing that's really important
[01:03:46.780 --> 01:03:50.780]   about alien visitations, whether it happened or not,
[01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:54.020]   is especially after COVID in 2020,
[01:03:54.020 --> 01:03:56.620]   I'm losing a little bit of faith of our government
[01:03:56.620 --> 01:04:00.140]   being able to handle that well, not our government,
[01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:03.980]   but us as a society, as a collective,
[01:04:03.980 --> 01:04:08.780]   being able to deal with new things in an effective way
[01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:11.600]   that's inspiring, that's efficient,
[01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:16.600]   that like, whether it's, if it's a dangerous thing
[01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:19.440]   to deal with it, to alleviate the danger,
[01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:22.020]   whether it's the possibility of new discoveries
[01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:24.780]   and something inspiring to ride that wave
[01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:27.100]   and make it inspiring, all those kinds of things.
[01:04:27.100 --> 01:04:29.180]   I honestly think if aliens showed up,
[01:04:29.180 --> 01:04:31.700]   they would look around, everybody would ignore them,
[01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:34.020]   and the government might like hide it,
[01:04:34.020 --> 01:04:37.260]   try to like see, to keep it from the Chinese and the Russians
[01:04:37.260 --> 01:04:38.540]   if it's the United States,
[01:04:38.540 --> 01:04:42.780]   call it a military secret in a very close-minded way.
[01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:44.900]   And then the bureaucracy would drown it away
[01:04:44.900 --> 01:04:47.220]   to where through paperwork,
[01:04:47.220 --> 01:04:50.580]   the poor aliens would just like waste away in a cell somewhere
[01:04:50.580 --> 01:04:51.400]   like there's a certain-
[01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:53.380]   - That would never happen.
[01:04:53.380 --> 01:04:55.420]   Part of the reason that I feel so confident
[01:04:55.420 --> 01:04:57.340]   that aliens have not visited,
[01:04:57.340 --> 01:04:58.700]   because they would have had to visit
[01:04:58.700 --> 01:05:00.780]   just to have a look remotely,
[01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:03.500]   from Neptune or something, which makes no sense
[01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:07.220]   because interstellar travel is so difficult
[01:05:07.220 --> 01:05:10.780]   that it would be quite a ridiculous proposition.
[01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:13.420]   But that's the bit that I think is technically possible.
[01:05:13.420 --> 01:05:16.180]   If they did come here and they were visible by anyone,
[01:05:16.180 --> 01:05:20.180]   detectable by anyone, the thought that any government,
[01:05:20.180 --> 01:05:23.140]   no matter, or any military could just contain them,
[01:05:23.140 --> 01:05:26.900]   these beings are capable of traveling interstellar distances
[01:05:26.900 --> 01:05:31.140]   when we can barely go to the moon, like barely go to the moon.
[01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:32.340]   - These things would be way, way, way, way-
[01:05:32.340 --> 01:05:36.980]   - Way, and the fact that we think our puny military,
[01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:39.300]   even if all the military in the world got together,
[01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:42.060]   and the fact that they could somehow contain,
[01:05:42.060 --> 01:05:44.260]   that's the bit that's left.
[01:05:44.260 --> 01:05:45.740]   - It's like ants trying to contain a human
[01:05:45.740 --> 01:05:48.020]   that visited them. - Exactly, exactly.
[01:05:48.020 --> 01:05:50.460]   And scientists, you would have to bring scientists on board.
[01:05:50.460 --> 01:05:52.100]   You've met a lot of scientists.
[01:05:52.100 --> 01:05:53.940]   How good are they at keeping secrets?
[01:05:53.940 --> 01:05:55.100]   'Cause in my experience,
[01:05:55.100 --> 01:05:58.660]   they're absolutely appalling at keeping secrets.
[01:05:58.660 --> 01:05:59.540]   - Yeah, that's terrible.
[01:05:59.540 --> 01:06:00.900]   - Even the phosphine on Venus thing,
[01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:03.220]   which was a pretty well-kept secret.
[01:06:03.220 --> 01:06:04.060]   - Oh, this is true.
[01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:05.340]   You had a bunch of people that were-
[01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:06.660]   - I told my dad.
[01:06:06.660 --> 01:06:08.060]   - Yeah. - My dad knew.
[01:06:08.060 --> 01:06:11.140]   And hopefully he didn't tell anyone,
[01:06:11.140 --> 01:06:12.700]   but if there had been an alien visiting,
[01:06:12.700 --> 01:06:14.420]   he probably would have told a mate.
[01:06:14.420 --> 01:06:20.020]   And so these secrets could not be kept by any scientist
[01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:22.100]   that I know, and certainly not collaborative scientists,
[01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:22.940]   which would be needed.
[01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:26.020]   You need all sorts of scientific teams.
[01:06:26.020 --> 01:06:31.020]   So between the pathetic power of any world's military
[01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:35.180]   compared to any civilization capable of traveling,
[01:06:35.180 --> 01:06:39.180]   and our absolute inability to keep secrets,
[01:06:39.180 --> 01:06:43.060]   absolutely not, I will bet everything
[01:06:43.060 --> 01:06:44.140]   that we have not been visited
[01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:47.140]   because we are too pathetic to hold that truth.
[01:06:47.140 --> 01:06:48.860]   - Well, let me push back,
[01:06:48.860 --> 01:06:51.220]   if we're just making a $10 bet.
[01:06:51.220 --> 01:06:55.420]   The possibility here that the main alien,
[01:06:55.420 --> 01:06:57.060]   say there exists one alien,
[01:06:57.060 --> 01:07:00.320]   other intelligent alien civilization in the galaxy.
[01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:05.420]   To me, if they visit Earth,
[01:07:05.420 --> 01:07:09.060]   what's going to visit Earth is like the crappy,
[01:07:09.060 --> 01:07:10.580]   like the really crappy-
[01:07:10.580 --> 01:07:11.580]   - Short straw.
[01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:12.620]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:07:12.620 --> 01:07:17.540]   - Like this really dumb thing that's, I don't know,
[01:07:17.540 --> 01:07:19.260]   like the early Game Boys or something.
[01:07:19.260 --> 01:07:20.620]   - I think there's a cartoon about this.
[01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:23.580]   There's an alien that gets sent to Earth,
[01:07:23.580 --> 01:07:25.940]   Commander Spiff or something,
[01:07:25.940 --> 01:07:28.420]   and it's kind of a punishment or something.
[01:07:28.420 --> 01:07:29.460]   But that's not possible.
[01:07:29.460 --> 01:07:31.420]   That's the thing, because interstellar distances
[01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:33.980]   are so hard to cross.
[01:07:33.980 --> 01:07:35.100]   - You have to do it on purpose.
[01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:35.940]   - You have to do it on purpose.
[01:07:35.940 --> 01:07:37.700]   It has to be a big, big deal.
[01:07:37.700 --> 01:07:39.940]   And we know this because, yes, you're right.
[01:07:39.940 --> 01:07:43.540]   We don't know enough about galactic biology.
[01:07:43.540 --> 01:07:46.260]   We don't know what the universal rules of biology
[01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:49.700]   or biochemistry are because we only have the Earth.
[01:07:49.700 --> 01:07:53.460]   But we do know that the laws of physics are universal.
[01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:55.900]   We can predict behavior in the universe
[01:07:55.900 --> 01:07:58.980]   and then see it happen based on these laws of physics.
[01:07:58.980 --> 01:08:01.780]   We know that the laws of chemistry are universal.
[01:08:01.780 --> 01:08:05.100]   We know the periodic table is all they have to choose from.
[01:08:05.100 --> 01:08:09.300]   So yes, there may be some sort of unimaginable intelligence,
[01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:12.700]   but they still have to use the same periodic table
[01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:14.140]   that we have access to.
[01:08:14.140 --> 01:08:16.260]   They still have a finite number of molecules
[01:08:16.260 --> 01:08:17.940]   they can do things with.
[01:08:17.940 --> 01:08:21.180]   So they still have to use the resources around them,
[01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:23.340]   the stars around them, the universe around them.
[01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:26.540]   And we know how much energy is in these places.
[01:08:26.540 --> 01:08:29.620]   And so, yes, they may be very capable,
[01:08:29.620 --> 01:08:32.100]   capable beyond our wildest dreams,
[01:08:32.100 --> 01:08:33.980]   but they're still in the same universe.
[01:08:33.980 --> 01:08:35.340]   And we know a lot of those rules.
[01:08:35.340 --> 01:08:36.860]   We're not completely blind.
[01:08:36.860 --> 01:08:40.980]   - But there's a colleague of yours at Harvard,
[01:08:40.980 --> 01:08:43.300]   Kamran Vafa, he's a theoretical physicist.
[01:08:43.300 --> 01:08:45.260]   I don't know if you know him.
[01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:48.020]   - I've only joined Harvard about six months ago.
[01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:48.980]   - Okay.
[01:08:48.980 --> 01:08:51.840]   It's time to meet all the theoretical physicists.
[01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:54.220]   So he's a string theorist,
[01:08:54.220 --> 01:08:59.220]   but his idea is that aliens that are sophisticated enough
[01:08:59.220 --> 01:09:04.620]   to travel interstellar, like those kinds of distances,
[01:09:04.620 --> 01:09:07.500]   will figure out actually ways to hack the fabric
[01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:10.540]   of the universe enough to have fun in other ways.
[01:09:10.540 --> 01:09:12.780]   Like this universe is too boring.
[01:09:12.780 --> 01:09:15.240]   Like you would figure out ways to create other universes
[01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:19.300]   or like you go outside the physics as we know it.
[01:09:19.300 --> 01:09:22.020]   So the reason we don't see aliens visiting us
[01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:24.300]   all over the place is they're having fun elsewhere.
[01:09:24.300 --> 01:09:25.980]   This is like way too boring.
[01:09:25.980 --> 01:09:27.320]   We humans think this is fun,
[01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:29.700]   but it's actually mostly empty space
[01:09:29.700 --> 01:09:31.700]   that no fun is happening.
[01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:33.860]   Like there's no fun in visiting Earth
[01:09:33.860 --> 01:09:35.740]   for a super advanced civilization.
[01:09:35.740 --> 01:09:38.820]   So he thinks like if alien civilizations are out there,
[01:09:38.820 --> 01:09:43.100]   they found outside of our current standard models
[01:09:43.100 --> 01:09:44.980]   of physics ways of having fun,
[01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:47.040]   that don't involve us.
[01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:48.460]   - And that's probably true.
[01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:49.720]   But even the notion of visiting,
[01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:52.460]   that's so literally pedestrian.
[01:09:52.460 --> 01:09:53.920]   Of course we want to go there
[01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:55.720]   'cause going there is the only thing we know.
[01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:58.360]   We see a thing we want, we wanna go there and get it.
[01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:00.080]   But that is probably something
[01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:03.640]   they've no longer got need for.
[01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:07.920]   I specifically don't particularly wanna go to space.
[01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:08.840]   Sounds awful.
[01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:11.800]   None of the things I like are gonna be there.
[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:16.080]   And my whole work is my whole career
[01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:17.880]   is finding life and understanding the universe.
[01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:20.040]   So I care a lot.
[01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:22.000]   But I care about knowing about it.
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.480]   And I feel no need to go there to learn about it.
[01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:27.480]   And I think as we develop better tools,
[01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:29.240]   hopefully people will feel less and less
[01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:32.840]   the need to go everywhere that we know about.
[01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:36.400]   And I would expect any alien civilization worth their salt
[01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:39.000]   have developed observation tools
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.480]   and tools that allow them to understand
[01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:44.320]   the universe around them and beyond
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:45.680]   without having to go there.
[01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:48.280]   This going is so wasteful.
[01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:50.520]   - Yeah, so more focused on the knowledge
[01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:52.240]   and the learning versus the colonization,
[01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:55.080]   like the conquering and all those kinds of things.
[01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:57.240]   - That's beneath them.
[01:10:57.240 --> 01:10:58.640]   - That's beneath them.
[01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:01.320]   I mean, that said, do you think there's
[01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:03.360]   in your hopeful search for life
[01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:06.160]   through phosphine and other gases,
[01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:10.800]   do you think there's other alien civilizations out there?
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:13.680]   First, do you think there's other life out there?
[01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:16.600]   First, do you think there's life in the solar system?
[01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:21.480]   Second, do you think there's life in the galaxy?
[01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:24.960]   And third, do you think there's intelligent life
[01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:27.860]   in the solar system or the galaxy outside of earth?
[01:11:27.860 --> 01:11:30.200]   - So intelligent life, I have no idea.
[01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:33.360]   It seems deeply unlikely possible,
[01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:35.360]   but I'm not even sure if it's plausible.
[01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:37.040]   - So that's the special thing to you about earth
[01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:38.480]   is somehow intelligent life came to be.
[01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:41.360]   - Yes, and it's only very briefly,
[01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:44.160]   probably extremely briefly.
[01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:47.120]   - Uh-oh, you mean like it's always going to be,
[01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:48.320]   like we're gonna destroy ourselves?
[01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:49.160]   - Exactly.
[01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:49.980]   - Oh boy.
[01:11:49.980 --> 01:11:52.520]   - And life will continue on earth happily,
[01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:54.280]   probably more happily.
[01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:56.800]   - The trees and the dolphins will be here, I'm telling you.
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:12:00.960]   - And the cockroaches and the incredible fungi,
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:02.280]   they'll be fine.
[01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:04.800]   So life on earth will be fine,
[01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:08.080]   was fine before us and will be fine after us.
[01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:10.400]   So I'm not that worried about intelligent life,
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:11.800]   but I think it is unlikely.
[01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:13.740]   Even on earth is unlikely.
[01:12:13.740 --> 01:12:15.660]   Out of, what is it, 5 billion species
[01:12:15.660 --> 01:12:16.920]   across the history of the earth?
[01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:17.920]   - Yes.
[01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:19.680]   - There's been one, an intelligent one,
[01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:21.480]   and for a blink of an eye,
[01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:23.580]   possibly not much longer than that.
[01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:27.340]   So I wouldn't bet on that at all,
[01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:29.040]   though I would love it, of course.
[01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:34.040]   I wanted to find aliens since I was a little girl.
[01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:38.800]   And so of course I initially wanted to find ones
[01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:40.680]   that I could be friends with.
[01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:42.320]   And I've had to let go of that dream
[01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:44.200]   because it's so deeply implausible.
[01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:45.880]   - But see the nice, and sorry to interrupt,
[01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:48.880]   but the nice thing about intelligent alien civilizations,
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:52.400]   they may have more biosignatures than non-intelligent ones.
[01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:54.680]   So they might be easier to detect.
[01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:56.280]   That would be the hope.
[01:12:56.280 --> 01:12:57.400]   - On earth that's not the case,
[01:12:57.400 --> 01:12:59.040]   but it could be the case elsewhere.
[01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:00.320]   - Oh, it's not the case on earth.
[01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:02.120]   - Most of the biosignatures we have on earth
[01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:04.320]   are created by quite simple life.
[01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:08.040]   If you don't count pollution, pollution is all,
[01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:08.880]   all us babies.
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:16.120]   - So you don't see polluting gases as a possible like.
[01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:18.600]   - I look for polluting gases.
[01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:20.920]   I would love to find polluting gases.
[01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:23.840]   Well, I'd be worried for them, of course,
[01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:27.720]   the same way I think about my alien colleagues all the time,
[01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:30.560]   looking at us and I'm sure they worry about our pollutions.
[01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:34.360]   But it would be a really good, robust,
[01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:38.000]   unambiguous sign of life if we found complex pollutants.
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.520]   So I look for those too.
[01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:41.080]   I just don't have any hope of finding them.
[01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:44.200]   I think intelligent life in the galaxy
[01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:49.200]   at the same time that we're looking is deeply implausible.
[01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:53.080]   But life I think is inevitable.
[01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:56.040]   And if it is inevitable, it is common.
[01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:59.960]   So I think there'll be life everywhere in the galaxy.
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:03.720]   Now how common that life is, I think will depend a lot
[01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:06.960]   on whether there's life in the solar system beyond earth.
[01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:10.160]   So I'll adjust my expectations very much based
[01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:13.080]   on there being life in the solar system.
[01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:16.040]   If there's life in the Venusian clouds,
[01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:19.440]   if there's life in the, if there are biosignatures
[01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:21.840]   coming out of the plumes of Enceladus,
[01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:23.560]   if there's life on Titan.
[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:24.400]   - Oh yeah, that's right.
[01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:26.000]   Enceladus, yeah, yeah, yeah, plumes of Enceladus.
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.040]   That's the Saturn one.
[01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:30.280]   It's the moon that has the geysers that come out.
[01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:34.120]   And so you can't see the subterranean oceans, but.
[01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:36.560]   - It's supposed, so it would be in the atmosphere.
[01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:38.920]   I was gonna ask you about that one.
[01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:40.160]   Have you looked at that?
[01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:43.800]   Have you, is that a hope for you to use the tools
[01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:48.360]   you're using with RASCO and other ways
[01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:53.480]   for detecting the 16,000 molecules
[01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:56.720]   that might be biosignatures to look at Enceladus?
[01:14:56.720 --> 01:14:59.000]   - Yes, that's absolutely the plan.
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.480]   - Is there, what's the limiting factor currently?
[01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:03.840]   Is it the quality of the telescopes?
[01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:07.160]   Is it, what's the quality of the data?
[01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:09.760]   - Yeah, the quality of the data, the observational data,
[01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:13.440]   and also the quality of RASCO and other associated things.
[01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:15.080]   So we're missing a lot of fundamental data
[01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:16.680]   to interpret the data that we get,
[01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:19.160]   and we don't have good enough data.
[01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:22.720]   But hopefully we will, in the coming decades,
[01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:24.680]   we'll get some information on Titan.
[01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:26.300]   We have Dragonfly going over.
[01:15:27.300 --> 01:15:29.820]   We'll get the plumes of Enceladus.
[01:15:29.820 --> 01:15:32.940]   We will look at the clouds of Venus,
[01:15:32.940 --> 01:15:33.940]   and there's other places.
[01:15:33.940 --> 01:15:38.940]   And so if we find any life or any sign of life ever,
[01:15:38.940 --> 01:15:42.940]   like on Mars, then I'll adjust my calculations,
[01:15:42.940 --> 01:15:46.620]   and I'll say life is not just inevitable and common,
[01:15:46.620 --> 01:15:48.220]   but extremely common,
[01:15:48.220 --> 01:15:50.100]   because all of these places we've mentioned,
[01:15:50.100 --> 01:15:51.820]   the subterranean oceans on Enceladus,
[01:15:51.820 --> 01:15:56.020]   the methane oceans of Titan, the clouds of Venus,
[01:15:56.020 --> 01:15:57.580]   the acidic clouds of Venus,
[01:15:57.580 --> 01:15:59.620]   these are places that are very different
[01:15:59.620 --> 01:16:02.020]   from the places where we find life on Earth,
[01:16:02.020 --> 01:16:04.060]   even the most extreme places.
[01:16:04.060 --> 01:16:05.540]   And so if life can originate
[01:16:05.540 --> 01:16:09.060]   in all of these completely different habitats,
[01:16:09.060 --> 01:16:12.700]   then life is even more resourceful than we thought.
[01:16:12.700 --> 01:16:14.660]   - Yeah, that's really- - Which means it's everywhere.
[01:16:14.660 --> 01:16:16.820]   - That's really exciting if it's everywhere.
[01:16:16.820 --> 01:16:21.420]   If there's life on just one of the moons, if it's on Mars.
[01:16:21.420 --> 01:16:22.980]   - Anywhere, anywhere in the solar system,
[01:16:22.980 --> 01:16:25.620]   and I will bet everything I own
[01:16:25.620 --> 01:16:28.100]   that every solar system, every planetary system
[01:16:28.100 --> 01:16:31.140]   has a potential for habitability,
[01:16:31.140 --> 01:16:33.060]   because even if they don't have a habitable planet,
[01:16:33.060 --> 01:16:36.020]   they'll have moons around other giant planets,
[01:16:36.020 --> 01:16:39.180]   and there'll be so much life.
[01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:43.060]   So for me, that's the only thing to figure out now,
[01:16:43.060 --> 01:16:45.540]   whether life is inevitable and quite common
[01:16:45.540 --> 01:16:49.580]   throughout the galaxy or everywhere,
[01:16:49.580 --> 01:16:51.380]   but it's somewhere between those two.
[01:16:51.380 --> 01:16:53.460]   Intelligent life, I make no bets.
[01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:56.500]   And if I had to bet, I would be against.
[01:16:56.500 --> 01:17:02.180]   - See, to me, two discoveries in the 21st century
[01:17:02.180 --> 01:17:03.520]   would change everything.
[01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:08.460]   One is, and maybe I'm biased,
[01:17:08.460 --> 01:17:12.860]   but one is the discovery of life in the solar system.
[01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:15.620]   I feel like that would change our whole conception
[01:17:15.620 --> 01:17:18.700]   of how unique we are in the universe.
[01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:20.940]   I think I'm much more eager than you are
[01:17:20.940 --> 01:17:23.580]   to jump from basic life to intelligent life.
[01:17:23.580 --> 01:17:26.320]   I feel like if there's life everywhere,
[01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:30.600]   like the odds are there has, like we cannot,
[01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:35.000]   like you have, oh, I see, you're saying
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:36.980]   there could have been many intelligent civilizations
[01:17:36.980 --> 01:17:38.420]   out there, but they just keep dying out.
[01:17:38.420 --> 01:17:40.100]   It's like little- - Yeah, I was detecting them,
[01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:41.260]   you know, ships in the night.
[01:17:41.260 --> 01:17:43.260]   - Ships in the night.
[01:17:43.260 --> 01:17:45.980]   Now that's ultra sad, just like-
[01:17:45.980 --> 01:17:47.060]   - Is it sad?
[01:17:47.060 --> 01:17:48.700]   - A graveyard of things. - The Earth is not better
[01:17:48.700 --> 01:17:49.860]   for having us.
[01:17:49.860 --> 01:17:53.340]   It doesn't owe us anything.
[01:17:53.340 --> 01:17:56.020]   - Would you be sad to find alien giraffes?
[01:17:56.020 --> 01:17:59.140]   Would you be disappointed if you found alien giraffes?
[01:17:59.140 --> 01:18:00.300]   'Cause I would not.
[01:18:00.300 --> 01:18:02.020]   - No, well, giraffes, first of all,
[01:18:02.020 --> 01:18:03.860]   they look goofy with their necks and everything, but-
[01:18:03.860 --> 01:18:06.140]   - But no, we do not shit on giraffes.
[01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:07.940]   - Okay. - Giraffes are wondrous animals,
[01:18:07.940 --> 01:18:09.180]   are deeply understudied.
[01:18:09.180 --> 01:18:10.780]   We still know so little about them
[01:18:10.780 --> 01:18:12.940]   'cause no one does PhDs in giraffes.
[01:18:12.940 --> 01:18:15.920]   I am disappointed I made a PhD in phosphine
[01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:17.600]   when people aren't doing PhDs in giraffes.
[01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:19.460]   We do not know enough about giraffes.
[01:18:19.460 --> 01:18:20.780]   - I think it was like Ricky Gervais
[01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:22.740]   that did a whole, like a long thing about-
[01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:25.020]   - I don't trust Ricky Gervais to talk about giraffes.
[01:18:25.020 --> 01:18:26.620]   That is not his expertise.
[01:18:26.620 --> 01:18:29.540]   - Yeah, but it's a stupid neck.
[01:18:29.540 --> 01:18:31.580]   It doesn't make any sense.
[01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:32.420]   I mean, that's fine.
[01:18:32.420 --> 01:18:34.020]   - Giraffes are very resourceful animals
[01:18:34.020 --> 01:18:36.700]   who do incredible things and can kick a lion in the face.
[01:18:36.700 --> 01:18:38.020]   - Why don't you climb the tree?
[01:18:38.020 --> 01:18:39.180]   Why don't you climb the tree?
[01:18:39.180 --> 01:18:42.340]   You don't need to grow through the lengthy evolutionary-
[01:18:42.340 --> 01:18:44.020]   - I'm not shitting on giraffes.
[01:18:44.020 --> 01:18:45.980]   - Okay, fine. - Giraffes are wondrous animals.
[01:18:45.980 --> 01:18:48.060]   - I would very appreciate it. - Take it back.
[01:18:48.060 --> 01:18:49.980]   - I take it back, I apologize.
[01:18:49.980 --> 01:18:52.600]   I trust your expertise on this.
[01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:57.780]   The thing that makes humans really fascinating,
[01:18:57.780 --> 01:19:01.300]   and I think the earth, but I'm a human,
[01:19:01.300 --> 01:19:04.100]   is we create- - It's a timer.
[01:19:04.100 --> 01:19:07.140]   - Yeah, we create things that are,
[01:19:07.140 --> 01:19:09.300]   yes, there's all the ugliness in the world.
[01:19:09.300 --> 01:19:11.620]   There's all the, on the biological,
[01:19:11.620 --> 01:19:13.660]   on the chemical level, there's the pollution,
[01:19:13.660 --> 01:19:18.420]   but we create beauty.
[01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:22.060]   If you even from a physics perspective look at symmetry
[01:19:22.060 --> 01:19:24.980]   as somehow capturing beauty, the breaking of symmetries,
[01:19:24.980 --> 01:19:28.160]   stuff grounded in all the different definitions of symmetry,
[01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:31.380]   we're good at creating things.
[01:19:31.380 --> 01:19:32.620]   - So are spiders.
[01:19:32.620 --> 01:19:36.340]   - But not giraffes, okay.
[01:19:36.340 --> 01:19:38.100]   But yes, this is- - Spiders.
[01:19:38.100 --> 01:19:39.140]   - Yes, this is the point. - There are spiders
[01:19:39.140 --> 01:19:41.020]   that create little bubbles of air
[01:19:41.020 --> 01:19:42.460]   so they can breathe underwater.
[01:19:42.460 --> 01:19:44.620]   They can literally scuba dive.
[01:19:44.620 --> 01:19:46.660]   There are spiders that can create parachutes
[01:19:46.660 --> 01:19:47.940]   so they can glide.
[01:19:47.940 --> 01:19:51.540]   And talk about symmetry, look what spiders can do.
[01:19:51.540 --> 01:19:52.980]   And I just thought of spiders,
[01:19:52.980 --> 01:19:56.620]   but if I was an alien species coming to earth,
[01:19:56.620 --> 01:19:58.420]   there'll be plenty to wander,
[01:19:58.420 --> 01:20:01.300]   and we would just be one- - One of the things.
[01:20:01.300 --> 01:20:05.260]   - Yeah, clunky, naked monkey.
[01:20:05.260 --> 01:20:07.620]   - Yeah, the ants might be even more fascinating.
[01:20:07.620 --> 01:20:10.580]   - The ants, ants can figure out exactly
[01:20:10.580 --> 01:20:13.500]   through some emergent consciousness
[01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:16.700]   what the maximum distance between their trash,
[01:20:16.700 --> 01:20:19.220]   their babies, and their food is,
[01:20:19.220 --> 01:20:22.820]   just from without any of them knowing how to do this.
[01:20:22.820 --> 01:20:24.980]   And collectively, they've learned how to do this.
[01:20:24.980 --> 01:20:27.620]   If I was an alien species, I'll be looking at that.
[01:20:27.620 --> 01:20:29.220]   - Well, so that was the other thing I was gonna mention.
[01:20:29.220 --> 01:20:31.740]   The second thing is I tend to believe
[01:20:31.740 --> 01:20:33.700]   we can engineer consciousness,
[01:20:33.700 --> 01:20:35.260]   but at the basic level,
[01:20:35.260 --> 01:20:37.700]   understand the source of consciousness.
[01:20:37.700 --> 01:20:42.380]   Because if consciousness is unique to humans,
[01:20:42.380 --> 01:20:44.220]   and if we can engineer it,
[01:20:44.220 --> 01:20:46.460]   that gives me hope that it can be present
[01:20:46.460 --> 01:20:47.580]   elsewhere in the universe.
[01:20:47.580 --> 01:20:49.820]   That's the other thing that makes,
[01:20:49.820 --> 01:20:50.860]   it's an open question, - The great-
[01:20:50.860 --> 01:20:53.620]   - that makes humans perhaps special
[01:20:53.620 --> 01:20:55.980]   is not maybe the presence of consciousness,
[01:20:55.980 --> 01:21:00.140]   but somehow a presence of elevated consciousness.
[01:21:00.140 --> 01:21:02.580]   It does, again, maybe human-centric,
[01:21:02.580 --> 01:21:04.740]   but it feels like we're more conscious than giraffes,
[01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:06.860]   for example, and spiders.
[01:21:06.860 --> 01:21:08.860]   - Yes, I won't deny that.
[01:21:08.860 --> 01:21:10.860]   There is something special about humans.
[01:21:10.860 --> 01:21:12.900]   They're my favorite species.
[01:21:12.900 --> 01:21:14.100]   - They are.
[01:21:14.100 --> 01:21:14.940]   - They are.
[01:21:14.940 --> 01:21:18.380]   Some of my best friends are humans.
[01:21:18.380 --> 01:21:19.220]   - Yeah.
[01:21:19.220 --> 01:21:23.580]   - I think highly of humans.
[01:21:23.580 --> 01:21:24.860]   It's great.
[01:21:24.860 --> 01:21:29.220]   I just don't have great hope for our longevity,
[01:21:29.220 --> 01:21:30.940]   and specifically, I don't have great hope,
[01:21:30.940 --> 01:21:33.140]   given that we're the only species out of 5 billion
[01:21:33.140 --> 01:21:35.660]   that did this cool consciousness trick.
[01:21:35.660 --> 01:21:40.660]   I just, I don't wanna bet on finding a kin ship elsewhere.
[01:21:42.100 --> 01:21:44.060]   - That's quite interesting to think about.
[01:21:44.060 --> 01:21:47.660]   I don't think I've even considered that possibility
[01:21:47.660 --> 01:21:51.580]   that there would be life in the solar system.
[01:21:51.580 --> 01:21:54.780]   So that indicates that very possibly,
[01:21:54.780 --> 01:21:57.100]   life is literally everywhere.
[01:21:57.100 --> 01:21:58.780]   - Yeah, everywhere it can happen, it does.
[01:21:58.780 --> 01:22:01.700]   - Yeah, and especially what we're discovering
[01:22:01.700 --> 01:22:06.140]   with the exoplanets now, how numerous they are,
[01:22:06.140 --> 01:22:09.500]   or Earth-like, habitable, quote-unquote, planets.
[01:22:10.940 --> 01:22:12.180]   Like, they're everywhere.
[01:22:12.180 --> 01:22:15.380]   - The most common type of planet is rocky, it seems.
[01:22:15.380 --> 01:22:18.020]   - But I didn't consider the possibility
[01:22:18.020 --> 01:22:20.740]   that life is literally everywhere,
[01:22:20.740 --> 01:22:25.740]   and yet, intelligent life is nowhere long enough
[01:22:25.740 --> 01:22:28.020]   to communicate with each other,
[01:22:28.020 --> 01:22:31.380]   to form little clusters of civilizations
[01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:33.740]   that expand beyond the solar system, and so on.
[01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:39.540]   Man, maybe becoming a multi-planetary species
[01:22:39.540 --> 01:22:44.140]   is a less likely pursuit than we imagined.
[01:22:44.140 --> 01:22:44.980]   - I agree.
[01:22:44.980 --> 01:22:47.380]   - But one of the things that makes humans beautiful
[01:22:47.380 --> 01:22:48.980]   is we hope.
[01:22:48.980 --> 01:22:52.820]   - But I hope for humanity,
[01:22:52.820 --> 01:22:54.620]   and one of the things I hope for
[01:22:54.620 --> 01:22:57.940]   is that we become less obsessed with conquering,
[01:22:57.940 --> 01:23:02.260]   and we become less obsessed with spreading ourselves.
[01:23:02.260 --> 01:23:06.660]   I hope that we transcend that,
[01:23:06.660 --> 01:23:08.420]   that we're happy with the universe
[01:23:08.420 --> 01:23:10.100]   without having to go and take it.
[01:23:10.100 --> 01:23:13.460]   So, you can hope for the species
[01:23:13.460 --> 01:23:16.960]   without hoping for a multi-planetary existence.
[01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:20.940]   That is only, I think, the drive
[01:23:20.940 --> 01:23:25.540]   of our most primitive instincts to go and take,
[01:23:25.540 --> 01:23:28.220]   to go and plant a flag somewhere.
[01:23:28.220 --> 01:23:30.980]   We love planting a flag somewhere,
[01:23:30.980 --> 01:23:35.220]   and maybe we could overcome that minor drive.
[01:23:35.220 --> 01:23:39.660]   And once we do, the AI systems we build will destroy us
[01:23:39.660 --> 01:23:41.260]   because we're too peaceful,
[01:23:41.260 --> 01:23:43.540]   and they will go and conquer and plant the flags.
[01:23:43.540 --> 01:23:44.460]   - Best of luck to them.
[01:23:44.460 --> 01:23:49.460]   The cockroaches will be happy to keep to the business
[01:23:49.460 --> 01:23:50.900]   as they always have.
[01:23:50.900 --> 01:23:53.900]   - I tend to believe that robots can have the same elegance
[01:23:53.900 --> 01:23:59.420]   and consciousness and all the qualities of kindness
[01:23:59.420 --> 01:24:02.700]   and love and hope and fear that humans have.
[01:24:02.700 --> 01:24:05.100]   - In principle, they could, yes.
[01:24:05.100 --> 01:24:08.020]   - I don't really trust the people who make them.
[01:24:08.020 --> 01:24:12.540]   - This is about the giraffe comment, isn't it?
[01:24:12.540 --> 01:24:13.900]   Okay.
[01:24:13.900 --> 01:24:16.180]   - I haven't forgiven you for shitting on giraffes.
[01:24:16.180 --> 01:24:18.260]   What have they done to you?
[01:24:18.260 --> 01:24:19.780]   - Just as a small tangent,
[01:24:19.780 --> 01:24:22.260]   your master's thesis is also fascinating.
[01:24:22.260 --> 01:24:24.820]   Maybe we could talk about it for just a little bit.
[01:24:24.820 --> 01:24:27.620]   It's titled "Influence of a Star's Evolution
[01:24:27.620 --> 01:24:29.900]   on its Planetary System."
[01:24:29.900 --> 01:24:33.660]   So, this interplay between a star and a planet,
[01:24:33.660 --> 01:24:34.860]   is there something interesting
[01:24:34.860 --> 01:24:36.460]   you could say about what you've learned
[01:24:36.460 --> 01:24:40.620]   about this journey that a star takes
[01:24:40.620 --> 01:24:42.720]   and the planets around it?
[01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:44.900]   - Well, when I was younger and I was told
[01:24:44.900 --> 01:24:48.460]   what would happen ultimately to the earth
[01:24:48.460 --> 01:24:51.100]   as the sun expands towards a red giant
[01:24:51.100 --> 01:24:55.460]   and Mercury would just like fall in
[01:24:55.460 --> 01:25:00.220]   and then Venus fall in and the sun doesn't care.
[01:25:00.220 --> 01:25:05.220]   And it just seemed so, I felt so small.
[01:25:05.220 --> 01:25:08.380]   I felt like the earth and everything on it,
[01:25:08.380 --> 01:25:10.340]   it's just the universe doesn't care.
[01:25:10.340 --> 01:25:12.300]   Even our sun doesn't care.
[01:25:12.300 --> 01:25:13.940]   And I think I felt like our sun should feel
[01:25:13.940 --> 01:25:17.660]   some sort of responsibility for its planets, you know?
[01:25:17.660 --> 01:25:19.860]   And it just felt like such a violent
[01:25:19.860 --> 01:25:21.700]   and neglectful parent.
[01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:23.340]   - It's like a parent eating its own children.
[01:25:23.340 --> 01:25:24.180]   - It's horrible.
[01:25:24.180 --> 01:25:25.760]   It's just a horrible notion.
[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:29.520]   But it made me think, what if there's some sort
[01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:30.940]   of generation?
[01:25:30.940 --> 01:25:34.000]   And so at the time when I was doing my master's,
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.300]   there was a notion of the white dwarf cemetery,
[01:25:36.300 --> 01:25:39.040]   which is this idea that when stars become white dwarfs,
[01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:42.400]   that death is so horrible that planets,
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:43.660]   potentially habitable planets
[01:25:43.660 --> 01:25:46.380]   that could have been habitable before, they're now gone.
[01:25:46.380 --> 01:25:49.380]   There's no chance for life.
[01:25:49.380 --> 01:25:51.940]   But then I thought, what if life returns?
[01:25:51.940 --> 01:25:54.300]   You know, now it's a white dwarf, it's calmed down.
[01:25:54.300 --> 01:25:55.180]   It's not gonna go anywhere.
[01:25:55.180 --> 01:25:59.600]   White dwarfs are very stable across universal timescales.
[01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:03.120]   And so could you have planets around a white dwarf
[01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:05.280]   that could themselves get life again?
[01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:07.880]   Life doesn't care.
[01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:12.880]   And so my work was basically killing dozens of planets
[01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:14.460]   thousands of times.
[01:26:14.460 --> 01:26:18.640]   I just ran thousands and thousands of end body simulations.
[01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:19.720]   - Oh, you simulated this?
[01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:22.520]   - Yeah, so I simulated the star growing
[01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:24.560]   and just eating all these planets up
[01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:26.800]   and just absolute chaos.
[01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:28.720]   The orbits of the planets would change
[01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:30.080]   as the star loses mass.
[01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:32.880]   So you would have like Jupiter planets
[01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:34.520]   just crashing into the other planets,
[01:26:34.520 --> 01:26:36.360]   throwing them into the sun early.
[01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:40.640]   It was terrifying to watch these simulations.
[01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:44.400]   It was absolute carnage.
[01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:47.400]   But if you run thousands of these simulations,
[01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:51.680]   some systems find new balanced ways of staying alive.
[01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:55.720]   Some systems post star death
[01:26:55.720 --> 01:26:59.000]   find stable orbits again for billions of years,
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.720]   more than enough for life to originate again.
[01:27:01.720 --> 01:27:04.920]   And so that was my idea during that time
[01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:06.760]   that Thesis was trying to explore
[01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:11.800]   this notion of life coming back
[01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:15.800]   and this idea of the universe doesn't care
[01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:17.280]   if you're here or not.
[01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:18.840]   And it will go about its business.
[01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:20.720]   You know, Andromeda will crash into us
[01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:23.320]   and doesn't care.
[01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:25.760]   No one cares if you're alive in the universe.
[01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:29.560]   And so letting go of that preciousness of life,
[01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:31.880]   I found very useful at that stage in my career.
[01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:33.600]   And instead I just thought,
[01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:36.280]   what if life is inevitable?
[01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:39.000]   It doesn't matter that it came by 4 billion years ago.
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.320]   It can start again 4 billion years later.
[01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:43.960]   And maybe that is nice.
[01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:45.440]   Maybe that's where hope lies,
[01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:48.920]   the Phoenix rising everywhere.
[01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:53.360]   Planets being destroyed and created and we're here now
[01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:56.320]   and others will be more or less here-ish
[01:27:56.320 --> 01:27:57.600]   billions of years later.
[01:27:57.600 --> 01:28:02.240]   - So accepting the cycle of death and life and yeah.
[01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:03.760]   - I'm not taking it personally.
[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:05.000]   - Not taking it personally.
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:06.560]   - The sun doesn't owe us anything.
[01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:08.160]   It's not a bad parent.
[01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:10.160]   It's not a parent at all.
[01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:11.360]   - Yeah.
[01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:13.880]   I was looking at the work of Freeman Dyson
[01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:18.520]   and seeing how this universe eventually
[01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:21.560]   will just be a bunch of super massive black holes
[01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:22.400]   before they also evaporate.
[01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:24.840]   - A bunch of tiny black holes too.
[01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:25.660]   - Yeah.
[01:28:25.660 --> 01:28:26.560]   - Absolute quiet.
[01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:27.960]   Everyone, all the black holes,
[01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:31.080]   a little too far away from one another to even interact
[01:28:31.080 --> 01:28:33.400]   until it's just silence forever.
[01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:39.000]   But until then, many, many cycles of death and destruction
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:40.540]   and rebirth.
[01:28:40.540 --> 01:28:42.320]   - And rebirth.
[01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:45.000]   You kept bringing up sort of coding stuff up.
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:46.840]   I wanted to ask two things.
[01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:51.840]   First of all, what programming language do you like?
[01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:57.080]   And also, what, 'cause you're as a computational,
[01:28:57.080 --> 01:29:01.880]   quantum astrochemist, no.
[01:29:01.880 --> 01:29:02.720]   - No, no, that's correct.
[01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:03.540]   - That's right.
[01:29:03.540 --> 01:29:09.920]   You're kind of, you could say you're actually understanding
[01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:12.640]   some exceptionally complicated things
[01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:14.120]   with one of the things you're using
[01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:18.040]   is the tools of computation, of programming.
[01:29:18.040 --> 01:29:20.440]   Is there a device you can give to people?
[01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:25.440]   'Cause I know quite a few that have not practiced that tool
[01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:27.360]   and have fallen in love with a particular science,
[01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:30.400]   whatever it's, biology and chemistry and physics and so on.
[01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:34.800]   And if they were interested in learning to program
[01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:37.440]   and learning to use computation as a tool
[01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:39.280]   in their particular science,
[01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:41.300]   is there advice you can give on programming
[01:29:41.300 --> 01:29:44.240]   and also just maybe a comment on your own journey
[01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:47.680]   and the use of programming in your own life?
[01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:50.960]   - Well, I'm a terrible programmer.
[01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:52.880]   A lot of scientists, their programming is bad
[01:29:52.880 --> 01:29:55.240]   because we never learned formal programming.
[01:29:55.240 --> 01:29:57.880]   We learned science, physics, chemistry.
[01:29:57.880 --> 01:30:01.600]   And then we were told, oh, you have to get these equations
[01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:04.160]   modeled and run through a simulation.
[01:30:04.160 --> 01:30:05.000]   And you're like, oh, okay,
[01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.400]   so I'm gonna learn how to code to do this.
[01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:10.040]   And you learn just as much as you need
[01:30:10.040 --> 01:30:11.200]   to run these simulations.
[01:30:11.200 --> 01:30:14.360]   And no more, so they're rarely optimized.
[01:30:14.360 --> 01:30:15.200]   They're really clunky.
[01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:17.160]   Six months later, you can't read your own code.
[01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:19.600]   All my variable names are extremely embarrassing.
[01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:24.600]   I still have error messages for different compilation errors
[01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:29.600]   that say things like, at least your dad loves you, Clara.
[01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:30.440]   You know, it doesn't help me at all.
[01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:31.680]   - Oh, so there's like humor?
[01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:34.200]   - Yeah, just like you suck at coding,
[01:30:34.200 --> 01:30:36.600]   but there's other things in your life.
[01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:37.800]   So I'm a bad programmer.
[01:30:37.800 --> 01:30:40.120]   And so, if that will give hope to anyone else
[01:30:40.120 --> 01:30:41.000]   who's a bad programmer,
[01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:44.240]   I can still do pretty impressive science.
[01:30:44.240 --> 01:30:47.600]   But I learned, I think I started learning MATLAB and Java
[01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:48.680]   when I was in college.
[01:30:48.680 --> 01:30:50.440]   It did me no good at all.
[01:30:50.440 --> 01:30:52.680]   It has not been particularly useful.
[01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:54.080]   I learned some Fortran.
[01:30:54.080 --> 01:30:55.240]   That was very useful,
[01:30:55.240 --> 01:30:58.360]   even though it's really not a fun language
[01:30:58.360 --> 01:31:02.560]   because so much of legacy code is in Fortran.
[01:31:02.560 --> 01:31:04.760]   And so if you wanna use other people's code
[01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:08.120]   who have now retired, Fortran will be nice.
[01:31:08.120 --> 01:31:10.080]   And then I used IDL to visualize.
[01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:12.640]   So that simulation and body simulation,
[01:31:12.640 --> 01:31:14.760]   that was all Fortran and IDL.
[01:31:14.760 --> 01:31:17.040]   But thankfully, since I've left college,
[01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:19.320]   I've just learned Python like a normal person
[01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:21.440]   and that has been much nicer.
[01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:24.400]   So most of my code now is in Python.
[01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:26.720]   - I should also make a few quick comments as well.
[01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:30.520]   So one is, you say you're sort of bad at programming.
[01:31:30.520 --> 01:31:34.760]   I've worked with a lot of excellent scientists
[01:31:34.760 --> 01:31:36.760]   that are quote unquote bad at programming.
[01:31:36.760 --> 01:31:38.880]   They're not, it gets the job done.
[01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:42.580]   In fact, there's a downside to sort of,
[01:31:42.580 --> 01:31:46.440]   especially getting a software engineering education.
[01:31:46.440 --> 01:31:47.840]   If I were to give advice,
[01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:50.240]   especially if you're doing a computer science degree
[01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:52.280]   and you're doing software engineering,
[01:31:52.280 --> 01:31:57.280]   is not to get lost in the optimization of the correct,
[01:31:57.280 --> 01:32:00.920]   there's an obsession, you can see it in Stack Overflow,
[01:32:00.920 --> 01:32:03.560]   of the correct way to do things.
[01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:07.400]   And I think you can too easily get lost
[01:32:07.400 --> 01:32:10.520]   in constantly trying to optimize
[01:32:10.520 --> 01:32:11.720]   and do things the correct way
[01:32:11.720 --> 01:32:13.360]   when you actually never get done.
[01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:14.360]   The same thing happens,
[01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:18.200]   you have like communities of people obsessed with
[01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:22.200]   productivity and they keep researching productivity hacks.
[01:32:22.200 --> 01:32:25.120]   And then they spend like 90% plus of their time
[01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:27.040]   figuring out how to do things productively
[01:32:27.040 --> 01:32:29.400]   and then never actually do anything.
[01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:30.940]   So there's a certain sense,
[01:32:30.940 --> 01:32:33.960]   if you focus on the task that needs to be done,
[01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:35.720]   that's what programming is for.
[01:32:35.720 --> 01:32:40.560]   So not over-optimizing, not thinking about variable names
[01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:43.320]   in the following sense.
[01:32:43.320 --> 01:32:45.360]   Sometimes you think, okay, I'm gonna write code
[01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:47.360]   that's gonna last for decades.
[01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:49.520]   In reality, your code,
[01:32:49.520 --> 01:32:51.120]   if it's well-written or poorly written,
[01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:54.520]   will be very likely obsolete very quickly.
[01:32:54.520 --> 01:32:57.560]   And the point is to get the job done really well.
[01:32:57.560 --> 01:33:00.320]   So there's a trade-off there that you have to,
[01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:02.160]   you have to make sure to strike.
[01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:05.820]   I should also comment as a public service announcement
[01:33:05.820 --> 01:33:09.400]   or a request, if there's any world-class
[01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:11.920]   Fortran or Cobalt programmers out there,
[01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:14.700]   I'm looking for them, I wanna talk to you.
[01:33:14.700 --> 01:33:16.200]   'Cause I think that- - That will not be me.
[01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:18.320]   I'm a terrible Fortran programmer.
[01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:20.680]   - But it's fascinating 'cause so much of the world
[01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:24.160]   in the past and still runs these programming languages
[01:33:24.160 --> 01:33:26.320]   and there's like no experts on it, so.
[01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:28.040]   - They're all retiring. - Yeah.
[01:33:28.040 --> 01:33:30.760]   I disagree slightly in that I think
[01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:33.520]   because I can get the job done, I'm a programmer.
[01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:35.480]   But because no one else can look at my code
[01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:38.560]   and know how I got my job done, I'm a bad programmer.
[01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:40.240]   That's how I'm defining it.
[01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:41.080]   - Including yourself six months later.
[01:33:41.080 --> 01:33:42.520]   - Including myself six months later.
[01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:44.200]   I'm working with a new student right now
[01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:46.920]   and she sent me some messages on Slack being like,
[01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:50.920]   what is this file that you've got
[01:33:50.920 --> 01:33:53.280]   with some functions around?
[01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:57.160]   And I was like, this was from 2018.
[01:33:57.160 --> 01:33:58.240]   It wasn't that long ago.
[01:33:58.240 --> 01:34:00.440]   And I can no longer remember what that code does.
[01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:04.280]   I'm gonna spend now two days reading through my own code
[01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:06.160]   and trying to improve it.
[01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:08.440]   And I do think that's frustrating.
[01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:11.320]   And so I think my advice to any young people
[01:34:11.320 --> 01:34:15.720]   who want to get into astronomy or astrobiology
[01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:20.320]   or quantum chemistry is that I certainly find it much easier
[01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:23.680]   to teach the science concepts to a programmer
[01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:25.720]   than the programming to a scientist.
[01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:29.760]   And so I would much, much faster hire someone
[01:34:29.760 --> 01:34:34.760]   who knows programming but barely knows where space is
[01:34:34.760 --> 01:34:37.880]   than teach programming to an astronomer.
[01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:38.960]   - Oh, that's fascinating.
[01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:40.320]   Yeah, okay, this is true.
[01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:42.400]   I mean, yeah, there's some basics.
[01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:45.240]   I'm focusing too much on the silver lining
[01:34:45.240 --> 01:34:47.800]   'cause the people that write like MATLAB code,
[01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:52.320]   yeah, single letter variable names, those kinds of things.
[01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:53.760]   - And it's accessibility, right?
[01:34:54.560 --> 01:34:57.960]   I want my code to be open source, and it is.
[01:34:57.960 --> 01:34:59.280]   It's on GitHub, anyone can download it.
[01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:00.760]   But is it really open source
[01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:03.560]   if it's written so cryptically, so poorly
[01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:06.120]   that no one can really use it to its full functionality?
[01:35:06.120 --> 01:35:09.360]   Have I really published my work?
[01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:11.600]   And that weighs on me.
[01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:15.260]   I feel guilty for my own inadequacies as a programmer.
[01:35:15.260 --> 01:35:18.080]   But you can only do so much.
[01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:20.880]   I've already learned quantum chemistry and astrophysics.
[01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:26.880]   - Yeah, I mean, there's all kinds of ways
[01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:27.840]   to contribute to the world.
[01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:29.640]   One of them is publication.
[01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:32.320]   But publishing code is a fascinating way
[01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:35.020]   to contribute to the world, even if it's very small,
[01:35:35.020 --> 01:35:38.960]   very basic element, great code.
[01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:41.240]   I guess I was also kind of criticizing
[01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:43.240]   the software engineering process,
[01:35:43.240 --> 01:35:46.240]   versus like, which is a good thing to do.
[01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:48.360]   It's code that's readable,
[01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:51.320]   almost like without documentation, it's readable.
[01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:52.720]   It's understandable.
[01:35:52.720 --> 01:35:54.480]   The variable names, the structure,
[01:35:54.480 --> 01:35:55.720]   all those kinds of things.
[01:35:55.720 --> 01:35:56.800]   - That's the dream.
[01:35:56.800 --> 01:35:57.760]   - That's the dream.
[01:35:57.760 --> 01:35:59.960]   This is a dumb question.
[01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:01.880]   What do you, all right.
[01:36:01.880 --> 01:36:04.720]   - No, no, tell me your dumb question, I wanna hear it.
[01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:06.120]   - Okay.
[01:36:06.120 --> 01:36:08.080]   I mean, okay, this is the question about beauty.
[01:36:08.080 --> 01:36:09.880]   It's way too general, it's very impossible.
[01:36:09.880 --> 01:36:12.120]   It's like asking what's your favorite band?
[01:36:12.120 --> 01:36:13.760]   What's your favorite music band?
[01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:15.080]   - Oh, I thought you meant Wavelength Band.
[01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:16.920]   I was like, I definitely have favorite Wavelength Bands.
[01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:18.200]   Absolutely.
[01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:20.120]   - Well, it's hard to narrow it down, huh?
[01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:25.160]   Okay, what to you is the most beautiful idea in science?
[01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:27.960]   - It's not a dumb question.
[01:36:27.960 --> 01:36:29.640]   Do you wanna try that question again, proudly?
[01:36:29.640 --> 01:36:30.480]   - Okay.
[01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:35.720]   I have a really good question to ask you.
[01:36:35.720 --> 01:36:37.240]   - Okay, don't oversell it.
[01:36:37.240 --> 01:36:38.320]   (both laughing)
[01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:41.320]   I've got an okay question to ask you, you know?
[01:36:41.320 --> 01:36:42.160]   - Yeah.
[01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:48.360]   What to you is the most beautiful idea in science?
[01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:51.400]   Something you just find inspiring or just,
[01:36:51.400 --> 01:36:53.960]   maybe the reason you got into science
[01:36:53.960 --> 01:36:57.360]   or the reason you think science is cool.
[01:36:57.360 --> 01:37:02.880]   - My favorite thing about science is
[01:37:02.880 --> 01:37:05.320]   kind of the connection between the scales.
[01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:08.760]   So when I was little and I wanted to know about space,
[01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:12.840]   I really felt that it would make me feel powerful
[01:37:12.840 --> 01:37:14.800]   to be able to predict the heavens,
[01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:17.680]   something so much larger than myself
[01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:19.520]   that felt really powerful.
[01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:22.080]   It was almost a selfish desire.
[01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:23.520]   And that's what I wanted.
[01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:26.760]   There was some control to being able to know exactly
[01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:28.640]   what the sky would do.
[01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:32.440]   And then as I got older and I got more into astronomy
[01:37:32.440 --> 01:37:34.920]   and I didn't just wanna know how the stars moved,
[01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:37.960]   I wanted to know how the planets around them moved.
[01:37:37.960 --> 01:37:39.800]   And then as I got deeper into that field,
[01:37:39.800 --> 01:37:41.920]   I really didn't care that much about the planets.
[01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:43.840]   I wanted to know about the atmospheres around the planets
[01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:46.200]   and then the molecules within those atmospheres
[01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:48.400]   and what that might mean.
[01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:51.280]   So I ended up shrinking my scale
[01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:53.680]   until it was literally the quantum scale.
[01:37:53.680 --> 01:37:56.200]   And now all my work, the majority of my work
[01:37:56.200 --> 01:37:59.680]   is on this insane quantum scale.
[01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:04.680]   And yet I'm using these literal tiny, tiny tools
[01:38:04.680 --> 01:38:10.080]   to try and answer the greatest questions
[01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:12.880]   that we've ever been able to ask.
[01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:15.680]   And this crossing of scales from the quantum
[01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:20.680]   to the astronomical, that's so cool, isn't it?
[01:38:20.680 --> 01:38:24.520]   - Yeah, it spans the entirety, the tiny and the huge.
[01:38:24.520 --> 01:38:26.360]   That's the cool thing about, I guess,
[01:38:26.360 --> 01:38:29.080]   being a quantum astrochemist.
[01:38:29.080 --> 01:38:30.120]   - Yeah. - Is you're using
[01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:34.200]   the tools of the tiny to look at the heavenly bodies,
[01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:35.320]   the giant stuff.
[01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:37.960]   - And the potential life out there,
[01:38:37.960 --> 01:38:40.560]   that this is the thing that connects us,
[01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:43.120]   that you can't escape the rules of the quantum world
[01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:44.800]   and how universal they themselves are
[01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:47.600]   despite being probabilistic.
[01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:52.600]   And that makes me feel really pleased to be in science,
[01:38:52.600 --> 01:38:56.000]   but in a really humbling way.
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.440]   It's no longer this thirst for power.
[01:38:58.440 --> 01:39:03.800]   I feel less special the more work I do,
[01:39:03.800 --> 01:39:05.640]   less exceptional the more work I do.
[01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:07.840]   I feel like humans and the earth
[01:39:07.840 --> 01:39:11.040]   and our place in the universe is less and less exceptional.
[01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:14.720]   And yet I feel so much less lonely.
[01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:16.560]   And so it's been a really good trade-off
[01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:19.100]   that I've lost power, but I've gained company.
[01:39:19.100 --> 01:39:21.600]   - Wow, that's a beautiful answer.
[01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:23.560]   I don't think there's a better way to actually end it.
[01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:25.920]   You're right, I asked a mediocre question
[01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:29.560]   and you came through, you made the question good
[01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:30.400]   by a brilliant answer. - That's what I wanted
[01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:31.240]   to make it do.
[01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:36.360]   - You're the Michael Jordan and I'm the,
[01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:39.040]   who's the Dennis, I'll be the Dennis Rodman.
[01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:40.160]   This is a-- - I don't know enough
[01:39:40.160 --> 01:39:41.000]   about basketball.
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:42.760]   I mean, literally you've reached the peak
[01:39:42.760 --> 01:39:43.840]   of my basketball knowledge
[01:39:43.840 --> 01:39:45.840]   because I know that those people are basketball--
[01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:46.920]   - But that's it.
[01:39:46.920 --> 01:39:49.320]   - Pros, I believe, but only 'cause I watched Space Jam,
[01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:50.160]   I think.
[01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:54.240]   - Are there books or movies in your life long ago
[01:39:54.240 --> 01:39:57.200]   or recently, do you have any time for books and movies?
[01:39:57.200 --> 01:39:58.840]   Had an impact on you?
[01:39:58.840 --> 01:40:01.240]   What ideas did you take away?
[01:40:01.240 --> 01:40:04.240]   - I absolutely have time for books and movies.
[01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:08.960]   I try as best I can to not work very hard.
[01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:11.280]   I mostly fail, I should point out,
[01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:13.880]   but I think I'm a better scientist
[01:40:13.880 --> 01:40:16.760]   when I don't work evenings and weekends.
[01:40:16.760 --> 01:40:21.160]   If I get four good hours in a day, I often don't.
[01:40:21.160 --> 01:40:23.520]   I often get eight crappy hours,
[01:40:23.520 --> 01:40:28.000]   emails, meetings, bad code, data processing,
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:31.240]   but if I can get four high quality scientific hours,
[01:40:31.240 --> 01:40:33.400]   I just stop working for the day
[01:40:33.400 --> 01:40:35.800]   because I know it's diminishing returns after that.
[01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:37.440]   So I have a lot of time.
[01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:40.160]   I try to make as much time as I can.
[01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:45.040]   - Can you kind of dig into what it takes
[01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:50.040]   to be, one, productive, two, to be happy as a researcher?
[01:40:50.040 --> 01:40:55.680]   Because I think it's too easy in that world to basic,
[01:40:55.680 --> 01:40:58.520]   'cause you have so many hats you have to wear,
[01:40:58.520 --> 01:41:02.480]   there's so many jobs, you have to be a mentor, a teacher,
[01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:06.200]   a head of a research group, do research yourself,
[01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:08.280]   you have to do service, all the kinds of stuff
[01:41:08.280 --> 01:41:10.240]   you're doing now with education.
[01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:13.220]   - Interviews.
[01:41:13.220 --> 01:41:20.160]   - So as a public science, being a public communicator,
[01:41:20.160 --> 01:41:23.120]   that's a job, the whole thing.
[01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:24.040]   - Pays very poorly.
[01:41:24.040 --> 01:41:29.240]   - I'll pay you in Bitcoin, okay?
[01:41:29.240 --> 01:41:30.240]   - I'll take Bitcoin.
[01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:37.360]   - So is there some advice you can give
[01:41:37.360 --> 01:41:41.200]   to the process of being productive and happy
[01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:42.920]   as a researcher?
[01:41:42.920 --> 01:41:45.840]   - I think sadly it's very hard to feel happy as a scientist
[01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:47.400]   if you're not productive.
[01:41:47.400 --> 01:41:51.880]   It's a bit of a trap, but I certainly find it very difficult
[01:41:51.880 --> 01:41:54.720]   to feel happy when I'm not being productive.
[01:41:54.720 --> 01:41:57.560]   It's become slightly better if I know my students
[01:41:57.560 --> 01:42:00.440]   are being productive, I can be happy.
[01:42:00.440 --> 01:42:03.120]   But I think a lot of senior scientists,
[01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:05.040]   once they get into that mindset,
[01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:07.920]   they start thinking that their student science is theirs.
[01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:10.760]   And I think this happens a lot of senior scientists.
[01:42:10.760 --> 01:42:13.280]   They have so many hats, as you mentioned,
[01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:15.920]   they have to do so much service and so much admin
[01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:18.800]   that they have very little time for their own science.
[01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:22.160]   And so they end up feeling ownership over the junior people
[01:42:22.160 --> 01:42:24.240]   in their labs and their groups,
[01:42:24.240 --> 01:42:27.320]   and that's really heartbreaking, I see it all the time.
[01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:32.000]   And that, I think I've escaped that trap.
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:35.520]   I feel so happy even when I'm not productive,
[01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:37.440]   when my students are productive.
[01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:40.800]   I think that sensation I was describing earlier,
[01:42:40.800 --> 01:42:44.880]   they only need to be half as productive as me
[01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:49.400]   for me to feel like I've done my job for humanity.
[01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:55.160]   So that has been the dynamic I've had to worry about.
[01:42:55.160 --> 01:42:57.400]   But to be productive is not clear to me
[01:42:57.400 --> 01:42:58.360]   what you have to do.
[01:42:58.360 --> 01:43:00.160]   You have to not be miserable otherwise.
[01:43:00.160 --> 01:43:02.960]   I find it extremely hard when I'm having conflicts
[01:43:02.960 --> 01:43:06.240]   with collaborators, for example,
[01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:08.280]   kind of very hard to enjoy the work we do,
[01:43:08.280 --> 01:43:12.080]   even if the work is this fantastical phosphine
[01:43:12.080 --> 01:43:15.960]   or things that I know I love, still very difficult.
[01:43:15.960 --> 01:43:18.760]   So I think choosing your collaborators
[01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:21.400]   based on how well you get along with them
[01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:25.840]   is a really sound scientific choice.
[01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:29.440]   Having a miserable collaborator ruins your whole life.
[01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:30.480]   It's horrible.
[01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:32.280]   It makes you not want to do the science.
[01:43:32.280 --> 01:43:34.480]   It probably makes you do clumsy science
[01:43:34.480 --> 01:43:35.640]   'cause you don't focus on it.
[01:43:35.640 --> 01:43:37.400]   You don't go over it several times.
[01:43:37.400 --> 01:43:39.440]   You just want it to be over.
[01:43:39.440 --> 01:43:42.440]   And so I think in general,
[01:43:42.440 --> 01:43:45.120]   just not being a douchebag
[01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:47.680]   can get so much good science done.
[01:43:47.680 --> 01:43:50.200]   Just find the good people in your community
[01:43:50.200 --> 01:43:51.320]   and collaborate with them.
[01:43:51.320 --> 01:43:53.480]   Even if they're not as good scientists as others,
[01:43:53.480 --> 01:43:55.640]   you'll get better science out.
[01:43:55.640 --> 01:43:57.120]   Yeah, don't be a douchebag yourself
[01:43:57.120 --> 01:43:59.160]   and surround yourself by other cool people.
[01:43:59.160 --> 01:44:00.000]   Exactly.
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.360]   And then you'll get better science
[01:44:02.360 --> 01:44:04.800]   than if you had tried to work with three geniuses
[01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:07.540]   who are just hell to be around.
[01:44:07.540 --> 01:44:12.160]   Yeah, I mean, there's parallel things like that.
[01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:13.520]   I'm very fortunate now.
[01:44:13.520 --> 01:44:16.240]   I was very fortunate at MIT
[01:44:16.240 --> 01:44:18.280]   to have friends and colleagues there
[01:44:18.280 --> 01:44:20.200]   that were incredible to work with.
[01:44:20.200 --> 01:44:22.120]   But I'm currently sort of,
[01:44:22.120 --> 01:44:25.680]   I'm doing a lot of fun stuff on the side,
[01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:30.120]   like this little podcast thing.
[01:44:30.120 --> 01:44:34.400]   And I mentioned to you, I think, robotics-related stuff.
[01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:38.120]   I was just at Boston Dynamics yesterday,
[01:44:38.120 --> 01:44:39.740]   checking out their robots.
[01:44:39.740 --> 01:44:44.160]   And I'm currently, I guess, hiring people
[01:44:44.160 --> 01:44:46.400]   to help me with a very fun little project
[01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:47.240]   around those robots.
[01:44:47.240 --> 01:44:48.440]   You wanna put an ad in?
[01:44:48.440 --> 01:44:52.160]   No, I have more applications I can possibly deal with.
[01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:53.680]   There's thousands.
[01:44:53.680 --> 01:44:57.560]   So, it's not an ad, it's the opposite.
[01:44:57.560 --> 01:44:58.400]   It's like-
[01:44:58.400 --> 01:44:59.400]   You need to put an ad out for someone
[01:44:59.400 --> 01:45:00.800]   to help you go through the applications?
[01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:02.800]   Well, that too is already there.
[01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:04.880]   That's over 10,000 people applied for that.
[01:45:04.880 --> 01:45:09.480]   An infinite Master Yoshikun doll of application management.
[01:45:09.480 --> 01:45:12.720]   But the point is, it's not exactly,
[01:45:12.720 --> 01:45:16.880]   the point is, what I'm very distinctly aware of
[01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:21.880]   is life is short and productivity is not a good thing.
[01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:26.360]   It is not the right goal to optimize for, at least for me.
[01:45:26.360 --> 01:45:29.320]   The right goal to optimize for is how happy you are
[01:45:29.320 --> 01:45:33.000]   to wake up in the day and to work with the people
[01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:34.960]   that you do, because the productivity
[01:45:34.960 --> 01:45:36.200]   will take care of itself.
[01:45:36.200 --> 01:45:37.200]   Agreed.
[01:45:37.200 --> 01:45:42.040]   And so, it's so important to select the people well.
[01:45:42.040 --> 01:45:44.840]   And I think one of the challenges with academia,
[01:45:44.840 --> 01:45:46.960]   as opposed to the thing I'm currently doing,
[01:45:46.960 --> 01:45:51.580]   is saying goodbye is sometimes a little bit tougher,
[01:45:51.580 --> 01:45:52.420]   because-
[01:45:52.420 --> 01:45:53.240]   Really tough.
[01:45:53.240 --> 01:45:55.320]   Your colleagues are there.
[01:45:55.320 --> 01:45:59.560]   I mean, goodbye hurts, and then if you have to spend
[01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:01.480]   the rest, for many years to come,
[01:46:01.480 --> 01:46:04.440]   still surrounded by them in the community, it's tougher.
[01:46:04.440 --> 01:46:07.840]   It kind of adds, puts extra pressure to stay
[01:46:07.840 --> 01:46:12.840]   in that relationship, in that collaboration.
[01:46:12.840 --> 01:46:16.160]   And in some sense, that makes it much more difficult,
[01:46:16.160 --> 01:46:17.000]   but it's still worth it.
[01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.480]   It's still worth it to break ties
[01:46:19.480 --> 01:46:24.480]   if you're not happy, if there's not that magic, that dance.
[01:46:24.480 --> 01:46:30.920]   I talked to this guy named Daniel Kahneman.
[01:46:30.920 --> 01:46:32.720]   Oh, I know, Danny Kahneman.
[01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:34.360]   Danny, yeah.
[01:46:34.360 --> 01:46:37.480]   Boy, did that guy make me realize
[01:46:37.480 --> 01:46:39.980]   what a great collaborator is.
[01:46:39.980 --> 01:46:41.640]   Well, he had Tversky, right?
[01:46:41.640 --> 01:46:44.160]   Yeah, but so they had, obviously,
[01:46:44.160 --> 01:46:45.920]   they had a really deep collaboration there,
[01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:50.880]   but I collaborated with him on a conversation,
[01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:53.740]   just talking about, I don't know what we were talking about.
[01:46:53.740 --> 01:46:55.680]   I think cars, autonomous vehicles.
[01:46:55.680 --> 01:46:59.480]   But the brainstorming session, I'm like a nobody,
[01:46:59.480 --> 01:47:02.120]   and the fact that he would, with that childlike curiosity,
[01:47:02.120 --> 01:47:04.400]   and that dance of thoughts and ideas,
[01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:08.440]   and the push and pull, and the lack of ego,
[01:47:08.440 --> 01:47:10.840]   but then enough ego to have a little bit of a stubbornness
[01:47:10.840 --> 01:47:12.920]   over an idea, and a little bit of humor,
[01:47:12.920 --> 01:47:15.440]   and all those things, it's like, holy shit,
[01:47:15.440 --> 01:47:18.440]   that person, also the ability to truly listen
[01:47:18.440 --> 01:47:21.040]   to another human, it's like, okay,
[01:47:21.040 --> 01:47:23.440]   that's what it takes to be a good collaborator.
[01:47:23.440 --> 01:47:26.260]   It made me realize that I haven't been,
[01:47:26.260 --> 01:47:28.440]   I've been very fortunate to have cool people in my life,
[01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:31.600]   but there's levels even to the cool.
[01:47:31.600 --> 01:47:32.820]   Yeah, I don't think you can compete
[01:47:32.820 --> 01:47:34.200]   with Danny Kahneman on cool.
[01:47:34.200 --> 01:47:36.300]   He's just incredible.
[01:47:36.300 --> 01:47:39.720]   But it was like, okay, I guess what I'm trying to say
[01:47:39.720 --> 01:47:42.320]   is that collaboration is an art form,
[01:47:42.320 --> 01:47:43.780]   but perhaps it's actually a skill,
[01:47:43.780 --> 01:47:47.480]   is allowing yourself to develop that skill,
[01:47:47.480 --> 01:47:49.840]   'cause that's one of the fruitful skills.
[01:47:49.840 --> 01:47:52.200]   And praise it in students, you know,
[01:47:52.200 --> 01:47:56.760]   and I think it is something you can really improve on.
[01:47:56.760 --> 01:47:59.720]   I've become a better collaborator as the years have gone on.
[01:47:59.720 --> 01:48:03.280]   I don't have some innate collaborative skills.
[01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:05.120]   I think they're skills I've developed.
[01:48:05.120 --> 01:48:06.920]   And I think in science, there's this
[01:48:06.920 --> 01:48:11.960]   really destructive notion of the lone wolf,
[01:48:11.960 --> 01:48:14.620]   the scientist who sees things where others don't,
[01:48:14.620 --> 01:48:16.500]   you know, then that's really appealing,
[01:48:16.500 --> 01:48:18.740]   and people really like either fulfilling that
[01:48:18.740 --> 01:48:21.060]   or pretending to be fulfilling that.
[01:48:21.060 --> 01:48:24.220]   And first of all, it's mostly a lie.
[01:48:24.220 --> 01:48:27.420]   Any modern scientist, particularly in astronomy,
[01:48:27.420 --> 01:48:29.100]   which is so interdisciplinary,
[01:48:29.100 --> 01:48:31.940]   any modern scientist that's doing it on their own
[01:48:31.940 --> 01:48:34.860]   is doing a crappy job, most likely,
[01:48:34.860 --> 01:48:37.380]   because you need an independent set of eyes
[01:48:37.380 --> 01:48:38.980]   to help you do things.
[01:48:38.980 --> 01:48:41.460]   You need experts in the sub-fields that you're working on
[01:48:41.460 --> 01:48:42.880]   to check your work.
[01:48:42.880 --> 01:48:46.840]   But most importantly, it's just a bad idea.
[01:48:46.840 --> 01:48:47.860]   It's not,
[01:48:47.860 --> 01:48:51.800]   it doesn't lead to good science,
[01:48:51.800 --> 01:48:54.160]   and it leaves you miserable.
[01:48:54.160 --> 01:48:57.440]   I was, recently I had some work that I was avoiding,
[01:48:57.440 --> 01:48:58.280]   and I thought,
[01:48:58.280 --> 01:49:00.080]   maybe I shouldn't pursue this scientific project
[01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:02.800]   because I don't care enough about the outcome,
[01:49:02.800 --> 01:49:04.360]   and it's going to be a lot of hard work.
[01:49:04.360 --> 01:49:06.320]   And I was trying to balance these two things.
[01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:07.640]   It can be really difficult,
[01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:09.780]   and the outcome is that maybe 10 people will cite me
[01:49:09.780 --> 01:49:12.320]   in the next decade because it's not,
[01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:14.720]   no one's asking for this question to be answered.
[01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:18.280]   And then I found myself working
[01:49:18.280 --> 01:49:20.760]   with this collaborator, Jason Dittman,
[01:49:20.760 --> 01:49:23.000]   and I spent a whole afternoon, hours,
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.720]   with him working on this, and time flew by,
[01:49:25.720 --> 01:49:32.040]   and I just felt taller, and I could breathe better.
[01:49:32.040 --> 01:49:35.040]   I was happier, I was a better person when it was done,
[01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:38.680]   and that's because he's a great collaborator.
[01:49:38.680 --> 01:49:42.180]   He's just a wonderful person that brings out joy
[01:49:42.180 --> 01:49:44.280]   out of science that you're doing with him.
[01:49:44.280 --> 01:49:46.840]   And that's really the trick.
[01:49:46.840 --> 01:49:48.800]   You find the people that make you feel that way
[01:49:48.800 --> 01:49:50.320]   about the science you're doing,
[01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:55.320]   and you stop worrying about being the lone wolf.
[01:49:55.320 --> 01:49:58.300]   That's just a terrible dream that will leave you miserable,
[01:49:58.300 --> 01:49:59.940]   and your science will be shit.
[01:49:59.940 --> 01:50:04.360]   - And since I'm Russian, just murder anybody
[01:50:04.360 --> 01:50:07.660]   who doesn't fall into that beautiful,
[01:50:07.660 --> 01:50:09.000]   collaborative relationship.
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:12.200]   We were talking about books.
[01:50:12.200 --> 01:50:13.360]   - Books, yes.
[01:50:13.360 --> 01:50:14.200]   - Is there books, movies?
[01:50:14.200 --> 01:50:16.440]   - Why was I talking about my productivity?
[01:50:16.440 --> 01:50:18.160]   Oh, you said you maybe don't have time
[01:50:18.160 --> 01:50:19.000]   for books and movies, yes.
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:22.680]   - And you said you must make time for books and movies.
[01:50:22.680 --> 01:50:24.520]   - Make time to not work.
[01:50:24.520 --> 01:50:27.960]   Make time to not work, whatever that looks like to you.
[01:50:27.960 --> 01:50:31.240]   But there's plenty.
[01:50:31.240 --> 01:50:34.240]   When I was younger, I found a lot of
[01:50:34.240 --> 01:50:36.880]   my scientific fulfillment in books and movies.
[01:50:36.880 --> 01:50:40.320]   Now, as I got older, I have plenty of that in my work,
[01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:43.720]   and I try to read outside my field.
[01:50:43.720 --> 01:50:45.920]   I read about Danny Kahneman's work instead.
[01:50:45.920 --> 01:50:50.500]   But when I was little, it was "Contact," the book,
[01:50:50.500 --> 01:50:52.120]   the Carl Sagan book.
[01:50:52.120 --> 01:50:56.980]   I really thought I was just like Ellie,
[01:50:56.980 --> 01:50:59.980]   and I was going to become Ellie.
[01:50:59.980 --> 01:51:02.720]   It really resonated with me, that character,
[01:51:02.720 --> 01:51:07.040]   and the notions of life and space and the universe,
[01:51:07.040 --> 01:51:11.840]   even the idea of, then the movie came out,
[01:51:11.840 --> 01:51:16.400]   and I got to put Jodie Foster in that, which helped.
[01:51:16.400 --> 01:51:21.240]   But even the notion of, if it is just us,
[01:51:21.240 --> 01:51:23.140]   what an awful waste of space,
[01:51:23.140 --> 01:51:26.280]   I find extremely useful as a concept to think.
[01:51:26.280 --> 01:51:29.520]   Maybe we are special, but that would suck,
[01:51:29.520 --> 01:51:32.720]   is a really nice way of thinking of the search for life,
[01:51:32.720 --> 01:51:36.940]   that it's much better to not be special and have company.
[01:51:36.940 --> 01:51:39.280]   I got that from Carl Sagan.
[01:51:39.280 --> 01:51:42.020]   So that's what I always recommend.
[01:51:42.020 --> 01:51:45.820]   - Let me ask one other ridiculous question.
[01:51:45.820 --> 01:51:50.800]   We talked about the death and life cycle
[01:51:50.800 --> 01:51:52.720]   that is ever-present in the universe
[01:51:52.720 --> 01:51:55.060]   until it's not, until it's supermassive,
[01:51:55.060 --> 01:51:58.640]   and little black holes, too, at the end of the universe.
[01:51:58.640 --> 01:52:03.240]   What do you think is the why, the meaning of it all?
[01:52:03.240 --> 01:52:07.600]   What do you think is the meaning of life here on Earth,
[01:52:07.600 --> 01:52:11.000]   and the meaning of that life that you look for,
[01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:14.320]   whether it's on Venus or other exoplanets?
[01:52:14.320 --> 01:52:16.040]   - I think there's none.
[01:52:16.040 --> 01:52:19.760]   I find enormous relief in the absence of meaning.
[01:52:19.760 --> 01:52:24.120]   I think chasing for meaning is a human desire
[01:52:24.120 --> 01:52:26.840]   the universe doesn't give two shits about.
[01:52:26.840 --> 01:52:29.040]   (Lex laughing)
[01:52:29.040 --> 01:52:31.240]   - But you still enjoy--
[01:52:31.240 --> 01:52:33.400]   - I enjoy finding meaning in my life.
[01:52:33.400 --> 01:52:38.400]   I enjoy finding where the morality lies.
[01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:43.480]   I enjoy the complication of that desire,
[01:52:43.480 --> 01:52:46.760]   and I feel that is deeply human,
[01:52:46.760 --> 01:52:49.680]   but I don't feel that it's universal.
[01:52:49.680 --> 01:52:52.560]   - It's somehow absolute, like we conjure it up.
[01:52:52.560 --> 01:52:56.400]   We bring it to life through our own minds,
[01:52:56.400 --> 01:52:59.400]   but it's not in any kind of fundamental way real.
[01:52:59.400 --> 01:53:04.240]   - No, and the same way the sun is not to be blamed
[01:53:04.240 --> 01:53:07.720]   for destroying its own planets.
[01:53:07.720 --> 01:53:12.560]   The universe doesn't care because it has no meaning.
[01:53:12.560 --> 01:53:16.080]   It owes us nothing, and looking for meaning in the universe
[01:53:16.080 --> 01:53:18.040]   is demanding answers.
[01:53:18.040 --> 01:53:18.960]   Who are we?
[01:53:18.960 --> 01:53:19.880]   We're nothing.
[01:53:19.880 --> 01:53:23.240]   We don't get to demand anything, and that includes meaning,
[01:53:23.240 --> 01:53:25.320]   and I find it very reassuring
[01:53:25.320 --> 01:53:29.200]   because once there is no meaning, I don't have to find it.
[01:53:29.200 --> 01:53:31.960]   (Lex laughing)
[01:53:31.960 --> 01:53:35.160]   - Yeah, once there's no meaning,
[01:53:35.160 --> 01:53:38.000]   it's a kind of freedom in a way.
[01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:39.360]   You sound a bit like--
[01:53:39.360 --> 01:53:42.120]   - I'm happy about it.
[01:53:42.120 --> 01:53:44.200]   This isn't a depressing outlook as far as I'm concerned.
[01:53:44.200 --> 01:53:45.560]   - It's happiness, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:53:45.560 --> 01:53:47.800]   So I mean, there's a, I don't know if you know
[01:53:47.800 --> 01:53:52.520]   who Sam Harris is, but he, despite the pushbacks
[01:53:52.520 --> 01:53:55.560]   from the entirety of the world, really argues hard
[01:53:55.560 --> 01:53:58.560]   that free will is an illusion,
[01:53:58.560 --> 01:54:02.440]   that the deterministic universe,
[01:54:02.440 --> 01:54:04.320]   and it's all already been predetermined,
[01:54:04.320 --> 01:54:08.080]   and he's okay with it, and he's happy with it,
[01:54:08.080 --> 01:54:12.120]   that he's distinctly aware of it, and that's okay.
[01:54:12.120 --> 01:54:13.560]   - The quantum world will disagree with him
[01:54:13.560 --> 01:54:17.040]   on the deterministic nature of nature.
[01:54:17.040 --> 01:54:20.560]   - Well, he's not saying it's deterministic,
[01:54:20.560 --> 01:54:23.400]   but he's saying that the randomness doesn't help either.
[01:54:23.400 --> 01:54:28.400]   Like, randomness does not help in the experience
[01:54:28.400 --> 01:54:32.780]   of feeling like you're the decider of your own actions,
[01:54:32.780 --> 01:54:36.560]   that he kind of is okay with being a leaf flowing
[01:54:36.560 --> 01:54:40.520]   on the river, or being the river, right,
[01:54:40.520 --> 01:54:43.040]   as opposed to having, or being like a fish or something
[01:54:43.040 --> 01:54:45.840]   that can decide a swimming direction.
[01:54:45.840 --> 01:54:48.600]   He's okay just embracing the flow of life.
[01:54:48.600 --> 01:54:51.160]   I mean, in that same way, it kind of sounds
[01:54:51.160 --> 01:54:54.380]   like your conception of meaning.
[01:54:54.380 --> 01:54:55.920]   I mean, it just is.
[01:54:55.920 --> 01:54:58.840]   It doesn't, the universe doesn't care.
[01:54:58.840 --> 01:55:01.960]   It just is what it is, and we experience certain things,
[01:55:01.960 --> 01:55:05.880]   and some feel good, and some don't, and that's life.
[01:55:05.880 --> 01:55:10.060]   - But I don't feel like that about life.
[01:55:10.060 --> 01:55:12.760]   I think life does have meaning, and there's,
[01:55:12.760 --> 01:55:16.160]   and it's laudable to look for that meaning in life.
[01:55:16.160 --> 01:55:20.080]   I just don't think you can apply that beyond life,
[01:55:20.080 --> 01:55:21.920]   and certainly not beyond Earth,
[01:55:21.920 --> 01:55:25.440]   that this notion of meaning is a human construct,
[01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:29.200]   and so it only applies within us,
[01:55:29.200 --> 01:55:34.200]   and the other life forms and planet types
[01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:36.900]   that suffer from our intrusions,
[01:55:36.900 --> 01:55:40.420]   or rejoice from our interactions.
[01:55:40.420 --> 01:55:44.700]   But it's this, this meaning is ours to do as we please.
[01:55:44.700 --> 01:55:47.320]   We've created it, we've created a need for it,
[01:55:47.320 --> 01:55:49.480]   and so that's our problem to solve.
[01:55:49.480 --> 01:55:51.160]   I don't apply it beyond us.
[01:55:51.160 --> 01:55:53.480]   I think we as humans have a lot of responsibilities,
[01:55:53.480 --> 01:55:55.480]   but they're moral responsibilities,
[01:55:55.480 --> 01:55:56.880]   and a lot of the responsibilities
[01:55:56.880 --> 01:56:00.720]   are much more easily fulfilled if you find meaning in them.
[01:56:00.720 --> 01:56:02.600]   So I think there's value to meaning,
[01:56:02.600 --> 01:56:04.640]   whether it's real or not.
[01:56:04.640 --> 01:56:07.260]   I just think we gain nothing from trying
[01:56:07.260 --> 01:56:10.840]   to anthropomorphize the entire universe,
[01:56:10.840 --> 01:56:13.600]   and also, that's the height of hubris.
[01:56:13.600 --> 01:56:15.340]   That's not for us to do.
[01:56:15.340 --> 01:56:17.240]   - Yeah, it also could be,
[01:56:17.240 --> 01:56:19.520]   just like duality in quantum mechanics,
[01:56:19.520 --> 01:56:23.720]   it could be both that there is meaning,
[01:56:23.720 --> 01:56:25.480]   and then there isn't.
[01:56:25.480 --> 01:56:29.260]   And we're somehow depending on the observer,
[01:56:29.260 --> 01:56:33.280]   depending on the perspective you take on the thing.
[01:56:33.280 --> 01:56:35.480]   - I mean, even on Earth, that's true.
[01:56:35.480 --> 01:56:38.040]   Whether things have meaning or not
[01:56:38.040 --> 01:56:39.660]   depends a lot on who's looking.
[01:56:39.660 --> 01:56:43.440]   - Whether it's us humans, the aliens,
[01:56:43.440 --> 01:56:44.540]   or the giraffes.
[01:56:44.540 --> 01:56:48.800]   Clara, this was an incredible conversation.
[01:56:48.800 --> 01:56:51.760]   I mean, I learned so much,
[01:56:51.760 --> 01:56:55.280]   but I also am just inspired by the passion you have.
[01:56:55.280 --> 01:56:58.640]   - In not finding meaning in the universe.
[01:56:58.640 --> 01:56:59.480]   - Yeah, right.
[01:56:59.480 --> 01:57:00.320]   For someone who finds meaning in the universe.
[01:57:00.320 --> 01:57:01.560]   - I'm very passionate about
[01:57:01.560 --> 01:57:04.040]   not finding meaning in the universe.
[01:57:04.040 --> 01:57:06.600]   - You're the most inspiring nihilist I've ever met.
[01:57:06.600 --> 01:57:07.440]   I'm just kidding.
[01:57:07.440 --> 01:57:13.040]   I mean, you are truly an inspiring communicator
[01:57:13.040 --> 01:57:15.760]   of everything from phosphine to life
[01:57:15.760 --> 01:57:19.040]   to quantum astrochemistry.
[01:57:19.040 --> 01:57:21.880]   I can't wait to see what other cool things you do
[01:57:21.880 --> 01:57:24.880]   in your career, in your scientific life.
[01:57:24.880 --> 01:57:27.480]   Thank you so much for wasting your valuable time
[01:57:27.480 --> 01:57:28.320]   with me today.
[01:57:28.320 --> 01:57:30.120]   I really appreciate it.
[01:57:30.120 --> 01:57:30.960]   - It was my pleasure.
[01:57:30.960 --> 01:57:32.920]   I'd already got my four hours of productivity
[01:57:32.920 --> 01:57:35.160]   before I got here, and so it's not a waste.
[01:57:35.160 --> 01:57:37.200]   - It's all downhill from there.
[01:57:37.200 --> 01:57:38.500]   Thank you.
[01:57:38.500 --> 01:57:39.880]   Thanks for listening to this conversation
[01:57:39.880 --> 01:57:41.200]   with Clara Sousa Silva,
[01:57:41.200 --> 01:57:46.200]   and thank you to Anit, Grammarly, Blinkist, and Indeed.
[01:57:46.200 --> 01:57:50.340]   Check them out in the description to support this podcast.
[01:57:50.340 --> 01:57:51.800]   And now let me leave you with some words
[01:57:51.800 --> 01:57:54.000]   from Konstantin Tsiolkovsky.
[01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.680]   "The earth is the cradle of humanity,
[01:57:56.680 --> 01:58:00.200]   but mankind cannot stay in the cradle forever."
[01:58:00.200 --> 01:58:02.960]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
[01:58:02.960 --> 01:58:05.540]   (upbeat music)
[01:58:05.540 --> 01:58:08.120]   (upbeat music)
[01:58:08.120 --> 01:58:18.120]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
