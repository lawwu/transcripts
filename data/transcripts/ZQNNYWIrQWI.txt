[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880]   Moving on here, we have a question from Orpheus.
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:10.600]   Appreciate the Greek mythology reference there.
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.560]   How can you increase the intensity of your deep work
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.760]   sessions if you're already focused
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.800]   and free of distractions?
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.440]   Orpheus goes on to say, I'm a music composer.
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.280]   Can I say, by the way, as an aside, I love--
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.400]   maybe this is why you chose the name,
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.360]   but obviously the character of Orpheus in Greek mythology
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.240]   is-- has this beautiful singing voice
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.480]   and can write this beautiful music with which he
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.440]   woos Persephone.
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.760]   So I like the fact that the person describing himself
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.400]   as Orpheus is a music composer.
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.760]   So well done, sir.
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.760]   So anyways, Orpheus says, I'm a music composer
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.400]   who finds it takes me far too long to write music.
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.240]   Following your book, Deep Work, I have time blocked,
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.000]   gotten away from distractions, set timers, and am focused.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.080]   Is there a way to continually increase intensity
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.580]   work produced in a certain time frame
[00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.440]   once all tenets of deep work are in place?
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.780]   Or should I just accept that this
[00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.880]   is a process that will always take a long time?
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.920]   So Orpheus, I have three things to tell you,
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.120]   three additional things I want you to introduce.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.000]   One is ritual.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.840]   Where you do the work, what you do before the work
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.160]   occurs, especially for highly creative endeavors
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.880]   that require spontaneous creative production
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.240]   like music writing, music composing.
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.640]   This type of stuff matters.
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.560]   And it's probably worth investing money in.
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.040]   Let me build out a space just for my composing,
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.480]   a special office I just go to, an outbuilding,
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.200]   or a really nice looking building.
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.800]   I remember at some point seeing the composing room
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.120]   that the movie composer, I believe it was James Horner,
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.620]   used.
[00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.200]   And it was this over-the-top decorated, really interesting
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.280]   room.
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.760]   It matters for this type of thing.
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.220]   What's your ritual before you write?
[00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.800]   What's the thing that turns you right?
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.560]   It's you walk through the forest,
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.680]   you have a certain type of herbamata tea
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.360]   just before you sit down.
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.280]   There's a certain type of music playing on a vintage record
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.280]   player through really high-end speakers.
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.480]   You want to lean on ritual for doing something
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.360]   that is as demanding as spontaneous creative
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.840]   production.
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.520]   Don't think about this as wasting money.
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.600]   Think about this as necessary investments
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.400]   to actually make creative work at this level,
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.520]   have a maximum chance of succeeding.
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.440]   That's my suggestion.
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.560]   My second is peers, by which I mean the people you spend time
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.000]   with.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.920]   Spend more time with people who do high-level creative work
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:39.960]   for their job.
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.280]   Just being around people, artists, and writers,
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.480]   other composers, other musicians that really take their work
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.120]   seriously and do it at a really high level, preferably
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.560]   at a level where you want to get.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.440]   It just affects the way that you approach it.
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.320]   You're more likely to be locked in and focused
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.600]   on the work that you're doing.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.400]   Your mind adjusts to the norms and habits of those around you.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.400]   And when the norms and habits of those around you
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.280]   is very much focused and valuing of creative production,
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.120]   your mind's going to be more on board when you sit down
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.520]   at that piano and say, let's go for it.
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.720]   So that could also help, too.
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.360]   So those are two things you might not have thought about.
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.040]   The third is acceptance.
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.360]   So after you've done those things and the other things,
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.480]   the time blocking, and the timers, and the training,
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.080]   then just accept.
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.560]   I'm doing creative work.
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.040]   I've set the conditions to be as good as possible.
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.720]   Where I end up at this point, this
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.040]   might just be what it feels like to do this creative work.
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.960]   We sometimes create storylines about how it should feel.
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.760]   We think it should be the scene from Amadeus, where Salieri
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.240]   has the entrance march, and Mozart comes in,
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.880]   and it's like, oh, I like that, and can I try it?
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.920]   And Salieri's like, do you want to see the music?
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.640]   And Mozart says, no, I think I got it.
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.640]   And he starts playing it from memory completely.
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.840]   He's like, yeah, that's just it, right?
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.480]   And then he stops for a second and says,
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.560]   wouldn't it be better if--
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.280]   and he makes some changes, and it
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.880]   becomes a beautiful, famous piece of Mozart music.
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.880]   And Salieri's cursing the gods, like, how can he
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.080]   just do this in his head?
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.000]   Sometimes we think this is what creative work should feel like.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   We have these storylines about we should sit at the piano,
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.720]   and beautiful music just comes out,
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.680]   and everyone's really impressed.
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.240]   And the Salieris in our life are really jealous.
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.000]   But that's often not what it's like.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.640]   Creative production is often painful.
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.560]   So much of it happens in revision.
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.960]   I talked about last week Brandon Sanderson
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.240]   and his process of writing super productively like he does.
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.320]   But one of things I picked up from the speech
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.520]   I watched of Brandon Sanderson talking about his writing
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.360]   process is how many revision processes
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.640]   go into actually getting one of his novels right.
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.680]   So that means there's a whole part of his production
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.760]   where he's writing, and it's painful,
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.560]   and it's not very good.
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.240]   But it's laying the foundation that's
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.440]   eventually on which he's going to build
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.560]   a book that he is proud of.
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.440]   So that's like my final point is acceptance.
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.320]   If you're doing the stuff you're already doing,
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.840]   and you add in the things I suggested
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.600]   you might be missing-- ritual, peer group, alterations--
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.760]   doing the whole thing.
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.280]   So now whatever it feels like, that's
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.240]   how it's supposed to feel.
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.760]   And don't tell yourself stories that it should feel different.
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.800]   That's probably what it's supposed to feel like.
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.560]   Keep producing, keep being deep.
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.140]   (upbeat music)
