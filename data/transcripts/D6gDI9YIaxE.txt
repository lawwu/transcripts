[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.020]   [ Silence ]
[00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:18.140]   >> Please give another very warm welcome to Jack Bogle.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:33.560]   [ Applause ]
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.860]   >> Thank you very much.
[00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.720]   That's probably quite enough applause.
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.640]   But I thank you.
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.820]   It's been wonderful to be with you.
[00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.060]   And I asked Mel to move me into the early spot this morning
[00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.220]   because I'm trying to be a good family man.
[00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.000]   Yes, there is a family out there.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.740]   And its prime member is my wife.
[00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.260]   And every year, we sign up for the Philadelphia Orchestra,
[00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.220]   Friday afternoon concerts, and we do about six.
[00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.320]   And one of them happens to be this afternoon.
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.020]   And I just -- you must understand that I did not want
[00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.060]   to say, "Eve, there's something more important than going
[00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.100]   on -- than going to the concert with you."
[00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.600]   It's being with the Bogleheads.
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.540]   And she would probably file papers for divorce.
[00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.540]   [ Laughter ]
[00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.060]   Immediately, if not giving me maybe a chance to redeem myself.
[00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.260]   So it's great to be with you here again.
[00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.040]   I've had a wonderful time with you.
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.200]   That book signing was so much fun because I had a chance
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.120]   to talk to many of you
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.320]   about whether you were having a good time or not.
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.360]   And for reasons that are beyond my contemplation,
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.340]   everybody seems to be having a good time here.
[00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.240]   I just can't imagine it.
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.120]   But I'm glad you are.
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.540]   And I'm glad you had a good time.
[00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.940]   Several people told me they had a good time.
[00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.380]   Over at Vanguard yesterday.
[00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.540]   And the management part.
[00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.940]   People who actually work for Vanguard.
[00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.520]   And so we're going to just do a little Q&A here.
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.680]   And take it away, Mel.
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.760]   >> The most asked question, a number of people asked this.
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.140]   So I'll put this up at the top.
[00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.160]   If you remember last year at the conference, you were asked
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.720]   about Vanguard Target Retirement Funds
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.220]   and the Life Strategy Funds.
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.620]   And why they are using Investor Class Shares instead
[00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:15.880]   of the Admiral Class Shares.
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.000]   You said you didn't know, but you look into it.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.100]   What was the outcome?
[00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.860]   >> Oh, they have decided to use the Admiral Shares.
[00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.880]   That's an answer I made up at the moment.
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.860]   Mike, do you know the answer to that?
[00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.320]   Is Mike here?
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.100]   Where are you, Mike?
[00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.440]   >> Why the Target Day Funds use Investor Class Shares?
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.660]   >> Yeah. Or do they?
[00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:39.560]   >> Yes, they do.
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.920]   We now have institutional price shares in addition
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.680]   to the original Target Day Funds for larger account balances.
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.820]   But as to why the decision was made to use the Admiral Shares.
[00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.040]   Basically, those are under an attempt
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.780]   to serve smaller account counts.
[00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.540]   The idea was if you're just starting out,
[00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.960]   you would use the Target Day Fund as your portfolio grows.
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.160]   It becomes more complicated.
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.760]   You probably, we would expect a lot of investors
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.740]   to diversify individual funds.
[00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.040]   >> Well, one of the things a lot of us have been pushing is
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.680]   that these are nicely diversified portfolio
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.320]   in a single fund that rebalances automatically.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.800]   And now we're not talking about necessarily small investors.
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.980]   I agree that people might start with it.
[00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.980]   But we're also pushing simplification in when you get
[00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.920]   into your retirement years, both for your heirs and your spouse.
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.520]   And the life strategy
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.940]   and the Target Retirement Funds are an ideal fund to hold that.
[00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.140]   So you could have people with $100,000.
[00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.000]   You could have people with a million dollars in there.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.380]   So it's nice when you have the two sets of shares.
[00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:53.800]   I understand you can't have it.
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.700]   But you do have it with the institutional class shares.
[00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.300]   So why aren't the institutional class shares offered
[00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.980]   to us regular folks?
[00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.380]   >> Yeah, so now what I'm hearing is there's an appetite for --
[00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:05.220]   >> Oh, definitely.
[00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.680]   >> -- a big fund with ample pricing.
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.280]   >> Exactly, exactly.
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.880]   And the same is true for the life strategy funds
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:18.120]   because, of course, the Target Retirement Funds have a changing
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.320]   thing, but once you get the Target Retirement income,
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.620]   it's fixed.
[00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:22.460]   It's not going to move.
[00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.000]   And people might not want that allocation.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.780]   They may want one of the life strategy allocations,
[00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.300]   which remain the same.
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.780]   So I think that there's an appetite
[00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.160]   for both the Target Retirement and the life strategy funds
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.100]   at the admiral rate, whether they're called institutional
[00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.480]   or what.
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.140]   And as I -- say again?
[00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:52.980]   Mike said that they do have an institutional class,
[00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.580]   but most institutional class is offered to large companies.
[00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:57.340]   Is that right, Mike?
[00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.540]   Yeah, and not to us regular investors.
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:06.080]   So we have to choose the investor class shares.
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.960]   But Mike said that normally, and there's a lot of truth to it,
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.080]   a lot of people in 401(k)s and that start
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.060]   out with a life strategy fund or a Target Date Fund,
[00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.920]   and that's a great way to start because they're small investors
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:29.560]   and they can still get a nicely diversified portfolio
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.080]   in a single fund, rebalances automatically.
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.720]   But the problem is, is that we're --
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.600]   we have been pushing -- not pushing, but telling people
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.760]   that there's nothing wrong with holding one fund.
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.760]   You don't have to -- you don't have to hold total stock market,
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.260]   total international, total bond, total --
[00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:54.320]   you can instead have a single fund because when you do that,
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.640]   you have to rebalance yourself.
[00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:01.940]   You also would normally want to get more conservative as you age.
[00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:07.540]   But in the case of the -- some investors are learning
[00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:12.600]   that they don't want to do this when they retire or they don't
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:18.900]   have to worry about tax efficiency in a IRA or a 401(k).
[00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:23.320]   So a lot of investors can have hundreds of thousands
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.200]   or even millions of dollars in the single fund
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.400]   when they want to -- especially when they retire,
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.900]   want to simplify things.
[00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:34.180]   And so there could be -- in addition to the small investors,
[00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.960]   there could be very large investors.
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.160]   So I don't have any problem with putting a $100,000 minimum
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.860]   or something like that on the funds,
[00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.500]   but I think that they should be available
[00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:50.980]   to us regular investors who have qualified for whatever balance
[00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.520]   that they set for those funds.
[00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:56.760]   And as I said, that was the most requested thing.
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.580]   Last year, people were asking about it.
[00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:02.080]   Jack said he'd looked into it, and now, this year,
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.960]   everybody wanted to know what the result was.
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.640]   So, yeah.
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:10.440]   >> Let me just add a couple of comments about target date funds
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.240]   because I do talk about them at some length,
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.180]   and about the whole idea of balance, rebalancing,
[00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:19.560]   steady balance throughout your life in the last two chapters
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.680]   of the book that I guess just about everybody here owns.
[00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:24.120]   The new book.
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.800]   So this isn't a plug for the book
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.720]   because you already got it.
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:33.220]   But it is not at all clear that there is a better strategy.
[00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:37.200]   Is a target date fund based on your age and retirement date a
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.540]   better investment than, let's say, you deciding that you want
[00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:42.800]   to be in a life strategy fund at one level of risk or another?
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.420]   Isn't that not at all clear that being in a balanced index fund,
[00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:50.860]   which we started back in 1992 or '93, which is just straight 60/40
[00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:52.560]   for all investors all the time,
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.320]   it's not clear that target date funds will give you better
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.060]   returns than that.
[00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.280]   We just don't know.
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.240]   Nobody knows.
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:04.340]   There is no guaranteed success in this business.
[00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:05.820]   You just take your chances.
[00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:10.940]   And so, I conclude in the book that I'm talking
[00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:13.840]   about asset allocation, how a lot of it is very intuitive.
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:19.440]   I'm not so sure we need to go from 60.1 back to 60
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.680]   to rebalance, and I'm not even sure that you have
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:22.980]   to go from 70 to 60.
[00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:25.460]   But maybe when you get to 80, you should go back
[00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:26.980]   to 65 or something like that.
[00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:27.860]   I just don't know.
[00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:28.700]   It all depends.
[00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:31.780]   There's no rule that is going to get you through there.
[00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:35.940]   And then, you have to take into account when you look at history
[00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:40.500]   that bonds used to yield a lot more than stocks.
[00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:43.060]   And that was a good reason.
[00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:45.980]   So, you come to your retirement and you want more income.
[00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:48.460]   Not everybody does, but most people do.
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:51.460]   And so, you've got a much bigger portion
[00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:53.040]   in bonds that will pay you income.
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.820]   And that's one of the principles of the target-date funds.
[00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:57.820]   But it isn't the case anymore.
[00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:00.040]   You know, I'm using a future return.
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.380]   Well, let's talk about yield.
[00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:05.720]   I'm using a yield on bonds of about 3% for the next 10 years,
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:09.760]   and that's just based on a very simple division
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:13.880]   of your bondholders into 10-year treasury notes,
[00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:21.340]   yielding about 2.2%, and a corporate bond fund yielding
[00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:25.460]   about, I think, about 4%, and you end up with a 3% return.
[00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:27.940]   And so, that's pretty much what you're going to get.
[00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:32.640]   Not the old 8, not the old 9, not the 15 that we got
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:33.820]   in Paul Volcker's era.
[00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:35.480]   Imagine that, 15%.
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.340]   I mean, shooting fish in a barrel.
[00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:39.020]   If you'd bought a zero-coupon treasury,
[00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:40.420]   nothing would have been better.
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:44.600]   So, I think we can say safely that it would be very hard to talk
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.220]   about the bond market and say
[00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:48.020]   that in the future nothing could possibly be better
[00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.180]   than a 3% return.
[00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:49.960]   I don't believe that.
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.480]   So, it's very much intuitive.
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:55.760]   I think, I almost hate to say this,
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:58.200]   but people should relax a little bit about the precision
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.360]   of all this, or about the certainty of all this.
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.920]   There's no certainty in investing.
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:06.560]   And I had this letter that is in the book,
[00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:08.760]   and I wrote to a young man who was worried
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:13.200]   about all the problems in the world, and he was trying
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.580]   to set his asset allocation.
[00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:20.160]   And so, you know, I said to him, you know, sir, young man,
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:25.500]   just as much about whether we're going to have a nuclear war
[00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:29.160]   as I do, or as anybody does, you know just as much
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.820]   about whether global trade is going to completely crash,
[00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:33.280]   which is kind of in the cards,
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.560]   but it may happen and it may not.
[00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:38.340]   You know as much about the effects of global warming,
[00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:40.240]   or as we're now supposed to call it, climate change,
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.040]   as anybody, make your judgment about that,
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.500]   and I can't help you with that.
[00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:47.400]   And, you know, racial divisions in the country,
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:49.560]   gap between the rich and the poor,
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:50.840]   how is that going to be reconciled?
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:52.900]   Nobody knows the answers to that,
[00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:54.440]   and yet that's an important part
[00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:55.840]   of what the market will hold in the future.
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:02.340]   So, I said, as for me, I'm invested 50% in stocks,
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:06.800]   stock index funds, and 50% in bonds, either our munis
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:12.160]   in my personal account or my corporate indexes or total,
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.040]   but not so much total bond market indexes,
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:20.800]   intermediate term in length, and I spent half, I said 50/50,
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:23.560]   and I spent half of the time worrying about why I have
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:26.640]   so much in stocks, and the other half of the time worrying
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.260]   about why I have so little.
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:33.820]   [ Applause ]
[00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:36.240]   >> Let's call that the investor's dilemma,
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:38.640]   and I think from that applause, for which I thank you,
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:41.460]   I think everybody is in the room, as I said, that said,
[00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:42.300]   oh yeah.
[00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:44.440]   >> No doubt, Jack.
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:47.640]   This question is from Dan Wickenhauser.
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:51.060]   He said, did you take an active role in the financial literacy
[00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:54.040]   of your children and/or grandchildren, and if so,
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.280]   how would you recommend
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:57.440]   that a parent start this process today?
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.800]   >> Well, you know, that's really a good question,
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.700]   and somebody mentioned it yesterday,
[00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:04.320]   but giving their kids a stock that they could watch,
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.080]   that kind of thing, and believe it or not,
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:08.860]   I did that with my oldest son.
[00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:12.000]   I bought him four stocks, probably five shares of each.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.300]   I can't remember the names of all the stocks now,
[00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:17.780]   but he put them on, he got these little decals and put them
[00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:21.000]   on his lampshade so he wouldn't forget to track them,
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.480]   and it got him very interested in the stock market,
[00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:26.280]   and that's the way to get your kids interested,
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:30.660]   but when it comes to investing, burn the damn lampshade.
[00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:36.520]   And I don't know how one reconciles that gap,
[00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:39.480]   and it's sort of the fun of investing versus the fun
[00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:42.680]   of not having a needy retirement, and, you know,
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:45.400]   one is long-term in nature, one is short-term in nature,
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.900]   one you can watch every day and see good things
[00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:51.020]   and bad things happen, one is roughly
[00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:52.280]   like watching the grass grow.
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:56.320]   And so I don't really have a good answer to that.
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:00.680]   I have given my grandchildren, in little trust accounts,
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:02.980]   which their parents will only be trustees for,
[00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:06.960]   balanced index fund, and I do it year after year.
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.620]   I'm not sure that's the perfect choice.
[00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:11.640]   Obviously, if you go back 20 years, 25 years,
[00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:15.140]   I should have put 100% in S&P 500,
[00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:19.540]   and I should have leveraged it, to be honest, but, you know,
[00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:20.480]   I'm just not into that.
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.000]   I don't want to look at it, I don't want to think about it,
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.220]   I want to send the check in at each year end in my ability
[00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:28.840]   to make gifts that aren't taxed, get it out of my estate.
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:32.960]   And so they have had an education in the balanced fund,
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:35.200]   and there's a pretty good section
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:38.920]   about what we call the Bogle model in the book,
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:44.540]   and it shows how the balance, the Bogle model is basically,
[00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:48.320]   based on the balanced index fund, was in the top,
[00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:53.820]   did better than the top decile of college endowment funds.
[00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:56.600]   The top decile of college endowment funds
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:59.300]   in the last 10 years, 5 years, 3 years,
[00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:01.580]   and probably 1 year, I can't remember.
[00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:09.720]   Wasn't that, yeah, and they had maybe, let me guess,
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:13.980]   a 1.25% margin, and we didn't have any geniuses running it.
[00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:17.940]   We had some genius who said balanced index is a good idea.
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:19.560]   I think I can remember who he was.
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.940]   [ Laughter ]
[00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:25.820]   >> Jack, this next comment/question is,
[00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:28.280]   I'd be interested in what his views are when he looks
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:30.300]   at his lifelong accomplishments.
[00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:33.520]   Does he ever sit back and realize how many people he has
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:34.760]   impacted for the better,
[00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:37.760]   how much he has impacted the investment industry?
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:41.160]   These impacts are huge, and I wonder what it must be
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:46.200]   like to contemplate your accomplishments.
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:49.560]   >> Well, when a question like that comes up,
[00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:53.620]   one is always called on to quote Sophocles,
[00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:56.660]   which I'm about to do.
[00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:59.100]   [ Laughter ]
[00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:04.280]   One must wait until the evening to enjoy the splendor of the day,
[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:08.360]   and my evening is not here yet, so I'm not really enjoying,
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:10.260]   ready to enjoy the splendor of the day.
[00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:15.100]   [ Applause ]
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:23.700]   And yet, and I mean, I do get a lot of enjoyment about,
[00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:27.140]   you could see this yesterday, I feel badly about it, actually,
[00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:31.660]   maybe a little too much ego, a little too much pride in some
[00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:34.000]   of the things I showed you yesterday, but it was kind
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.160]   of my year, and I thought, hell, brag about it.
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:38.160]   [ Laughter ]
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:40.700]   And it's not a good idea, I know that,
[00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:43.280]   and that's why that quote I gave you at the end
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:46.480]   about how minuscule we all are in the vast context
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:50.120]   of space and time, so you kind of come down to earth,
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:52.060]   and you also have a lot of lives.
[00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:55.260]   You have a family life, you have a community life,
[00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.600]   you have a business life, and you have a, I mean,
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.040]   I would say I have a ministry.
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:04.860]   I'm much more interested in the intellectual side
[00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:07.040]   of this business than I am in the business side
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:09.980]   of this business, and indeed, that article I wrote
[00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:12.760]   for the Financial Analyst Journal, their request
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:16.820]   of what I mentioned yesterday, profession versus business,
[00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:20.120]   professional values versus business values in finance,
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:23.440]   is to try and strike some balance
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:28.640]   in all these things you do, and I, you know, we, we, my wife,
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:31.260]   I think I'm bereft of humility.
[00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.740]   [ Laughter ]
[00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:35.700]   Did you follow that all right?
[00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:39.820]   And there is, there is something to that, but I've tried
[00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:43.800]   to handle what I, I don't want to make this too personal,
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:49.380]   but I just, this is, this is really weird,
[00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:53.160]   and I may be overexpressing a little bit, but I just want
[00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:54.960]   to be the same kind of kid I grew up as.
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:56.340]   I don't want to change.
[00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:57.940]   I had high values.
[00:16:57.940 --> 00:16:59.440]   I tried to set a good example.
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:00.540]   I took responsibility.
[00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:04.280]   I worked hard, and tried to do things the right way
[00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:06.380]   to help the community and the investor
[00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:08.240]   and anybody else I was working with,
[00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:12.100]   and that's good enough for me, and, you know, when I look at some
[00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:14.220]   of those monkeys, for the want of a better word,
[00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:17.060]   that are in the Forbes list that I talked about yesterday,
[00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:19.380]   you know, I have no envy.
[00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:20.460]   They all have more money.
[00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:22.640]   No, I don't give a damn, not a damn,
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:27.480]   and we have all we need, so I'm not embarrassed in that score,
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:30.400]   and, you know, I've done my best to live a good life.
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:36.340]   I've made some errors along the way, but I do like, I mean,
[00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:38.860]   I get letters from shareholders, this is a more direct answer
[00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:40.640]   to your question, Mel, I get letters
[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:43.720]   from shareholders pretty much every day to the point
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:45.140]   where if I hadn't gotten one in the morning,
[00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:49.180]   when noon comes, I say, "Emily, do you want to check the inbox?"
[00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:56.180]   And so that's good enough for me,
[00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:58.720]   and the letters I've written are incredible.
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:02.160]   They're beyond belief in their generosity,
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.580]   in their appreciation, and, you know,
[00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:07.880]   little things, little things mean a lot in life,
[00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:09.900]   and I just got a letter in response.
[00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:11.100]   This was not even an investment letter.
[00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:15.580]   This fellow said he had talked to me, he's a man, I think,
[00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:18.500]   about 60, he had talked to me, he was scared, he thought he had
[00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:21.960]   to get a heart transplant, and he called me up to talk about it.
[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:23.040]   What am I supposed to say?
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:25.400]   I'm not going to talk to you, so I talked to him
[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:27.600]   and encouraged him to do it, told him some of the challenges
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:30.200]   and difficulties, and how great it can work out,
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:32.360]   and he got his heart, and it's working fine,
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:33.420]   so I got a letter from him.
[00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:36.600]   Well, that's nice, you know, if you can do something nice
[00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:40.060]   for another person, for God's sake, do it,
[00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:42.720]   and to quote what I said yesterday
[00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:45.320]   from someone you'll probably remember, "Do it now,
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:47.860]   for we shall not pass this way again."
[00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:51.100]   >> And a follow-up on that, Jack,
[00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:55.820]   what would the next Jack Bogle be looking to change?
[00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:58.820]   Is there something that is ripe for a revolution
[00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:01.140]   that we will see over the next 40 years?
[00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:04.200]   >> Well, that's a good question.
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.300]   I don't think so.
[00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:10.180]   The index revolution comes kind of out of nowhere,
[00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:15.500]   comes out of an unwillingness of Wall Street
[00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:18.100]   and the mutual fund industry to change in a way
[00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:21.380]   that favors the investor, and that's just bad economics
[00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:24.920]   and bad business, but the mutual fund industry,
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:27.800]   particularly Wall Street too, has been able to get away
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:31.980]   with this fraud, if you will, I don't mean to speak too sharply,
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:36.380]   because the market keeps going up, and I use a number
[00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:41.260]   for something like this, if you started in, let's say,
[00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:45.620]   40 years ago, 30 years ago, 84, what is that, 30 years ago,
[00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:50.640]   and had gotten the index return of around 11 or 12 percent,
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:55.720]   you'd now have, I think, around $75 for each dollar you put in,
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:20:01.840]   $750 maybe, and for the investors
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:07.720]   that got 5 percent, he's got maybe $400.
[00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:10.780]   He thinks to multiply his money four times,
[00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:13.360]   it's something like that, and instead of eight,
[00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:16.120]   or whatever the number is, I don't have the numbers clearly
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:17.740]   in mind, but that's the kind of difference there is,
[00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:20.500]   and he thinks he's in heaven, my God, I've got four times
[00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:21.880]   as much money as I had at the beginning,
[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:24.100]   my investment advisor must be a genius,
[00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:26.740]   my mutual fund manager must be in the greatest business
[00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:30.140]   in history, but he has lost most of that return.
[00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:33.980]   Those kind of returns are not going to be with us
[00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:37.200]   for a long, long time, and indeed,
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:42.000]   given the perverseness of this business, the only way we're
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.780]   going to get those kind of returns again is
[00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:46.180]   if we get a good, solid market decline.
[00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:48.700]   Think about that, and particularly you
[00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:50.440]   who are still putting money to work regularly,
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:51.720]   what do you want today?
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:55.840]   You should look for a big 50 percent decline, and, you know,
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:59.100]   you keep investing at lower and lower prices, so this idea
[00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:02.260]   that the market has to go up, big news in the paper,
[00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:04.960]   a new high yesterday, the Dow went up, I think,
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:06.880]   two one-hundredths of one percent.
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:12.260]   Well, I mean, that doesn't sound like big news to me, so it's,
[00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:19.620]   I think, I think we, it's an, what we have done is
[00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:23.140]   to do the right thing in an industry that refuses to change
[00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:25.940]   and put the stockholder at the top
[00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:27.700]   of the food chain instead of at the bottom.
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:30.340]   And that's not going to happen twice.
[00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:34.020]   >> The next one is a complaint, Jack.
[00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:35.080]   >> Good.
[00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:39.780]   >> It says, "Ask him why he doesn't put a proper link
[00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:43.420]   to Bogleheads on his, the Bogle e-blog web page.
[00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:45.660]   His link leads to this forum.
[00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:50.680]   His link to this forum retains the name diehards.org.
[00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:54.280]   A search for his site for Bogleheads returns nothing.
[00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:56.340]   Perhaps he is too modest?"
[00:21:57.180 --> 00:22:00.600]   >> Wait a minute, I didn't get the question.
[00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:02.340]   Are you saying I used diehards.org?
[00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:02.900]   >> Yes.
[00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:04.160]   >> How could I do that?
[00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:05.220]   >> Ask Mike.
[00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:08.460]   [ Laughter ]
[00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:12.460]   >> Mike, it never happened, did it?
[00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:13.380]   >> I'm sorry, Mike.
[00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:16.920]   I didn't ask the question, I just read it.
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:18.560]   >> No, no, it's just an example
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:20.140]   of the incredible modesty I have.
[00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:21.320]   You've not observed it.
[00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:23.320]   [ Laughter ]
[00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:26.100]   >> Now, the next thing is, a comment says,
[00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:29.240]   "Since Mr. Bogle is a hero to people here on Bogleheads,
[00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:31.560]   I was wondering who your heroes are."
[00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:35.760]   >> Well, I've been asked that question more than once
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:39.160]   and so I don't have to agonize over the answer.
[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:44.120]   You know, in the world of business today, you know,
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:45.980]   certainly Warren Buffett has to be on that list.
[00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:48.920]   If you want to look at our competitors, I think Dodge
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:50.620]   and Cox is the best because they're in the,
[00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:52.740]   they're not always going to do well, of course,
[00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:55.720]   but they're in the business of, in the investment business,
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:56.840]   not in the marketing business.
[00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:59.160]   And that's a big distinction, all no-load funds
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:22:59.860]   and that kind of thing.
[00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:01.800]   If you want to go back in history,
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:04.800]   long before the recent popularity boom,
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:06.600]   Hamilton has always been my favorite.
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:10.080]   And when I read the Chernow book,
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:12.840]   he was my favorite before I even read Ron Chernow's book.
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:15.900]   And I didn't want to have 1,000 pages,
[00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:19.520]   I would have bought Chernow's new book on U.S. Grant.
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:21.900]   It was just too heavy for me.
[00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:24.500]   And I think I'd rather read the book than look
[00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:25.760]   at it on my iPad.
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:28.220]   So certainly Hamilton there.
[00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:31.420]   Benjamin Franklin, his sayings are quoted a lot
[00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:32.900]   and they're very much like mine.
[00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:38.180]   In terms of more contemporary, I still am, I'm not going
[00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:39.920]   to say this one because it would get political.
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:42.360]   And I wouldn't want to do that.
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:45.000]   I've always thought Woodrow Wilson was one
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:45.840]   of the great presidents.
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:46.800]   He did go to Princeton.
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:52.700]   But he was an idealist, an idealist
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:55.860]   that obviously fell a little bit short, if not a lot short,
[00:23:55.860 --> 00:24:00.520]   in his racial decisions, decisions to remove blacks
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:06.760]   from the federal government back in 1912 or '13, I guess 1915.
[00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:09.460]   And that was a shameless thing.
[00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:11.660]   But I think if we examined the history,
[00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:13.860]   we'd see there was horrendous political pressure on him
[00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:16.140]   to do that kind of thing.
[00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:17.480]   And I don't think he dreamed it up himself.
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:19.820]   But he did give, and here's a good one
[00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:22.380]   for Woodrow Wilson, gave women the vote.
[00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:26.600]   At least signed the final amendment to the Constitution.
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:28.620]   And so I like Wilson.
[00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:32.760]   And young people at Vanguard will often ask me,
[00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:34.320]   "What's the secret?"
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:37.940]   And this is a Hamilton kind of comment.
[00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:41.600]   And I say, "Well, look, there isn't any secret."
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:43.840]   I said, "You have assets that I don't have
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:46.040]   and I have liabilities that you don't have.
[00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:48.320]   And just make the most of your assets
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.360]   and minimize your liabilities and you'll do fine."
[00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:53.580]   But I said, and these words, almost exact words are
[00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:57.300]   in the Hamilton play, and that is, "Work a little harder,
[00:24:57.300 --> 00:24:59.460]   work a little smarter, be a self-starter."
[00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:02.920]   And that's what I've been telling them long before Lin
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:05.340]   Manuel's magnificent musical came out.
[00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:09.020]   So I don't know what to add to that.
[00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:16.360]   And oh, above all, above all, Walter Morgan, my hero.
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:21.820]   I met him when he was 50 and came over to see him
[00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:23.380]   for his 100th birthday.
[00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:29.280]   And what I had done, my second book, Common Sense
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:32.020]   on Mutual Funds, was in the process of coming out,
[00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:34.440]   but I didn't have a book to show him.
[00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:39.000]   So I got the publisher to give me the cover
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.780]   and the dedication page was dedicated to Mr. Morgan.
[00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:46.300]   And then a page which was like the whole book was printed
[00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:49.240]   in blue because Wellington Fund was the first,
[00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:51.760]   it was a very staid business back in the '30s.
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:55.140]   And Wellington used to distinguish themselves blue,
[00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:57.740]   prospectus, prospectus printed in blue.
[00:25:57.740 --> 00:25:59.180]   So that was in his memory too.
[00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:00.320]   And he saw all that.
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:03.560]   And, you know, he gave me my first break.
[00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:07.680]   He turned the company over to me when I was 35 years old.
[00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:13.380]   He was, in many, many ways, a better person than I was.
[00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:14.540]   He had a more balanced life.
[00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:17.900]   He was a fisherman and a hunter, had a place up in the country
[00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:23.260]   and I guess trout fishery, fisherman and deer hunter.
[00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:29.620]   And had his setters and pointers, dogs.
[00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:35.860]   And so, and he really didn't want to, he said later on,
[00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:38.900]   he turned the company over to me I think when he was about 62.
[00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:43.600]   And he said later on, you know, I wish I'd stayed longer.
[00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:48.640]   But he also said, in a magazine that was published probably
[00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:53.060]   in the '90s, that hiring me was the best decision he ever made.
[00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:58.520]   So with all the turmoil that came with it, he was pleased
[00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:02.200]   and I was pleased and I dedicated myself
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:03.580]   to fixing the Wellington Fund.
[00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:05.000]   Very few people know this story.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.240]   It's in my book, Investment Versus Speculation.
[00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:13.660]   And fixing the Wellington Fund was the highlight of my life.
[00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:16.820]   I had to fix it for Walter Morgan and it was not difficult.
[00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:19.400]   You know, I'm not known for some investment genius,
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:22.640]   but all we did was get rid of an investment moron,
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:24.320]   if you forgive the expression.
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:26.220]   And it's amazing, you look like a genius.
[00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:30.800]   So, you know, that would be the most of him.
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:33.340]   >> Jack, I'd like to interject something here
[00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:34.920]   when you were talking about Walter Morgan.
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:38.860]   I remember at the first conference in Miami,
[00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:42.700]   I had the job or the pleasure of driving you
[00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:46.000]   from the hotel over to Taylor's for our first conference.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.880]   And I thought to myself, "What on earth am I going
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:49.860]   to say to this guy?"
[00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:54.620]   And during the conversation, I kept calling you Mr. Bogle
[00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:56.540]   and you kept saying, "Call me Jack."
[00:27:56.540 --> 00:28:00.580]   After the conference, when I was bringing you back to the hotel,
[00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:03.300]   you were telling me about Walter Morgan, your mentor.
[00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:06.480]   And you said, "I had a hard time calling him Walter."
[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:07.560]   And I said--
[00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:11.100]   >> Hard time, I couldn't do it to his face.
[00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:13.820]   >> And I said, "Now, you know why we have a hard time calling
[00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:15.140]   you Jack."
[00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:18.060]   >> It's an older generation thing.
[00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:23.940]   >> This was discussed quite a bit, and there's a lot
[00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:27.160]   of argument on this among the Bogle heads.
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:31.640]   Says, "Mr. Bogle, what is your opinion on Bitcom?"
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:36.100]   Bitcoin, I'm sorry.
[00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:37.260]   >> Bitcoin, Bitcoin.
[00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:40.160]   Well, of course, I'm something of an expert in that field.
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:44.780]   And we're bringing out a Bitcoin fund.
[00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:52.160]   The management didn't want to do it, but given my standing
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:55.500]   in the community, they do it to be offered soon.
[00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:58.320]   It's-- I think it's honestly ridiculous.
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:28:59.480]   It's a currency.
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:02.380]   How does a currency, you know, how does a dollar going
[00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:05.060]   to be worth $4 the next day?
[00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:06.360]   It's speculative.
[00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:10.480]   I don't fully understand this blockchain technology
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:11.000]   as they call it.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.400]   I did have dinner when I was at the CFA or something.
[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:17.840]   Yeah, it was a CFA, a speaker's dinner.
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:20.580]   And the professor from the University of Georgia
[00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:23.560]   who's really expert on all this, the blockchain technology.
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:27.340]   And so, he sent me his stuff, but I haven't had time
[00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:30.560]   to read it, but I'd say, "Don't go there."
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:31.860]   Can I be clear?
[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:35.140]   [ Laughter ]
[00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:37.140]   >> This is from Lady Geek.
[00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:41.140]   The question says, "At last year's Bogo Heads Conference,
[00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:43.060]   you predicted that over the next 10 years,
[00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:48.100]   stocks gross return would be 4%, bonds would be 2.6%.
[00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:51.740]   Your slide presentation, pages 49 to 52,
[00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:54.600]   which only Lady Geek could remember.
[00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:56.900]   [ Laughter ]
[00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:59.100]   It's one year later, are you still on track?"
[00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:01.180]   >> Well, no, I'm not on track.
[00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:04.440]   Let me be honest, I mean, I'm not sure what that means,
[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:06.660]   one year into a 10-year forecast,
[00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:09.860]   but it means the returns will be much lower than they have been.
[00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:11.680]   But I want to emphasize this.
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:17.880]   I have never thought or said that this theory of the sources
[00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:20.880]   of returns, stock returns come from dividend yields,
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:23.960]   stock returns come from earnings growth,
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:25.500]   and we add those two together,
[00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:27.420]   and that gives you investment return.
[00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:31.220]   And then stock returns get enhanced or reduced,
[00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:32.820]   by valuation changes.
[00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:36.260]   If the PE goes from 20 to 30, you get another 7% a year.
[00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:39.700]   If it goes from 20 to 10, you lose a 7% a year
[00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:40.560]   over the next decade.
[00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:43.700]   And those things are not really predictable.
[00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:49.660]   So we rely on history, I do, I think it's 10 years for one
[00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:51.500]   and 30 years for the PE.
[00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:59.040]   And so when I say, as I do this year, 4% and 3% before costs are
[00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:02.860]   deducted, I say, if you don't like my prediction,
[00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:08.180]   make your own, and just think about how easy that is.
[00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:10.140]   And the dividend yield is 2%.
[00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:12.320]   You can't change that, and I can't change that.
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:16.260]   The earnings growth, I'm using 4,
[00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:18.540]   and you can say it's going to be 8.
[00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:20.300]   I don't think you're going to be right,
[00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:21.760]   but you're entitled to say that.
[00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:26.140]   So all of a sudden, you're at 10, 8 and 2, and you say,
[00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:27.560]   I think the valuations are going to go
[00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:30.400]   from 25 times earnings to 30, and that's going
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:31.900]   to take the 10 to, let's say, 12.
[00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:35.540]   Just don't give me the 12 without telling me
[00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:36.360]   the components.
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:37.920]   There's a discipline here.
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:39.640]   When someone says, I think the market's going
[00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:43.480]   to do 10% a year, just tell me, please, where it comes from.
[00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:48.060]   And right now, my predictions are not looking very good.
[00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:51.660]   Not predictions, really, but reasonable expectations.
[00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:56.140]   And I'd much rather, I guess just constitutionally,
[00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:59.900]   be on the low side than the high side, but the math is the math.
[00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:02.520]   Now, I could have said I expect more earnings growth,
[00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:05.380]   and I probably would have been wise
[00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:09.460]   to have put 7% earnings growth instead of 6.
[00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:13.520]   I'm sorry, instead of 6%, instead of 4 or 5%.
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:14.640]   But we'll see.
[00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:16.900]   There's a lot of time to go, and happily,
[00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:20.940]   with this 10-year forecast, I won't be around to know whether
[00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:21.700]   it's right or wrong.
[00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:24.460]   >> Well, we hope you are, Jack.
[00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:25.720]   >> Not too much.
[00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:30.080]   >> And she made a comment that you're a Phillies fan,
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:32.240]   and wanted to know if you think the Phillies are going
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:33.020]   to turn it around.
[00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:37.280]   >> Well, I certainly was a Phillies fan.
[00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:38.280]   >> Was, okay.
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:40.900]   That answers the question, Jack.
[00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:43.580]   >> But they have, I mean, it's just amazing to me.
[00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:46.120]   Everybody else seems to produce an Aaron Judge
[00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:48.520]   or somebody like that, and the Phillies don't.
[00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:51.400]   And I don't know if it's their farm system or what,
[00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:53.560]   and I think their management is top-heavy.
[00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:55.740]   They've gotten this young quant right out of,
[00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:59.420]   what was the Billy Bean movie, Mike?
[00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:02.580]   What was it called?
[00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:03.560]   >> Moneyball.
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:04.140]   >> Moneyball.
[00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:05.620]   I had a good story about the investment,
[00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:06.580]   and that was a fun movie.
[00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:13.280]   But it's, we're in the quantitative era in baseball,
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:15.140]   and people are trying to pick and choose
[00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:16.020]   and look at little numbers.
[00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:18.580]   And that will help some teams for some time,
[00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:21.340]   and other teams, well, that's just like the investment business.
[00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:24.060]   And as soon as somebody says there's a winning strategy,
[00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:26.860]   everybody else does it, and it's no longer a winning strategy.
[00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:28.180]   This is all so simple.
[00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:33.760]   And so, the Phillies, I don't know, hope springs eternal.
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:37.440]   >> And this next question is from Victoria,
[00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:38.800]   who's sitting right next to Sue.
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:41.720]   She said, "Jack, what are your favorite topics
[00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:43.020]   in the Bogleheads Forum?
[00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:46.240]   And conversely, do any topics
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:48.120]   on the Bogleheads Forum concern you?
[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:51.920]   I.e., do you think any topics do more harm than good
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:53.240]   for the average investor?"
[00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:55.660]   >> Well, let me first be honest.
[00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:57.520]   I have to work every day,
[00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:01.660]   and that means I don't see the Bogleheads every day.
[00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:04.160]   I mean, the amount you have on there, the number of hits,
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:08.040]   number of comments are so vast that I just,
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:09.760]   I cannot be a subscriber.
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:13.040]   I kind of count on Mike if he finds anything that's, you know,
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:15.260]   relative to what we're doing, he and I are doing.
[00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:18.540]   And, you know, he'll tell me about that.
[00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:21.120]   But as for topics, I mean, I think it's fair game,
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:22.840]   and there's no such thing as a bad question.
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:24.900]   There's just a bad answer.
[00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:29.280]   And so, I think the Bogleheads has been a huge asset,
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:31.580]   enormous asset at Vanguard.
[00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:33.900]   There's nothing like it out there in the world.
[00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:37.380]   I read somewhere that it's the most popular investment website
[00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:41.660]   of any kind, not just, you know, put together of common ownership
[00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:45.940]   and common values, but any website that's there.
[00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:48.300]   So I'd love to see it.
[00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:51.840]   I usually send to Taylor stuff that might be of interest,
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:53.220]   but we kind of miss a lot of those.
[00:34:53.220 --> 00:34:54.740]   I don't send enough of my stuff down,
[00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:56.680]   and he can decide whether to publish it,
[00:34:56.680 --> 00:34:58.580]   or Mel can decide whether to publish it or not.
[00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:02.680]   So, but I do look at it, and I do look at the number
[00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:04.200]   of comments about what I've said.
[00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:07.000]   And, you know, if I said something really stupid,
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.800]   I take those comments to heart.
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:11.360]   You know, you can learn a lot from your mistakes,
[00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:13.940]   and so I try to do that.
[00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:16.980]   So congratulations to all of you on having a really,
[00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:19.140]   really good, really, really good website.
[00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:22.380]   And think of the number of investors that you helped,
[00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:24.800]   and it's the objectivity that counts.
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:26.260]   You know, you're not getting paid.
[00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:31.080]   You've done it, and it works, and so that's a huge service
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:32.420]   and a huge part of Vanguard's growth.
[00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:35.160]   I mean, I can't give you chapter and verse, but probably,
[00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:39.780]   I don't know if we're doing $350 billion a year.
[00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:42.560]   God knows how much comes from the bogleheads,
[00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:44.880]   and then people that look at your site.
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:50.320]   But it's a great asset to have in the element, you know,
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:53.800]   people talk about the index fund as being a great example
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:55.700]   of the democratization of investing.
[00:35:55.700 --> 00:36:00.460]   And you put the democratization right first,
[00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:04.120]   so it's the democratization of commentary and all that,
[00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:08.000]   and as well as the, you know, principal use of index funds,
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.920]   one way or the other, or low-cost funds is fine.
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:16.320]   And so, I think that's all I can say.
[00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:18.540]   >> Well, I did point out to Vanguard
[00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:23.920]   when they showed the slide that showed the growth comparison
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:26.980]   of Vanguard to, Fidelity, I think, was second,
[00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:31.200]   and they were going neck and neck, Vanguard slightly ahead.
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:35.880]   2007, Vanguard shot up like a rocket, Fidelity stayed
[00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:38.720]   down here, and I pointed out that in 2007 was
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:40.440]   when the Bogleheads Forum was founded.
[00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:42.440]   [ Laughter ]
[00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:45.640]   And they acknowledge, the people,
[00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:47.780]   the Vanguard people do acknowledge the fact
[00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:49.940]   that we drive a lot of business there, and that's one
[00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:52.560]   of the reasons why they treat us the way they do.
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:54.900]   >> Well, maybe that's why they ran that thing
[00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:57.500]   about airline preferences on their website.
[00:36:57.500 --> 00:37:02.540]   >> This next question is from Rick Tawani.
[00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:05.740]   Could you please comment on the differences and benefits
[00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:08.340]   of investing in different kinds of index funds?
[00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:10.500]   For example, cap-weighted,
[00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:13.140]   fundamental-weighted, and equal-weighted.
[00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:20.800]   >> There is nothing like cap-weighted indexing.
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:23.900]   It gives you the entire market return.
[00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:25.580]   It doesn't care about sectors.
[00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:26.840]   It doesn't care about managers.
[00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:29.720]   It doesn't care about styles, and in the long run,
[00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:33.320]   we know as a fact that it's very difficult for investors
[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:34.580]   to capture the market return.
[00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:39.480]   As a group, they can't, and so I go with cap-weighted totally.
[00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:42.020]   It also is kind of self-executing
[00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:46.000]   because people write, you know, if these hot stocks,
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.840]   whatever they call them, shag stocks or something, sag, rag,
[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:50.560]   what's it called, Mike?
[00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:52.860]   Bang, bang, bang.
[00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:54.860]   [ Laughter ]
[00:37:54.860 --> 00:38:01.340]   When they fall apart, the index, boom, will be over.
[00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:05.080]   But the reality is that other funds own those same
[00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:06.580]   fang stocks, actively managed funds,
[00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:09.580]   in almost the exact proportion as the index fund does.
[00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:12.140]   There's just no grounds for that kind of complaint.
[00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:15.340]   So, and it's not like we're driving
[00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:17.600]   up the price of Amazon if we buy it.
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:19.700]   We're not a big factor in that market
[00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:22.600]   because we aren't turning the portfolio over.
[00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:23.720]   It's just investing new money.
[00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:29.280]   And so it seems to me quite clear that that kind
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:30.220]   of indexing is best.
[00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:34.340]   You will find in equal-weighted a kind of temptation
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.220]   because it's equal-weighted, you don't have to,
[00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:40.600]   it requires a lot of work to adjust it
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:43.380]   and keep everything equally weighted.
[00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:46.900]   And every once in a while, including the recent era,
[00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:51.640]   equal-weighted has done better than cap-weighted.
[00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:54.800]   But it doesn't represent anything but a new way
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:55.780]   of looking at the market.
[00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:59.120]   And sometimes it will do better, and sometimes it will do worse,
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:00.780]   and sometimes it will do a lot better,
[00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:01.960]   and sometimes it will do a lot worse.
[00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:06.700]   So it's just the non-predictability
[00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:11.280]   of the returns on the equal-weighted portfolio,
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:13.100]   relative to the total market.
[00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:15.960]   It's going to get people thinking I should have done this,
[00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:17.800]   I should have done that, I'm going to get out of this,
[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:20.140]   get out of that, when those things happen.
[00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:23.760]   And so the temptation to change is always great.
[00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:28.180]   As for the value, I always thought that whole thing was kind
[00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:30.760]   of nutty, if you forgive the expression.
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:36.980]   And we had my sort of friend Rob Arnott brought
[00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:41.400]   out this rappy 1,000 fund, and it was based
[00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:43.900]   on industry fundamentals-dividend yields,
[00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:47.240]   earnings growth, book values, even number of employees,
[00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:48.640]   things like that that are pretty durable.
[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:51.660]   And he's had a very erratic record,
[00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:55.600]   very high volatility relative to the 500,
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:40:00.920]   and is probably a hair behind the 500 as we speak today.
[00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:03.920]   It was very, very close, he's been ahead a lot of the time,
[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:07.940]   but now he's been behind, and now he's calling for a crash
[00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:09.360]   in fundamental indexing.
[00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:12.780]   And I don't think that can happen either.
[00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:19.760]   I mean, the guy's a little bit of a nut, and he wrote an article
[00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:21.060]   about him in the Wall Street Journal.
[00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:22.920]   This is a little anecdote,
[00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:25.860]   and the journal reporter called me, a big article actually,
[00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:29.220]   and she said, "Well, how do you sum up your feelings
[00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:29.920]   about Rob Arnott?"
[00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:33.760]   And I said, "I just wish I was as sure of anything
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:35.620]   as he is of everything."
[00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:38.920]   [ Laughter ]
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:42.180]   And damned if that wasn't the closing line in the article.
[00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:43.700]   [ Laughter ]
[00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:46.200]   And I heard from one of his associates that he loved it.
[00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:47.160]   He loved it.
[00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:48.660]   [ Laughter ]
[00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:49.300]   What to be said.
[00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:54.120]   So, you know, fashions come and go, and we'll see a little bit
[00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:57.620]   more of this in the cash flows as the year goes on and comes
[00:40:57.620 --> 00:40:59.200]   to a conclusion in probably next year.
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:04.180]   But all this talk about value being better than growth,
[00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:07.400]   this year the growth index is up 22 and a half percent,
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:10.140]   and the value index is up by 10 and a half percent.
[00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:12.340]   So that kind of thing happens.
[00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:17.360]   Call it reversion to the mean, and that's a fundamental thing.
[00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:22.380]   You saw the charts yesterday, and it's always, in my opinion,
[00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:23.920]   it's always going to happen.
[00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:25.820]   There is no such thing as a permanent solution,
[00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:29.480]   a permanent formula, a permanent way to get rich
[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:32.760]   and just enjoy the market return.
[00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:35.040]   And you may do better somewhere else.
[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:39.480]   I have no reluctance to say that, but you don't want
[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:41.940]   to bet your financial future on odds.
[00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:44.360]   You know, I got a 1 in 10 percent chance,
[00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:47.120]   1 in 10 chance of beating the S&P.
[00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:50.960]   Why would anybody take that?
[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:53.760]   So I'm very comfortable as life has gone on
[00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:58.700]   and almost everybody has adopted the S&P or the cap-weighted,
[00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:01.720]   market cap-weighted by total market capitalization
[00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:04.320]   and methodology, anyone serious about the business.
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:08.440]   But there are a few kind of outcast, outliers, I should say,
[00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:10.800]   that do the total stock market.
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:11.800]   Right now it looks pretty good.
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:13.880]   I mean, do the equally weighted.
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:16.540]   So, you know, choose whatever you want,
[00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:18.820]   but I think if you're investing for a lifetime,
[00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:22.200]   there is no better way to do it.
[00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:25.160]   And I will editorialize at this point, and I'm starting
[00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:26.120]   to write more about this.
[00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:27.580]   I did it to the CFA, too.
[00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:30.320]   Just think about this for a minute.
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:33.160]   You're a mutual fund buyer, and you buy the best managers
[00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:34.920]   that are around, looking at past performance,
[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:37.900]   which is not only useless, but counterproductive.
[00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:42.280]   And we know you start this at 25, and you're going
[00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:45.420]   to be investing for the next 75 years.
[00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:50.080]   Someone 25 years old will have a life expectancy of 100 years.
[00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:52.460]   So what happens in the next 75 years?
[00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:56.580]   Mutual fund, you buy three funds or four funds, good funds,
[00:42:56.580 --> 00:42:59.460]   good performing funds, and one,
[00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:01.540]   the average portfolio manager lasts eight years.
[00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:03.460]   Not 75, eight.
[00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:05.600]   And the average fund, well,
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:08.080]   50 percent of them go out of business every decade.
[00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:11.380]   So that's 50 percent, and 50 percent, and 50 percent,
[00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:13.760]   and 50 percent, and then 25 or something at the end.
[00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:17.180]   And so you're going to probably own, we have no way
[00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:18.840]   to calculate this, but I think we use,
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:22.800]   when I gave these examples, that you'll have, let me say,
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:24.640]   35 different managers in your lifetime.
[00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:29.900]   What is the possibility that 35 managers,
[00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:31.940]   some of whom have gotten fired for bad performance,
[00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:35.300]   some of whom brought in new managers who clean
[00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:38.900]   out the portfolio at great turnover cost, some of which come
[00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:40.520]   and some of which go, none of them are going to live
[00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:43.780]   for 75 years, more than their present age,
[00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:47.020]   and what are the chances that that large number
[00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:51.860]   of managers can conceivably outperform someone
[00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:54.840]   who is smart enough to pick no portfolio manager
[00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:56.900]   at the beginning with the guarantee
[00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:58.480]   that his fund will still be run
[00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:00.860]   by the same non-portfolio manager at the end?
[00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:01.820]   Think about that.
[00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:06.140]   So lifetime investing is what we should all be thinking about
[00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:08.400]   and not being paid so much attention
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:10.800]   to what happens every day, every minute, every week.
[00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:14.760]   And listen carefully to Jim Cramer
[00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:16.280]   to get the best advice we can.
[00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:18.700]   [ Laughter ]
[00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:23.060]   A little aside on that, the first Bogo Heads conference was
[00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:25.320]   at the Miami Herald Making Money Seminar.
[00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:27.660]   Jack was the keynote speaker
[00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:30.580]   and followed immediately by Jim Cramer.
[00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:34.900]   Jack made his usual buy the market,
[00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:36.420]   own the market, low cost.
[00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:40.560]   Jim Cramer came up, forget everything that guy told you,
[00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:43.400]   I'm going to give you 10 stocks that won't miss.
[00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:46.480]   Everybody's writing down, running out to make the calls
[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:49.880]   to the broker and that was right before the tech wreck.
[00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:54.160]   And his stocks, basically I think 8 out of 10 went
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:56.740]   out of business and the others lost 70%.
[00:44:56.740 --> 00:45:02.360]   So right after that, if I recall, he confessed
[00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:04.640]   that Jack was right, buy index funds.
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:08.740]   But that was right before he got the gig banging things
[00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:11.920]   on the TV show and found
[00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:13.560]   out he could make more money doing that.
[00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:17.160]   And even more, this one happened to be in Florida too.
[00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:18.860]   I used to do kind of a speaking circuit thing
[00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:21.760]   and I could make a couple of bucks.
[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:24.840]   I would no longer run well at Vanguard full time.
[00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:34.720]   And so somebody, I guess it was in Florida, said, oh,
[00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:40.120]   it was a money game kind of thing and you had all these,
[00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:42.640]   this ring of investment advisors around there
[00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:44.960]   and one guy saying gold is the only way
[00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:47.720]   and somebody else is saying gold is the only bad way.
[00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:52.300]   And then so how do you, if you want growth without risk,
[00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:54.740]   here's how to get it and on and on around.
[00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:56.700]   They were all just big phony things.
[00:45:56.700 --> 00:46:00.280]   So when I got up to speak, I said to this nice audience
[00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:02.320]   of normal human beings, probably an audience very much
[00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:04.040]   like this one, and Taylor Laramore happened
[00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:04.840]   to be in the audience.
[00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:07.760]   And I said, you know, the first advice I'm going
[00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:10.500]   to give you is don't pay any attention whatsoever to anyone
[00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:11.520]   who has an exhibit here.
[00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:15.780]   [ Laughter ]
[00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:19.320]   >> Well, I remember the comment at the end.
[00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:22.360]   >> I'm looking over at the guys sponsoring
[00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:23.300]   out of the corner of my eye.
[00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:27.180]   He didn't look at all happy and Taylor dropped me a vote
[00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:28.780]   and he said, I'm going to guess you're never going
[00:46:28.780 --> 00:46:30.040]   to be invited to be back again.
[00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:32.940]   But, you know, if that's the price you pay
[00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:36.060]   for telling the truth, what's to be said?
[00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:36.880]   And it's an opinion.
[00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:38.340]   I can't really swear it's the truth.
[00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:41.040]   But the best advice is don't listen to all the stuff
[00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:42.060]   that you see on the billboards.
[00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:45.440]   >> Yeah, that was the money show in Orlando and I remember
[00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:51.100]   after that when Jack said, I don't know why they invite me.
[00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:52.380]   They know what I'm going to say.
[00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:54.680]   [ Laughter ]
[00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:58.540]   >> Jack, the next question is someone wants
[00:46:58.540 --> 00:47:02.000]   to ask your thoughts on two active vanguard funds,
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:05.340]   Wellesley and Wellington, and their roles have held as part
[00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:08.400]   of a retiree's or accumulator's asset allocation.
[00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:12.880]   It seems many indexers here do hold these active funds
[00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:15.980]   and would be interested to get Jack's perspective.
[00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:22.220]   >> Well, as I said yesterday, I've never done this kind
[00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:26.700]   of analysis but I am sure it is correct for Wellesley.
[00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:30.500]   But for Wellington, it is 98 percent indexed.
[00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:33.380]   It tracks the return, the source
[00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:36.940]   of its returns are determined 98 percent by the combination
[00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:42.660]   of 65 percent S&P 500 and 35 percent corporate bond index.
[00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:44.820]   And I guess the Bloomberg,
[00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:46.960]   Barclay-Bloomberg Corporate Bond Index.
[00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:51.720]   So it's an index fund and I like that about it.
[00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:54.760]   I like the fact that the big change I made in the fund
[00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:57.220]   when it was run, it's kind of a terrible story,
[00:47:57.220 --> 00:47:59.220]   when the Boston guys took over,
[00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:02.200]   they put a man named Walter Cabot.
[00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:04.140]   Bostonians love each other.
[00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:10.780]   That was an aside, in charge of the Wellington fund.
[00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:12.160]   He ran it for 10 years.
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:16.560]   He left the equity ratio normally at about 65 percent top,
[00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:21.200]   kept 83 percent, 83 percent totally out of the funds mandate
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:23.260]   at the high in the market of course
[00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:25.680]   and then watched it collapse with everything else,
[00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:27.200]   particularly because he put a lot of junk in it,
[00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:28.520]   the stocks of tomorrow.
[00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:32.980]   And in Mr. Cabot's 10-year tenure,
[00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:37.080]   it had the worst record of any balanced fund.
[00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:39.660]   And what you have to understand about this business,
[00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:43.420]   it is just as hard to be the worst fund on the list
[00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:45.000]   as it is to be the best fund on the list.
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.280]   I mean, there's a lot of randomness here.
[00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:52.280]   So he went on and so he was basically an abject failure.
[00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:56.360]   And so where did he go from there?
[00:48:57.400 --> 00:49:00.560]   He was named the treasurer of Harvard University
[00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:02.340]   and the president of the Harvard Management Company.
[00:49:02.340 --> 00:49:05.600]   Only in Boston.
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:13.400]   >> Do you think the higher profit potentials
[00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:17.380]   of large U.S. companies in domestic markets will continue
[00:49:17.380 --> 00:49:20.800]   at the expense of foreign and new domestic competitors?
[00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:24.860]   >> Well, I don't really know how to answer that
[00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:28.920]   because these old dichotomies really don't exist anymore.
[00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:32.600]   We know that half of the revenues and half of the earnings
[00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:35.960]   of U.S. corporations come from non-U.S. sources.
[00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:40.560]   And so you already have an international fund there.
[00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:43.100]   And the question, I mean, let's call it 50 percent.
[00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:43.800]   It's different.
[00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:46.220]   You don't have the same currency problems and all that,
[00:49:46.220 --> 00:49:52.180]   or currency value variations if you own foreign stocks.
[00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:53.740]   And by the way, I should say this.
[00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:57.100]   I don't know how many people know it, but I want
[00:49:57.100 --> 00:49:58.120]   to have a chance to mention it.
[00:49:58.120 --> 00:50:02.020]   And as last year, there is no question.
[00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:03.220]   I'm glad Mel didn't ask one.
[00:50:03.220 --> 00:50:05.820]   There's no question that gets asked more of me
[00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:08.760]   than why don't I favor international stocks?
[00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:12.700]   And I've explained it over and over and over again.
[00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:16.300]   And now when somebody asks it, I say, I hate that question.
[00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:18.800]   You might as well be honest.
[00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:23.300]   But last year, this year that we're going through right now,
[00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:28.180]   foreign stocks have done exactly the same,
[00:50:28.180 --> 00:50:31.660]   non-U.S. stocks have done exactly the same as U.S. stocks
[00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:35.820]   of about 14 percent until you get the weakness
[00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:38.860]   in the U.S. dollar, which has added 10 percent
[00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:39.700]   to those returns.
[00:50:39.700 --> 00:50:42.680]   So when you look at the international returns
[00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:45.240]   and non-U.S. returns, you will see 24 percent.
[00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:49.480]   But understand that those things are not fundamental
[00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:50.720]   in local currency terms,
[00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:53.180]   the way the markets are actually performing before you
[00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:56.180]   get into currency is identical.
[00:50:56.180 --> 00:50:58.940]   So there are a lot of things that go into this.
[00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:02.320]   And I always thought currency risk was a reason not
[00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:05.000]   to own international or non-U.S. funds.
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:06.500]   But I don't really object to it.
[00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:10.460]   But it's gotten to the point, I think the article was
[00:51:10.460 --> 00:51:14.460]   on CNBC maybe, Mike, the thing about my feelings
[00:51:14.460 --> 00:51:15.060]   on international.
[00:51:15.060 --> 00:51:17.620]   And oh, you didn't see that.
[00:51:17.620 --> 00:51:18.120]   You always wonder.
[00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:20.620]   It's six pages.
[00:51:20.620 --> 00:51:22.360]   Six pages.
[00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:26.560]   Of explaining my international position.
[00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:28.340]   And, you know, it's very logical.
[00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:29.700]   Could be wrong.
[00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:30.540]   I'm not saying that.
[00:51:30.540 --> 00:51:31.460]   You can always be wrong.
[00:51:31.460 --> 00:51:35.100]   But it points out that I don't say you don't need donors.
[00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:36.440]   You just be aware of these risks.
[00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:39.900]   A lot of returns in the U.S. companies are already
[00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:41.120]   international companies.
[00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:44.540]   That currency risk is a big thing.
[00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:46.500]   That institutional kind of risk.
[00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:48.780]   And these are how these things change.
[00:51:48.780 --> 00:51:50.780]   I'm not allowed to get into politics,
[00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:52.660]   but the fact of the matter is we used to look
[00:51:52.660 --> 00:51:55.340]   at the United States as having the strongest institutions
[00:51:55.340 --> 00:51:58.280]   in the world, governmental institutions, court institutions,
[00:51:58.280 --> 00:52:01.160]   or other kinds of institutions
[00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:03.820]   that change our lives here for the better every day.
[00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:09.440]   And, you know, the government institution is shaky today.
[00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:10.380]   Everybody knows that.
[00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:13.080]   I used to ask, have we lost --
[00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:16.120]   one of the risks is will we lose the ability
[00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:17.080]   to govern ourselves?
[00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:20.340]   I think you could argue that we're giving that a good shot.
[00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:23.100]   But that's politics, so I won't pursue it.
[00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:26.060]   >> Well, Jack, I guess I can throw the rest
[00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:28.040]   of the questions away since you don't want anything
[00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:28.780]   on international --
[00:52:28.780 --> 00:52:33.140]   >> No, I'll be glad to repeat my usual patois.
[00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:35.120]   >> This is a little twist on it.
[00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:38.760]   He says, in Bogle on mutual funds,
[00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:41.920]   you explain why international investing has risks and state
[00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:44.820]   that perhaps investors should keep their money in U.S. stocks.
[00:52:44.820 --> 00:52:49.400]   It concerns me that virtually no other passive investing author
[00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:51.960]   is worried about the same risk that you identify.
[00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:54.700]   Why do you think these risks are ignored
[00:52:54.700 --> 00:52:58.300]   and international investing is being touted as crucial
[00:52:58.300 --> 00:52:59.680]   for maximum diversity?
[00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:01.340]   What is behind this?
[00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:05.420]   >> Well, first, I have never given a damn
[00:53:05.420 --> 00:53:06.860]   about what anybody else thinks.
[00:53:06.860 --> 00:53:07.820]   >> We knew that, Jack.
[00:53:07.820 --> 00:53:10.500]   [ Laughter ]
[00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:13.280]   >> And I pay attention and I listen to the arguments.
[00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:15.860]   That may be a little strong form of my feeling.
[00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:19.260]   But they're entitled to their opinion and it may be right.
[00:53:19.580 --> 00:53:23.100]   And as this article that I just cited mentions,
[00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:28.860]   and this is true, I say this whenever I write about it.
[00:53:28.860 --> 00:53:31.360]   When I first said this, you don't need the international,
[00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:32.520]   any non-U.S. stocks.
[00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:34.740]   It was 1994 in my first book.
[00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:35.480]   I was on the record.
[00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:36.440]   You don't need them.
[00:53:36.440 --> 00:53:38.480]   If you're going to have them because of these extra risks,
[00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:40.820]   stop at 20 percent, no matter what the market weight is.
[00:53:40.820 --> 00:53:46.640]   And so in the next 20 years, some 25 years almost,
[00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:51.080]   and the non-U.S. are up about, let me say, 300 percent
[00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:52.420]   and the U.S. is up 800 percent.
[00:53:52.420 --> 00:53:55.100]   So this is a brilliant prognostication.
[00:53:55.100 --> 00:53:56.860]   I hear a little applause there.
[00:53:56.860 --> 00:54:02.040]   And yet, I quickly acknowledge the fact that the U.S. has done
[00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:06.180]   so well for so long in this relative sense may easily mean
[00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:07.520]   that we'll have some reversion to the mean.
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:08.440]   I always talk about that.
[00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:11.500]   And it could mean that one doesn't really know.
[00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:15.380]   So just take all of the-- don't take my word for it.
[00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:17.460]   Take it and make your own decisions.
[00:54:17.460 --> 00:54:20.460]   But I do think that you don't want
[00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:24.780]   to get carried away with unknown risks.
[00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:26.480]   And then I use this other example.
[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:27.920]   And they talk about Disney.
[00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:31.860]   And that is, when you talk about non-U.S.,
[00:54:31.860 --> 00:54:34.920]   think about what non-U.S. means.
[00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:37.800]   Don't just take it for granted.
[00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:41.100]   The largest non-U.S. market is the United Kingdom.
[00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:44.340]   The second is Japan, and the third is France.
[00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:49.560]   Now, the U.K. with Brexit and all is not
[00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:50.880]   in a particularly productive economy.
[00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:53.480]   I would bet that our GDP would grow faster
[00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:54.940]   than theirs in the next 25 years.
[00:54:54.940 --> 00:54:59.920]   Japan, very structured society, population shrinking,
[00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:04.480]   or aging population, tsunamis every few years.
[00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:07.320]   It doesn't seem to me to be a place
[00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:11.460]   that will do better than the U.S. And France, my God,
[00:55:11.460 --> 00:55:12.460]   they don't go to work there.
[00:55:12.460 --> 00:55:13.540]   They're having a big fight again.
[00:55:13.540 --> 00:55:15.560]   [ Laughter ]
[00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:20.100]   So, if you're French, I'm sorry.
[00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:22.100]   [ Laughter ]
[00:55:22.100 --> 00:55:26.800]   But they have very strong labor protections in France.
[00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:27.720]   There's no question about this.
[00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:32.580]   And the idea of the new Macron, I guess, administration is
[00:55:32.580 --> 00:55:33.680]   to reduce those protections
[00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:35.260]   and have a more competitive framework.
[00:55:35.260 --> 00:55:37.180]   And labor is revolting.
[00:55:37.180 --> 00:55:41.420]   You know, they have a, I think it's a 35-hour maximum week
[00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:42.120]   or something like that.
[00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:45.680]   And, thank God, I work 35 hours and a half a week.
[00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:48.380]   Not now, but I used to.
[00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:52.640]   >> Jack, this next one is a little embarrassing.
[00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:56.900]   It says, "A friend of mine is a successful salesman
[00:55:56.900 --> 00:56:00.880]   for Northwestern Mutual in Omaha and continues
[00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:03.100]   to push insurance financial products.
[00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:06.800]   I have told him time and again that I'm not interested
[00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:08.600]   and I'm now a bogey head.
[00:56:09.020 --> 00:56:14.040]   Three fund, low expense, index investor, full discloser.
[00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:17.000]   His comeback was stating, 'Good news.
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.740]   Jack Bogle is a Northwestern Mutual customer.'"
[00:56:19.740 --> 00:56:21.720]   Is that true or is that--
[00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:22.680]   >> Yes, it's true.
[00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:24.680]   [ Laughter ]
[00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:26.440]   I mean, let me tell you the truth of the matter.
[00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:30.420]   As a young married man, I wanted some insurance in case.
[00:56:30.420 --> 00:56:35.300]   I quirked, passed, went, so whatever the--
[00:56:35.300 --> 00:56:37.360]   but don't use the word died, please.
[00:56:37.860 --> 00:56:42.820]   And so, I bought a $10,000 policy for Northwestern
[00:56:42.820 --> 00:56:45.020]   because it was clearly a mutual company
[00:56:45.020 --> 00:56:48.120]   which was probably the best company in terms of relationship
[00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:53.680]   of rates to premiums and for $10,000.
[00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:59.440]   And I think maybe there was a companion policy I bought later
[00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:02.560]   on which is a tie on to that which maybe was another $8,000.
[00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:05.380]   So, yes, and I still kept it.
[00:57:05.740 --> 00:57:08.460]   So, I had $18,000 with the Northwestern Mutual.
[00:57:08.460 --> 00:57:10.720]   I mean, confession is good for the soul.
[00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:11.680]   I hope that doesn't--
[00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:15.580]   [ Laughter ]
[00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:17.340]   >> Well, are you getting royalties
[00:57:17.340 --> 00:57:19.840]   for them using your name, Jack, as a sales tool?
[00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:21.280]   >> No, but you know it's going to happen.
[00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:22.720]   You know it's going to happen.
[00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:30.080]   >> OK. Besides contracting for a term like policy,
[00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:33.480]   is there any reason to invest in an insurance product?
[00:57:34.700 --> 00:57:36.580]   >> Well, when you get beyond term--
[00:57:36.580 --> 00:57:40.160]   and all term is not the same, by the way.
[00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:41.640]   You want to pick that very, very carefully,
[00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:43.560]   but there's some perfectly good term policies.
[00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:45.860]   Sure, there's a place for an insurance product.
[00:57:45.860 --> 00:57:48.680]   For people that, you know, they have modest means,
[00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:50.760]   they're very dependent on--
[00:57:50.760 --> 00:57:53.580]   their family is going to be very dependent on their earnings.
[00:57:53.580 --> 00:57:55.120]   They don't have a lot of savings put aside.
[00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:58.760]   And it's an expensive way to save, but it's immediate.
[00:57:58.760 --> 00:58:02.700]   You know, you invest the difference and it's--
[00:58:03.260 --> 00:58:08.120]   it just is a perfectly intelligent thing to do,
[00:58:08.120 --> 00:58:10.600]   just so long as you don't get ripped off.
[00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:12.520]   And I'd say there's such a thing about--
[00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:15.360]   and the hidden cost in insurance and particularly
[00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:17.520]   in variable annuities are just an outrage.
[00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:20.300]   And so then it's not a good investment.
[00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:22.820]   It's a terrible investment, but there are things
[00:58:22.820 --> 00:58:24.560]   that are more important like your livelihood.
[00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:28.800]   And when you get into things, my experience or maybe intuition,
[00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:31.520]   when you get into something that gets complicated,
[00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:35.300]   it's really hard to maintain.
[00:58:35.300 --> 00:58:38.760]   So, you're buying term and investing the difference
[00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:42.980]   and, you know, it's complex and, you know, if you forget
[00:58:42.980 --> 00:58:47.140]   to invest a couple of times and your term policy lapses or--
[00:58:47.140 --> 00:58:49.180]   there's so many things that can go wrong
[00:58:49.180 --> 00:58:53.060]   that I think the strategy in the abstract is fine,
[00:58:53.060 --> 00:58:55.980]   but in the implementation, just make sure you do what you're
[00:58:55.980 --> 00:58:58.320]   intending to do and buy from a good company.
[00:58:58.320 --> 00:58:59.700]   And there aren't very many of them.
[00:58:59.700 --> 00:59:01.540]   I'd say Northwestern is still a pretty good company.
[00:59:01.620 --> 00:59:04.480]   >> This one said-- first of all,
[00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:08.620]   this was in almost every question.
[00:59:08.620 --> 00:59:10.800]   It says, "Mr. Boyle, thank you for all you've done
[00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:14.540]   for the little guy," and I just didn't want to repeat it over
[00:59:14.540 --> 00:59:17.520]   and over again, but it was in almost every response.
[00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:20.800]   "If I were to include Social Security as part
[00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:23.340]   of my fixed income, what would be wrong
[00:59:23.340 --> 00:59:25.880]   with holding the balanced index fund for life?
[00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:29.900]   My plan is to put it in this one fund and never look back."
[00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:31.660]   >> Nothing.
[00:59:31.660 --> 00:59:32.920]   >> OK.
[00:59:32.920 --> 00:59:35.540]   >> That is nothing would be wrong
[00:59:35.540 --> 00:59:36.800]   if you missed the beginning of the question.
[00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:42.140]   >> This one, again, repeats, "Thank you for all you've done
[00:59:42.140 --> 00:59:44.060]   in order to help the individual investor.
[00:59:44.060 --> 00:59:49.020]   Thank you for providing that constant reinforcement
[00:59:49.020 --> 00:59:51.120]   through your books and interviews that allows me
[00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:53.420]   to feel confident with my investment strategy.
[00:59:53.420 --> 00:59:58.160]   Taken into consideration, you're often quoted aging bonds
[00:59:58.200 --> 01:00:01.560]   as a starting point in determining one's fixed income
[01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:05.740]   asset allocation as well, as there is less need
[01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:08.800]   or willingness to take risk as we age."
[01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:12.580]   >> Well, in the abstract, that's probably true,
[01:00:12.580 --> 01:00:16.100]   but it's a rule of thumb and it depends on so many things.
[01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:18.880]   First, it depends on including Social Security
[01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:21.600]   as a fixed income position, which it clearly is.
[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:24.180]   And as long as it holds up, it's a fantastic--
[01:00:24.180 --> 01:00:26.640]   and we all just got-- everybody in the room just got it--
[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:29.880]   everybody that's on Social Security got a 2% raise.
[01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:32.080]   And, you know, that's not a bad year.
[01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:35.180]   And so it's inflation hedged by and large.
[01:00:35.180 --> 01:00:37.840]   And the government is not going to go out of business.
[01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:38.600]   It can be fixed.
[01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:43.020]   I'm reminded of a panel, a joint interview I was doing
[01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:45.160]   with Paul Volcker some years ago.
[01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:48.240]   And I said that-- they were talking about Social Security
[01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:50.280]   and I said, "The fixes are so easy,
[01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:51.320]   you wouldn't even notice them."
[01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:58.240]   And I said, "If you would just make Paul and I the two czars
[01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:00.000]   of the new Social Security system,
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.620]   we'd get it fixed in a day."
[01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:03.920]   And Paul looks up at me and says,
[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:05.920]   "Couldn't we fix everything?"
[01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:11.180]   [ Laughter ]
[01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:13.840]   >> Jack, I know you have to get out.
[01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:16.480]   So we're going to let you out on time.
[01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:22.740]   I want to let you know that we ran out of meaningful tokens
[01:01:22.740 --> 01:01:26.560]   of appreciation for your-- for the annual events.
[01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:28.260]   So we decided to create one.
[01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:33.340]   I know recently in conjunction with the Forbes Award
[01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:36.680]   that you won, you mentioned Founders Mentality.
[01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:39.520]   And we thought we'd pick up on that
[01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:42.880]   and we'd create something to commemorate this.
[01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:47.760]   As you know, many memorable events happened here
[01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:50.860]   in Philadelphia and pictured on the left
[01:01:50.860 --> 01:02:00.940]   of this are the founding fathers at Independence Hall
[01:02:00.940 --> 01:02:05.780]   in Philadelphia and on the right is a picture of you.
[01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:09.760]   And the title is Visionary Founders.
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:13.000]   And you certainly fit that to a T, Jack.
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.120]   And thank you for all you've done.
[01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:45.160]   [ Applause ]
[01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:55.080]   >> Well, thanks guys.
[01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:59.320]   We all need strength to carry on, I underscore the all.
[01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:03.420]   And these couple of days with you have given me enough strength
[01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:06.780]   to go on for as long as I'm able.
[01:03:06.780 --> 01:03:07.920]   I'm not going to go on forever.
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:12.860]   And there will be a time when your mind starts to go.
[01:03:12.860 --> 01:03:14.040]   It happened to a lot of my friends.
[01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:16.980]   They died, we lost three good friends in the last two weeks,
[01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:19.440]   about my age, one a little older, one younger.
[01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:21.680]   So that happens and it's part of life.
[01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:24.820]   But I'm going to try and go on as long
[01:03:24.820 --> 01:03:26.080]   as I can responsibly do it.
[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:28.560]   And responsibly be fair to my family.
[01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:32.780]   And I'm still trying to make my family life a little bigger part
[01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:33.660]   of my regular life.
[01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:36.980]   I do take those couple of months off in the mountains
[01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:38.300]   in the Adirondacks in the summer.
[01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:43.980]   But I found out that when you've been at Vanguard for 30 years,
[01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:47.380]   you get eight weeks vacation.
[01:03:47.380 --> 01:03:55.800]   So I've been there for 65, so I may just go up there
[01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:59.140]   and stay there, but it's a thrill to be with all of you.
[01:03:59.140 --> 01:04:02.140]   God bless you and God willing, I'll see you all next year.
[01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:02.560]   Thank you.
[01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:22.520]   [ Applause ]
