[00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:09.200]   All right, we got time here for--
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.000]   we'll do two more quick DeepLife questions.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.400]   So we have one here from Charles.
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.320]   Charles says, how can high school students
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.560]   excel in this new age without SATs?
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.000]   Well, Ben, focus on your grades.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.920]   I mean, the academic formula has always
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.560]   been grades plus SAT scores.
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.240]   For the vast majority of colleges,
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.880]   basically the only thing that matters
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.560]   is your grades and SAT scores.
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.440]   If they're where they need to be, you get in.
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.680]   If they're not, you don't.
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.140]   So now you're just doing grades instead of grades plus SAT
[00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.000]   scores.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.360]   If you're in one of the very narrow group of people who's
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.880]   applying to a college that is selective enough
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.760]   that grades alone are not going to be enough to determine
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.120]   if you get in and they're going to look at other aspects
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.400]   of your life and your activities,
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.920]   read my book, How to Become a High School Superstar.
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.960]   I get into how to do that game sustainably,
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.400]   how to make yourself impressive to college admissions officers
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.920]   without living a overworked, miserable, grind life.
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.000]   It's a cool book.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.760]   I profile a bunch of students I call
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.360]   relaxed superstars who got into good schools
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.320]   without stressing out.
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.880]   And I deconstruct how they do it.
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.080]   So you'll like that book.
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.720]   But again, for the most part, for 95% of the people,
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:20.400]   get good grades.
