[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   [Music]
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   The Lord gives and the Lord takes away.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   And it's His active role in the taking away that we often fail to reflect on.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   The Lord takes away by His own initiative.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   It's His wisdom, His act of sovereignty in our lives when we feel the sting of personal loss.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   But why? Why does God take things from us?
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   This was the question taken up by John Piper in a recent sermon.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   And here's one precious answer.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   The reason this world of calamity, conflict, misery, suffering, and death exists
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   is so that the followers of Jesus Christ would be able to experience and display
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   the profound God-honoring truth that Christ is more precious to us than everything we could lose in this world.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   A world of loss exists so that you and I, by not murmuring or complaining or getting angry at God,
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   but rather resting in Him and trusting in Him, could show the world and testify to our own consciences
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   that God is more precious to us than everything that we just lost.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   That's why the loss exists.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   I'll read the verse from which I get that.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   This is Philippians chapter 3, verse 8.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   "I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   For His sake I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as refuse in order that I may gain Christ."
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   All loss is meant to show in the heart of believers that Christ is more precious than what is lost.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   You've got two options every time you experience a loss.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   You can hate God or you can hate sin.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Because all loss enters the world through sin and is intended to portray the horrors of sin.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   My wife and I were married in 1968.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   I was 22 and already the Lord was showing me as I was making the transition from college to seminary,
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   the pain of the world. Not sure why I was just so burdened and sensitive.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   So I anticipated the exquisite pleasures of sex in marriage.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Who wouldn't?
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   And I felt the horrors of disease in the Vietnam War.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Fiasco. 50,000 of my friends dead.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   So in our wedding, the text that my dad, I asked to read, who did our wedding,
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   was Habakkuk chapter 3, verses 17 following that go like this.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   "Though the fig tree should not blossom, nor fruit be on the vines, the produce of the olive fail,
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   and the fields yield no food, the flock be cut off from the fold, and there be no herd in the stalls.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   Yet I will rejoice in the Lord. I will take joy in the God of my salvation."
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   We've been married 46 years and it's been very hard.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Still is. For reasons you don't need to know.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Some of which I'd be happy to tell you, others I would not be happy to tell you.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   And I'm so thankful that the Lord put that foundation under us.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   I don't believe in walking away from a spouse for any reason.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   "Though the fig tree should not blossom, no fruit be on the vines, the produce of the olive fail,
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   the fields yield no food, the flock be cut off from the fold, there be no herd in the stalls."
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   That means you're dead. There's nothing to eat.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   "Yet I will rejoice in the Lord. I will take joy in the God of my salvation."
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   That's why famine exists, among other reasons.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   So that Christians who are swept away in the famine will bear witness,
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   God is better than food.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   God is all satisfying to my soul as I die of starvation.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   Yes, He is.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   And what a tribute you pay to Him when that happens.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Murmuring is a great sin.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Philippians 2.15 says, "Do all things without murmuring,
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   that you may shine like lights in a dark and crooked generation,
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   and show yourself to be pure and blameless sons of God."
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Oh, how many times have I failed, even in the last 24 hours.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   I'm a born murmurer.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Murmur, murmur, murmur.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   I hate myself when I murmur.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   Because it's a statement that God is not better than what you're murmuring about.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   Oh my, that is humbling.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   This clip was taken from John Piper's recent sermon,
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   "The Pain of the World and the Purposes of God,"
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   a sermon he preached in Vancouver on April 26th.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   And you can find the full sermon at DesiringGod.org right now.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   Well, how do I know if the love of money rules my heart?
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   I'll ask author Paul Tripp that tomorrow as we continue talking about his book,
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   "Sex and Money."
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John Podcast.
