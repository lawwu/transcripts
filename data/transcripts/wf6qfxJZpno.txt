[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   Guys, my dog.
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   Is in jail?
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   Joker's in jail?
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.500]   Joker got in jail again.
[00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.760]   Okay, so he's been jailed in Italy.
[00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.320]   He was jailed in Palo Alto.
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.920]   When will that dog learn?
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:10.920]   I've spent quality time with that dog.
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:11.920]   Wait, why did he get jailed?
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:12.920]   He's out of control.
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:13.920]   Why did he get jailed?
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:14.920]   He got jailed because-
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:15.920]   He's a runner.
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:16.920]   He went to...
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:17.920]   He's a runner.
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:18.920]   He's a runner.
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:19.920]   He's a track star.
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.760]   We sent him to like the dog walker where he goes and runs around and they come pick him
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.120]   up but then the guy opened the van door.
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.120]   He dug off?
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.120]   He dug off.
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.620]   Anyways, he gets found.
[00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:37.280]   They're trying to call me because I guess my number is on the thing which I hadn't realized.
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.280]   You don't pick up?
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.280]   Can't reach me.
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.500]   Well, I'm in DC in New York and they put them in the kennel and we get this picture and
[00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.680]   Nick you can post the picture but you know because I sent it to you.
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.680]   Poor Joker in dog jail.
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.680]   He's a great dog.
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.680]   But he is-
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.680]   Wait, is he back?
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.680]   Did you get him back?
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.680]   Now he's back.
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.680]   We got him back but he's back.
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.680]   He's out of jail again.
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.680]   Honestly, he's only going to learn if he goes to jail.
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.240]   You should get a little tag for him.
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.020]   A little remote tracking tag.
[00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.080]   That's not- I mean, it's great but it doesn't stop him from escaping.
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.080]   That dog.
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.080]   There's something wrong with that dog.
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.080]   Remember when he came out when Zax came over?
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.080]   Yeah.
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.080]   And the dog was like growling at him and Zax was like, "I'm not punched in the corner."
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.180]   It's the only dog that doesn't like me.
[00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.180]   He's so cute.
[00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.180]   Every other dog.
[00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.180]   Every other dog loves me.
[00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.180]   What country was that dog trained in?
[00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.180]   No, he's not been trained.
[00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.520]   He's not been trained.
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.520]   We have to train him.
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.520]   I get it.
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.180]   He hasn't been trained but he's so cute.
[00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.240]   Did you train that dog to hate white people?
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.240]   No.
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.240]   That dog is a little racist.
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.240]   I'll say it.
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.240]   All right, everybody.
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:56.040]   Welcome to another episode of All In, the podcast that you've been listening to for
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.040]   48 episodes.
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.040]   Here we are.
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.220]   We're on the precipice of greatness, 49 episodes in.
[00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:08.600]   With us again today, the queen of quinoa, your science ambassador, David Friedberg.
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.380]   Also on the pod, the Rain Man himself.
[00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.040]   Definitely his dad lets him drive in the driveway, David Sachs.
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:22.000]   And batting cleanup, the dictator himself, Chamath Palihapitiya.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.040]   What did we all think of last week's pod with Balaji?
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.040]   I felt it got cut off too soon.
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.820]   soon. I was getting into a groove with biology and I'm trying to figure out how to pick that
[00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.660]   up with him. Cause I thought they were getting into some pretty interesting discussion towards
[00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.080]   the end. And we obviously ran out of time to Martha had to hop off. So, uh, it would,
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.660]   it would have been great to keep that conversation going. Apology. I really do think there's
[00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.860]   a big question Mark on like, how does the decentralized centralized web or decentralized
[00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.420]   social networks in particular work with respect to kind of that, you know, recommendation
[00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.940]   application layer, which is effectively what search solved on the internet. Um, and so
[00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.820]   I'm, I'm, I'm curious to keep the conversation going and seeing, you know, what this means.
[00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:06.460]   I made the decision to end the pod because Chamath had to go, Saks had to go. There was
[00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:11.600]   a hard stop. And I was like, I don't want to keep this going without the other besties.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.920]   And people were very upset. They thought I, um, shut it down abruptly, but we had a certain
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.120]   amount of time and we can always have them back. So everybody relax. But I did look at
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.400]   the stats. We each came in with our, you know, whatever percent prorotic, whatever percentage
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.760]   data, and he had double. So he had 40% and we all had basically, which is right for a
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.840]   guest. I think I felt right. Didn't it feel right. I think it's important to hear what,
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:37.660]   when folks come on, what they have to say. Um, he's a really smart guy and you know,
[00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.460]   you can kind of just let him go and riff for a while. Um, and then just react to him. So
[00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:48.780]   I think it's, it's lovely to hear such a deep thinker think out loud, quite honestly. Yeah.
[00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.420]   And even if you don't agree with him, I don't agree with him on a lot of his points about,
[00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.380]   you know, decentralized everything.
[00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.800]   I think centralized works for, you know, many things better. I'm curious, Saks, you know,
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.880]   looking back on it, were there moments that you felt maybe you disagreed with him more
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.000]   or agree with him more and wanted to lean into a conversation? Obviously it's very hard
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.140]   to have five people on a pod and only get a certain amount of airtime, et cetera.
[00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.260]   Well, look, I think, um, I think biology is a great guest to have on once in a while.
[00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.680]   I mean, it does kind of turn the pod a little bit more into a Ted talk. Uh, definitely have
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.360]   that vibe, but the, the fans.
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.360]   Yeah.
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.640]   Liked it. And I mean, biology should have his own show. I mean, he can go for a while.
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.540]   I mean, he's got a lot to say for hours. Yes. And he has, he has, and, and I think he should
[00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:36.820]   do his own show because there's definitely a huge fan base for it. And, uh, and if people
[00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.700]   want more biology, I interviewed him for about an hour on purple pills, which is kind of
[00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:46.560]   the, the, I don't know if you want to call solo pod solo show that I do where I occasionally
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:52.300]   interview people on call and download call in and, uh, go check out purple pills. Uh,
[00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.340]   so yeah. You know, I think it's, it's a great, it's a great podcast. I think it's, it's a great
[00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.340]   podcast.
[00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:55.340]   Yeah.
[00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.340]   I think it's, it's a great podcast. I think it's a great podcast. I think it's a great
[00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.920]   podcast. And you know, I gave a biology, a little pep talk coming in saying, Hey, listen,
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.160]   it's a round table discussion and I've interviewed you before, and you can kind of tip into the
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.640]   monologuing and explaining very big picture things. So just try to pass the ball a little
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:11.160]   bit here. Um, and I, and I think he, he did adjust his game a little bit, but it's, you
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.740]   know, it's hard to have somebody like that on. I think you pointed it out. Sacks that
[00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.260]   it's more like a Ted talk for him.
[00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:20.320]   We're having a conversation and he's used to being interviewed. And I think that is a,
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.320]   that's a transition, but you know, um, it was fine.
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.320]   Let's move on.
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.820]   Yeah. Okay. So I think we'll start off with something we talked about on episode nine,
[00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:35.300]   which was Coinbase, the CEO, Brian Armstrong wrote a very controversial blog, very, very
[00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:40.440]   controversial blog post, uh, exactly a year ago, Coinbase is a mission focused company
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:46.940]   at the time he was dealing with a never ending debate inside his own company about black
[00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.000]   lives matter about social justice and any number of issues.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.300]   And he said, listen, the company is mission focused. Our mission
[00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:58.760]   is to, you know, make people more financially independent, literate, et cetera. And we're
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:03.140]   going to ban any discussions on our electronic communications. You can do things on your
[00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:07.160]   own time. And it was quite controversial at the time. We had a good discussion. I re-listened
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:12.240]   to our discussion. I re-listened to our discussion on that pod and we all universally felt like
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:17.680]   it was the right move. Well, he went ahead and, uh, picked up the hornet's nest. He did
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:22.220]   not have to talk about this ever again. Everybody had forgotten about it and he grabbed the
[00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.280]   hornet's nest.
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.020]   He ran into the end zone and spiked it.
[00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:29.900]   Jason, can you, well, before you do that, can you say how many people left as a result
[00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.900]   of his blog post and all, do you know those stats? Cause I think those were
[00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.460]   I don't have those stats handy, but it was a dozen or two.
[00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:40.560]   It was 5% ended up leaving. There was a big article about it. You gotta, this was, I think,
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.660]   I think it was worth him doing a followup post. This was the one year anniversary of
[00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.800]   his blog post and he was kind of giving us a status update. And what he basically said
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.260]   is that the policy had worked. Um, so you got to, so first of all, should we just review
[00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:54.260]   what the policy was?
[00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:55.260]   Yeah.
[00:06:55.260 --> 00:07:00.080]   The policy was that they were going to declare the workplace to be politically neutral, that
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:06.160]   people would leave their politics to the door. They would not have sort of extraneous political
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:11.180]   conversations at work. That doesn't mean you couldn't support whatever causes you wanted
[00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:15.660]   on your own time or tweet whatever you want on your own time. But while you're at work,
[00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:20.600]   they would declare it to be sort of a political DMZ, like a demilitarized zone. Basically
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.240]   all he was doing was reasserting the old.
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:28.480]   Center the old etiquette of, Hey, when you go to work, you you're not engaged in your
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:34.140]   point to leave it. Yeah. You're paid to work. You're not there to engage in political activism.
[00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:38.740]   So that was the policy. And of course, uh, the, the, the, the woke mob became completely
[00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:44.260]   hysterical about it, uh, as it turns. And so then what happened is that Brian offered
[00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:48.480]   everyone a very generous severance policy. If they didn't want to stick around policy.
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:53.220]   Yes. Extremely generous. So they made it really absurdly generous, right? They made it really
[00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:57.040]   easy for people to check out if they want to check out. Well, only 5% took the policy
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:01.520]   people. Yes. And then on the heels of that, there was a gigantic New York times hit piece
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:07.700]   against the company, the usual disinformation and slanders, um, against the company. And
[00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:09.220]   then now we have this follow-up piece.
[00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:14.840]   And I think what Brian basically reported is that today Coinbase is a more aligned company
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:18.280]   because everyone who's there wants to be there for the mission. That's what they focus on
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:22.200]   when they go to work. He talked about how they had hired top talent away from other
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.200]   companies.
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:28.060]   And basically he put out the bat signal and people came running because you know, we have,
[00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:32.260]   they wanted neutrality. They did not want it. People are voting with their feet to come
[00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:36.800]   work. They're fed up with the politics and distraction. And, and I think the employees
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:42.440]   were secretly relieved that he declared this policy. Basically he took the heat on himself
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:46.320]   for the larger benefit of all the employees who just want it to be there and work and
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:50.140]   not have to wonder whether they're doing something right or wrong because they're on the wrong
[00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:51.180]   side of a political issue.
[00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:52.180]   Free.
[00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:53.180]   Berg. Nailed it.
[00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:56.260]   You said in our episode nine, which you can go back to free, but you may not remember
[00:08:56.260 --> 00:09:00.740]   your comments, but you said, what about the employees who just want to come to work and
[00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:04.420]   don't want to engage in political space? Now you're infringing on them to force them to
[00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:07.780]   be participate in these discussions and they don't have a choice because they need to feed
[00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:10.680]   their families need to go to work. And so free, we're going to take a little victory
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:14.860]   lap there. He says in this tweet storm, I'll just read the third part of it. One of the
[00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:18.820]   biggest concerns around our stance was that it would impact our diversity numbers. Since
[00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:23.160]   my post we've grown our head count about 110% doubled it. While our diversity numbers have
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:28.840]   remained the same or even improved in some metrics. So all of the hand wringing and pearl
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:33.080]   clutching that this would have a negative effect on the company has turned out to be
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:35.280]   wrong. Go ahead, Chamath and then free.
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:39.260]   I mean, if you want, it's like, I think it's important to set the context for what this
[00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:46.920]   is. There is a, um, a productivity war going on inside of, um, institutions around the
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:53.140]   world. And what's happening is that, um, people's personal beliefs are bumping up against what
[00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:59.460]   the government is doing. And, um, goals, operational goals of a company are, or a university or
[00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:04.360]   all these other places. And so this is probably the first big example. This is a, what is
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:10.280]   a 50, $60 billion public company, um, $50 billion public company that basically said
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:12.020]   enough's enough.
[00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:16.980]   This is our mission. Everybody else, um, basically just needs to shut the fuck up. And I think
[00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:21.960]   that that's very important. Now, if they then go off and actually crush their goals, that's
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.120]   the one missing piece.
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:27.700]   And all of this, because when that happens, then you can write a through line through
[00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:32.160]   all of this and say, okay, this is in part what allowed them to do it. So I think that
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:39.360]   the, um, the, um, the, the folks that, you know, uh, were really up in arms still have,
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:46.080]   uh, one small straw in the fight, which is that if these guys don't achieve their goals,
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:49.120]   they'll point to this as one of the reasons why, but if Brian
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:53.100]   diversity is strength, you know, like, yeah, you're suppressing free speech.
[00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:58.640]   You know that argument. But I think if Brian then goes and delivers a couple of knockout
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:04.200]   quarters and a couple of knockout years, then, um, you know what he will be able to say definitively,
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:08.960]   which no one can refute is we leave our politics at the door. We define our okay. R's and then
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:14.040]   we go and we build things that people need, um, as a company. And then you go off and
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:18.460]   you can do whatever you want. And I think that that's very powerful for, uh, many companies
[00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:19.460]   and institutions.
[00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:23.080]   Friedberg. You heard my recap of what you said last time. I'm not sure if you remembered
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:24.580]   this and what are your thoughts today?
[00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:31.000]   I think it's, um, it's worth just noting less about the particularities of what was said
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:37.780]   in the particular issue at hand here. And I, I would look more to kind of Brian's, um,
[00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:42.860]   leadership style as an excellent example of defining and creating strong culture, culture
[00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:49.020]   in an, uh, organization can give that organization what it needs to succeed. It puts everyone
[00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:53.060]   aligned in a specific way on how we make decisions, how we operate. It doesn't matter what the
[00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:57.300]   his particular beliefs and opinions were what to exclude, what to include in the dialogue and the
[00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:01.300]   discourse and the model for discourse within the organization. I think what matters that he put
[00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:05.700]   a line in the sand and he said, this is what we're going to do. This is what's in.
[00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:10.820]   And this is what's out. And organizations that do that and do that effectively generally win,
[00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:15.140]   they win more, they do better. The teams are aligned, the teams are more unified.
[00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:18.500]   And I think that definition may sometimes be controversial. And you'll notice that as
[00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:22.900]   companies get bigger, go public, they're larger, they bring in professional managers and the
[00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:28.900]   founder CEO steps out, they generally don't do that, right? They generally try to not do that
[00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:33.460]   definitional work, because they're trying to minimize loss, and not kind of take the bet on
[00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:38.100]   maximizing long term gain and doing the things that they think culturally define or will enable
[00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:43.300]   success long term. So I think it's a great example of leadership generally on how you kind of can,
[00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:46.420]   can be very vocal about defining a strong culture.
[00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:48.820]   Elon calls it I think Elon calls it corpo speak.
[00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:51.540]   What happens? Like,
[00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:52.740]   when you're meeting most companies,
[00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:56.820]   when they get bigger, they gravitate towards corpo speak. And then what happens is
[00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:03.460]   some cohort of employees who are really good, just feel trapped in this kind of morass of mediocrity.
[00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:09.300]   And by the way, look at Elon's, you know, call it attrition rate, right? By the typical large
[00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:13.140]   scale public company corporate metric of like, how many people are leaving per year, you'd say,
[00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:17.540]   oh, my gosh, something's up with that organization. But it really speaks to a strong culture. There's
[00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:22.180]   a company that's famous for this called Bridgewater Associates, you know, run by Ray Dalio $100 billion
[00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:22.580]   hedge fund.
[00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:26.740]   One of the best performing investment vehicles of all time. And they have incredible culture.
[00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:30.500]   I've talked about Ray Dalio's book principles before and some of the work he's done on this,
[00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:34.980]   where he is so adamant about getting culture right within the organization, how you operate,
[00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:39.620]   that they almost have, I think, a 30% attrition rate after the first year of people that come in,
[00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:43.140]   because they not only try and screen for these elements of what they consider to be the right
[00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:47.140]   cultural fit for their organization upfront, but then they also screen people the heck out of the
[00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:51.860]   door if they're not a good fit. And I think Elon has a similar sort of model. And you know, I think
[00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:52.420]   Brian, the way he's been doing it for a long time, he's been doing it for a long time. He's been doing it for a long time.
[00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:56.820]   The way he speaks about the organization is a similar model. And it's about defining the lines.
[00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:59.780]   It's about being very crystal clear about what's in and what's not.
[00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:05.540]   Whatever if you as a CEO and a founder, whatever you believe, you need to believe in it strongly.
[00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:09.540]   And you communicate it clearly, and then communicate it and then let people vote.
[00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:13.460]   They vote with their feet, they don't get to vote whether to change it. They just get to vote
[00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:17.300]   whether they get to stay or whether they go. And I think that that's a really smart.
[00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:18.420]   I think that's well said.
[00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:22.260]   Yeah, I think there's one other issue here. Jake, Jake, how this goes back to your point about why
[00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:26.100]   Brian have to bring this back up? Was it unnecessary? Did he spike the hornet's nest in
[00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:31.060]   the end zone? Here's why I think it was necessary. If you go to point seven and eight of his tweet
[00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:35.940]   storm, he says, it was the most positive reaction I've gotten from any change I've made in the
[00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:40.420]   history of the company, which is saying something, how could something be so negative in the press,
[00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:44.260]   but turned out to be incredibly, incredibly positive with every stakeholder 95% of
[00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:48.500]   employees privately, all the investors were telling him it was a great thing.
[00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:52.100]   And then what he says is the only sense I can make of it is there's a huge mismatch right now.
[00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:56.900]   Between people stated and revealed preferences, and we're operating in an environment of virtue
[00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:02.980]   signaling and fear of speaking up. So to me, this is the point of this tweet storm and bringing up
[00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:10.020]   now is without people like Brian standing up and saying what the truth is that look,
[00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:13.940]   everybody wants this, they're just afraid to articulate the principle.
[00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:21.940]   We keep, we keep encouraging this climate of fear. And you know, the alternative to Coinbase, one of
[00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:26.260]   the other companies we've talked about is Apple. I mean, you can basically choose to be Coinbase or
[00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:32.180]   Apple. What has Apple done? They booted out Antonio Garcia Martinez because of a passage in his book
[00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:36.980]   that they knew about. And ever since then, the company's been roiled by boycotts and petition
[00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:40.100]   writing from the employees about some new cause every couple of weeks.
[00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:43.140]   And eventually that'll show up in the operating results of the business.
[00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:44.420]   It's just a matter of time.
[00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:49.780]   Right. And so, so why, why does that go on? I mean, I'm sure most employees at Apple don't want to be
[00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:51.780]   constantly royal.
[00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:52.020]   Right.
[00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:57.700]   By these like petition campaigns. But they have to put up with it because everyone's so afraid
[00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:01.540]   to speak up. And that's why it's important that what Brian did, we have to basically
[00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:08.580]   recognize that this woke mob who's cowed everyone to silence is maybe 5% of these companies. And if
[00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:11.380]   everybody just acts like Brian, the problem will be over.
[00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:14.740]   Well, we know, we know what the trail of breadcrumbs is right now.
[00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:21.620]   And I think we should probably, you know, shine a light on it, which is that that 5% is exactly
[00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:26.900]   the same as Donald Trump, they just exist on the left, you know, and there's, there's more and more
[00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:33.540]   research that shows that just as much as we thought they were right, authoritarians, they're
[00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:38.820]   also left authoritarians. And this is what we're seeing that, that the craziness that you know,
[00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:42.100]   everybody decries on the right, actually also exists on the left.
[00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:45.540]   And they just put a button on that before we pivot to the next story.
[00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:51.460]   Armstrong was very clear that the mission is about global wealth inequality. So staying
[00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:57.460]   focused on that, in his mind is the high order a bit and will result in the most great change.
[00:16:57.460 --> 00:17:02.260]   So paradoxically, or ironically, you know, all these woke people attacking Coinbase,
[00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:07.060]   Coinbase might do more for wealth inequality, and justice in the world,
[00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:12.100]   if they stay focused, then if they try to tackle everything, and you know, this is a road to
[00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:16.260]   nowhere for Apple, I think, Sax, you pointed this out about how if you were running Apple,
[00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:21.300]   you would fire anybody who does a petition, because I'll tell you where Apple is about to
[00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:28.420]   to basically land by enabling all of this woke mob inside their own company by coddling them,
[00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:35.140]   addressing them, and not keeping them focused, they will eventually get to the fact that China
[00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:40.340]   is, you know, has 3 million Uyghurs in a concentration camp, and those Uyghurs
[00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:47.220]   are proven to be providing through slave labor, equipment and components
[00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:51.140]   to companies that eventually make their way to Apple products. Ergo,
[00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:56.180]   Apple supports slavery. And that's what the employees will eventually get to. And that will
[00:17:56.180 --> 00:18:00.820]   cause chaos. But there's something even closer, more closer to home that that's probably true,
[00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:06.980]   or could be true. I don't know. It is true. But, you know, the fact that Apple had the most
[00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:12.900]   important security leak in their entire software career, just a few months ago,
[00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:20.980]   is also quite important. Like you had a zero, why is it important? You had a zero, so the iOS 4.0
[00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:27.860]   14.8 exists because of why? Because a researcher or a set of researchers in Toronto discovered that
[00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:34.020]   there was a zero click exploit in iOS that allowed you to basically turn on the microphone, turn on
[00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:39.140]   the camera, you know, grab anything you needed from iPhones, it was the most secure device
[00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:43.460]   until two months ago, when it turned out it was actually the most insecure device.
[00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:46.100]   So you're saying… I tend to think those kinds of
[00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:50.820]   technical mistakes happen when people take their eye off the ball. And I think people take their eye
[00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:57.060]   off the ball, because they're demoralized with dealing with distractions. Sax?
[00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:03.940]   Yeah, I mean, I think it's the whether it's the Uyghurs or the security issue, it's a good example
[00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:09.780]   of the employees at Apple, see the spec in somebody else's eye, but not the log in their own.
[00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:15.780]   I mean, that's, that's the principle. And, and they would be much better off focusing on dealing
[00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:20.660]   with their own internal issues. But but let's go, can we go back to that article that Chamath
[00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:21.220]   referenced about?
[00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:25.460]   Yeah, well, let me get free, you got anything else on this issue that you want to before we
[00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:26.260]   segue over?
[00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:26.980]   No.
[00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:29.540]   I thought this is a really great article. Do you want to explain it, Jayco?
[00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:32.340]   Yeah, I'll just give you a quick overview. And then you can dive right in since you put
[00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:36.340]   it on the docket. Psychiatrist and author Sally Sattel, hopefully I'm pronouncing that correct,
[00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:40.340]   wrote an article for the Atlantic entitled The Expert Somehow Overlooked Authoritarians on the
[00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:45.460]   Left. The main point here is that Trump's presidency sparked a ton of research and coverage
[00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:49.300]   of authoritarianism on the right, but mostly ignored the left with some researchers even
[00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:50.500]   suggesting that the left wing…
[00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:56.500]   that left wing authoritarianism isn't real. In an email to Sattel, a social psychologist from
[00:19:56.500 --> 00:20:02.180]   Rutgers said the following. For 70 years, the law, the lore in the social sciences has been
[00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:07.380]   that authoritarianism has been found exclusively on the political right. Why is that? One reason
[00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:12.180]   left wing authoritarian authoritarianism barely showed up in social psychology research is that
[00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:17.060]   most academic experts in the field are based at institutions where prevailing attitudes are far
[00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:19.540]   to the left of society as a whole. Sachs?
[00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:20.340]   Well, actually,
[00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:24.980]   Chamath put this on the docket. So, Chamath, do you want to introduce what you liked about it?
[00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:28.980]   The reason I saw this and I thought it was so interesting was basically we had
[00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:38.020]   an entire body of research trying to understand why some folks are attracted to these authoritarian
[00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:44.180]   figures like Trump. And overwhelmingly, all the research at the time said they only exist on the
[00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:50.180]   right. And, you know, you… and all of this started after Hitler. And so, there was all this
[00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:55.700]   research around the, you know, social and attitudinal reactions to Hitler and how he came
[00:20:55.700 --> 00:21:01.380]   to power and then all of the iterations of folks like him on the right afterwards. And so, people
[00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:06.500]   put Trump in that category and then they said it can only exist there. But as it turns out,
[00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:10.980]   when this person did this research and she surveyed 7,000 people and all of this data was
[00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:15.940]   very well summarized in this Atlantic article, which I'm sure we can post in the show notes that
[00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:20.020]   folks should read, lo and behold, it actually exists on both sides.
[00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:25.540]   So, as it turns out, the extreme right and the extreme left are exactly the same.
[00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:31.220]   They're moral absolutists. They believe in themselves and themselves only. And they believe
[00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:37.300]   anybody else that outside of where they are is fundamentally in the wrong. And if you actually
[00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:44.500]   look at that and see how Trump behaved in his presidency and now how you see how the left
[00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:49.860]   names and shames, you actually find a lot of commonality. So, the reason I found that article
[00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:52.980]   interesting is that it actually says again what we've been saying, which is
[00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:58.740]   coming down the middle and finding, you know, reasonable compromise is the only way forward
[00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:04.260]   because the minute you start moving in either direction, you are the same. And that person is
[00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:08.100]   an ugly person that we don't want around. Let me give the money quote and then get
[00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:12.900]   your feedback, Friedberg. The similarities in the study included, quote, "similarities between
[00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:18.100]   authoritarianism on both sides, left and right, preference for social uniformity, check, prejudice
[00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:19.700]   toward different groups, different
[00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:25.460]   others, willingness to wield group authority to coerce behavior, cognitive rigidity,
[00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:32.260]   aggression and punitiveness toward perceived enemies, outsized concern for hierarchy, and,"
[00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:36.020]   as Chamath pointed out, "moral absolutism." Friedberg?
[00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:39.860]   I think authoritarian figures resolve when
[00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:49.540]   a population feels insecure. So, I mean, we talked about this last pod, but I do think that
[00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:56.820]   you know, the notion of freedom emerges after the comfort of security has been provided. And I think
[00:22:56.820 --> 00:23:03.780]   the absence of security drives people away from the drive towards freedom. Like, when you have a
[00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:08.900]   feeling of insecurity with respect to kind of your ability to get a job, I mean, remember,
[00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:16.580]   Hitler rose to power when unemployment, you know, post-Weimar Republic was skyrocketing.
[00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:19.380]   People, you know, couldn't get jobs, they couldn't afford food.
[00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:24.100]   And the authoritarian figure was going to provide the security needed, I think,
[00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:29.620]   to resolve the concerns that the population had. And then, you know, people latch on to that. So,
[00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:33.700]   you know, there are moments in time when I think authoritarianism can emerge
[00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:37.940]   with different forms of resolution. It doesn't necessarily mean that the authoritarian actor
[00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:42.820]   needs to take a left or a right point of view. They're just going to give you a path to security
[00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:46.260]   when you're feeling insecure. If you don't feel insecure, you're going to say, "That's ridiculous."
[00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:48.500]   So, countries that are wealthy, countries that are
[00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:53.460]   privileged with the opportunities that maybe the United States has are less likely and less
[00:23:53.460 --> 00:24:00.740]   inclined to fall in, you know, in favor of authoritarian leaders. And then as we slip
[00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:06.900]   backwards economically, unemployment-wise, etc., we're more likely to be in favor of
[00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:09.940]   those sorts of actors. And so, I think that, you know, we'll see them emerge.
[00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:14.740]   But don't you think it's crazy that we actually didn't think it could exist in one end of the
[00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:17.460]   political spectrum and now it does? You have a point in that or no?
[00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:18.340]   I never really understood the point of that.
[00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:23.300]   I never understood the whole like, "Hitler is purely a right-wing guy." Like, he was a,
[00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:27.940]   you know, a socialist and he was trying to enable like, you know, socialized services and socialized
[00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:32.100]   systems for people, you know, in a lot of political circles that would be argued as being
[00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:36.180]   a very kind of left point of view. And so, I don't know if it... Yeah, I...
[00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:42.340]   Let's go beyond Hitler. You're right, the Nazi party was a national socialist party. That's
[00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:48.180]   what the name of the party was. But there's also Stalin, Pol Pot, Mao. I mean, if you're paying
[00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:54.020]   attention to history, you know that there's been authoritarianism on the left, not just the right.
[00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:59.540]   But, you know, in the universities and in the media, they only want to focus on the
[00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:05.140]   right-wing version of it. And I think what this study does is it upends 70 years of dogma that,
[00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:12.020]   you know, authoritarianism is only to be found on the political right. I mean, it obviously can be
[00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:18.020]   found on the political left as well. And you can see that in cancel culture, in speech restrictions,
[00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:27.860]   in these very aggressive Covid mandates that are now happening. You can see it in the sort of the
[00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:35.140]   ghoulishness. Anytime somebody on the right, you know, dies from Covid, I mean, there's always some
[00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:41.220]   chortling on the part of the left about this. The harsh penalties for noncompliance. I mean, right now...
[00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:47.860]   A lot of rigidity is the one that stands out for me, like, there is just on the left, they make a decision. Amazon is
[00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:51.940]   bad, and they cannot move off of that. Right, David? Like, even if...
[00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:55.460]   What about willingness to wield group authority to coerce behavior? And what about aggression
[00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:58.980]   and punitiveness towards perceived enemies? Cancel culture. That would be cancel culture.
[00:25:58.980 --> 00:25:59.700]   That to me is...
[00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:04.420]   It begs a good question, which is, what socialist
[00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:12.340]   regimes have come to power without an authoritarian figure? Has there... I'm just trying to...
[00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:17.700]   None. They're all revolutionaries. And actually, the study has a really good point,
[00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:23.700]   about this, which is they say that the researchers describe what they call anti-hierarchical aggression.
[00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:29.220]   So, one of the traits of authoritarianism is, they call it an outsized concern for hierarchy.
[00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:33.380]   But, you know, leftists think that they don't believe in hierarchy, but actually they do.
[00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:39.540]   They believe in an anti-hierarchical hierarchy, which is they want to turn upside down the social hierarchy,
[00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:47.540]   and they're willing to justify... The ends justify the means. In other words, if you can turn the hierarchy upside down, they'll let you do anything.
[00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:51.380]   And it's actually pretty scary. That's where the revolution comes from.
[00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:56.980]   Here's a practical thing, J. Cal, about what you said, which illustrates this point even further.
[00:26:56.980 --> 00:27:04.100]   Right now, we have a three and a half trillion dollar bill meandering through Congress. And,
[00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:06.980]   you know, it's very much a question mark about whether it gets passed or not.
[00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:16.180]   And one of the elements that's in there is free community college. Now, when it passes, if it passes,
[00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:22.100]   there's a lot of support that that's something that the government should do. It's a good thing.
[00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:26.820]   But if you're a private company like Amazon, who just announced that they will give you free college,
[00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:33.220]   they're still a bad company. And this is the example of this intellectual rigidity that
[00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:37.380]   doesn't actually see the forest from the trees. What do you really want? Do you want the process
[00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:42.820]   where you control and you meter out progress? Or do you actually want the outcome where
[00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:47.220]   somebody can get a job where they make fifteen or twenty dollars an hour and also now get
[00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:50.420]   college paid for? Yes, I personally want the latter.
[00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:52.740]   Yeah, we much better if the government didn't have to provide.
[00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:56.820]   I'd love I'd love it if the government could pay for it. But I'm really glad that Amazon is in a
[00:27:56.820 --> 00:28:01.860]   position to pay for it as well. But if you start to become absolutist and say, well, no, it just
[00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:06.660]   needs to be top down and metered out this way. And any private organization that wants to try to do
[00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:11.620]   it is still bad. I think that's where that rigidity holds us all back. It's unnecessary.
[00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:17.060]   Here's where I see the rigidity, Chamath is they keep saying gig workers are bad. Nobody should be
[00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:21.220]   allowed to be a gig worker. And David had a great interview with the ride sharing guy on call in
[00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:26.900]   in which they talked about the fact and this is somebody who is super pro advocate of drivers said,
[00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:33.300]   listen, 80% of people do not want to do shift work. They do not want the government dictating
[00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:39.300]   how they work. And I talked anecdotally with an Uber driver says making like 70 bucks an hour
[00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:45.860]   during peak hours. They were fighting to get minimum wage for drivers. Now drivers are making
[00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:52.980]   40 $50 an hour. Uber rides have gone and Lyft rides. It's a massive competition free market
[00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:58.500]   works. Well, and they can't take the win. They still are so rigid on the left that they're
[00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:03.380]   demanding whatever that woman's name is, who is you know, in the pocket of the arena Gonzalez,
[00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:10.900]   Lorraine Gonzalez in the pocket of the unions. How cynical are they? The victory is upon them.
[00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:15.780]   People are getting paid five times more, three times more wage, and they still want to screw them
[00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:16.740]   the takeaway for a lot of people. The takeaway for a lot of people is that they're not going to do it.
[00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:23.060]   A lot of people should be that your spidey senses should go up. When folks present solutions as a
[00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:31.700]   choice of one source only. Ah, you know, when things when things can only happen in one way,
[00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:36.020]   and it's the way that I feel the most comfortable. Yeah, your spidey sensor should go up and you
[00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:41.220]   should think to yourself really is that is that really the only way like can't we have choice?
[00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:44.980]   Can't we have different ways of solving this? Can't we maybe we can run an experiment and see
[00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:46.580]   what happens? Go ahead, sex. Well,
[00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:51.780]   I think your spidey sense should also go up whenever somebody is basically saying that
[00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:57.220]   speech needs to be censored for some higher purpose. You know, that that that whatever
[00:29:57.220 --> 00:30:04.820]   people are trying to abridge and take away our rights and our sort of long held values,
[00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:10.500]   our freedoms, you have to start getting concerned. And there's always a reason why they want to do it.
[00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:15.860]   In the study, the quote that the left wing authoritarians agreed with was getting rid of
[00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:16.420]   inequality,
[00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:20.500]   equality is more important than protecting the so called right to free speech. So there's always
[00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:26.740]   some higher reason the means always justify the the ends always justify the means. But but that's
[00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:29.780]   that's what you have to look out for is when they're taking away your right to speech to
[00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:35.860]   another fun proof point. Fun because it's Dave Chappelle that you can listen to or watch to
[00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:40.660]   see a flavor of this left wing authoritarianism is called redemption song,
[00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:46.260]   which is a little clip he put out recently. And the the entire clip is more about him
[00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:52.020]   getting his body of work back from Comedy Central. But the part in the beginning talks about
[00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:59.780]   folks on the left that really tried to dunk on him when he got COVID. And you should just listen to
[00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:04.420]   his reaction and how he frames it. Because I think it's pretty powerful. And again, it explains that
[00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:07.780]   extremism on both sides, they actually end up looking the same.
[00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:12.260]   Yeah, aggression and punitiveness towards perceived enemies. And I think that applies to
[00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:16.100]   anyone who anyone who defies the whatever the
[00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:23.060]   conventional wisdom is on COVID. There's another another example in the study of that, that the
[00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:26.980]   people who the left wing authoritarians agreed with the statement, I cannot imagine myself
[00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:31.380]   becoming friends with a political conservative. So you know, you've got these social groups that
[00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:36.100]   are completely uniform. And by the way, there have been like studies for a long time showing that
[00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:41.220]   liberals are twice as likely as conservatives to be upset if their son or daughter were to
[00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:45.700]   marry someone of the opposite party. So this has been this has been turned up in polls for a while.
[00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:51.140]   But this and you've seen it on universities and college campuses, right. But there's this idea that
[00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:57.460]   you know, anybody of the other political side is just suspect, you know, morally suspect needs to
[00:31:57.460 --> 00:32:02.740]   be shunned, needs to be expelled. Like those are the people you have to be concerned about.
[00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:05.620]   Yeah, you can't be friends. I can't be friends with you,
[00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:07.860]   Sachs, because you voted for Trump. It's just ridiculous.
[00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:15.780]   No, but it's, I think it's the derangement to give the other side of this. I think Trump was so
[00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:21.460]   extreme and so trolling and so great. I mean, if you think about his superpower, it was to troll
[00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:27.300]   the left and put them into such a deranged mindset that they did actually become that which they
[00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:32.500]   hated most. Right, but he did. He did troll the left. But But here's, but here's the thing is that
[00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:38.820]   we only hear in the media about the authoritarianism of the Trump administration. How
[00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:45.620]   many times were they screaming fascism during the Trump years? And, and now today, and of course,
[00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:50.260]   you know, if you go to MSNBC, it's January six all day all the time. That's all they want to talk
[00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:55.140]   about. But you there's a total blind spot with respect to the authoritarian tendencies of the
[00:32:55.140 --> 00:33:00.660]   left, which we see right now in COVID policy. I mean, it is getting so extreme right now.
[00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:05.860]   And I mean, Freeberg, you posted a the breaking news that just announced by a press conference,
[00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:11.620]   Gavin Newsom is now implementing mandated COVID vaccines for all public K through 12 schools
[00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:15.460]   in California starting this fall. Wait, wait, these students?
[00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:20.900]   Yeah, all eligible kids in all in all public schools, in all public schools,
[00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:24.020]   in order to go to school in California, you have to have a vaccine.
[00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:28.820]   I mean, kindergarten, kindergarten? Well, I mean, they're not eligible. Yeah,
[00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:32.580]   if it's when they're eligible, they're, they're, they're gonna be eligible very soon.
[00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:40.580]   I mean, look, I so so we have a 13 year old and 11 year old and a five year old, the 13 year old
[00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:45.060]   got vaccinated. She wanted to we supported it, the 11 year old wasn't eligible. She didn't get a
[00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:49.460]   vaccine. She got COVID. For me, it was a mild case. And our five year old isn't eligible for
[00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:55.380]   the vaccine. He never got COVID. Now, if if and when a new vaccine comes out that our five year
[00:33:55.380 --> 00:34:00.100]   old is eligible, I don't think he needs it. I mean, I'm not anti vax. I mean, I'm glad I got
[00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:05.300]   the vaccine. I'm glad you know, going to school by 13 year old vaccine. Yeah, he goes to school.
[00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:09.220]   Question is, do you if it is safe? Do you want them going to school catching it,
[00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:13.620]   spreading it? And do you want them to not have to wear a mask? Because you say conclusively,
[00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:18.980]   what say for a five or six year old at this point, it's a little hard, their bodies are developing.
[00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:23.300]   And yeah, you need some time. Do we really need to mandate this? I mean, why? Why can't parents
[00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:27.300]   make up their own decision? Because of other people in society would be impacted? I mean,
[00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:31.300]   you also see this, you know, look, I think I think vaccines maybe are complicated to
[00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:35.220]   debate because vaccines do actually provide protection. Let's talk about these mass
[00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:39.540]   mandates, which I supported at the beginning of the pandemic, because it's all we had to fight it.
[00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:44.260]   But you take an example like San Francisco still has these stringent mass mandates that may or
[00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:46.980]   not be effective. And I think that's a good example of how we can do this.
[00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:49.940]   So I think that's a good example of how we can do this. And I think that's a good example of how
[00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:51.460]   we can do this. And I think that's a good example of how we can do this. And I think that's a good
[00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:51.780]   example of how we can do this. And I think that's a good example of how we can do this.
[00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:55.700]   Yeah, I mean, that's what she said. She was like, she was basically like,
[00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:57.620]   it's Tony, Tony, Tony, guys, what do you want me to do?
[00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:00.180]   I'll risk the COVID, which is personal freedom.
[00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:00.980]   I had to give her that one.
[00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:06.020]   If you want to risk, if you want to risk COVID to play poker, or see your favorite artist,
[00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:07.940]   I mean, I mean, what do you want to do? What do you want her to do?
[00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:09.940]   What do you think about? Let me ask this question.
[00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:14.980]   What she said when she got caught was actually correct, which is we should be out supporting
[00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:18.260]   restaurants, we should be out supporting nightlife, adults should be able to make their
[00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:22.180]   own decision about the risks they're willing to take. The problem is she's not willing to give
[00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:24.260]   the rest of us that choice. Right.
[00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:29.060]   And we can all make our own choice. And by the way, look, the idea that the COVID is not going
[00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:34.740]   to get you with you know, once you take off your mask, when you get to the table, you know, we've
[00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:37.780]   talked about this, right? Yeah, you wear the mask and the made or
[00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:41.780]   do you stand to the table, then you take it off to eat and drink. And the COVID somehow
[00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:47.380]   between getting in. She was saying she was like, I listen, they were like, you weren't eating,
[00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:51.220]   we have you on video, you weren't drinking. She's like, it's unrealistic for an adult to put the
[00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:56.580]   mask on and off in between sips and bites. And I was on a flight and I was flying coach as opposed
[00:35:56.580 --> 00:36:01.460]   to business class recently. And when I was in business class, I was eating and drinking.
[00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:04.820]   There was no entire foreign language so far you're speaking what are you saying?
[00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:11.140]   Most people pay for a plane ticket and then they get on an airplane.
[00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:14.980]   So but the interesting thing was when I was in business class, I was eating my meal,
[00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:19.540]   I was drinking no issues. I had the mask off for whatever 20 minutes I was eating and drinking.
[00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:25.060]   When I was in coach, same situation, the flight attendant was going up and down the aisle.
[00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:28.580]   And while people were eating and drinking, if they didn't have the mask on, she was kind of being like
[00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:34.340]   a whole monitor saying please put your mask on in between bites. And I was like, okay.
[00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:37.460]   Yeah. And when we supported this mask man,
[00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:41.140]   day way at the beginning of the vaccine, we all thought the government's going to distribute N99,
[00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:46.180]   or at least N95 high quality 3M masks, right? We never got those. We never got them.
[00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:47.460]   Where's our testing kits?
[00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:51.940]   I know people are like walking around wearing these cloth masks, these loose fitting cloth
[00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:57.140]   masks. It's ridiculous. The COVID goes, you know, through the bottom, over the top, through the
[00:36:57.140 --> 00:37:00.340]   side, go right through it. I mean, like it doesn't do anything.
[00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:02.500]   Yeah, you're the lone ranger. Yeah. How's that work?
[00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:07.300]   I mean, I look if you wear a high quality, like, you know, PPE type,
[00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:13.220]   mask, I think it might be helpful. But you know, it's a marginal benefit once we have vaccines.
[00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:16.740]   Oh, by the way, just as we end this, what do we think of
[00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:22.500]   Andrew Wiggin? Well, you can't comment on this, maybe because you're an owner on the team, but
[00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:28.180]   a number of NBA players, high profile ones, in fact, in New York and California,
[00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:31.700]   where you're not allowed in the arena, if you're not vaccinated,
[00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:37.140]   are now deciding to sit out their home games. So Kyrie Irving being the highest profile
[00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:44.420]   one is refusing to get the vaccine. And he will be getting paid. He's got a $200 million contract
[00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:50.580]   max player, I think he gets 40 50 million a year. He's going to give up half of his salary to not
[00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:56.100]   20 million a year to not get the vaccine at least and leave his team to not play with them in home
[00:37:56.100 --> 00:38:03.620]   games. What are our thoughts on mandating NBA players who are playing inside an arena to be
[00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:05.460]   vaccinated? DC Draymond interview?
[00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:06.980]   I did.
[00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:09.220]   What did what did a day have to say about this?
[00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:12.180]   He says he's so fucking strong, isn't he?
[00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:16.340]   Yeah, he was like, this is ridiculous that we don't like respect each other is like,
[00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:20.980]   we've made this so political. And it's all like antagonistic, as opposed to meta,
[00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:25.380]   recognizing that there are differences and people have differences of opinion and respecting them
[00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:29.620]   and embracing each other for those differences rather than like, attacking each other and finding
[00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:32.660]   fault in each other and forcing them. And it's a great point. But
[00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:36.820]   I don't know. I mean, I don't think that this point is any different than
[00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:42.180]   the point about, you know, mandating a vaccine for anything, any workplace, any school. I mean,
[00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:45.780]   if you're going to mandate if you're going to mandate vaccines for workplaces and mandate
[00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:51.460]   vaccines for schools, you know, the NBA is gonna, you know, not be kind of excluded here. It's what
[00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:51.780]   it is.
[00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:55.300]   Right, just happens to be a bigger paycheck and a higher profile stage.
[00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:57.220]   I think as a matter of policy,
[00:38:57.220 --> 00:39:01.460]   the right policy here is to let private employers decide whether they're going to require
[00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:06.420]   vaccination or not. I think I think private organizations have the right to do that. If you
[00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:10.580]   know if a restaurateur wants to say that we are going to be an all vax restaurant, you want to,
[00:39:10.580 --> 00:39:14.740]   you know, they're only going to take clientele who are vax, that should be their right to do it.
[00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:19.300]   If another restaurant says we don't care, people can go to that restaurant if they want. You know,
[00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:22.980]   I think that the free market can sort of sort this out. I don't know that we need the government
[00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:25.940]   imposing it. If the NBA decides this is what they want to do, they can't.
[00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:28.260]   The NBA has decided, what do you think of that decision?
[00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:31.700]   Well, I mean, what I wonder about is how necessary it is.
[00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:35.940]   I mean, given the fact that, you know, all the players are young and healthy,
[00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:42.100]   and if they want the vaccine, they can get the vaccine. Look, I'm really glad I got it. You know,
[00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:49.460]   I think it but but I just you know, if given that everybody is vaccinated now who wants it,
[00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:55.060]   I just you know, what is the point of forcing that last 10% of holdouts to do something they
[00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:59.620]   don't want to do? I mean, this is where I think the authoritarian I would resist the authoritarian
[00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:00.500]   impulse.
[00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:05.860]   Freiburg, is there a new pill that's coming out? I saw a story today about this. I don't
[00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:07.540]   know if want to cover that or go to unicorns first.
[00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:15.940]   Merck published some results on this, basically, antiviral pill, it effectively
[00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:23.940]   inhibits RNA replication in viruses, and it's kind of, it was designed to be kind of broadly
[00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:29.620]   applicable. It was, you know, discovered at Emory University years ago, and they were testing it for
[00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:35.780]   influenza. And then even pre pre COVID, they were testing it on other kind of coronaviruses. Asar,
[00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:43.060]   and MERS. And so the the data that they just published shows that there's a 50% reduction in
[00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:51.860]   hospitalizations 50% in hospitalizations, water for people that are test positive for SARS CoV
[00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:55.780]   two infection, and then they start the pill within some number of hours, you take a few of these
[00:40:55.780 --> 00:41:00.340]   pills, I think they said five days, right? Yeah, well, I think it will they did the test on like,
[00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:05.700]   it was effectively Yeah, four or five days. That's right. When you end up reducing the number, the,
[00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:11.060]   the percentage of people that end up in the hospital by 50%. Now, you know, so the idea is
[00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:17.220]   that for countries that don't have access to vaccines, you can very cheaply make this chemistry,
[00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:21.140]   it's a cheap molecule that you could theoretically produce at scale, and you could ship it all over
[00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:25.940]   the world. And countries that don't have, you know, broad scale vaccination programs, they can
[00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:30.980]   make these pills available quickly and cheaply. And then you know, as people get infected with SARS
[00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:35.620]   CoV two, they just pick up this pill, you know, put it in every pharmacy, go grab a couple. And
[00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:40.660]   then you know, the hospitalization rate goes down, we don't yet know if it reduces the transmission
[00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:45.460]   rate. So there's a lot of question marks on like, does this actually solve the problem of the
[00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:50.500]   pandemic? It's certainly another instrument to blunt the, you know, the impact announced the
[00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:57.140]   name of it. It's mall new all new peer review, mall new peer review, the government. And by the
[00:41:57.140 --> 00:42:01.940]   way, there wasn't a lot of people in the study, no one that took the pill died, people that didn't
[00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:05.540]   take the pill did die in the in the infection in the infected population, because they were
[00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:09.380]   not the only ones that took the pill. And so I think that's a really important question, because
[00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:12.740]   they split them, right? They gave some people a placebo and some people the pill, the people that
[00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:18.420]   had the placebo, there were deaths. No one in the group that had the pill, the actual pill died. And
[00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:23.060]   so, you know, so theoretically, we don't yet have enough data to know. But there's also a big
[00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:30.820]   question on the side effects. Typically, these anti viral RNA kind of blocking drugs have other
[00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:35.460]   side effects. They're usually pretty mild, but you know, so there'll be a little bit more studying.
[00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:36.500]   So I think that's a really important question. And I think that's a really important question.
[00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:36.660]   I think that's a really important question. I think that's a really important question.
[00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:39.060]   I'm going to make it I'm going to make a prediction. Here we go.
[00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:46.900]   I think that the combination of vaccines and what is equivalently Tamiflu for COVID,
[00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:53.780]   which is effectively what this is, is the one two punch we need, so that this basically is rendered.
[00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:57.300]   You're missing the three, you're missing a key piece there, the testing,
[00:42:57.300 --> 00:42:59.780]   you must have testing to know that you have to take this.
[00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:05.380]   But I think that that's a I think like the testing is, it's not efficient, but the solution
[00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:06.020]   is, it's not efficient, but the solution is, it's not efficient, but the solution is, it's not
[00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:09.940]   efficient. My point is, if you have a combination of all these things, this is like a flu, which
[00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:14.820]   means that there'll be less ability for folks to not show up to work, which means that most of the
[00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:21.380]   economy will get back going. And I think then we can get back to really addressing what are all
[00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:26.100]   that 10 or $12 trillion? How does it show up in the economy? That's where the inflation comes from.
[00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:31.540]   That's where all this other stuff. So I'm, I'm pretty excited by what I read today. But now my
[00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:35.300]   mindset is going to 18 months from now, midterm inflation, and then I'm going to be able to go
[00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:38.900]   back to the midterm inflation. I think that's going to be what it's all about.
[00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:44.100]   We ordered 1.7 million courses of this alcohol. It's a we just call basically this is the
[00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:48.580]   equivalent of a Z pack. So and call those the impact. If this hits,
[00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:53.700]   I've taken probably 1.7 million Z packs. That's just on the way back from Vegas.
[00:43:53.700 --> 00:44:00.660]   So I mean, this feels like the end game and they are going for emergency use. So let's
[00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:03.860]   keep our fingers crossed. This would mean the stock market's gonna rip Jamath.
[00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:10.580]   No stock market is in a little bit of precarious position because if you have to if you have to
[00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:16.260]   reposition yourself for inflation, there's a lot of tech stocks that will get just absolutely
[00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:22.740]   obliterated like well when you when you when you have inflation, so the the order of operations,
[00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:29.460]   inflation means prices go up. The government sees prices going up and they say how do we control
[00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:33.940]   that they raise interest rates so that the cost of borrowing goes up so that then less money is
[00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:35.140]   being spent, right? So that when you have inflation, you're going to have to go back to the
[00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:36.100]   stock market. So that's the thing that I think is really important. And I think that's the thing
[00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:37.380]   that I think is really important. And I think that's the thing that I think is really important.
[00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:42.180]   When you do that, then all of a sudden people have to think about how much money you're going to make
[00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:45.860]   in the future. Because if you're not investing as much in the future, you won't make as much in the
[00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:50.420]   future. And when you discount all those dollars back, there's less of them. And so all of a
[00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:54.980]   sudden, you start to think about oh my gosh, well, I want dollars today, not dollars 10 years from
[00:44:54.980 --> 00:45:02.740]   now. That really puts a lot of pressure on tech stocks because we trade on multi year valuations
[00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:05.060]   in the future. So inflation is very bad for tech stocks. And so we're going to have to think about
[00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:05.620]   how much money we're going to make in the future. And that's the thing that I think is really important
[00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:08.340]   when you're investing in technology stocks. Inflation tends to be good for companies that
[00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:14.340]   make money today. Why? Because if I get $1 today, I can put it in this in the, you know, bond markets
[00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:18.260]   or I put it into a savings account and I can get more interest than I would have otherwise.
[00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:23.220]   And then separately, you also want to own things that are physical and real because those have more
[00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:28.340]   value. So all of that has to then get worked out into the economy and we have to make a bunch of
[00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:34.980]   economic decisions. So now the solution for that in all of those cases, though, if you're a hyper
[00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:38.820]   gold company, you'll be okay. So if you're growing more than 50 60% a year, you're fine.
[00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:43.780]   But if you're growing 20 or 30%, and you're kind of a middling business, and rates are going up,
[00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:48.420]   and inflation is going up, you're in a very, very, very precarious spot. And
[00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:49.620]   Sachs, what do you think?
[00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:55.060]   Okay, well, there was, there was a great article in the Wall Street Journal over the past week
[00:45:55.060 --> 00:46:00.020]   called University endowment's mint billions in the golden era of venture capital is basically
[00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:04.340]   talking about I mean, these these university endowments are like gaining 50% year over year,
[00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:04.900]   there's been like nothing
[00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:08.900]   Nothing like it before. There's so many unicorns being created. There's an interview,
[00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:14.020]   there's a separate article in I think, PitchBook as well about the rate of unicorn or crunch base.
[00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:19.220]   Yeah, that the rate of unicorn creation, I think last year, it was like one every few days. Now
[00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:24.740]   it's it's more than one a day bonkers. And so you know, we're getting multiple unicorns now created
[00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:31.540]   every day this year. It's just this golden era VC this engine of wealth and prosperity creation. So
[00:46:31.540 --> 00:46:34.820]   that's the good news. And to connect this to a point we were talking
[00:46:34.820 --> 00:46:41.300]   about earlier, if the radicals on the left would just allow the golden goose to keep laying
[00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:46.820]   golden eggs, we're going to have enough wealth and prosperity to pay for all these progressive
[00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:52.420]   programs in the long run, but they're not willing to wait. And so you have in Washington, for
[00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:58.100]   example, I think a political program that really could upset the apple cart. I mean, you're talking
[00:46:58.100 --> 00:47:04.740]   about a $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill, it'll probably get brought down to somewhere between 1.5%
[00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:09.380]   and two, then you got a 1.2 trillion dollar infrastructure bill, they've already spent
[00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:13.380]   1.9 trillion on a COVID relief bill. This is after the 6 trillion.
[00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:16.340]   What would you advise should be the amount spent?
[00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:20.180]   Well, okay, good question. So last year, the federal government
[00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:26.260]   generated record tax receipts, the most revenue it's ever raised, and it was about
[00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:33.140]   19 and a half percent of GDP. When Bill Clinton left office, he broasted about the fact that
[00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:33.620]   government
[00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:41.060]   spending was only 18 and a half percent of GDP. Last year, it was about 30% of GDP. My theory on
[00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:50.020]   this is that if you have government spending as a share of the economy at around 20%, from a tax
[00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:57.060]   spending standpoint, things basically work. But as you try to go up to 25% and 30%, it starts to
[00:47:57.060 --> 00:48:02.340]   break, you have too much deficits and debt, too much money printing, too much taxation,
[00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:04.580]   too much inflation, you become more
[00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:09.780]   brittle, and you start to you basically are, you know, unhealthy, you're killing the golden goose.
[00:48:09.780 --> 00:48:16.580]   And so, you know, all we have to do is let the economy keep ripping 20% of it is going to is
[00:48:16.580 --> 00:48:21.780]   going to be government share. And you'll be able to fund more and more progressive programs over
[00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:29.220]   time, as society gets richer. And by the way, this this prosperity that's being created in
[00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:34.500]   the tech ecosystem, it's available to everybody who has a good idea. I mean, this is not so
[00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:40.740]   as we all know, so it's not just government that's creating advancement, and economic opportunity for
[00:48:40.740 --> 00:48:45.460]   disadvantaged people, the tech economy is creating it as well. And what I worry about is, is why are
[00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:50.500]   we taking so much risk in upending this whole system that is working quite well?
[00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:54.100]   Well, the other thing is, this is all in the face of there being 11
[00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:59.700]   million open jobs, there's 1.4 jobs for everybody who's unemployed. So
[00:48:59.700 --> 00:49:04.420]   the idea that in some ways, society is broken, and people can't be employed. Now, these might not be
[00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:08.260]   the only jobs, there's only 4 million, there's only 4 million people looking for work. There's
[00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:12.420]   11 million outstanding jobs. Yeah, I mean, it is bonkers. Friedberg,
[00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:17.220]   do you think this is sustainable? What are your thoughts on spending and turning over the apple
[00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:23.940]   cart as sex is saying, the longer you guys have me on this podcast, the more likely it is you guys
[00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:30.580]   are going to unmask me as a diehard libertarian. I will not let my tendencies, you know, come out
[00:49:30.580 --> 00:49:34.340]   in full force. The spending is ridiculous. And there's a lot of waste. So I mean,
[00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:38.900]   I'll just leave it at that. What I think is interesting, though, is this unicorn creation
[00:49:38.900 --> 00:49:44.820]   system. This unicorn creation machine. You know, it's worth highlighting, because I think that that
[00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:49.460]   crunch space article showed that these unicorns in aggregate were worth like what one and a half
[00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:53.140]   trillion dollars or something. And so those are all private companies.
[00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:54.740]   $3.4 trillion.
[00:49:54.740 --> 00:49:58.260]   $3.4 trillion. So is that the amount of both bills?
[00:49:58.260 --> 00:50:04.260]   3.4 trillion is the total market cap of all the private unicorns, not just in the US,
[00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:07.700]   but the world. And right now in Washington, they're talking about three and a half trillion
[00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:12.260]   dollar reconciliation bill, same size. Can you imagine government spending,
[00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:17.700]   basically the entire value of the tech ecosystem in one year? It's bonkers, right?
[00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:22.100]   And so this, but by the way, I mean, like, I think that that 3.5 trillion, you can kind of
[00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:27.300]   think about that as being the future economy of the future global economy, right? So the entire,
[00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:34.180]   I just pulled up the latest quarterly stat, but the entire market cap of public US companies,
[00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:36.340]   which is the US, is $3.4 trillion.
[00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:39.460]   And so the total market cap of public companies is $3.4 trillion.
[00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:41.620]   And so the total market cap of public companies is $3.4 trillion.
[00:50:41.620 --> 00:50:43.620]   And so the total market cap of public companies is $3.4 trillion.
[00:50:43.620 --> 00:50:44.820]   And so the total market cap of public companies is $3.4 trillion.
[00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:45.780]   And so the total market cap of public companies is $3.4 trillion.
[00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:46.740]   And so the total market cap of public companies is $3.4 trillion.
[00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:48.180]   And so the total market cap of public companies is $3.4 trillion.
[00:50:48.180 --> 00:50:48.740]   And so the total market cap of public companies is $3.4 trillion.
[00:50:48.740 --> 00:50:49.380]   And so the total market cap of public companies is $3.4 trillion.
[00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:50.260]   And so the total market cap of public companies is $3.4 trillion.
[00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:50.580]   And so the total market cap of public companies is $3.4 trillion.
[00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:52.260]   And so the total market cap of public companies is $3.4 trillion.
[00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:52.260]   And so the total market cap of public companies is $3.4 trillion.
[00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:52.340]   And so the total market cap of public companies is $3.4 trillion.
[00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:52.420]   And so the total market cap of public companies is $3.4 trillion.
[00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:52.980]   And so the total market cap of public companies is $3.4 trillion.
[00:50:52.980 --> 00:50:53.060]   And so the total market cap of public companies is $3.4 trillion.
[00:50:53.060 --> 00:50:56.740]   It used to be that technology companies started in Silicon Valley,
[00:50:56.740 --> 00:51:00.100]   sold technology to traditional industries.
[00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:04.340]   What's happening in Silicon Valley today and over the last 10 years or so,
[00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:09.220]   is that technology "companies" are becoming the next industrial companies.
[00:51:09.220 --> 00:51:10.420]   They are replacing the traditional industries.
[00:51:10.420 --> 00:51:11.060]   Profound insight. Profound insight.
[00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:12.260]   Profound insight. Profound insight.
[00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:17.140]   And so this is what we saw. Airbnb is a hotel chain without hotels.
[00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:20.820]   Uber is a transportation company without vehicles.
[00:51:20.820 --> 00:51:21.460]   DoorDash.
[00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:26.980]   DoorDash. But even more importantly, there's an entire emergent class of life sciences companies,
[00:51:26.980 --> 00:51:32.980]   of novel hardware companies. And these businesses are leveraging their core technology competence
[00:51:32.980 --> 00:51:37.220]   to create an advantage in replacing an old model of doing industry.
[00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:39.140]   They're not selling into the old school companies.
[00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:43.060]   And so I think that the... And people are freaking out about some of these big investors
[00:51:43.060 --> 00:51:46.980]   like Tiger Global coming in and writing crazy checks. If you take an index,
[00:51:46.980 --> 00:51:51.860]   if you take an index of the $3.5 trillion today and said, "You know what?
[00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:58.340]   These guys today are going to be worth more than the $46 trillion market cap of all the
[00:51:58.340 --> 00:52:01.540]   other public companies that sit today in the next 20 or 30 years."
[00:52:01.540 --> 00:52:04.980]   That's a pretty good way to place your money over a 30-year horizon.
[00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:09.220]   I'm going to go ahead and put as much money as I can into the index of the private companies
[00:52:09.220 --> 00:52:12.180]   and expect that they're going to be worth more than $46 trillion in 30 years.
[00:52:12.180 --> 00:52:15.540]   I'm going to make a 10-bagger. That's a retirement fund for my family.
[00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:16.900]   And so it makes a ton of sense. I think that these...
[00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:23.940]   These unicorns, given the advantages that are evolving from software and sciences and so on,
[00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:28.500]   do end up playing out. It's going to be ugly. And what will happen is you'll end up seeing
[00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:31.620]   the asymmetry. You'll see the like, "Oh my gosh, it's something that's a thousand X,
[00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:35.940]   100X return." It'll become $100 billion public company or $200 billion public company.
[00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:37.380]   And then there'll be a bunch of them that are going to die.
[00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:41.620]   And people are going to focus on the depths and say this was overhyped. The bubble is over.
[00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:43.860]   But the reality is the index of companies today,
[00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:46.820]   I would be willing to bet 20 to 30 years from now is worth more than the
[00:52:46.820 --> 00:52:49.300]   $46 trillion of all the public companies today.
[00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:53.220]   So Chamath, one of the things we're seeing here, and you're playing a small part in it,
[00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:54.900]   or a large part, depending on who you talk to,
[00:52:54.900 --> 00:52:59.860]   we now have over 6,000 publicly traded companies on US exchanges.
[00:52:59.860 --> 00:53:02.340]   No, we have less than 4,000. We have about 3,800.
[00:53:02.340 --> 00:53:08.980]   Okay. No, we had 3,600 in 2016, according to the research I have here. According to MarketWatch,
[00:53:08.980 --> 00:53:11.380]   6,000 public traded companies in US exchanges. So what's the right number here?
[00:53:11.380 --> 00:53:14.260]   They could be counting the pink sheets and over-the-counter stuff, which is...
[00:53:14.260 --> 00:53:16.740]   Oh, okay. Got it. We're seeing dramatically more publicly traded
[00:53:16.740 --> 00:53:23.220]   companies. Many speculative ones or ones where you're getting to buy in in year four, five,
[00:53:23.220 --> 00:53:29.140]   or six. Obviously, you're part of that with all the different IPOAs through... What are you up to
[00:53:29.140 --> 00:53:33.540]   now? What's the... Yeah, we have six tech SPACs. We have four biotech SPACs.
[00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:36.580]   Perfect. I mean, I've started or invested in a bunch
[00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:41.860]   of others that have gone public. So let's look at this through the lens of the public markets as
[00:53:41.860 --> 00:53:46.660]   well. My macro view is exactly what Friedberg said. We are much better off with the
[00:53:46.660 --> 00:53:53.380]   many technology companies being birthed and being viable because over the long arc of time,
[00:53:53.380 --> 00:53:58.580]   those companies will rebuild things that are today inefficient and broken in a better way.
[00:53:58.580 --> 00:54:06.100]   The world becomes better. The question is for a lot of people, well, what if the wealth isn't
[00:54:06.100 --> 00:54:11.620]   better because it's only a fraction of the number of people with a very specific skill set that
[00:54:11.620 --> 00:54:16.580]   many other people don't have? That I think is a valid argument. But then there's a different way to
[00:54:16.580 --> 00:54:21.780]   attack this problem, which is you could actually do something really meaningful around corporate
[00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:29.300]   interest rates and corporate tax policy that would then get it. Even if those thousand companies,
[00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:34.100]   if you assume that that $3.4 trillion, 10Xs, that's $34 trillion of eventual market cap.
[00:54:34.100 --> 00:54:37.220]   That's going to be supported by trillions of dollars of earnings.
[00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:41.700]   But maybe those things only have a million or two million employees, but there's eight billion,
[00:54:41.700 --> 00:54:46.500]   eight odd people in the world. Well, the way you get the money into the government's coffers so that they
[00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:51.220]   can reallocate it to everybody that doesn't work at those thousand companies is through sensible
[00:54:51.220 --> 00:54:57.700]   tax policy that goes after the companies because those companies will still do the job. It's not
[00:54:57.700 --> 00:55:02.980]   like you're going to choose to not work at a world-beating startup in a mission that you care
[00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:08.820]   about because of the corporate tax rate. Nobody's going to do that. I think this is where if you
[00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:14.740]   actually take a step back and think of the bigger picture, the answer is right in front of us. We
[00:55:14.740 --> 00:55:16.420]   just choose not to listen. This is why
[00:55:16.420 --> 00:55:23.220]   again, what Trump did was stupid. He focused on corporate tax policy, cutting it unnecessarily.
[00:55:23.220 --> 00:55:27.780]   Now what we're doing is we're fighting over tax policy. Part of the reason why this bill
[00:55:27.780 --> 00:55:30.900]   isn't going to get passed is because of corporate tax policy and trying to raise it again.
[00:55:30.900 --> 00:55:36.900]   Really, what we should do is actually raise it, leave personal rates roughly where they are. Elon
[00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:43.060]   even said when asked by Kara Swisher this week, he's like, "I pay 53% taxes. What about you?"
[00:55:43.060 --> 00:55:45.380]   Yeah. It's going to 57%.
[00:55:46.340 --> 00:55:49.060]   53%, 57%, 61%. Who cares?
[00:55:49.060 --> 00:55:50.660]   Sure. Whatever. It's all the same.
[00:55:50.660 --> 00:55:54.420]   He has to... The point he made was, listen, the ProPublica article was
[00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:59.940]   really disingenuous. They said he got a tax refund and they never explained,
[00:55:59.940 --> 00:56:05.220]   "Well, that's because he overpaid his taxes massively the year before." They're selectively
[00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:10.900]   pulling information. The fact is he said, "I will be the first money into SpaceX and Tesla.
[00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:16.260]   I'll be the last money out." That is something we want more founders to do, which is
[00:56:16.260 --> 00:56:19.540]   never sell their shares and have more skin in the game.
[00:56:19.540 --> 00:56:24.900]   Sorry. I'm sorry. I disagree with that. I think that that's a bunch of fucking malarkey.
[00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:25.620]   Why?
[00:56:25.620 --> 00:56:28.500]   If you choose to not sell, so be it.
[00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:29.220]   Okay.
[00:56:29.220 --> 00:56:33.460]   But look at the good that Bill Gates has done by selling down Microsoft.
[00:56:33.460 --> 00:56:35.620]   Well, I mean, yeah.
[00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:38.900]   COVAX shouldn't exist. The Bill Gates Foundation shouldn't exist.
[00:56:38.900 --> 00:56:39.380]   No, no, no, no.
[00:56:39.380 --> 00:56:42.100]   All the reproductive protection. It had to be paid somehow.
[00:56:42.100 --> 00:56:44.980]   He did that when he hit 60 years old. I'm sure when other-
[00:56:44.980 --> 00:56:46.180]   No. No.
[00:56:46.180 --> 00:56:48.660]   He started to do it when he was 40 years old, Jason.
[00:56:48.660 --> 00:56:53.940]   Elon sold PayPal and he was able to use that money to reinvest in Tesla and SpaceX.
[00:56:53.940 --> 00:56:59.620]   I think Elon's putting all the money back into two companies that are solving two major issues
[00:56:59.620 --> 00:57:00.100]   for humanity.
[00:57:00.100 --> 00:57:02.660]   But he wouldn't have been able to do that if he hadn't sold in the first place.
[00:57:02.660 --> 00:57:08.580]   Exactly. My point is, let's not conflate the problem. If you generate wealth,
[00:57:08.580 --> 00:57:16.100]   I think that you should be bound, morally bound by society to put the money back to work.
[00:57:16.100 --> 00:57:20.420]   He chooses to put the money back to work by reinvesting so aggressively into the things
[00:57:20.420 --> 00:57:21.860]   that he's doing. That's laudable.
[00:57:21.860 --> 00:57:24.260]   Yeah, I think that's virtuous. Yeah.
[00:57:24.260 --> 00:57:27.460]   I agree. But it's not the only way. Bill Gates took a different path,
[00:57:27.460 --> 00:57:32.020]   which is to basically take all those profits, sell it down, to then be able to go and put it
[00:57:32.020 --> 00:57:36.180]   into the Gates Foundation. People will take multiple paths. The point that's the same among
[00:57:36.180 --> 00:57:40.180]   all these people is there's a moral obligation they feel to do the right thing for the future.
[00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:41.460]   Agreed. Then we're in agreement.
[00:57:41.460 --> 00:57:45.220]   Let's just celebrate that, not some tactical thing about buying and selling stock.
[00:57:45.220 --> 00:57:46.020]   By the way, one other-
[00:57:46.020 --> 00:57:52.260]   One other point I'd make, Chamath. You said that we should tax the wealth creation and distribute
[00:57:52.260 --> 00:57:57.460]   it. There's another way to get that redistribution of wealth, which is to enable access to the
[00:57:57.460 --> 00:58:03.300]   investments earlier by public pension funds, by the endowments, by the places where people,
[00:58:03.300 --> 00:58:09.300]   by the retirement funds, where a broader swath of the population have savings sitting.
[00:58:09.300 --> 00:58:11.380]   Change the accreditation laws.
[00:58:11.380 --> 00:58:15.940]   We've historically forced the narrative that everyone in the United States needs to have a home
[00:58:15.940 --> 00:58:19.780]   and have 80, 90% of their wealth tied up in a piece of real estate. Then we end up with these
[00:58:19.780 --> 00:58:25.380]   massive inflationary bubbles to keep that book value growing for them. The reality is if that
[00:58:25.380 --> 00:58:30.580]   money was put more productively into building businesses via retirement funds that had access
[00:58:30.580 --> 00:58:34.900]   to venture capital, the public pension funds already do, but they probably under-allocate
[00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:37.700]   to venture capital today relative to where they're putting their overall funds.
[00:58:37.700 --> 00:58:39.460]   We talked about the endowments are crushing it.
[00:58:39.460 --> 00:58:40.020]   Look at the returns.
[00:58:40.020 --> 00:58:42.900]   That's another way. By the way, if that was the model, you wouldn't need to tax.
[00:58:42.900 --> 00:58:45.860]   Well, by the way, one of the brilliant provisions in this,
[00:58:45.860 --> 00:58:50.660]   reconciliation bill is they're actually disallowing retirement funds to invest in
[00:58:50.660 --> 00:58:55.220]   alternative assets, including startups and venture capital funds.
[00:58:55.220 --> 00:58:58.740]   Insane. That is so wrong. So frigging wrong.
[00:58:58.740 --> 00:58:58.980]   Yeah.
[00:58:58.980 --> 00:59:00.100]   What?
[00:59:00.100 --> 00:59:00.740]   That's in there.
[00:59:00.740 --> 00:59:07.460]   They literally are taking pension funds and saying, you can't have access to them.
[00:59:07.460 --> 00:59:15.780]   You as an individual through a 401k or IRA cannot invest in alternative assets.
[00:59:15.780 --> 00:59:17.460]   Yes, partly in response to that.
[00:59:17.460 --> 00:59:20.740]   Well, they should just make it a cap. Don't you think they should cap Peter Thiel's
[00:59:20.740 --> 00:59:23.620]   massive gain?
[00:59:23.620 --> 00:59:25.940]   Why? Why cap anything? Who's to say?
[00:59:25.940 --> 00:59:30.020]   Well, because it was against the spirit of it. The spirit of the Roth was, let's discuss this
[00:59:30.020 --> 00:59:35.380]   as a specific issue. I'll tee it up for you, Sax. Peter Thiel put his Facebook stock in his Roth.
[00:59:35.380 --> 00:59:40.420]   And yeah, you're supposed to get that tax free so you can have a great retirement.
[00:59:40.420 --> 00:59:45.460]   He did that as an end run around paying taxes on the Facebook investment that became worth billions
[00:59:45.460 --> 00:59:50.340]   of dollars reportedly. So now they're saying you can have a Roth, but anything above 50 billion,
[00:59:50.340 --> 00:59:54.580]   you got to pay tax on because the goal here isn't for you to use it as a shelter
[00:59:54.580 --> 00:59:58.420]   against some massive venture gains, Sax.
[00:59:58.420 --> 01:00:04.340]   I don't have a huge problem with them putting a cap on the benefit of these accounts. However,
[01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:09.060]   my issue with what's in the bill, there's a couple of issues. One is like we said, they're disallowing
[01:00:09.060 --> 01:00:13.620]   investments and alternatives, which I just think is bad for savers. Why would you want to do that?
[01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:14.100]   Terrible.
[01:00:14.100 --> 01:00:14.500]   Second,
[01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:14.820]   Super.
[01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:15.380]   Yeah.
[01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:16.420]   I mean, I think it's a good point. I think it's a good point. I think it's a good point,
[01:00:16.420 --> 01:00:19.780]   because it's just a matter of what happens when you exceed the cap. And right now what they're
[01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:26.500]   saying is you have to distribute out all of those funds and then subject them to immediate taxation
[01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:31.620]   at ordinary income rates, which is confiscatory because you could have made the investment
[01:00:31.620 --> 01:00:36.420]   outside the retirement account and paid long term cap gains rates.
[01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:38.900]   If you do go over, it should be long term tax, of course.
[01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:42.420]   Yeah. And furthermore, it's even worse than that, because what they're saying is,
[01:00:42.420 --> 01:00:44.260]   let's say that you do have an alternative.
[01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:50.100]   Like an investment in a startup or a venture fund, you have to distribute it out and pay tax on that,
[01:00:50.100 --> 01:00:52.260]   even though that investment is not liquid.
[01:00:52.260 --> 01:00:55.780]   Right. So you should be able to take it out and just be treated normal cap gains
[01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:57.700]   and not have to liquidate it. Do you think?
[01:00:57.700 --> 01:01:01.380]   Well, what it's going to do is it's going to get it's going to give people an incentive. It's going
[01:01:01.380 --> 01:01:05.220]   to warp the incentives for saving because what it's going to say to people is you want to do well,
[01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:06.420]   but not too well.
[01:01:06.420 --> 01:01:06.580]   Right.
[01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:09.860]   Because if you hit the cap, you're now subject to a confiscation.
[01:01:09.860 --> 01:01:11.220]   You get penalized. Yes, it should be.
[01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:14.980]   So it shouldn't be a penalty. Yeah, exactly. I think the way to work is,
[01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:19.700]   you have a cap at any distribution above that, you basically that becomes the basis for future
[01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:20.260]   taxation.
[01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:23.940]   I think all of this can be summarized more simply, I think that we have,
[01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:31.220]   unfortunately gotten so confused, that we've decided to fix the finish line
[01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:36.100]   and stagger the starting line. Right? Because all of this still doesn't apply to rich people.
[01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:38.100]   No, this is vindictive against people.
[01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:41.460]   Rich people can do all of these different things. They can set up these
[01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:44.660]   out of state trust, they can set up generation skipping trust, they can be,
[01:01:44.660 --> 01:01:51.700]   you know, qualified investors, they can have QSBS deductions. And so what this will do,
[01:01:51.700 --> 01:01:59.140]   unfortunately, is entrenched the kind of wealth gains that Peter Thiel was able to generate in a
[01:01:59.140 --> 01:02:04.020]   very visible way that will just piss everybody off. And I think instead, you got to go back
[01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:11.540]   to a different litmus test. So, Jason, you have been the strongest advocate for
[01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:14.340]   letting people participate in the economy. I have always agreed.
[01:02:14.340 --> 01:02:19.620]   I've always agreed with that. We need to figure out how we can make sure that it isn't abused.
[01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:24.980]   But that's the best way is to educate folks about financial literacy so that they can actually be a
[01:02:24.980 --> 01:02:29.780]   part of it. Even the starting line, let everybody be able to put stuff into this stuff and learn
[01:02:29.780 --> 01:02:30.500]   about it.
[01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:33.620]   I mean, what Peter did essentially was put lottery tickets into his,
[01:02:33.620 --> 01:02:39.380]   you know, non tax retirement fund, lottery tickets being buying stocks in private companies early.
[01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:44.020]   But regular Americans aren't allowed to do that. So rather than retroactively try to
[01:02:44.020 --> 01:02:47.940]   penalize Peter because you disagree with his politics, or because he did it too well,
[01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:52.260]   I think it's better that everybody be allowed to be an accredited investor and do what Peter did,
[01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:57.060]   which is everybody should be able to take their 401k or their Roth and be able to buy
[01:02:57.060 --> 01:03:01.140]   the next LinkedIn Uber. So if you were a civilian and you took an Uber,
[01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:06.420]   or you use LinkedIn to hire somebody in year two, and you had an opportunity to buy those shares,
[01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:10.100]   you should be allowed to buy it because you're a human resources person or Uber driver and you
[01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:13.460]   realize this is a great service that will change the world. It doesn't take a genius to figure that
[01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:14.980]   out. Freebird?
[01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:20.820]   Yeah, look, I mean, the downside is you see speculative concentrated bets that white people
[01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:25.380]   out. That's the reason the protective provisions are in there. So I think there are probably
[01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:33.620]   sensible ways of managing that, you know, around, you know, qualifying, you know, pools of these
[01:03:33.620 --> 01:03:38.820]   investments in a way creating indexes against them, etc. And maybe that's the right way to
[01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:43.060]   provide access. But you know, giving individuals that maybe, you know,
[01:03:43.060 --> 01:03:48.020]   don't have the right kind of point of view on a particular investment, the ability to put all of
[01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:54.580]   their capital into that investment. Generally, I would say go for it. The problem is we've socialized,
[01:03:54.580 --> 01:04:01.540]   you know, protection, right? So and this is the same with healthcare. In a model for governing
[01:04:01.540 --> 01:04:06.340]   or model for a state where you provide socialized care for people through healthcare, socialized
[01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:11.940]   healthcare, or you provide socialized support for people through the Social Security system and
[01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:12.500]   other services like that.
[01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:17.860]   It's difficult to say, okay, the government's going to be your backstop, and it's going to
[01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:23.300]   provide the support for you. And we're also going to let you take risky behavior. And that's where I
[01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:27.540]   think the two have to go hand in hand. If you want to get rid of one, you got to get rid of the other.
[01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:32.660]   And so because otherwise, we all end up paying the cost of the person that takes the you know,
[01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:37.380]   outsized risk. And then we all end up having to foot the bill for that person taking that risk. So
[01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:40.740]   if we're all going to be there to protect that person, we have to tell them you can't take
[01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:41.540]   unnecessary risks.
[01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:41.940]   Okay.
[01:04:42.340 --> 01:04:50.980]   Okay, hey, Sax, let me ask you a conspiracy theory here. Peter Thiel supported Trump when
[01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:58.660]   Trump was teetering on the Access Hollywood tape, and he went to bat for him, he gave him a big
[01:04:58.660 --> 01:05:03.460]   donation at that time, then obviously did the Republican National Convention, and was a key
[01:05:03.460 --> 01:05:11.380]   intellectual influencer in his election plan. Now the Democrats are in and suddenly the focus,
[01:05:11.380 --> 01:05:18.100]   focus becomes this one outsized Roth IRA, and we're going to rewrite the law so that Peter Thiel has to
[01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:24.820]   take $5 billion or so is one of the estimates that I saw online on CNBC out of his IRA. Do you think
[01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:32.340]   this is specific vindictiveness on the part of the Democrats to try to attack? Specifically, Peter
[01:05:32.340 --> 01:05:34.580]   Thiel? I know he's your bestie. Well, yeah, I mean,
[01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:38.420]   it does feel and I'm not I'm not a Peter Thiel apologist, but this feels vindictive and personal.
[01:05:38.420 --> 01:05:38.820]   So yes and no. Okay, so Peter Thiel is a vindictive Democrat.
[01:05:38.820 --> 01:05:38.980]   So yes and no. Okay, so I'm not a Peter Thiel apologist, but this feels vindictive and personal.
[01:05:38.980 --> 01:05:39.060]   So yes and no. Okay, so Peter Thiel is a vindictive Democrat.
[01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:39.300]   So yes and no. Okay, so Peter Thiel is a vindictive Democrat.
[01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:44.820]   So yes and no. Okay, so what I would say is there have been proposals over the last I think going
[01:05:44.820 --> 01:05:51.780]   back to maybe even 2014 on providing some restrictions or caps on, you know, these,
[01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:57.300]   these IRAs and the Roth IRAs. However, there's never been a proposal as punitive
[01:05:57.300 --> 01:06:02.340]   and retroactive and confiscatory. That's what they're doing here. And specifically,
[01:06:02.340 --> 01:06:07.700]   it's the fact that they're going to force Peter to distribute out everything above the cap,
[01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:08.740]   and then tax the rest of the money. And so, Peter, I think, you know,
[01:06:08.740 --> 01:06:09.700]   is going to be a very good candidate for the cap. So I think Peter Thiel is a vindictive Democrat.
[01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:10.660]   So yes and no. Okay, so what I would say is there have been proposals over the last I think going
[01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:10.660]   back to maybe even 2014 on providing some restrictions or caps on, you know, these IRAs and
[01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:10.820]   retroactive and confiscatory. That's what they're doing here. And specifically, it's the fact that
[01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:16.900]   that's just changing the rules. That part I think is directed at Peter and I've actually heard
[01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:21.860]   that staffers on Capitol Hill are calling this the Peter Thiel provision. So let me just confirm
[01:06:21.860 --> 01:06:27.780]   that part for you. So what I would say is I think there is a sensible way to provide some
[01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:32.900]   restrictions on these retirement accounts, but the way they're doing it is so punitive. I think
[01:06:32.900 --> 01:06:38.500]   it is motivated by political revenge against Peter Chamath, what do we think of the number of, you
[01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:42.340]   know, unicorns being created in the private markets, obviously, when a company hits unicorn
[01:06:42.340 --> 01:06:46.900]   status, I think they're going to start buzzing around and maybe knocking on your door and SPACs
[01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:51.540]   and boards might start thinking about that. These companies sometimes have $10 million,
[01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:56.660]   $30 million in revenue, 50 million in revenue, and they're becoming worth a billion dollars.
[01:06:56.660 --> 01:07:01.060]   Do these valuations make sense writ large? And are you concerned that this is a bubble?
[01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:03.540]   I don't think there's a bubble.
[01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:07.140]   Okay. Explain why there's not a bubble in early stage private companies.
[01:07:08.260 --> 01:07:12.500]   I think it's because of what we just talked about, which is that these companies,
[01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:18.820]   by and large, are growing at incredibly fast rates, and they are replacing legacy
[01:07:18.820 --> 01:07:26.500]   incumbents that are growing very slowly or not at all, who have basically won for a long time
[01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:33.060]   with inferior products. And so as these superior products with more nimble organizations get
[01:07:33.060 --> 01:07:38.020]   capitalized to go to market, they're just going to win. And so I think what we're seeing is a whole
[01:07:38.020 --> 01:07:44.020]   sale replacement of the economy from the old to the new. And so that's why these companies will
[01:07:44.020 --> 01:07:51.220]   do well. And I think it's going to be a really powerful force in the world because the world
[01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:57.300]   should be a little bit more efficient and fairer when you have all this modern technology working
[01:07:57.300 --> 01:08:02.660]   on your behalf. So I'm a real supporter of all of this. I think there's going to be even more.
[01:08:02.660 --> 01:08:07.780]   And I think the thing that we have to be comfortable with is whenever something goes from a
[01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:12.740]   fringe thing, which is what venture capital was, Jason, when all of us were first in Silicon Valley
[01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:20.660]   20 years ago, to today in 2021, we're sitting here, this is going to become a fundamental part
[01:08:20.660 --> 01:08:26.740]   of the economy. And when that happens, there'll be more and more money. The returns won't be as
[01:08:26.740 --> 01:08:31.060]   good. That'll be okay, but there'll be a lot of progress. And so we're going through the
[01:08:31.060 --> 01:08:37.540]   same transition that private equity did in the '80s and '90s, that hedge funds went through the
[01:08:37.540 --> 01:08:40.580]   same transition. And so we're going to see a lot of growth in the future. And I think that's
[01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:41.140]   going to be a big part of the economy. And I think that's going to be a big part of the economy.
[01:08:41.140 --> 01:08:45.940]   The kid from Lightspeed, a bunch of other folks, obviously our friend Bill Gurley is stepping back.
[01:08:45.940 --> 01:08:47.780]   The kid. Why do you call people kids?
[01:08:47.780 --> 01:08:48.420]   Jeremy Liu.
[01:08:48.420 --> 01:08:50.500]   He's 50. He's 50. Yeah, that kid from-
[01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:53.860]   Wait, am I doing something wrong here? I'm busy creating a venture firm at
[01:08:53.860 --> 01:08:55.860]   age almost 50 and all these people are-
[01:08:55.860 --> 01:08:58.500]   You're on the wrong side of this distribution curve, Sachs.
[01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:00.820]   What are we thinks behind this? They just made too much money in their-
[01:09:00.820 --> 01:09:02.020]   They made a ton of money.
[01:09:02.020 --> 01:09:04.500]   Or is it because it's too competitive now and it's too hard?
[01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:05.780]   They're moving to Wyoming.
[01:09:05.780 --> 01:09:07.300]   I would say it's slightly different.
[01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:13.460]   I don't know. I mean, I know all of those guys, but I don't know what their motivation is. But
[01:09:13.460 --> 01:09:20.500]   what I would say is I tend to think that the mindset of venture has a relatively short half
[01:09:20.500 --> 01:09:28.420]   life. And I think it's about 15 years. And I think that there is a... And because company building is
[01:09:28.420 --> 01:09:34.180]   roughly a 10-year arc, like when you get into something early. And so I think that there is
[01:09:34.180 --> 01:09:37.060]   like a newness whenever you start. I don't think it matters what your
[01:09:37.060 --> 01:09:48.580]   age is. And then there is this sort of like death march that sets in by year eight or nine.
[01:09:48.580 --> 01:09:54.660]   And then you try to see it through to returning the capital and making sure all the employees and
[01:09:54.660 --> 01:10:01.220]   founders you've been invested with land the ship. And I think what these guys did was get to that
[01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:06.820]   place and say, "Okay, I've had this 15-year beautiful arc. Do I want to do another 15-year arc?"
[01:10:06.820 --> 01:10:13.060]   And for a lot of people, it won't make much sense. And then also, I think your patience to do it goes
[01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:16.980]   away, right? Because it's like, you guys know what it is. We all know what it's like.
[01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:17.060]   It's exhausting. It's grinding.
[01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:22.340]   It is exhausting. It's exhausting. The amount of drama I'm dealing with right now in my portfolio
[01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:27.860]   is bonkers. I don't know if you're seeing this, Sax, but the amount of shenanigans,
[01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:32.900]   bad behavior, fraud, lying, backstabbing is at an all-time high.
[01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:34.740]   That would be your portfolio, J.K. Yeah.
[01:10:34.740 --> 01:10:36.580]   No, it's like, no, no. It's literally, you're going to get a lot of money. It's literally, you're
[01:10:36.580 --> 01:10:38.580]   going to get a lot of money. It's literally three companies. I'm literally dealing with
[01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:44.740]   three companies with drama out of 350. I think one out of 100 is probably fine. But I am seeing
[01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:47.460]   all kinds of shenanigans. Even in the diligence phase, I'm seeing a ton of bad behavior.
[01:10:47.460 --> 01:10:50.820]   No, Jason, I meant something more tactical, which is like, for example,
[01:10:50.820 --> 01:10:56.740]   yesterday, we're starting something really ambitious in batteries. And I have to sit
[01:10:56.740 --> 01:11:00.740]   there for an hour, and we have to go through ordering the equipment, setting up the lab,
[01:11:00.740 --> 01:11:01.380]   getting the-
[01:11:01.380 --> 01:11:02.580]   Human resources.
[01:11:02.580 --> 01:11:06.340]   And there's only so much of that that you have the energy to do after
[01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:11.780]   a certain amount of time. It's important work. You have to do it right, but it feels
[01:11:11.780 --> 01:11:18.500]   a little low leverage. Now, for that CEO, it's everything. And so you have to be on top of your
[01:11:18.500 --> 01:11:24.580]   game to help that person. And I think this is where I appreciate their honesty in basically
[01:11:24.580 --> 01:11:31.460]   saying, "Guys, I don't have that level of detailed focus in me anymore." And that's important because
[01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:34.180]   in a next generation of folks who want to put in that 15-year journey-
[01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:36.100]   You need somebody committed. You need somebody who's
[01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:37.140]   super committed.
[01:11:37.140 --> 01:11:42.980]   Yeah. And I do think there's a difference between being a partner in a large partnership where you
[01:11:42.980 --> 01:11:47.540]   kind of have your portfolio of companies and, to Chamath's point, you're going to be on that
[01:11:47.540 --> 01:11:53.620]   arc with them. And then kind of building a firm from scratch where, quite frankly, I would go
[01:11:53.620 --> 01:11:58.820]   crazy the way that you're dealing with Jason and Chamath is saying, "I would get burned out if I
[01:11:58.820 --> 01:12:02.260]   didn't have a team." So we now have a pretty big team.
[01:12:02.260 --> 01:12:02.660]   How many?
[01:12:02.660 --> 01:12:05.860]   Well, just on the investment team, I think we've got about 15,000.
[01:12:05.860 --> 01:12:10.660]   15 people. And then we now have a bunch of operating partners. So we were looking at what
[01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:14.260]   Andreessen Horowitz has done with services. We had this big debate in the venture community for
[01:12:14.260 --> 01:12:20.820]   a long time about whether venture firms should offer services and operating partners. And Andreessen
[01:12:20.820 --> 01:12:24.980]   went hog wild with that. They've got like 200 people doing it. And I think they've proven that
[01:12:24.980 --> 01:12:29.860]   it works in the sense... It's not totally clear how much value they're delivering, but it clearly
[01:12:29.860 --> 01:12:34.020]   works in the sense that founders would like the services if they can get them.
[01:12:34.020 --> 01:12:35.620]   It creates marketing, but I mean,
[01:12:35.620 --> 01:12:37.620]   it's not necessarily a marketing strategy. It's great marketing.
[01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:40.740]   Because if you're a great founder, when you were a great founder, you wouldn't want Andreessen
[01:12:40.740 --> 01:12:44.580]   Horowitz telling you how to run your HR and doing your marketing for you at Yammer.
[01:12:44.580 --> 01:12:51.140]   Right. But so what we've done is focus on bringing on not 200 people, but an expert in every
[01:12:51.140 --> 01:12:55.860]   functional area that a SaaS company might need. Because you do want access to an expert when
[01:12:55.860 --> 01:12:59.780]   you're setting up the department, you want to go talk to the digital marketing person or the legal
[01:12:59.780 --> 01:13:05.380]   person or, you know, we have an executive briefing center now. So we do believe that there is a
[01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:09.060]   version of the services model that makes a lot of sense. And we are building that. If I had to do all
[01:13:09.060 --> 01:13:14.100]   of that value add myself, yeah, I would burn out. Yeah. I mean, I think it's a very good point.
[01:13:14.100 --> 01:13:19.620]   I literally last week launched the syndicate.com/saas, a SaaS syndicate, just for the same
[01:13:19.620 --> 01:13:24.820]   reason. So I can build a group of individuals who are focused just on that and who have that domain
[01:13:24.820 --> 01:13:32.260]   expertise. But the great founders do not want you up in their business. So I'm concerned with like...
[01:13:32.260 --> 01:13:35.140]   That's why we have like kind of, we call it a teach them how to fish model.
[01:13:35.140 --> 01:13:39.140]   Yes. Exactly. Where we don't want to do the work, we want to give them an expert as a resource
[01:13:39.140 --> 01:13:41.700]   who can meet with them, show them some best practices and then they...
[01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:44.980]   Do you have people though coming to you expecting you to do the work? Because that's what I
[01:13:44.980 --> 01:13:46.980]   have happen sometimes is they're like... No. Although...
[01:13:46.980 --> 01:13:48.500]   Can you find us a developer? And I'm like,
[01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:52.740]   no, but I can talk to you about finding developers, but I don't have a
[01:13:52.740 --> 01:13:54.340]   recruiter on staff. Do you have a recruiter on staff?
[01:13:54.340 --> 01:13:56.900]   Yeah, we actually do now. We have three recruiters on staff. So...
[01:13:56.900 --> 01:14:01.780]   So you're paying a half million dollars a year to recruit for your company. So that's a big advantage.
[01:14:01.780 --> 01:14:03.140]   Basically. Basically.
[01:14:03.140 --> 01:14:04.900]   That's a big advantage. Is it working? Are
[01:14:04.900 --> 01:14:07.620]   you actually landing developers? Yeah. I mean, look, we can't...
[01:14:07.620 --> 01:14:09.780]   Freeport and I don't give a fuck about any of this.
[01:14:09.780 --> 01:14:12.740]   All right. Well, anyway, this is us in the weeds. So you want to talk about some...
[01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:16.660]   Okay. Well, just to kind of up level it for a second. I just want to go back to this like
[01:14:16.660 --> 01:14:22.180]   golden era point when we're talking about venture capital, because look, obviously in the weeds,
[01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:26.660]   we're going to talk about our problems, but I really think that what's happening
[01:14:26.660 --> 01:14:30.820]   here with a thousand new unicorns being minted every year is just unbelievable.
[01:14:30.820 --> 01:14:34.660]   If you look at the number of billionaires in the US, I just Googled this,
[01:14:34.660 --> 01:14:39.780]   there were 614 billionaires in the US as of October 2020. Now there's probably more,
[01:14:39.780 --> 01:14:43.460]   I don't know, let's say there's a thousand. Well, if you're minting a thousand new unicorns every
[01:14:43.460 --> 01:14:45.700]   year, how many billionaires is that creating? I mean...
[01:14:45.700 --> 01:14:50.820]   And how many millionaires? More importantly, how many people who were making 50 to $250,000
[01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:54.340]   a year before they joined the ecosystem and now are worth millions will buy homes,
[01:14:54.340 --> 01:14:57.060]   hire people, start the next... But let me just give you guys the
[01:14:57.060 --> 01:15:01.380]   counterpoint to that, which I'm not necessarily arguing, but this is what I think the narrative
[01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:04.340]   is, which is that those businesses that are kind of, you know,
[01:15:04.340 --> 01:15:10.260]   accumulating wealth and accumulating revenue are effectively destroying the old economy and
[01:15:10.260 --> 01:15:13.460]   shutting down companies and shutting down jobs. Wait, there's 11 million job openings.
[01:15:13.460 --> 01:15:16.340]   That's bullshit. I don't believe it's a zero sum game.
[01:15:16.340 --> 01:15:18.500]   Yeah. I think it's creative
[01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:20.100]   destruction. But it's disruptive. It is disruptive,
[01:15:20.100 --> 01:15:24.500]   right? So there is kind of a temporal flux and there's a flux of people across from the old
[01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:28.820]   economy to the new economy. And it's that flux that I think creates the great uncertainty and
[01:15:28.820 --> 01:15:30.900]   the great heartache that everyone's trying to solve for.
[01:15:30.900 --> 01:15:32.020]   That's the hand-wringing. That's the hand-wringing framework.
[01:15:32.020 --> 01:15:34.020]   Guys, this is why it is so important to me.
[01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:38.100]   It's so important to get corporate taxation right. Because if you're going to replace
[01:15:38.100 --> 01:15:44.340]   GDP dollar for dollar, don't focus on the fewer employees that work there. Focus on the largest
[01:15:44.340 --> 01:15:48.740]   number possible, which is the revenue that these employees are helping to generate for these
[01:15:48.740 --> 01:15:53.460]   companies. So if you had much, much higher corporate taxation, you can play around with
[01:15:53.460 --> 01:15:58.020]   all the personal taxation you want. But if a lot of people do get shut out of the economy, you're
[01:15:58.020 --> 01:16:02.820]   not going to make nearly as much for the government as you would by taxing companies more.
[01:16:02.820 --> 01:16:03.700]   You know... Chamath,
[01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:09.700]   should there be a backstop? Because we know tax law is so sophisticated, and if you're intelligent,
[01:16:09.700 --> 01:16:13.460]   you could make it seem like you didn't make any money because you're investing, you're distributing,
[01:16:13.460 --> 01:16:17.940]   yada yada. Should there just be a, "Hey, listen, whatever you want to do with your taxes is fine,
[01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:24.740]   but X percent of your top line revenue is your base tax, and you cannot get around that."
[01:16:24.740 --> 01:16:28.740]   Should there be something like that? There's a couple things that this tax bill attempted to do,
[01:16:28.740 --> 01:16:33.380]   which could be really powerful if it does get passed. I think that corporations
[01:16:33.380 --> 01:16:38.500]   should pay a large tax. I think that they should be forced to spend a certain percentage on R&D,
[01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:43.540]   and I think they should be forced to spend a certain percentage on basically benefits
[01:16:43.540 --> 01:16:50.500]   for their employees. I think that would do a lot to level the playing field. Then I do think that
[01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:55.860]   you can have much higher individual taxation, but you need to make it simpler because there's too
[01:16:55.860 --> 01:17:01.940]   many easy ways, like that ProPublica article showed, for you to play games for individuals
[01:17:01.940 --> 01:17:03.060]   to not pay taxes.
[01:17:03.060 --> 01:17:08.340]   Yes. You've got to simplify all of this stuff because it's too complicated. If you're
[01:17:08.340 --> 01:17:13.220]   rich enough to hire a fleet of lawyers, you will work your way around it.
[01:17:13.220 --> 01:17:13.460]   Yes.
[01:17:13.460 --> 01:17:14.660]   Period.
[01:17:14.660 --> 01:17:21.220]   They repealed it as part of the… The AMT was for corporations was repealed as part of the
[01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:25.220]   Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, I think. I don't know where that stands,
[01:17:25.220 --> 01:17:27.380]   but it does seem like a lot of companies because of…
[01:17:27.380 --> 01:17:30.980]   I don't know how that makes sense, J. Cal. Some businesses run high margins,
[01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:32.740]   some are low margins, some are losing money, some are losing money.
[01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:33.540]   Some are over investing.
[01:17:33.540 --> 01:17:36.100]   No, it's complicated. I don't have the solution. That's why I'm sort of saying…
[01:17:36.100 --> 01:17:42.100]   I think one of the optics issues here is people are like, "That company didn't pay any taxes.
[01:17:42.100 --> 01:17:44.500]   That company sells this many iPhones. That company sells this many…"
[01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:48.020]   Yes, but I mean, that's because they're doing what tax laws were designed to do,
[01:17:48.020 --> 01:17:50.020]   which is to encourage investment.
[01:17:50.020 --> 01:17:52.420]   So how do you fix it? Give me a solution, Friedberg.
[01:17:52.420 --> 01:17:56.020]   I think that once businesses are mature and they start dividending cash and making
[01:17:56.020 --> 01:17:59.380]   distributions and they're profitable, that might be the time to tax them. I'm not sure that like…
[01:17:59.380 --> 01:18:02.420]   Why would they ever do that if they had an army of people saying, "Hey, you don't have
[01:18:02.420 --> 01:18:02.740]   to."
[01:18:02.740 --> 01:18:05.860]   You don't want to do it because if they're investing in growth, they're creating jobs
[01:18:05.860 --> 01:18:07.380]   and they're growing the economy. And that's what we want to do.
[01:18:07.380 --> 01:18:10.820]   Okay, so their status quo is fine. I don't think they're creating as many jobs as you think,
[01:18:10.820 --> 01:18:14.580]   but they are growing the economy. That's why you have to tax the corporation because that's
[01:18:14.580 --> 01:18:17.300]   the effective proxy for taxing GDP.
[01:18:17.300 --> 01:18:22.980]   Yeah. Look, I would be all about… Let me just… I'll wear my libertarian hat again for a second,
[01:18:22.980 --> 01:18:27.700]   but like I would be all about taxation if I felt like my dollars had a positive ROI where they
[01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:32.100]   ended up. And the problem right now is like government spending is set up in such a way that…
[01:18:32.100 --> 01:18:35.940]   That it's effectively been gamified and people extract capital from the government
[01:18:35.940 --> 01:18:40.260]   and my dollars are not getting a positive ROI for me or for society. I would rather have them sit
[01:18:40.260 --> 01:18:40.420]   somewhere else.
[01:18:40.420 --> 01:18:43.380]   Which is why you left… Let's be honest. That's why you left San Francisco. I mean,
[01:18:43.380 --> 01:18:44.500]   it's just they're spending more…
[01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:48.020]   That's not why I left San Francisco. I've got a family and I need a backyard. So,
[01:18:48.020 --> 01:18:48.740]   that's a little different.
[01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:50.500]   But isn't part of it that you are…
[01:18:50.500 --> 01:18:53.860]   San Francisco is a separate degree of incompetence, but yes, you're right.
[01:18:53.860 --> 01:18:56.740]   They're spending more than ever and it's getting worse.
[01:18:56.740 --> 01:19:00.260]   San Francisco is a whole another nightmare, J Cal. Well, I'm just speaking in general.
[01:19:00.260 --> 01:19:01.780]   Or California writ large.
[01:19:01.780 --> 01:19:05.860]   In general. Right now, whether it's the state level or the federal level,
[01:19:05.860 --> 01:19:10.580]   it feels to me and I think it feels to a lot of people that dollars aren't being spent in a way
[01:19:10.580 --> 01:19:15.460]   that's generating a return for the taxpayer. And I think we all feel that way. And I think that's
[01:19:15.460 --> 01:19:19.780]   what's frustrating. It's not about how much one's being taxed. It's about how are those tax dollars
[01:19:19.780 --> 01:19:24.660]   being spent? And are they being spent in a way that secures the future of our nation, of our
[01:19:24.660 --> 01:19:31.460]   people, of our livelihoods, etc. And giving everyone access to opportunity. What's happened is we've
[01:19:31.460 --> 01:19:37.220]   created things like student loan programs, and housing programs, and infrastructure programs
[01:19:37.220 --> 01:19:41.060]   that are literally just giving away money to private companies that are profiteering off
[01:19:41.060 --> 01:19:42.340]   of government spending. Right.
[01:19:42.340 --> 01:19:46.100]   And it's crony capitalism as our favorite professor Scott Galloway says.
[01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:51.780]   It's one thing I really do agree with him on. It is that there is this notion of crony capitalism
[01:19:51.780 --> 01:19:56.180]   where the United States and state governments and even local governments as seen in San Francisco,
[01:19:56.180 --> 01:20:00.180]   California, all the way up to the federal level, are spending money in a way that I think we all
[01:20:00.180 --> 01:20:00.480]   feel that it's a waste of time. And I think that's what's really important. And I think it's a waste of time.
[01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:00.980]   Yeah, I think it's a waste of time. And I think it's a waste of time. And I think it's a waste of time.
[01:20:00.980 --> 01:20:01.420]   And I think it's a waste of time. I think it's a waste of time.
[01:20:01.420 --> 01:20:06.780]   It's benefiting some disproportionately to most. Now, if there was a high degree of taxation,
[01:20:06.780 --> 01:20:10.660]   and everyone was benefited in a meaningful way, and those programs were well managed, and
[01:20:10.660 --> 01:20:15.420]   capital flowed meaningfully to support everything we want to support, great. I think everyone would
[01:20:15.420 --> 01:20:19.500]   raise their hand, raise two hands and say, tax the heck out of me. Let's make that happen. But that's
[01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:22.820]   not what happens. And I think that's the primary aversion to high taxation.
[01:20:22.820 --> 01:20:24.700]   Sachs, you got the final word?
[01:20:24.700 --> 01:20:29.500]   Yeah, I mean, look, what I'm worried about is taxes are going up big time, no matter what
[01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:30.160]   happens in Washington. I think that's the primary aversion to high taxation.
[01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:32.800]   Yeah, I think that's the primary aversion to high taxation. Spending is going up big time,
[01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:40.000]   we now have peacetime deficits that are the biggest that they've ever been. The national debt,
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:45.680]   the peacetime national debt is the highest it's ever been. We have a looming debt crisis in China,
[01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:47.360]   we have supply chain shortages.
[01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:48.560]   What could go wrong?
[01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:54.160]   I mean, you know, there's a lot of things here that could upset the apple cart. And what I'm
[01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:59.200]   afraid of is we're going to look back at this year, the 1000 unicorns being minted and say,
[01:20:59.200 --> 01:20:59.840]   that really was the
[01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:03.360]   golden era and everything happened. And after that, we really screwed up.
[01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:06.480]   Sachs, you sound like the old guy at Starbucks. It says that every generation
[01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:09.440]   and complains about the last generation, golden era, and it's all down.
[01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:10.640]   How much does music suck today?
[01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:12.080]   Normally, normally,
[01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:16.800]   I will say how impressive it is that 10 years ago, none of those unicorns existed. And it is
[01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:21.920]   likely the case that $3 trillion of value was created via private funding and private companies
[01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:26.000]   over the last 10 years. So all these entrepreneurs, all these employees, anyone working at
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:29.520]   these businesses, anyone involved in these businesses should be thrilled about the fact
[01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:33.280]   that you from zero created three and a half trillion dollars of value in 10 years.
[01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:34.560]   That's extraordinary.
[01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:39.120]   Yeah, I'm not trying to create nostalgia about the past. I'm talking about the present and trying to
[01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:42.160]   preserve it because I'm seeing some storm clouds on the horizon.
[01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:45.680]   Yeah, I would like to play the best song from Tony, Tony, Tony is really
[01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:45.840]   Yeah.
[01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:50.320]   Okay, everybody, we're heading out this one's for you London breed.
[01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:59.200]   State approved entertainment. You can take off your mask for this entertainment. It's so good.
[01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:02.000]   I need you guys watch Squid Game. Anybody watch Squid Game?
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.600]   No, we have lives.
[01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:06.000]   Nobody watched Squid Game.
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:09.520]   Okay, my kid my kids been talking about that. Should I be letting them watch Squid Game or
[01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:09.680]   is it?
[01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:12.960]   No, it's the most violent Korean horror dystopian.
[01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:16.720]   Show ever watched they're going to be scarred for life.
[01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:17.680]   Oh, I want to watch that.
[01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:22.880]   Hey, Sax, as a follow up, did you? Did you stop your kids from from TikTok?
[01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:24.240]   Did you take your kids off TikTok?
[01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:28.960]   They told Yeah, I went in there. I'm like, kids, what are you watching?
[01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:32.400]   I'll tell you in a second.
[01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:36.400]   Yeah, so did you take your kids off TikTok?
[01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:39.360]   Yeah, I went in there. I was like, kids, what are you watching? They're like,
[01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:40.480]   dad get the hell out of here.
[01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:41.040]   Yeah.
[01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:45.440]   He was like, okay, I'll be right back.
[01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:50.800]   If you can tell me to turn off by my name. I'll do it. David. See you later.
[01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:55.200]   The conversation was what do you want? I was watching on TikTok. I hear it's all
[01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:58.720]   sex and drugs. They're like, no, watching dance. Okay, go ahead. I trust you.
[01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:07.200]   The dance videos are literally like, absolutely sex and drug based every single one of them.
[01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:08.320]   It is so deviant.
[01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:11.600]   No, stop it is not that you're so exaggerating.
[01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:17.360]   I am so not exaggerating. Literally, the if you listen, take the most obscene lyric to
[01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:21.120]   obscene hook to any rap song. That's what trends.
[01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:26.000]   Oh my god, it's so true, guys. Every generation says the same about the next. It's unbelievable,
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:26.240]   right?
[01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:28.480]   No, but it is like explicit. Listen, whatever.
[01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:34.880]   I mean, like, you know, Pearl Jam. And you know, all the way back to the Beach Boys.
[01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:36.720]   They said it about Elvis and shaking his hips.
[01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:37.760]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:41.600]   Yeah. But I mean, no, this when I say it's explicit. It is literally explicit.
[01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:44.560]   You just don't get the youth J Cal. You don't understand them.
[01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:51.760]   I think I understand it a little bit too well. Anyway, do not you see you? Listen, I Oh, hey,
[01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:56.000]   guys, are we going to do the all in summit or not? I went to the code conference. And I was like,
[01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:57.760]   this was amazing to get back to.
[01:23:57.760 --> 01:23:58.240]   Yeah. You got to say something.
[01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:01.040]   You got to stop talking about ideas and actually just doing them.
[01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:04.240]   What are you talking about? We created this. I'm just trying to get by in Jason.
[01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:05.680]   Take a day to do it. Go.
[01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:09.040]   Let's do it. Okay. All right. I need your buy in. We have a voting system.
[01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:09.840]   You're rolling.
[01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:13.280]   Take a Miami. Miami. Miami. Okay. First year,
[01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:18.880]   Miami second year, Italy. Not Rome. All right, we'll do first year, Miami. Second year, Italy.
[01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:22.000]   Make it somewhat accessible.
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:22.880]   I think we do domestic.
[01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:27.440]   You have a cane so you can't get there. You old fucking bastard. So here's how it's gonna work.
[01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:32.720]   250 tickets, 200 for purchase, 50 for scholarship, all in summit,
[01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:35.360]   three days, Miami, Sax and I are off to the races.
[01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:39.280]   Why don't you make it more people, bro? Why do you have to keep it so exclusive? You're just so
[01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:46.400]   exclusive. I want to, what is it? I want to invert the top down hierarchy to what? I want to be a
[01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:49.120]   left wing authoritarian. What is it that I have to believe in?
[01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:51.600]   That is what you are, a left wing authoritarian.
[01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:57.200]   I'm like, listen, I just want to be rich and powerful. I don't care what party I am. I just want money and wealth.
[01:24:57.200 --> 01:24:58.560]   Money, status and power.
[01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:02.640]   Let me tell you, let me tell you why I like this idea is because to the points we're talking about
[01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:08.080]   with Coinbase earlier, we, you know, we have these conferences in the tech industry and they're
[01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:14.560]   frankly run by people who hate tech and the tech industry and people who are successful.
[01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:16.000]   They love the 7500 tickets.
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:21.120]   Right, exactly. And so the, I see these tech founders going up on these stages and subjecting
[01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:25.920]   themselves to these interrogations by people who hate them. And I'm like, what are they doing? Like,
[01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:26.800]   it makes no sense.
[01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:26.960]   Yeah.
[01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:30.800]   I'm putting up a form. I'm going to let people take deposits. I'm going to pick a month
[01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:33.920]   and we're going to go. How many people went to the conference guys you went to this week?
[01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:37.920]   Uh, I, the, uh, code conference, I think was probably three or 400 by design.
[01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:40.080]   Um, it was a third or half.
[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:41.360]   How much, how much were the tickets?
[01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:45.840]   I didn't actually buy a ticket cause I didn't want to be in the conference itself
[01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:49.600]   because I was concerned about a breakthrough virus, but I did host the poker game with Sky and Brooke
[01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:54.320]   tickets, I think are 8,000 for code. And I think Ted is up to 10 or 15.
[01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:55.760]   So maybe, so how much are we charging?
[01:25:55.760 --> 01:25:56.720]   Maybe like 25 million.
[01:25:56.720 --> 01:25:58.240]   $7,500.
[01:25:58.240 --> 01:26:00.720]   We're charging 7,500. So 200 tickets.
[01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:03.760]   And then 50 scholarships for people who wouldn't be able to afford it.
[01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:07.200]   So the gross revenue here is 1.5 million.
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:08.960]   And what's our cost going to be?
[01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:10.400]   Cost will be a million.
[01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:13.760]   So wait, so we're, so we're making profit on this deal?
[01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:14.800]   No, I'm making a profit.
[01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:15.600]   Cause I'm going to run it.
[01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:18.560]   I'm not, I'm not, I'm not.
[01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:21.920]   We spend, we spend what we make.
[01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:26.240]   I am buying the wine and you will shut the fuck up.
[01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:26.480]   I'm buying the wine and you will shut the fuck up.
[01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:29.520]   Okay. So then it's going to be, it's going to cost 2 million.
[01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:31.040]   So it's going to make 1.5.
[01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:31.360]   No, no, no, no.
[01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:34.080]   And if he's doing the wine, it's going to cost 2 million.
[01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:36.640]   I want, I want a wine budget so that everybody that comes
[01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:40.800]   is, it feels like they've had an exceptional food and beverage experience.
[01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:43.760]   Jamant is going to spend half a million dollars on wine. No joke.
[01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:46.080]   So then it has to be 10K a ticket, but you know what?
[01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:47.840]   The people who are coming can afford it. They don't care.
[01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:50.880]   We're not privileging you with some profiteering.
[01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:52.000]   I'm not profiteering off of it.
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:56.240]   Honestly, the reason I want to do it most is I want to play poker for three days and I want
[01:26:56.240 --> 01:27:01.680]   to have us, the four of us interview the most iconoclastic, interesting people.
[01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:05.600]   And I want to do it for the fans so that some number of fans get to come who wouldn't normally
[01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:09.520]   be able to come to a conference at this level. And I just think it would be a blast. It'd be
[01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:10.320]   fun to get together.
[01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:13.200]   Okay. Stop talking about it and do it. We're all okay. I'll do it. All right. I just want
[01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:17.920]   to make sure everybody's bought in. I mean, I'll set a date. Okay.
[01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:21.360]   Not, not the first week of February. Cause I think I have a,
[01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:26.000]   I'm thinking March, April, March, April, also not the third week of February. Cause I think I'm
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:32.400]   skiing in Europe. Can you just give us the dates you're not
[01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:35.440]   gallivanting around Europe and other places.
[01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:38.480]   Bro, I'm grinding every day here. You see what I'm doing? It's like,
[01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:42.320]   I know I'm working hard too. I mean, it's crazy right now. It's like the,
[01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:45.040]   I've never seen the market like this. I mean, it is bonkers.
[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:47.440]   What's that?
[01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:53.840]   Exactly. All right, everybody. We'll see you next time for the dictator Chamath Palihapitiya
[01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:55.760]   for the Rain Man, David Sachs and the queen
[01:27:55.760 --> 01:28:01.520]   of quinoa, David Freedberg. I'm J Cal and we'll see you on episode 50. Bye-bye.
[01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:04.480]   We'll let your winners ride.
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:07.360]   Rain Man, David Sachs.
[01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:10.320]   I'm going all in.
[01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:14.080]   And instead we open source it to the fans and they've just gone crazy with it.
[01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:14.960]   Love you, ESQ.
[01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:16.800]   I'm the queen of quinoa. I'm going all in.
[01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:25.520]   Let your winners ride. Let your winners ride. I'm going all in. Besties are gone. Gold 13.
[01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:27.520]   That's my dog taking a
[01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:28.080]   drive away.
[01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:29.280]   Wait, no, no.
[01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:31.680]   Oh, man.
[01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:33.120]   My avatars will meet me at
[01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:37.040]   We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they're all just
[01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:40.560]   useless. It's like this like sexual tension, but they just need to release them out.
[01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:43.280]   Wet your feet.
[01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:44.720]   Wet your feet.
[01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:45.280]   Your feet.
[01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:48.080]   We need to get merch.
[01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:48.560]   Besties are back.
[01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:50.320]   I'm going all in.
[01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:51.360]   What?
[01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:53.360]   What?
[01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:55.280]   What?
[01:28:55.280 --> 01:28:58.360]   I'm going all in
[01:28:58.360 --> 01:29:00.420]   you
