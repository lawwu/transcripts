[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.640]   Now we have reached the point in our study of the Epistle to the Romans where we are
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:14.640]   looking at the second half of the seventeenth verse in the eighth chapter, the eighth chapter
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:22.640]   of Paul's Epistle to the Romans, and in particular this evening, the second half of the seventeenth
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.640]   verse.
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.200]   "If so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together." The whole
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:39.360]   verse reads, "And if children, then heirs, heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ.
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:46.040]   If so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together."
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:54.160]   Now the apostle here does something which is very typical and characteristic of him.
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.960]   We have already seen in this little paragraph that we have been studying for so many weeks
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:06.880]   that each thought leads to another. You see, the whole verse starts, "If children, then
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.080]   heirs," and it is carrying on from what he had been saying in the sixteenth verse. And
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:20.160]   here again in this statement that we are looking at tonight, he does the same thing.
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:27.040]   Now it is very interesting to ask a question at this point. Why did the apostle, you think,
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:33.680]   suddenly introduce this particular thought? He has been talking about our sonship. That
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.440]   has been the theme from the beginning of the fourteenth verse. He has been rejoicing in
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:45.400]   the fact that we have not been given again a spirit of bondage, of fear, but a spirit
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:52.200]   of adoption whereby we cry, "Abba, Father." And indeed on top of that, the Spirit itself
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:59.640]   beareth witness with our spirits that we are the children of God. And not only that, because
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:07.280]   we are children, we are therefore heirs, heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ. He seems
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:16.720]   to be going up and up and up. Then suddenly he introduces this whole matter of suffering.
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.560]   If so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:29.920]   Now then, why did the apostle suddenly introduce this whole question of suffering? Here is
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:38.000]   a most important question to ask as it leads to a most important subject. Now there can
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.520]   be no difficulty about answering the question. The apostle undoubtedly introduced this matter
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:52.960]   here, first of all because he was a man who had a great pastoral heart. Never think of
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:59.360]   the apostle Paul as a kind of professor of theology. He was not. He was a profound theologian,
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.280]   but he was also an evangelist and a pastor. He was concerned about helping his people
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.320]   always and in everything. Nothing just academic about these men, never theoretical in his
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:18.520]   approach. Here was a man who had a great heart of love and was so anxious to help everybody.
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:24.000]   And here, of course, at once he foresaw a practical question, a practical difficulty
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:33.760]   arising. And the difficulty was this. Here is the apostle building up this extraordinary
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:41.000]   and elevated and moving picture of Christian people because of their relationship to God
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.160]   through the Lord Jesus Christ, talking about a great inheritance and the implications of
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:56.360]   that as we are joint heirs with Christ. This thrilling, wonderful picture. And then it
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:03.720]   is as if he suddenly thought to himself, "Well, I wonder how these people will react to that."
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:09.880]   Because their present position and circumstances is almost the exact opposite of that. They
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:15.040]   are having a hard time, they are suffering, they are in trouble, they are surrounded by
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.840]   distressing conditions. And it may very well be, said the apostle to himself, that they
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.200]   will say, "Oh, it's all very well for him to write like that, but this is how we find
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:31.240]   life." And therefore, in order to help them and in order to deal with such difficulties
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:40.080]   as they might arise in their hearts, the apostle takes up this subject. And of course, he just
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.800]   introduces it here in this second half of verse 17. And then he takes it up properly
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.840]   in the beginning of verse 18, and he goes on to deal with it right until the end of
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:57.440]   the chapter. That is the great theme in reality with which the apostle deals from this very
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.960]   point right away through to the end of the chapter.
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.640]   Now this was a very urgent problem in the early Church. There is a sense in which nearly
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:13.000]   all these New Testament epistles are concerned with this one thing. People were tempted to
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.840]   say, "Now we listened to the preaching, and we heard these great promises, these wonderful
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:24.320]   statements about the kingdom of God and what would happen to us if we believed the gospel."
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.800]   But they say, "Our actual experience is that life is very hard and very difficult
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.920]   and very trying." And the devil came in, of course, and tempted them at that point,
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.920]   and said, "Very well, didn't I tell you that you should never have believed it? It's
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:44.040]   a sort of fairy tale. It's just a kind of fantasy and fancy. There's no substance
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:49.800]   to it." "Why?" said the devil, "If God were God and if Christ Jesus was his Son,
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.700]   you wouldn't be like this." And so he took great advantage of this and tried to
[00:05:54.700 --> 00:06:00.560]   shake their faith. It was a very urgent problem in the early Church. Nearly all the epistles,
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:05.920]   I say, deal with it. And you'll find that it's been an urgent problem very often
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:12.000]   since then in the history of God's people. And it is at this moment, tonight, a very
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:19.120]   urgent problem for many, many Christian people in various parts of the world. This whole
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:26.720]   problem of suffering and how to reconcile it all to these exceeding great and precious
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:35.040]   promises, to this vista of glory which the apostle has just been painting for us.
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:41.440]   Now, it's a very important thing, therefore, that we should realize the place that this
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:47.920]   particular matter has in the New Testament teaching. It's very often forgotten. And
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:52.480]   there are many Christian people who are unhappy tonight, and have been unhappy because they've
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:58.240]   never understood this doctrine. The devil seems to attack many of us and get at most
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:03.680]   of us along this very point. We feel as if we're not being dealt with fairly, or we
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.920]   wonder whether we are Christians at all. We say, "If I am really a Christian, why is
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:13.400]   all this happening to me?" Well, it's the great theme, in a way, I say, of the New Testament.
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:18.200]   Take a book like the book of Revelation, the last book in the Bible. That is really its
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:26.720]   one great theme. It's its one great concern. The book of Revelation was written to encourage
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:32.680]   suffering Christian people at that time and at every other time. It's a book which is
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:38.760]   always up to date for that reason. Very well, then, there I think was the first
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:43.400]   reason which led the apostle to introduce this subject. But it isn't the only one,
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:49.800]   there's a second one. And that is that he still is continuing the matter that has already
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:08:01.040]   been occupying him. Here is a further way of being certain and sure of our salvation.
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:07.440]   This verse, 17 in other words, is one of those links, it's a kind of junction. It's carrying
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:13.880]   on the theme about sonship, and it is at the same time introducing this particular other
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:20.800]   matter. But the point I'm making is that this whole matter of suffering, if we understand
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:30.200]   it rightly, is one of the strongest and profoundest arguments for assurance of salvation and the
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:37.800]   absolute certainty of our ultimate arriving in glory that we can ever find. So the apostle
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:42.680]   is doing the two things at one and the same time. He's got a very practical object, and
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:49.880]   he's putting in, as it were, the final argument with regard to assurance and to certainty.
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:55.420]   Very well. Now, if that is what he's doing, let's see exactly what he says.
[00:08:55.420 --> 00:09:01.640]   The first point we have to deal with is one purely of mechanics. The translation is a
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:08.320]   little bit important. Here I'm reading this authorized version, "If so be that we suffer
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:20.360]   with him, that we may be also glorified together." "If so be." What does this mean? Now, here
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:30.280]   is something that is important for us. And it's a very important point. The whole exegesis,
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:39.040]   the whole interpretation, depends upon a right understanding of this "if so be." Now, I'm
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:46.040]   sorry to have to say this, but this New English Bible, as it's called, seems to me to be entirely
[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:54.320]   wrong at this point. This is how they put it. They say, "We are God's heirs and Christ's
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:10:04.240]   fellow heirs, if we share his sufferings now in order to share his splendor hereafter."
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:11.280]   Let's pass by the reduction of glory to splendor. Don't wait for that. But let's take up this
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:17.960]   other point, which is a much more important one. "We are God's heirs and Christ's fellow
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:28.520]   heirs, if we share his sufferings now in order to share his splendor hereafter." I may be
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:36.800]   misreading it, but I've tested myself as best I can. Their translation seems to me to suggest
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:44.400]   that our heirship and our joint heirship with Christ is conditional upon our suffering now
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:50.120]   in this present life. But that is not what the apostle meant. Well, what did he mean?
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:55.720]   Well, we've already got a key to the answer. Go back to verse 9. You read there, "But ye
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:11:02.800]   are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit. If so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you."
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:08.880]   Now if any men have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. The same word, "if so be."
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:14.560]   And of course we saw there that it can carry only one meaning. It means "since." And it
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:20.880]   means "since here." What he's saying, therefore, is this, "If children, then heirs, heirs of
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:29.400]   God and joint heirs of Christ, since we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together."
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:37.200]   So it should be translated as, not "if," but "since." Or, if you like, "if as is the
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:43.720]   fact." That's an equally good way of putting it. Or, if you prefer it, "seeing that."
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:49.680]   "Seeing that." "In view of the fact that." That's what it means. There's no element
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:56.680]   of doubt here at all. There's nothing conditional about this. The apostle is saying, "Now,
[00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:06.280]   as we are suffering with him now, we shall also experience the glory with him." It is
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:12.880]   something, as I want to try to show you, that is said in many, many places in the New Testament
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:18.520]   Scripture. In other words, we must get rid of any notion that our heirship of God and
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:24.280]   joint heirship with Christ is conditional upon our suffering here. It's almost the exact
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:29.000]   opposite of that. Very well, there is the first part of the translation, but we must
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:36.200]   also look at this word "that." "If so be that we suffer with him, that." And here,
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:45.680]   there seems to be general agreement that "that" means "in order that." "In order that we
[00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:55.440]   may be also glorified together." Very well, then. We can read our sentence like this,
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:13:01.560]   "If children, then, heirs, heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ, since we suffer with
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:10.680]   him in order that we may be glorified also together." Very well, what's the teaching?
[00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:16.240]   What is the doctrine? Well, there are two main doctrines here, obviously, are there
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:27.280]   not? The first is this. The suffering of Christian people, far from raising any doubts about
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:36.160]   the truth of the gospel promises or of their interests in the promises, rather should be
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:42.640]   seen as strengthening both the promises and our share in them. Now, the two things are
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:50.840]   important in this way. As I've already indicated, this is how the devil comes and tempts us.
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:56.720]   He says, "Ah, what's the value of those great promises in the gospels, in view of
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:04.240]   your state and condition?" He says, "It's one of two things. Either the gospel is full
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:11.040]   of lies and of false promises which are not materialized, it's either that, or else,
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:15.840]   if the promises are true, it's obvious that you are not a Christian. It's one or the
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:20.720]   other," says the devil, "and it may be both." Well, very well. Well, now then,
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:27.080]   here I'm laying down a proposition that, correctly understood, this statement tells
[00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:34.360]   us that suffering is far from raising either of those doubts or questions. Suffering, rather,
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:40.440]   is a proof of the truth of the promises, and it also establishes the fact that we've
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:45.160]   got a share in them. Now then, how does it do this? Well, let's
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:51.200]   divide the matter up like this. You notice the apostle has just been saying that we're
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:58.840]   not only heirs of God, but that we are giant heirs with Christ, which we interpreted as
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:04.920]   meaning this, that he is here, as he's done already in chapter 5 and elsewhere, reminding
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:13.240]   us of our union with Christ, our oneness with him, that we're in Christ and therefore
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:19.000]   sharers of everything that's true of him, buried with him in baptism, raised again with
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.080]   him, seated with him in the heavenly places. We're in him, he's the head and we're
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:29.560]   the body, and therefore we are sharers in the things that are pertained to him. Now
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:33.520]   that's the doctrine the apostle has been laying down. We are giant heirs with him because
[00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:39.120]   we are incorporated into him. All right. Now that applies to the suffering quite as much
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:45.120]   as it does to everything else. That's what he's really saying. So we can divide it
[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:52.400]   up like this. Look at the Lord himself. What was it that happened to him when he was in
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:16:00.280]   this world? Well, we know the answer, don't we? He was a man of sorrows and acquainted
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:11.680]   with grief. There is no record anywhere of our Lord having laughed aloud, not once. Man
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:19.840]   of sorrows and acquainted with grief. We hear of him weeping. We hear of him saying that
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:30.000]   his soul was troubled. He was despised. He was rejected of men. He was buffeted. He was
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:38.640]   hated. He was persecuted. No one has ever suffered as the Son of God suffered when he
[00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:45.680]   was in this life and in this world. That was his lot. Here he is, the eternal Son of God
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:53.480]   incarnate. Here he is, everlasting love in the likeness of sinful flesh, living his life
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:17:00.080]   as a man in this world. And read the record. Read your four Gospels. Think of it especially
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:05.160]   this time of the year when our thoughts go on to his death upon the cross and all that
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:08.960]   led up to it. Look at the picture. Well, there it is. It's summed up in there. He's a man
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:18.960]   of sorrows and he's acquainted with grief. His visage is marred. That is the picture.
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:26.320]   Now this is the key to the understanding of this doctrine, isn't it? That was the experience
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:33.600]   of the head of the church himself when he was in this life, in this world. He was one
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:42.280]   who suffered. The reason why he suffered, of course, is quite clear. He suffered because
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:47.400]   he was the Son of God, he says so repeatedly himself. Let me give you one illustration
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:54.880]   in John 5, verse 43. He says, "I am come in my Father's name, and he received me not.
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:18:01.040]   If another shall come in his own name, him he will receive." He turned to the people
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:04.600]   who were persecuting him and throwing stones at him and said, "For which good work are
[00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:11.200]   you doing this to me?" There was no answer. They couldn't give any answer. He suffered
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:19.520]   as he did because he was the Son of God. He keeps on saying that. The world, he says,
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:25.880]   recognizes its own and it likes its own. "But it hates me," he says. He said on one occasion
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:32.040]   to his followers, he said it to his brothers rather, that the world couldn't hate them
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:38.120]   as it hated him. Why? Well, because they belonged to the world and because he was not of the
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:45.240]   world. That's the explanation. He suffered in this life and in this world because this
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:50.600]   is a world that is evil. It's a world that is governed by the Prince of the Power of
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:55.560]   the Air, the Spirit that now ruleth in the children of disobedience. It's a world that
[00:18:55.560 --> 00:19:03.440]   is dominated by the God of this world. It is this present evil world as this apostle
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:08.320]   describes it in writing to the Galatians. And the result of that is, you see, that it
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:15.080]   hates God. It hates the Son. And the result is that when he came into the world, his own
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:22.040]   received him not. They cried away with him, crucified him. They didn't want him. Well,
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:28.880]   he's got his own word for it. This is the condemnation, that light has come into the
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:38.920]   world and men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds are evil. Why? Well, as
[00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:44.640]   he says, light is that which always exposes the hidden things of darkness. And the darkness
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:49.760]   doesn't like that. Nobody likes being found out, nobody likes being exposed, but light
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:54.680]   always does that. And he is the light of the world. And he exposed the hidden things of
[00:19:54.680 --> 00:20:02.440]   darkness and the darkness hated him. They loved darkness and hated the light, instead
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:10.440]   of loving the light and hating the darkness. Now this is the whole key to the understanding
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:15.400]   of so much that happens to us as Christian people in this world. That's what happened
[00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:23.480]   to him. And he says this is a rule. So I make my second point, that we've got some very
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:30.080]   clear and definite predictions by him as to what was going to happen to his own people.
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:36.520]   Now I read some of them to you just now in that fifteenth chapter of John's Gospel.
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:43.880]   Here are the statements. "If the world hate you, you know that it hated me before it hated
[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:48.920]   you. If you were of the world, the world would love his own. But because you are not of the
[00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:55.120]   world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. If the servant
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:59.920]   is not greater than his Lord, if they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you.
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:04.220]   If they have kept my saying, they will also keep yours. But these things will they do
[00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:14.080]   unto you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me." And so on. Now
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:22.120]   then there is a specific prediction and prophecy by our Lord himself, that Christian people,
[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:26.800]   because they are Christian, are going to suffer in this life. Indeed you've got it still more
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:36.560]   explicitly in John 16, 33. "These things have I spoken unto you, that in me ye might
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:49.040]   have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation, but be of good cheer. I have overcome the
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:56.840]   world." But now there it is. In the world ye shall have tribulation. He tells them that.
[00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:02.880]   They are to expect this. They can anticipate it for certain. It's going to happen. And
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:08.800]   you see the reason why it must happen is this, because they're his people. Like master, like
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:14.160]   servant, like head, like body. You can't belong to Christ without having the treatment that
[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:19.080]   he had. He said, "You can expect it. Don't be taken unawares. Don't be troubled. Don't
[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:25.520]   be upset. It's bound to happen to you, because you are my people. They'll treat you as they
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:31.880]   treated me." Now you see the argument is developing. Then let's go on after that and turn to the
[00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:37.120]   book of the Acts of the Apostles and see what did happen to his people in the light of this
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:44.360]   prophecy. And you get it almost at once. You'll find at the beginning of Acts 4 that Peter
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:49.600]   and John were arrested and tried before a court. Why? Well, simply because they'd been
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:53.960]   doing his work. They'd been preaching and teaching in the name of Jesus, and they'd
[00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:58.920]   healed a man at the beautiful gate of the temple saying, "In the name of Jesus Christ
[00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:06.320]   of Nazareth, rise up and walk." They're in trouble. They're arrested. And they're straightly
[00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:11.280]   threatened we are told. They were told that they would be set at liberty this time on
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:17.720]   condition that they never again preached or did anything in the name of this Jesus. You
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:21.400]   see it's already beginning to happen to them. They didn't do anybody any harm. They were
[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:25.560]   ignorant and unlettered men. They were not leading an insurrection. They were not gathering
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:30.120]   an army. They were doing nothing but talking about this Jesus and healing a lame man. But
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:35.280]   opposition arises, exactly as it had happened to him. You'll find at the beginning of the
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:39.960]   eighth chapter of Acts that we are told there was a great persecution of Christian people
[00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:45.880]   in Jerusalem, and they all had to leave the city apart from the apostles. Ordinary Christian
[00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:52.120]   people are being persecuted simply because they are the followers of Christ, people of
[00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:58.440]   the way. But then one of the most extraordinary and wonderful proofs of all I'm trying to
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:05.600]   say is found in the ninth chapter of that book of Acts, in connection with the call
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:13.360]   of Saul of Tarsus, this apostle Paul, on the road to Damascus. Do you remember it? Do you
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:24.400]   remember the first words he heard? "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?" Well, who
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:29.040]   was he persecuting? He was persecuting the Christian people. Yes, but our Lord puts it
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:36.840]   like that. "Why persecutest thou me?" In persecuting them, Paul was persecuting him.
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:42.080]   You see, the head and the body are one. They are indissolubly linked, so that he says,
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:48.760]   "Why persecutest thou me?" Here is the essence of this great doctrine. You go on
[00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:55.880]   to chapter 12, you find that James, the brother of the Lord, was put to death. They then proceeded
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:25:02.720]   to arrest Peter, and he is put into prison, bound to soldiers with chains, four quaternions
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:07.040]   of soldiers looking after him, intending after Easter to bring him forth and to put him to
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:13.080]   death. It's the same thing. And then, of course, you've got in Acts 14, 22, a very
[00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:17.360]   definite statement made about the apostle Paul. Listen to this. We are told that he
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:23.840]   went round the churches confirming the souls of the disciples and exalting them to continue
[00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:35.160]   in the faith, and that we must, through much tribulation, enter into the kingdom of God.
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:39.640]   The apostle was repeating the message of his master, that as Christian people you've
[00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:46.280]   got nothing to expect and to anticipate but much tribulation. And you enter into the final
[00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:54.560]   glory via, along the route of, much tribulation. There is further evidence in the book of the
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:59.440]   Acts of the Apostles. I simply pick that out almost at random in order to show you the
[00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:04.760]   teaching. But come along to the teaching of the epistles. And here you'll find this,
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:09.720]   I say, almost everywhere. I've selected certain passages. Take, for instance, what
[00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:18.240]   you've got in 2 Corinthians chapter 1, reading from verses 3 to 7. "Blessed be God, even
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:23.040]   the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and the God of all comfort, who
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:28.160]   comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in
[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:33.800]   trouble by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God. For as the sufferings
[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:42.560]   of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ. Whether we be afflicted,
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:46.920]   it is for you a consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:53.240]   same sufferings which we also suffer. Or whether we be comforted, it is for you a consolation
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:27:00.520]   and salvation. And our hope of you is steadfast, knowing that as ye are partakers of the sufferings,
[00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:08.040]   so shall ye be also of the consolation." You see, this man repeats his teaching, doesn't
[00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:13.400]   he? You've got it everywhere. It's in all the epistles. That's why I always say that
[00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:19.920]   if you really do study any one of these major epistles, you'll cover the whole of Christian
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:26.920]   doctrine. You see, you get it in these various passages. Go on in that same 2 Corinthians
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:33.800]   to chapter 4, 17 and 18. "Our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:39.120]   a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory, while we look not at the things which
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:44.240]   are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporal,
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:49.760]   but the things which are not seen are eternal." That's it again. Well, then when you go to
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:55.880]   chapter 11 of that 2 Corinthians, I'm not going to read it all. It's too long a passage.
[00:27:55.880 --> 00:28:02.880]   But there, beginning at verse 23, he really does tell them something about this. He says,
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:07.880]   "Are they ministers of Christ? I speak as a fool, I am more. In labors more abundant,
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:13.840]   in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft of the Jews, five
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:19.160]   times received I 40 stripes save one." And on and on and on he goes, giving a recital
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:26.040]   and a list of his sufferings and his trials and his tribulations. That was the sort of
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:34.780]   life this great apostle lived. Like master, like servant. So he teaches this. Then when
[00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:38.600]   you come on to the epistle to the Philippians, you've got a wonderful statement of all
[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:46.360]   this. Here's the apostle in prison. He says in verse 12, "I would that you should understand,
[00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:51.440]   children, that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:57.760]   of the gospel, so that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace and in all
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:03.040]   other places." He was in prison, threatened with death, doesn't know what's going to
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:07.920]   happen to him. In a difficult to decide which he wants, to stay or to go on, which is to
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:13.800]   be with Christ, which is far better. But there it is, he's suffering for the sake of Christ.
[00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:20.520]   And that leads him to say, explicit, in verses 28 and 29 of that first chapter of Philippians,
[00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:26.360]   "It shall be in nothing terrified by your adversaries, which is to them an evident token
[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:31.280]   of perdition, but to you of salvation and that of God." He says they think that because
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:35.880]   you're suffering like this, it's a sign of perdition. But he says to you it is a proof
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:43.160]   of your salvation and that of God. For, because, unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ
[00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:54.280]   not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake. That's it. That's the essence
[00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:59.360]   of this doctrine. And then you see you've got another statement of it, a very wonderful
[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:06.440]   one in the third chapter again, in the tenth verse. Indeed, you've really got much the
[00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:11.840]   same thing in the second chapter, in verse 17, "Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:16.400]   and service of your faith, I join and rejoice for you all." That's a way of saying, if
[00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:21.120]   I'm going to be put to death because of all this, it's all right. But here in Philippians
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:27.640]   3, 10, is this wonderful statement. This is his ambition, "That I may know him and the
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:36.040]   power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his suffering, being made conformable unto
[00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:42.640]   his death, if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection from among the dead."
[00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:47.680]   Leave that for a moment. Go on to Colossians. You've got it there in Colossians 1, 24.
[00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:53.360]   "Now rejoice in my sufferings for you." He's rejoicing in his sufferings for them.
[00:30:53.360 --> 00:31:00.280]   "And fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his
[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:09.200]   body's sake, which is the church." What a statement! I'll come back to that in a moment.
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:14.240]   But let's go on to complete this evidence. Go to 2 Thessalonians, the first chapter.
[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:20.680]   Look at verses 4 and 5. "So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God." Why?
[00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:27.160]   "Well, for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that you
[00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:33.840]   endure, which is a manifest token of righteous judgment of God, that you may be counted worthy
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:42.160]   of the kingdom of God, for which you also suffer." You can't get anything more explicit.
[00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:49.560]   But let me complete this evidence. Go to 2 Timothy, chapter 1. "God," he says in verse
[00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:53.800]   7, "hath not given us the spirit of fear, but of power, and of love, and of a sound
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:57.760]   mind." Timothy was always in trouble in this question of suffering, and the apostle
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:02.160]   deals with it. "God hath not given us the spirit of fear, but of power, and of love,
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:06.840]   and of a sound mind. Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor
[00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:14.280]   of me his prisoner; but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to
[00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:21.320]   the power of God." Then he goes on in the second chapter, in verse 12, to say this,
[00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:27.000]   "If we suffer, we shall also reign with him." You see, it's exactly what we've
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.440]   got in this seventeenth verse of this eighth chapter of Romans. It is a faithful saying,
[00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:35.800]   "If we be dead with him, we shall also live with him. If we suffer, we shall also
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:41.680]   reign with him." There it is. But if you want something as explicit as a thing can
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:47.640]   possibly be, go to the third chapter of that second epistle to Timothy and begin to read
[00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:54.720]   at verse 10, verses 10 to 12. "But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life,
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:33:02.360]   purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience, persecutions, afflictions, which came unto
[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:09.280]   me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured, but out of them all
[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:23.640]   the Lord delivered me; yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecutions."
[00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:28.680]   It's as explicit as the statement of our blessed Lord himself. The author of the epistle
[00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:33.400]   to the Hebrews is equally definite in the second chapter, in verse 10, "It became
[00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:38.560]   him for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory,
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:44.200]   to make the captain of their salvation perfect through suffering." What's the meaning
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:49.000]   of chapter 11 of the epistle to the Hebrews? It's just this. He says, "Look at all
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.940]   the great heroes of the faith, but look how they had to suffer. Look how they were maligned.
[00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:58.120]   Look how they were persecuted. Look how men treated them. Look how they were thrown into
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:03.560]   prison, sown asunder, attacked by lions, thrown to the lions." The whole of that
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:08.640]   glorious chapter is just to deal with this question of suffering. And it's exactly
[00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:13.640]   the same, of course, with the twelfth chapter, a portion of which I read at the beginning.
[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:17.400]   But you see, James is not to be left out. He is not to be outdone. They've all got
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:22.000]   this same teaching. So James starts off in the first chapter, "My brethren, count it
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:28.520]   all joy when you fall into divers temptations, trials, knowing this, that the trying of your
[00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:34.000]   faith worketh patience." Verse 12, he repeats it again. He says, "Blessed is the man
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:40.760]   that endureth trials." He's a blessed man. He's a man to be congratulated, as it
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:45.640]   were. But you see, Peter carries on with the same doctrine. Listen to him in his first
[00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:51.760]   epistle, first chapter, verses 6 and 7. He's talking about this blessed hope, wherein he
[00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:59.280]   greatly rejoiced, "Though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through
[00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:04.760]   many full temptations, that the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold
[00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:09.560]   that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and
[00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:16.920]   glory at the appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ." And then John, in the last book of all, in
[00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:22.680]   the book of Revelation, in the first chapter and in the ninth verse, this is what I read,
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:32.760]   "I, John, who also am your brother and companion in tribulation and in the kingdom
[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:40.960]   and patience of Jesus Christ." He's a brother and companion with them in tribulation.
[00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:45.880]   Very well, what does all this mean? Well, I've already given you the doctrine. It
[00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:57.720]   means this. Because we belong to him, this is what happens to us. It happened to him,
[00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:02.080]   it happens to his people. He prophesied it, it happened in the early church, it's been
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:08.640]   happening since. All the other teachers teach us exactly the same thing. The followers get
[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:15.680]   the same treatment as the head. There is this unity in Christ. We share the blessings, but
[00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:20.280]   we share the sufferings. It is the head and the body once more. Very well, then, this
[00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:30.480]   is the argument, you see. If you are suffering as a Christian, and because you're a Christian,
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:39.040]   it is one of the profoundest proofs you can ever have of the fact that you are a child
[00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:45.280]   of God. And if a child, then an heir, an heir of God and a joint heir with Christ. I mean,
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:50.360]   a man once wrote a phrase like this. I think it's a very wonderful one. It sums up everything
[00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:58.720]   that's said in this teaching. "All Christ's sheep are branded with a cross, and that not
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:09.760]   in the fleece only, but also in the flesh." All Christ's sheep are branded with a cross.
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:20.840]   It's burnt in by a hot iron, not only into the fleece, but also into the flesh. If you
[00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:28.960]   suffer as Christian, says Peter, in the fourth chapter of that first epistle of his, "Beloved,"
[00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:33.000]   he says, "think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:39.240]   some strange thing happened unto you, but rejoice inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's
[00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:44.720]   words, that when his glory shall be revealed, you may be glad also with exceeding joy. If
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:49.000]   you be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye, for the spirit of glory and
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:54.800]   of God resteth upon you. On their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:38:03.520]   glorified." There it is, I say, once more. And the argument is inevitable. If we are
[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:11.320]   suffering as Christians, it is an absolute proof that we belong to him, that we are therefore
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:16.680]   joint heirs with him. So you must look at your sufferings in that way. You mustn't
[00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:21.240]   let the devil frighten you and say the promises of God are not true, or if they are true,
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:25.800]   you are not a partaker. Turn round to him and say, "Thank you very much. You're
[00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:30.760]   not as clever as you thought you were. You know what I'm enduring is a proof to me
[00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:36.920]   that I'm a child of God. The world under your inspiration is treating me exactly as
[00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:42.720]   it treated him. If I belong to you, I shouldn't be having this treatment. Thank you. You're
[00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:45.880]   giving me a proof of the fact that I'm a Christian." You see, that's the way
[00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:50.840]   to deal with the devil. You resist him. You turn back the scriptures on him, and he has
[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:55.480]   nothing to say. He flees. Resist the devil and he'll flee from you. And thus thank
[00:38:55.480 --> 00:39:00.000]   him for having given you an additional proof of the fact that you're a child of God.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:05.280]   "Yea, and all that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution." So you
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:09.480]   don't begin to grumble and complain and say, "Why am I having a hard time like this?
[00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:13.760]   I believe the gospel, but everybody atones against me, and I'm suffering in the office
[00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:18.840]   ever since. Nothing seems to go right." Don't grumble and complain. Say, "Thank
[00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:23.640]   God. Count it all joy, my brethren. It's a proof of the fact that you're a child
[00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:29.880]   of God and an heir of God and a joint heir with Christ. Since we suffer with him, we
[00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:34.280]   shall also be glorified together." But there's a second part of this, as I hinted.
[00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:40.900]   There's more. "In order that, since we suffer with him, in order that we may be
[00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:48.840]   also glorified together." Now here is further teaching. And this is
[00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:55.520]   extraordinary teaching in the New Testament, but it's here everywhere. This suffering
[00:39:55.520 --> 00:40:04.400]   that we undergo as Christians is a part of our preparation for the glory that is coming
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:10.200]   for us. You see, it goes beyond what I've been saying. It's not only a proof in and
[00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:16.800]   of itself because we are suffering. No, no, it's further. This very suffering is a part
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:23.800]   of my preparation for the inheritance which I'm going to enjoy with the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:27.280]   You know, the author of the epistle to the Hebrews tells us in chapter 2 and chapter
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:35.400]   5 that our Lord himself was made perfect by his sufferings as our leader and as our mediator
[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:40.640]   and redeemer. It became him, you get in Hebrews 2.10, "of whom are all things and by whom
[00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:46.120]   are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation
[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:54.360]   perfect through suffering." The same is taught in chapter 5. He cried out with cryings and
[00:40:54.360 --> 00:41:01.520]   strong tears. He endured and he suffered. It was a part of his perfection as our mediator
[00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:11.520]   and redeemer. Very well. The teaching is that the same thing becomes true of us also. It
[00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:18.000]   was because he endured even the death of the cross that Paul says in Philippians 2.9 and
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:25.320]   10, "because of this that he was highly exalted and given a name that is above every
[00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:30.600]   name that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things
[00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:35.400]   in earth and things under the earth and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ
[00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:43.560]   is Lord to the glory of God the Father." Well now then, the same happens to us. You
[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:46.880]   see, when something really big and great is going to happen to you, you always prepare
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:54.680]   for it, don't you? You always have to. We're never prepared for the greatest privileges.
[00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:59.920]   We always have to go through some extra preparation. There's always hard work if you want to
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:04.800]   pass an examination. There's a lot of practice if you want to be perfect at any art. If you're
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:10.600]   going to some great interview, well, you're careful to be clean and well-dressed and shod
[00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:16.520]   and all the rest of it, and there are no spots nor blemishes. You're at your best. Of course.
[00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:23.040]   Multiply all that by infinity, and there is the glory of the inheritance. As we are, my
[00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:27.720]   friends, we are not ready for it. We are not fit for it. But thank God he's preparing
[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:34.600]   us for it, and it is he who is preparing us for it. So Paul, you see, argued, did you
[00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:40.840]   notice, in 2 Corinthians 4, 17, he says, "Our light affliction which is but for a moment
[00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:47.520]   worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory." And it includes that.
[00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:54.520]   It's a part of the preparation for the glory which is coming. Of course, it's the whole
[00:42:54.520 --> 00:43:00.560]   argument in 2 Corinthians 12, isn't it, about the thorn in the flesh. Why did he have the
[00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:04.800]   thorn in the flesh? He couldn't understand it at first. He prayed three times that it
[00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:10.040]   might be removed, but it wasn't. "My grace is sufficient for thee." "All right," says
[00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:16.640]   Paul, "I've got it at last. I understand it. I was in danger of becoming a bit inflated.
[00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:21.000]   I'd been doing such wonderful things. I was beginning to think I was an unusual and a
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:28.120]   remarkable man. I needed to be kept down a bit. When I am weak, then am I strong. This
[00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:32.800]   messenger of Satan was sent to buffet me for my goods," says the apostle. "I've been learning
[00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:37.280]   things here I'd never have known otherwise. It is good for me that I have been afflicted,"
[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:42.840]   says the psalmist. In Psalm 119, verse 72, the apostle was learning the meaning of the
[00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:49.440]   thorn in the flesh. He thanks God for it. It's preparing him. It's knocking off certain
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:54.840]   corners, getting rid of blemishes, preparing him for this absolute glory which is coming.
[00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:59.680]   That is why I think he said what he said in Philippians 3.10. This is his desire, "that
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:08.120]   I might know him and the power of his resurrection." Yes, and the fellowship of his suffering,
[00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:14.400]   being made conformable to his death. You learn things about the Lord Jesus Christ when you
[00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:20.640]   are suffering that you'd never know otherwise. We've all got to testify to that. We can look
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:25.880]   back and thank God for things that have gone against us. I thank God in this pulpit for
[00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:32.840]   times when God slammed doors in my face. I didn't like it at the time. I thank him now.
[00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:37.800]   It's when you're in trouble and distress and tribulation that you begin sometimes to realize
[00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:43.120]   the glory of these wonderful promises. You've got to be down before you can receive some
[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:48.480]   of the best blessings. It is the pauper who knows what to receive. The self-sufficient
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:52.360]   man, he doesn't need anything. Look at that Pharisee. He just thanks God he's not like
[00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:57.520]   others. He's not aware of needs and he doesn't receive supply. No, no, it is in this way
[00:44:57.520 --> 00:45:03.680]   that God manifests himself to us in some of the most tender manners and in some of the
[00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:10.040]   greatest glories of his love. Paul desires to know something of the fellowship of his
[00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:15.680]   sufferings to be made conformable unto his death. And then you noticed in Colossians
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:21.360]   1, 24, he says that he's making up in his own body that which remains of the suffering
[00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:26.000]   of Christ. I don't understand that fully. Nobody does. But it seems to me to be something
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:36.720]   like this. It is the apostles entering intimately into this union with the blessed head. And
[00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:41.080]   he says, "You know, I never knew what it was really to know the unity until I discovered
[00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:46.520]   it through my sufferings. I can see now that the head and the body are one, that these
[00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:53.240]   sufferings are part of his suffering. It passes through me. He suffers it all as the great
[00:45:53.240 --> 00:46:00.040]   head and I'm participating in this ministry of the sufferings of Christ, making up that
[00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:06.520]   which remains of the sufferings of Christ. And then, of course, you've got it absolutely
[00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:12.720]   explicitly in Hebrews 12, 10, haven't you? Here is the essence. He says, "These fathers
[00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:19.160]   of ours which punished us and chastised us, they did it for their own pleasure, but he
[00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:29.320]   for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness." May I use an almost ridiculous
[00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:37.320]   illustration? No child likes to be washed. But there's a little child, he's going to
[00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:42.880]   a party, and his mother washes him. She's particularly careful. And the child grumbles
[00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:46.560]   he doesn't want her to clear him out these hairs of his, and he doesn't want his neck
[00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:50.120]   to be clean. He objects to it all, but the mother insists upon it. He's going to the
[00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:55.560]   party and the honor of the family is involved. The child doesn't like it, but if done to
[00:46:55.560 --> 00:47:01.160]   him, it's for his good ultimately and for the final enjoyment. You know, God deals with
[00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:07.960]   us like that. We need to be washed, we need to be cleansed. And God's ambition for us
[00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:12.480]   is that we be absolutely perfect, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, faultless
[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:19.120]   and blameless, holy, glorified in his presence. And he's going to bring us to that. And in
[00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:22.800]   order to bring some of us to that, it isn't enough just that the gospel is preached to
[00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:27.000]   us. We won't listen to that. And we're too busy and we forget it. Well, he's got his
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:31.440]   other methods. He puts us on a sick bed. He gives us a disappointment. There's a loss.
[00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:36.800]   There's a setback. Doesn't matter. It's a part of his preparation of us for this great
[00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:42.340]   glory that's coming. That's why James says, "Count it all joy, my brethren, when these
[00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:47.520]   things happen to you." And that's what Peter says, isn't it, in that great statement that
[00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:54.800]   I read there in his first epistle, first chapter, verses 7 and 8, that the trial of your faith,
[00:47:54.800 --> 00:48:00.320]   listen, "being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with
[00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:06.240]   fire, might be found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ."
[00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:13.560]   There's a lot of alloy mixed up with the gold of your faith and mine. There's a lot of that
[00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:18.760]   mixture. There's a lot of extraneous matter. But nothing will pass before the heavenly
[00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:25.240]   examination but the pure, unadulterated gold. And how do you purify gold? Well, you put
[00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:30.640]   it in a crucible and you put a powerful flame underneath it. And everything is melted away
[00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:36.540]   and destroyed and nothing is left but the pure gold. Your faith being much more precious
[00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:41.960]   than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise
[00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:47.800]   and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ. Yes, the hymn we've just been singing
[00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:54.040]   was absolutely right. "When through fiery trials the pathway shall lie, His grace all
[00:48:54.040 --> 00:49:03.080]   sufficient shall be thy supply, the flame shall not hurt thee, His only design thy dross
[00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:17.920]   to consume, and thy gold to refine. Since we suffer with Him, we shall be also glorified
[00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:24.200]   together." The only man who needs to go from this service tonight in any kind of trouble
[00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:28.840]   is that man or that woman who thinks that he or she is a Christian but who knows nothing
[00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:37.280]   about this suffering for Christ's sake. If you are not in some shape or form suffering
[00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:43.680]   for Christ's sake, it needn't be being thrown into prison, it needn't be that you're thrown
[00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:48.880]   into a concentration camp, but as certainly as you're a Christian you'll have to suffer
[00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:54.840]   for it. If it's just to see people looking at one another when you enter the room, if
[00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:59.800]   it's just to see the snigger or the sneer, if it's just to hear the remarks that are
[00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:06.880]   made at your expense just because you're a Christian, that is suffering for Christ's
[00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:13.360]   sake. If you are doing things simply because you're a Christian and they lead to these
[00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:18.400]   kinds of troubles, you are suffering for Christ's sake. If you refuse to do certain things,
[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:22.040]   not so much because they're wrong in and of themselves, but because you feel they don't
[00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:28.760]   fit your position as being in Christ and suffer for it, you are suffering for Christ's sake.
[00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:35.640]   Yea, and all that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution. They always have
[00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:41.920]   done. If they've hated me, he says, they will hate you. And they do. The world tonight hates
[00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:48.520]   the Christian because he is like his Master and Lord, because he belongs to him, because
[00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:53.840]   they see in him what they saw in him. And they hated the light that was in him, and
[00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:58.760]   they hate the light that's in us. Very well then, if you are suffering as a Christian
[00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:06.360]   tonight and suffering for Christ's sake, I say, my brethren, rejoice. It's an absolute
[00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:15.920]   proof of the fact that you're in Christ. It's more. It is an absolute proof that God is
[00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:24.480]   preparing you for the glory that he has prepared for all who are in his Son, all who are his
[00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:34.000]   heirs and who are joint heirs with his only begotten beloved Son. Oh, thank God that the
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:42.200]   apostle added this bit. If children, then heirs, heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ,
[00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:52.960]   since we suffer with him, in order that we may be glorified together.
[00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:59.160]   Blessed is the man, the woman in this service, who is aware of the process of preparation.
[00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:03.960]   Are the corners being knocked off you? Do you know something about the chiseling? Are
[00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:09.480]   you being cleansed? Are the corners being cleansed and the parts that are sensitive?
[00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:14.160]   Are you being hurt and being cleansed? Do you know that God is dealing with you and
[00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:21.480]   handling you? Are you aware that as children he himself is preparing you for the great
[00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:33.760]   day, the glory which is coming? Happy are you if you are aware of that. Let us pray.
[00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:41.000]   Oh God, we thank thee for thy blessed word and its glorious truth. We thank thee that
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:46.200]   thou didst ever cause thy servants to write it that it may come to us. We see how easily
[00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:53.800]   we are misled by the devil, tempted at all points by him. And yet, O Lord, we thank thee
[00:52:53.800 --> 00:53:00.200]   that when we do get hold of this truth, we not only see the hollowness and the falseness
[00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:06.680]   of all his accusations and suggestions, they provide us with further proof of our relationship
[00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:12.900]   to thee. Oh God, forgive any grumbling Christian that
[00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:18.600]   may be in this congregation. Help us to be ashamed of ourselves that we have ever grumbled
[00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:24.520]   or complained. Help us, O God, to see that whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth
[00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:32.040]   every son whom he calleth. Give us this wisdom that will enable us to deduce these things
[00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:38.880]   rightly and gloriously, that we may even rejoice in tribulations because they are final proof
[00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:46.480]   to us that we are thy children and that thou art preparing us for that indescribable glory.
[00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:54.200]   And now, may the grace of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship
[00:53:54.200 --> 00:54:00.480]   and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night, throughout
[00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:08.840]   the remainder of this hour's short, uncertain, mere earthly life and pilgrimage, and until
[00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:21.080]   we shall see him face to face, enter into the glory and be made like him. Amen.
