[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Self-delusion is such a strong component of all of these stories of business gone wrong.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.360]   It's very rare that you have one of the characters at the heart of this who actually
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.840]   understands what they're doing and understands that they're moving over into the dark side and
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.160]   thinks about the potential repercussions of this and chooses this path anyway.
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.800]   That's usually not the way these stories go.
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.360]   So it's entirely possible that SBF studied Enron, knew all about it,
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:33.680]   and never envisioned that there were any similarities between that and what he was doing.
