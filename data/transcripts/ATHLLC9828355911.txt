[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.700]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.880]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.940]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.200]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, Longangle.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.240]   Longangle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.060]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.620]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.460]   I'm a member of Longangle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.940]   investments.
[00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.660]   Now, the majority of Longangle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.320]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.280]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.240]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.160]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.440]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.000]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out Longangle and it's totally
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.800]   free to join.

[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.960]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.640]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:42.000]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.880]   your life, money, and travel.
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.040]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins, and I'm excited to have my first two interview
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.920]   episode today.
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.760]   We'll first talk about estate planning with Patrick Hicks, a lawyer who recently
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.960]   became the general counsel for Trust & Will.
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.640]   Now, if you're not familiar with estate planning, think of it a little bit like
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.280]   risk management for your family.
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.280]   It's a way to protect and guide your loved ones should you die or become
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.200]   incapacitated.
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.480]   Now, I know that's not the most exciting topic for a dinner conversation, but I
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:14.560]   promise it's an important one and we'll get into some really tactical advice.
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.760]   After that, we'll talk to Mani Mahadevan, who runs a company called Valor, which
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.960]   is really democratizing access to the kinds of trusts that wealthy people use
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.520]   to limit the taxes they pay.
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.800]   It was so fascinating to hear about some of the crazy ways that people avoid
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.200]   giving the IRS more money.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.520]   I know this is a longer episode, but both of these conversations were on similar
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.200]   topics and were so interesting that I thought it would be worth combining them
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.880]   into one.
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.400]   So let's jump right in.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.640]   Patrick, thank you for being here.
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.200]   Happy to be here and speak with you.
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.080]   I just spent some time talking about some of the aspects of how people and their
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.520]   families can start to protect themselves, their documents, and I didn't spend as
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.280]   much time on the legal side of things.
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.280]   So I think most people have heard of the term "will" and I've written about it a
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.880]   bit and we've mentioned it in the past.
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.360]   Maybe we could just start at the basics about what is a will and who needs one.
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.600]   Yeah, that's a great question.
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.960]   So a will is a fundamental estate planning document.
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.680]   And once you have all of your decisions made and your intentions and your
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.320]   preferences, it's these legal documents that actually make them legally binding,
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.760]   enforceable, and valid.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.440]   So that's the difference between I have a desire and now I actually have an
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.160]   enforceable legal decision.
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.760]   That's the estate planning documents and the will is the cornerstone,
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.880]   fundamental estate planning document.
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.400]   It's incredibly old.
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.720]   It's been around the concept of a will since ancient Greece, but the will as we
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.880]   know it today, even that the origins trace back to the 16th century.
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.320]   I mean, Henry VIII was the king when they passed the statute of wills act that set
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.800]   a lot of the requirements that we're still working with today.
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.920]   So that's how long a will has been part of estate planning in modern society.
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.360]   If you can really call the 16th century modern society, we're still using the
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.880]   same rules.
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.280]   So I guess I got to give them a little bit of credit.
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.040]   Wow.
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.120]   I didn't know the history.
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.800]   What are the main components of it?
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.120]   The decisions that you want to think about before creating one?
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.560]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.320]   So a will, because it is a very fundamental document, it handles
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.280]   fundamental needs.
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.640]   And there's three primary needs that every will will handle.
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.360]   And the first is we'll dispose of your assets and we'll say where your things
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:22.760]   go, who gets what after your death and a will only applies at death.
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.960]   But that's what it does is it transfers your assets after death.
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.320]   The second thing after disposing of your assets is it will choose
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.240]   who will care for your children.
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.040]   Now, your children are not assets.
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.880]   You don't dispose of them in quite the same way.
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.880]   But it will allows you to nominate someone who can care for your children
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.840]   to serve as their guardian.
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.280]   And the last thing that a will does is allows you to specify
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.840]   your own final arrangements, your burial preferences.
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.000]   Do you want to be cremated, buried at sea, blasted to the moon,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.840]   whatever it is that you want to do?
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.840]   A will lets you select those three things.
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.720]   Dispose of your assets, someone to care for your children
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.200]   and your final arrangements.
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.400]   Those are the core functions of a will.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.680]   Would it be fair to say anyone who has assets, children or preferences
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.360]   on what happens to them should probably have a will?
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.440]   Or what would happen if I wrote a document?
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.600]   It wasn't fancy.
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.560]   And I emailed it to like 3 friends that just said, "Here's what I want to do."
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.760]   Does that work in place of a will?
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.360]   Or what's necessary for this to all play out how you want it?
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.920]   Yeah, that's a great question.
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.920]   So the first one is every adult does need a will.
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.920]   You should have a will on your 18th birthday.
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:27.600]   Are you going to?
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.240]   Is that what you're going to be?
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.520]   First thing in line, Monday morning, your 18th birthday?
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.520]   No, let's be realistic.
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:32.800]   But every adult should have a will.
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.920]   There's no minimum asset thresholds.
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.640]   And like you said, even if you don't have this huge amount of assets,
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.600]   you don't have children, you still have final arrangements
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.320]   and you still have some property that you will dispose of,
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.680]   whether it's high value or sentimental property, you need a will.
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.520]   Every adult needs a will.
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.480]   But if you don't have a will or if you're looking to kind of create
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.280]   your intentions without a will, it starts to get a little dicey
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.680]   because you can send that email or even draft a letter to your friends
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.000]   to say, "In the event of my death, I want this to happen."
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.480]   And the question is, is that legally valid and enforceable?
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.880]   Is that enough for your preferences
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.680]   to be given actual weight in the eyes of the law?
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.440]   And in many times, unfortunately, the answer is no.
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.560]   And so when you have that result, you may think you have a plan,
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:21.080]   but the law disregards your plan and you wind up dying with no estate plan at all.
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.000]   And so let's take an example.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.400]   Somebody has $50,000, one child
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:32.080]   and a strong desire to be cremated, but no will, no email sent to anyone.
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.360]   Maybe they've told their spouse what they want, or maybe we can go through
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.320]   whether they do or don't have a spouse.
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.480]   But what would happen to that $50,000 without a will?
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.800]   What would happen to their child?
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.120]   Who makes the decision on what happens to their remains?
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.360]   Yeah. So if you die without a will, that's known as dying intestate
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.000]   or intestacy is the process that you go through.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.920]   And that simply means that you have no will at death.
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:57.720]   And every state has a set of laws that will apply that says,
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.040]   if there is no will, here are the default laws.
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.680]   And those default laws attempt to fill in all those holes.
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.960]   So it will say who's responsible for making decisions or where assets might go
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.160]   or who might have priority to care for children.
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.960]   So it's an attempt to fill in those gaps.
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:17.040]   But it's not a perfect solution by any stretch in your situation.
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:22.000]   That $50,000 would most likely be split between the surviving spouse
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.280]   and their surviving child.
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.640]   So $25,000 to to each of them.
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.800]   And that's just that default law.
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.280]   Now, that spouse might be the person who has the presumed authority
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.240]   to make decisions, who could say, hey, I happen to know
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.880]   that this person wanted to be cremated, so we're going to choose cremation.
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.640]   But if they don't know that or if they disagree with that,
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.640]   if you've never expressed that preference at all,
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.960]   that spouse may have the legal right to act,
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.120]   but they don't have the knowledge of what your preferences are.
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.520]   So you have to have both sides.
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:53.280]   You have to have clear intentions and you have to have legal authority.
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.680]   And without a will, you're really running a risk that you don't have either of those.
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:01.280]   And if you didn't have a spouse, what happens to children or assets?
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.560]   Or if you don't have children, what happens to assets?
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.640]   Yeah, so if you don't have a spouse, you don't have children.
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:10.160]   Most of these state laws, what they have is essentially an if then statement.
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.560]   So if you have a spouse, everything goes to your spouse.
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:15.280]   And if you have a spouse and one child, it's divided equally.
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.680]   Spouse and two children.
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.880]   It's just cascading set of decisions.
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:22.000]   But if you really boil it down, all of these laws basically say
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.600]   assets pass to your closest living relatives.
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.040]   So if you have a spouse, maybe your spouse or your kids,
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.480]   and if you don't have one, it might be your parents or your siblings.
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.520]   Maybe you can go out to your grandparents and your cousins.
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.320]   So if you're really isolated and don't have close family,
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.200]   it might still pass to your cousins.
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.600]   The problem is getting that process completed,
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:43.800]   getting to that finish line could be a difficult step.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:46.200]   By the time the assets get to that cousin,
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.800]   the assets might even be depleted by fees and expenses.
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.440]   And so you're really starting to eat into the beneficiary's
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:54.120]   actual receipt of funds from your state.
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:57.720]   And I assume if you had neighbors who were unofficial
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.360]   godparents to your children and your desire was,
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:03.360]   I wish they could take our kids and you didn't have a will to state that,
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:07.120]   I imagine that would probably be a difficult thing because neighbors
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.400]   and friends probably aren't in the statutes of if then statements.
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.040]   Right. Absolutely.
[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:15.160]   You have assets you want to leave to your neighbors or your close friends.
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.520]   The law just it doesn't look at that at all.
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.480]   If it's you, you're a family member or you're not.
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.080]   So if you have something like that,
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:24.120]   you really critically need a state plan in place.
[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:27.280]   But with children, it's even trickier because ultimately the court
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:29.880]   is compelled to do what is best for the child.
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:33.960]   So even if as a parent, I say, I want my neighbor to care for my child
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.760]   and the court will look at that and it's very unlikely.
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:39.760]   But if the court says, hey, this is a really bad decision
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:40.880]   for some unknown scenario,
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.360]   maybe the neighbors have developed a drug habit or something like that
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.800]   that is unknown to me.
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:48.240]   The court can actually step in and say, we're going to overrule this decision
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.760]   and we're going to pass the children to someone else.
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:53.640]   It kind of leaves the court with almost too many options.
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:54.720]   Should we give it to a family member?
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.640]   Should we give it to close friends?
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:00.040]   Or does the child fall into the foster care for the state?
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:04.280]   It's almost too open ended and it leaves your children with no certainty.
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:07.400]   And what's already, if you think about a tragic time, the loss of a parent,
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.520]   it's a lot for a child to be expected to bear.
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:13.760]   Wow. OK, so it's pretty clear that everyone probably needs a will.
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.400]   What would actually happen?
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:17.680]   I'm just curious if you were in debt.
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:21.160]   Let's say someone actually had the opposite of as they just had liabilities.
[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:24.560]   Is that a rare circumstance where if you had no kids, no spouse,
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:28.200]   no desires for your remains, it might be better to not specify
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:31.240]   who takes on those liabilities or what happens when you die
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:34.480]   with credit card debt or a mortgage that you don't have enough assets to cover?
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.240]   Yeah, that's a great question.
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.320]   So there's two types of debt.
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:40.680]   The first type is known as recourse debt, and that's something that might be
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:41.800]   like your mortgage in your house.
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.800]   It's actually tied to a specific property.
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.600]   And so that debt is associated with that property.
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:50.040]   If you want to leave someone that property, they take it with that debt.
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:52.480]   The other type is something like maybe your credit card bills.
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:55.080]   And that's just a personal promise to repay that debt.
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.920]   The benefit of that second type, your credit cards,
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:02.520]   any sort of normal outstanding loans, they don't evaporate at death.
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:05.360]   They can be paid off from any assets in your estate.
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:08.720]   But if there are not enough assets to pay down those debts,
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.200]   those debts just go away.
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:13.240]   They don't get passed on to your heirs as a general rule.
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.800]   There's some weird exceptions that might pop up here and there.
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.600]   So it's not always a black and white scenario.
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:21.800]   But generally, you don't have to pass on liabilities to your children.
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.680]   But you still need to account for that plan,
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:28.320]   because if you don't have that accounted for as part of your estate plan,
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:30.760]   you can actually have a creditor who will come in and say,
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:33.280]   we're going to open up the probate proceeding, for example,
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:35.440]   and we're going to call the shots and we're going to run this show.
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.600]   So it may still not be in your best interest.
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.120]   Even if you don't have significant assets,
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:42.440]   everyone has something of sentimental value, whether it's a photo album
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.720]   or old furniture in your house is an antique.
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:48.440]   And it's something been in the family a long time that a creditor is going to say,
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.720]   well, that's 50 bucks at a consignment shop.
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:52.280]   And they're going to look at it as dollar amounts.
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:53.120]   And it's going to deplete
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:56.800]   what could be a sentimental inheritance to your children, for example.
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.080]   So I think that makes a lot of sense.
[00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:03.720]   Will seems to be something that everyone listening should have at least over 18.
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.760]   What about all of these other documents?
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:08.840]   So I've written in the past about the full estate plan.
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:12.000]   And I know in California, that's sometimes something
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.080]   that has to do with avoiding probate.
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:17.240]   I don't generally know across the country what all the rules are.
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:21.440]   But what would you say is the core difference between an estate plan
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:24.240]   and a will and who needs to make the upgrade?
[00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:28.240]   Yeah, so I think the best way to think about it is an estate plan
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.440]   is a set of documents.
[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:33.320]   And then a state plan can contain a variety of documents
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.440]   depending on your particular situation.
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:38.600]   Most typically, an estate plan will have at least a will
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:42.480]   and a set of health care documents, maybe a power of attorney or a living will
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.600]   or advanced health care directive, something like that.
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:48.240]   So that set is really the fundamental building block of an estate plan.
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:50.720]   You can also add additional documents.
[00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:54.880]   So a living trust, for example, is a very common additional document
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:56.840]   to be included in an estate plan.
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:59.000]   And if you start getting in more complex situations,
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.360]   you might have other types of trust, maybe asset protection trusts
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:05.360]   or charitable giving trust and things like that are really specific tools
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:07.440]   for specific use cases.
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:09.560]   Not everyone's going to have those as part of their estate plan.
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:13.680]   But if you have that need, it is a great fit for your situation.
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:16.880]   So fortunately, we're going to have money from Valor on the show in a little bit.
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:19.920]   So we don't have to get into a lot of those complex things.
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:23.680]   But I do think it would be good to walk through the basic documents.
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:27.560]   Even I originally got confused when I was like, OK, so there's a will
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:28.640]   and then there's a living will.
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:32.080]   And it turns out the living will is not the same thing as what you think of as a will.
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:36.120]   So maybe we could just step through the common components of a state plan
[00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:38.800]   and talk about what they are and who might need them.
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:42.240]   Yeah. You have the will, the fundamental document, dispose of your assets at death,
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.800]   nominate guardians for children, final arrangements.
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:47.240]   A will only applies at death.
[00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:49.840]   It has no impact on you during your lifetime.
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:52.920]   Where you fill that out or compliment a will is with something
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:54.400]   known as health care documents.
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.040]   And this might be this group of documents
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:59.120]   is sometimes known as health care documents or disability documents,
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:02.400]   incapacity documents, a variety of names that might apply here.
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:05.920]   And within that group of documents, you typically see something
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:07.360]   called a power of attorney.
[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:11.160]   And then you see a health care directive or a living will medical directive.
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.360]   Again, there's a lot of interchangeable terms here.
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:17.800]   But the basic concept is these health care documents apply during your lifetime.
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:19.640]   So a will applies after death.
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:21.720]   But health care documents apply during your lifetime
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:24.200]   and allow you to make decisions for what should happen
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:27.200]   if you are alive but unable to speak for yourself.
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:30.320]   So maybe you've had a medical emergency, you're incapacitated,
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.560]   you stepped off the curb and got hit by that proverbial bus.
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:36.320]   Whatever it is that you're unable to make a decision for yourself at that time,
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:40.800]   these documents can step in and fill in that gap and either speak for you
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.720]   or nominate someone else to make decisions on your behalf.
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:47.680]   OK. And what kinds of decisions can you make in advance?
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:48.720]   What do you need to specify?
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.720]   What goes into the nuance of creating them?
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:54.120]   So each document does one thing a little bit different than each other document.
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:56.640]   So that's why they're typically coupled together as a set.
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:59.680]   The power of attorney handles your financial affairs.
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:01.920]   And essentially, it's everything that's not medical.
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:04.760]   So it ranges from banking and taxes to real estate.
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:07.280]   Anything that you need to do as a transactional matter
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:10.800]   other than dealing with health care, that's where the power of attorney will fill in.
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:13.640]   And this essentially allows you to designate someone else
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:16.520]   to step into your shoes and make decisions on your behalf.
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:21.040]   That's great to cover a wide range of really common needs.
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:25.480]   The health care side, you have a set of documents known as either a living
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:27.600]   will, an advanced directive, a medical directive.
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:30.160]   Again, a lot of different terms can be used interchangeably.
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:31.480]   And these do two things.
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:34.800]   One, they specify your medical preferences.
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:38.120]   So what type of care do you want to receive or not want to receive?
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:40.480]   You can make choices for yourself.
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:43.080]   But the second thing they do is they nominate someone else, again,
[00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:44.440]   to fill in those gaps.
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:47.920]   So if a decision has to be made and you haven't spoken in advance,
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:50.560]   who answers those questions for you?
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:53.520]   And that's the medical side that pairs with the financial side.
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:57.360]   Both of those two documents together comprise the health care documents
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:58.840]   as a single unit.
[00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:01.200]   And I know for having filled out these documents,
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:05.440]   one of the big decisions you often talk about is plans for life support.
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.040]   So for anyone listening and you're thinking,
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:08.640]   what kind of decisions would I want to make?
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:11.320]   It's if you were in a coma, how do you want to treat that?
[00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:16.360]   The options are often like go at all expense to try and prolong my life.
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:19.040]   Or if a doctor determines that we've done
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:21.640]   as much as is reasonable, don't keep going.
[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:22.960]   So those are the kinds of decisions
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:26.560]   that you might have a different opinion on than whoever's in charge.
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:28.520]   And you can specify in advance.
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:30.720]   Yeah, these are inherently personal decisions.
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:32.840]   And so your choice is specific to you.
[00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:35.560]   No one else can make the same choice that you would in that circumstance.
[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:38.040]   They're also very difficult decisions.
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:41.400]   And so it's unfortunate for anyone to be asked to make a decision
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:44.800]   with no guidance that can be just incredibly overwhelming
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.840]   for that individual to think, what am I supposed to do?
[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:49.880]   Am I going to pull the plug or leave them on life support?
[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:53.320]   They can carry that doubt and potential guilt for the rest of their lifetime,
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:55.040]   worrying if they made the wrong choice.
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:57.280]   So it's not always something you do for yourself.
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:00.480]   It's really important for you to do this, to think about those who are also
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:04.560]   still alive and making decisions for you and what the benefit you can provide to them.
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:07.920]   And who would make that decision absent these documents?
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:09.360]   If I hadn't nominated someone?
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:13.600]   I'm guessing the law stipulates, OK, if you have a spouse, the spouse makes a decision.
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:14.680]   Is it the same thing?
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:17.440]   The closest living relative is the person who gets to make the call?
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:20.240]   It does. It follows the same set of rules.
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.240]   There are different rules, but they're the same structure, at least.
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:25.120]   So it would be your spouse, your kids, your parents, closest living relatives.
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:27.400]   But you can get into a situation if you have three kids
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:30.280]   and they're equally entitled to make a decision and they disagree.
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:31.520]   What happens then?
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:35.440]   So it can be very important because you have to make one single decision.
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:40.000]   And many cases, you don't have time to work out a dispute or go to court,
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.320]   get a court to intervene and make a decision on behalf of the three kids.
[00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:45.120]   Some of these decisions are very urgent.
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:48.760]   So having a plan is particularly important for health care decisions.
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:51.960]   OK, so we've got a will.
[00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:55.880]   We've got your medical and your power of attorney documents to cover your finances.
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:58.440]   What are other things people should be considering
[00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.400]   when it comes to their estate planning?
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:04.720]   So the other core document that many people should look at is a trust.
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:08.560]   And when I say trust, I mean a revocable living trust.
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:13.480]   There's a whole wide range of trusts, but we're talking about a revocable living trust.
[00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:16.920]   The revocable part simply means that it's able to be amended or changed
[00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:18.640]   or even revoked during your lifetime.
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:21.480]   And the living part just simply means you create it while you're alive.
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:26.400]   So it sounds complicated, but it's the workhorse of modern estate planning.
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:29.960]   That is the document that the majority of individuals
[00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:33.080]   who look to add something beyond a will will look to add
[00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:35.840]   a revocable living trust into their plan.
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:39.200]   Like the will, it allows you to make decisions after death,
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.080]   but it also applies during your lifetime.
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:43.160]   So a trust kind of blurs the line.
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:46.800]   It allows you to handle some of those lifetime incapacity issues,
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:49.680]   but also allows you to plan for what happens after death,
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:52.720]   where your assets should go, who should be in charge, things like that.
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:54.280]   I'll just flag for anyone listening.
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:57.880]   We've all seen some TV show or movie where some kid gets a trust fund
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:59.960]   and there's tens of millions of dollars.
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:03.520]   And my original knowledge of it was like, trusts are just so much money
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:06.160]   that they want to limit how much goes to their kids.
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.680]   I've learned over time that that is true.
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:10.040]   There are lots of trusts.
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:12.720]   They're actually usually more the irrevocable kind
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:15.480]   that have a lot of different tax avoidance, often benefits.
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:17.360]   And we're going to talk about those a little bit later,
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:19.560]   because I think it's really fun to understand.
[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:23.560]   But the revocable or revocable trust is really not a thing
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:25.680]   just for people with millions of dollars.
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:28.000]   But who should be thinking about this?
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.280]   When does it make sense to say, OK, a will in some of these health care
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.520]   documents is not enough.
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:34.960]   Let's look at the trust.
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.120]   Yeah, so there are a few reasons
[00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:38.680]   that you might want to look to add a trust to your estate plan.
[00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:43.200]   And the first, if you focus on what a trust does, a trust gives you more control
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:47.000]   over the distribution of your assets, when and how those assets are distributed
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.400]   to your beneficiaries.
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:50.480]   So this might be useful if you have young children.
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:52.920]   You might want to look at a trust because that allows you to say,
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:56.760]   hey, I want my assets to go to my kids, but maybe not at age 18.
[00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:01.000]   I want them to go at age 25 or split half at 25 and half at 35.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.760]   You have a little more control over when and how assets are distributed.
[00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:08.640]   Similarly, if you're in a blended family or if you're a second marriage situation,
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:12.560]   a trust allows you to do a little more in terms of I want to support my spouse,
[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:16.040]   but I want to ensure that ultimately those assets pass to my children.
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:18.800]   I don't want to worry about leaving everything to my spouse
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:21.560]   and then my spouse either getting remarried or leaving everything
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:24.280]   to my stepchildren with my kids receiving nothing.
[00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:27.400]   So those kind of complex family dynamic situations.
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.920]   It's a great option for a trust.
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:33.480]   Beyond that, though, a trust has one feature that a will does not.
[00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:37.160]   Well, will goes through probate after death and it becomes essentially
[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:39.960]   a public document and a trust stays private.
[00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:42.600]   So if you want to have a little privacy in your affairs,
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:46.840]   particularly after your death, a trust gives you that and a will simply does not.
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:50.200]   But the primary reason for most people to look for a trust
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:52.720]   is to avoid probate entirely.
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:55.720]   If that's something by nature of a will, it goes through probate
[00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:59.240]   and a trust just simply bypasses the probate process entirely.
[00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:02.640]   That can be a massive savings of not just time and effort,
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:05.160]   but money for a whole lot of people.
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:07.320]   So I have a couple of questions there.
[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:09.680]   One, what is that general cost?
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:12.800]   And two, at least in California, I've always heard
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:16.760]   if you have less than $100,000 in assets, a will can avoid probate.
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:19.840]   So think about a trust when you cross that threshold.
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:21.360]   Is that still true?
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:23.480]   And what does the process look like?
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:26.320]   Yeah, so the probate process, it deals after death.
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:29.160]   It allows you to essentially prove that the will is valid,
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:31.840]   appoint the executor, carry out the terms of the will.
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:33.920]   It seems like an orderly process.
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:37.880]   It's anything, but it can take measure typically in months or years.
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:41.280]   In California, a two year probate is close to the norm these days.
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:45.160]   So the fees involved with probate, they vary by state,
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:48.640]   but then they also vary by the facts of your particular estate.
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:53.040]   In California, the threshold was recently raised and it's now $184,000
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:56.160]   of whether or not you can have some sort of short form probate
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:58.000]   or if you have to have a full probate.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.680]   Once you reach that threshold, the amount that you're actually going to pay
[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:02.400]   in terms of fees and expenses,
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:05.760]   it's basically a percentage of the overall value of your assets.
[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:10.280]   But as a quick example, if you have a million dollars of assets in California,
[00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:14.600]   you might look to pay maybe $50,000 of fees
[00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:17.400]   all out the door to get through the probate process.
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:21.680]   And just to clarify, that million dollars is the gross value of your assets.
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:23.640]   So if you own a home and you're heavily mortgaged,
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:26.880]   you maybe have a million dollar home and $200,000 of equity.
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:31.640]   You're still paying that $50,000 on the full $1 million value.
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:33.840]   You don't just look at the net value of your assets.
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:37.560]   That $50,000 can be a pretty heavy bill for someone to pay
[00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:41.320]   on top of their ongoing cost to maintain their standard of living.
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:45.320]   And they just pull those assets to pay for probate out of whatever
[00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:48.240]   you had in your bank account and whatnot and sell your investments
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:49.480]   and that kind of stuff.
[00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:52.120]   Yeah, if you have liquid assets available, they'll come from that.
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:55.680]   Otherwise, you might be forced to mortgage a house or even sell assets
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:58.040]   that are illiquid in order to generate these funds.
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:59.080]   And that can happen.
[00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:02.640]   You do see surviving spouses who have to sell the family home
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:05.840]   because they cannot come up with the cash to pay for probate
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:08.560]   or they can't maintain the mortgage payments after death,
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:10.800]   particularly with a loss of a source of income.
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:11.880]   Life insurance proceeds
[00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:15.440]   is a great opportunity to pair life insurance with your estate
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:18.160]   to ensure that there is cash available.
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:21.040]   But if you don't have that cash available, it's coming from other assets.
[00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:24.400]   And ultimately, it's going to reduce the amount that passes to your beneficiaries.
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:28.440]   So California, in many different ways, is a unique state.
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:33.120]   How do the other 49 states and commonwealths and territories
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:37.760]   compare in terms of a hard threshold where things get really complicated?
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:41.400]   Or do many states offer that kind of short form version of probate
[00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:44.480]   that maybe isn't as daunting or expensive or timely?
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:49.120]   Yeah, most other states are not quite as burdensome as California
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:50.080]   with respect to probate.
[00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:52.680]   California, if it's not the worst, it's competing up there
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:55.920]   with maybe a couple of the states to be among the worst states in terms of probate.
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:59.440]   A lot of other states, it's a more streamlined process.
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:01.840]   It's maybe closer to filing your tax returns.
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:03.800]   You're filling out some documentation, submitting it.
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:05.720]   You got to have a lot of records to back it up.
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:07.080]   It's not quite as burdensome.
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:08.120]   It doesn't take as long.
[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:11.600]   It's not nearly as expensive, but it's still not enjoyable.
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:13.880]   And so you have to bear in mind that you're doing this
[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:15.840]   immediately following a death.
[00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:19.320]   So there's a lot of emotion going on, a lot of just mental struggle happening.
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:23.040]   And then, hey, let me go fill out this really complicated equivalent to a tax return.
[00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:26.000]   It may be easier than California, but it's still something
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.240]   that a lot of people might look to avoid without the fees of $50,000.
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:33.840]   You can definitely get away in a lot of other states without a trust.
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:37.320]   So you don't necessarily have to have a trust in every state,
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:40.560]   in every situation as a universal rule.
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:43.760]   Many people still want to trust because it does have other benefits
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:46.680]   outside of probate, those additional control over distributions
[00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:48.600]   and the privacy benefits.
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:53.000]   But it's not necessarily the probate factor alone requiring the use of a trust.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.320]   Are there other states that if someone's listening and in that aren't
[00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:00.600]   California, that are equally challenging or maybe not as challenging,
[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:03.480]   but states where a trust might make a little bit more sense?
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:05.720]   Yeah, so there are a couple of states.
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:07.960]   So New York is actually fairly difficult.
[00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:10.080]   Not surprising as a lot in common with California.
[00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:13.720]   You also get some interesting things like Cook County in Illinois.
[00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:16.520]   Not the whole state of Illinois, but Cook County in Illinois
[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:18.600]   can be difficult to go through the probate process.
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:23.760]   So as a general rule, if you're in a bigger city or a higher net worth area,
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:25.760]   you tend to have a little bit more going on.
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:27.240]   The courts might be more congested.
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:29.840]   So the whole process just gets a little more bogged down.
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:33.040]   If you're in the Midwest, most of the states that tends to move
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:34.520]   a little more efficiently.
[00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:37.760]   So if you aren't sure what your local rules might apply to you,
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:40.320]   just think about what it looks like if you go to the county courthouse
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:41.880]   and try to get any sort of application.
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:43.160]   Is that relatively easy?
[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:45.080]   Or is that something you don't want to look forward to doing?
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:47.840]   And that should give you a direction of which way to lean on how bad probate might be.
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:51.000]   So I've gone through a couple of different processes
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.920]   in my life setting all these documents up.
[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:58.280]   One time I had a legal benefit at work where it turns out I could enroll.
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:25:59.440]   And I just did it for one year.
[00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:01.400]   I paid maybe $15 a month.
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:06.040]   And at the end of the I was able to go hire an attorney to drop these docs.
[00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:09.880]   And then full disclosure, once we had our first child, I used trust and will.
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:12.520]   And that's how we put together our whole estate plan.
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:14.040]   And I'm a big fan of the product.
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:15.400]   You guys didn't pay to come on.
[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:16.360]   I just like the product.
[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:17.560]   I've talked about it before.
[00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:21.480]   I am curious for people listening,
[00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:25.880]   when does it make sense to download the template of a will
[00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:28.920]   that I'm sure there's lots of free legal will templates?
[00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:30.520]   Maybe even the state provides one.
[00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:33.880]   When does it make sense to use a service like trust and will
[00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:37.160]   or others that help you automate and create documents
[00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:38.840]   that you don't have to fill out yourself?
[00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:42.120]   And when do you get to the point that it makes sense to work with an attorney
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:44.120]   to drop something a little bit more custom?
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:49.560]   Yeah. So the hard part of trusting any sort of free document is knowing
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:51.320]   is this actually valid?
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:52.520]   Has this been updated?
[00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:54.040]   Does this reflect the current laws?
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:56.200]   If I create this document,
[00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:59.960]   do I get what I think I'm actually expecting to receive here?
[00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:01.960]   I would say what you're paying for, but that's nothing.
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:03.960]   Are you really getting what you're expecting there?
[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:06.120]   And unfortunately, I've looked at many of these free templates
[00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:08.760]   and sometimes they're just not valid.
[00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:11.560]   So there's that huge risk there of what you get.
[00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:12.680]   Some of them are good.
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:14.760]   So I'm not saying it's impossible to do it.
[00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:16.520]   And in some states, you can just pull out a piece of paper
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:18.200]   and handwrite your will and you're good.
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:19.160]   You're out the door.
[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:21.960]   The mechanics of it are less difficult than somehow knowing
[00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:24.840]   what to say to carry out your intentions.
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:26.920]   So that's where you might want to look at something like trust and will.
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:28.280]   And if you need to make a quick comparison,
[00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:30.600]   trust and will is like TurboTax for state planning.
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:32.920]   So yeah, you can download the forms in the IRS
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:34.520]   and fill out your 1040 on your own.
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:38.120]   But most people would either have a guided experience
[00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:40.440]   through a tech platform like TurboTax.
[00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:43.080]   It just seems to make it all a little more comfort inspiring.
[00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:43.960]   You have more peace of mind.
[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:44.840]   It's a little bit easier.
[00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:49.080]   Trust and will, we really handle most needs for most people
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:51.720]   where we really start to have some situations
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:52.920]   where you might want to go to an attorney.
[00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:54.680]   If you have really complex situations
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:57.320]   or if you're expecting a fight after your death,
[00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:59.480]   it's probably worth it to go see an attorney.
[00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:02.520]   Or once you get into really high net worth individuals,
[00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:04.440]   if you're over about $5 million,
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:06.600]   we can still handle that at trust and will.
[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:08.360]   Our documents are sophisticated enough
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:12.040]   to handle those situations up to and including a taxable estate,
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:14.680]   12 or 15, $20 million of total wealth.
[00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:17.160]   But you're probably going to get a better value
[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:19.720]   if you actually go and pay the $5,000, $10,000
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:21.880]   to have a custom document drafted by your attorney.
[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:24.440]   $5,000, if you have $20 million in the bank,
[00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:26.120]   not that big of a blow to you.
[00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:29.080]   But $5,000, if you maybe have $500,000 in the bank,
[00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:31.240]   it starts to be a little harder to swallow that bill.
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:34.040]   That's really where trust and will fits in for most people.
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:36.280]   Are there any other circumstances
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:37.480]   that might make someone say,
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.880]   "Okay, maybe working with an attorney does make sense?"
[00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:42.040]   Yeah, that's a great example.
[00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:43.000]   Especially in these children's
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.840]   particularly difficult situation,
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:46.440]   there's a specific type of planning
[00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:47.960]   that can be done for that.
[00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:49.400]   Trust and will doesn't currently offer that,
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:51.000]   although that's something that's on our roadmaps.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.840]   We hope to have that offered soon.
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:54.200]   But that particular situation,
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:56.040]   if you want to account for a beneficiary
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:57.400]   who has special needs,
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:58.600]   it's a great option to go say,
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:01.240]   "Hey, maybe an attorney is better for my use case."
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:03.880]   Beyond that, if you have things like a prenup
[00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:06.360]   that requires certain payments to be made at death,
[00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:08.120]   or even a divorce decree
[00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:09.640]   or a marital settlement agreement that says,
[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:11.880]   "Upon my death, I ensure that I'm gonna leave X amount
[00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:13.080]   to my former spouse."
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:15.400]   You may need to have custom language
[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:16.680]   inserted into your documents.
[00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:19.160]   And typically only an attorney can provide that
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:21.320]   and ensure that the language in your documents
[00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:23.560]   complies with the requirements of that prenup
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:24.600]   or that marital agreement.
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:27.560]   So, if you have a situation where you may think,
[00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:28.360]   "Everybody's unique,
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:30.120]   and I don't want to say anybody is boilerplate,
[00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:31.240]   no one's template."
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:32.920]   But if you have a situation where you go,
[00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:34.520]   "I just feel like I'm not a good fit
[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:36.200]   for this particular reason."
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:37.320]   You get that tingly feeling,
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:39.640]   that might be enough to at least call an attorney,
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:40.760]   see what they say.
[00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:41.800]   Maybe you could find some help.
[00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:42.360]   Maybe they go,
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:43.480]   "Oh yeah, I can easily handle this.
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:44.200]   It's not a problem."
[00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:45.640]   And you get a little guidance from them,
[00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:48.040]   but maybe use your own best judgment.
[00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:50.360]   If you feel that you aren't gonna be a good fit,
[00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:52.680]   you probably are worth paying a little bit more
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:53.720]   just to get the peace of mind
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:55.000]   of having an attorney involved.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.560]   Are there any financial or tax benefits
[00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:59.880]   other than avoiding probate costs
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:01.320]   that come with setting up a trust?
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:06.600]   So trust can have some tax savings opportunities,
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:09.800]   both on a federal state tax or even a state tax.
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:12.120]   For most people, that's not applicable.
[00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:14.840]   The current federal state tax thresholds are so high
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:15.720]   that it's just not something
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:16.680]   most people have to care about.
[00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:18.920]   But a trust can be used to at least
[00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:20.520]   efficiently pass assets
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:22.360]   without incurring additional taxes.
[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:24.680]   So if it's something that you're concerned about,
[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:25.720]   it can do that.
[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:27.160]   But on the flip side of that,
[00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:29.000]   the trust also doesn't really
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.520]   incur any additional taxes.
[00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:32.760]   While you're alive, a revocable living trust
[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:36.600]   is essentially disregarded from federal tax viewpoint.
[00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:37.640]   It's your alter ego.
[00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:39.640]   It's moving assets from your left pocket
[00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:40.920]   into your right pocket.
[00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:43.480]   You don't need a new taxpayer ID number.
[00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:45.320]   You don't have to file a separate tax return
[00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:46.840]   for assets in your trust.
[00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:48.760]   It's known as a grantor trust.
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:50.760]   But that just means it's no change.
[00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:53.160]   So it's held in this vehicle of a trust
[00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:54.920]   that provides a lot of benefits,
[00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:57.800]   but it won't negatively impact your tax status
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:59.000]   while you're still alive.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.600]   As someone who's gone through this process,
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:02.920]   usually you fill out a form, sign it, send it in.
[00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:04.760]   The account now has a new title,
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:06.040]   but it's still your same account.
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:08.280]   You still get your debit card with your name on it.
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:09.640]   It doesn't really change a whole lot.
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:11.640]   So I think when it comes to a lot of
[00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:13.080]   the trust we'll talk about in a bit,
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:14.680]   the irrevocable ones,
[00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:16.440]   that changes a lot of things.
[00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:18.040]   But in this circumstance,
[00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:21.000]   it feels more fancy and technical
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   because of the way we've seen it in the media
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.280]   about kids with trust funds
[00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:26.600]   than it is actually more a document
[00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:28.520]   to just keep things more organized.
[00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:31.320]   I wish I could say that I'm eating
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:33.400]   a fully balanced diet every day,
[00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:36.040]   but the reality is that I am definitely not.
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:37.880]   So I love having an easy way
[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:40.120]   to get my daily nutritional insurance,
[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:43.000]   which is why I kickstart my day with Athletic Greens.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.520]   And I am excited to be partnering
[00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:46.120]   with them for this episode.
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:47.160]   I started taking it
[00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:49.400]   because I wanted to see what all the hype was about,
[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:52.040]   and I've kept it in my daily routine for months.
[00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:54.920]   Every morning, I mix it up with some cold water,
[00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:56.280]   add a few ice cubes.
[00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:58.200]   It tastes so good when it's cold,
[00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:00.280]   and I head to my office feeling focused
[00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:01.640]   and energized for the day,
[00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:04.360]   which is a feeling I absolutely love.
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:07.800]   I also love that it's made from 75 high quality vitamins,
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:09.320]   minerals, and superfoods,
[00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:12.040]   and contains less than one gram of sugar.
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:14.520]   It also has no GMOs, nasty chemicals,
[00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:16.200]   or artificial anything.
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.040]   To make giving it a try easy,
[00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:19.640]   Athletic Greens is gonna give you
[00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:23.480]   a free one-year supply of immune-supporting vitamin D
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:26.280]   and five free travel packs with your first purchase.
[00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:28.440]   All you have to do is visit
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:32.120]   allthehacks.com/athleticgreens.
[00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:35.880]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/athleticgreens
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:37.960]   to take ownership over your health
[00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:40.680]   and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance.
[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:43.880]   Science has shown that being charitable
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:46.840]   can actually have a huge impact on your happiness,
[00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:50.200]   which is why I'm excited to be partnering with Daffy today.
[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:51.720]   They're a not-for-profit community
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:53.880]   built around a new modern way to give,
[00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:56.840]   and they have a mission I think we can all get behind,
[00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:59.880]   helping people be more generous more often.
[00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:02.360]   Amy and I use Daffy for all of our giving
[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:03.560]   because they offer an account
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:06.600]   that makes it easy to put money aside for charity.
[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:08.600]   You can make a one-time contribution,
[00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:11.160]   or you can set a little aside each week or month,
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:14.360]   and all your contributions are tax-deductible.
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:16.440]   Except you don't actually have to know
[00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:19.080]   exactly where you wanna give the money right away.
[00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:22.440]   In fact, you can make your tax-deductible contribution now
[00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:25.720]   and invest that money into stocks or even crypto
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:27.400]   so it can grow tax-free
[00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:29.480]   and let you have more impact in the future.
[00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:31.640]   Then, whenever you're ready,
[00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:33.480]   you can give to any of more than
[00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:36.040]   one and a half million charities, schools,
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:38.680]   or faith-based organizations in a matter of seconds.
[00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:42.920]   So head on over to allthehacks.com/daffy
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:44.840]   if you wanna start giving today.
[00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:47.480]   And for a limited time, if you visit that link,
[00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:50.040]   you can get a free $25 to give
[00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:51.400]   to the charity of your choice.
[00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:57.320]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/D-A-F-F-Y.
[00:33:57.320 --> 00:34:00.920]   One of the questions that you have to figure out
[00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:05.960]   is who's going to be the trustee of the trust
[00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:07.000]   if you were to pass?
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.800]   And usually that is you and your spouse might create it
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:10.840]   and the spouse takes over.
[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:13.640]   Can you talk a little bit about that decision?
[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:14.840]   Because I think some people listening
[00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:16.600]   are probably gonna go through this and have to think,
[00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:19.480]   "Okay, who is gonna manage these financial affairs?"
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:20.840]   And let's say my kids are young
[00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:22.520]   and they're not ready for the money.
[00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:23.640]   What happens to it?
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:25.080]   How do those decisions get made?
[00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:28.360]   So the trustee, they're the CEO of the trust.
[00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:29.560]   They have a lot of administrative
[00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:31.000]   and financial responsibilities.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.960]   And that includes everything from keeping records,
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:35.640]   paying taxes after death,
[00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:37.960]   making sure the distributions are actually made.
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:40.840]   They also work with a lot of professional advisors,
[00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:42.840]   whether it's a lawyer, an accountant, somebody like that.
[00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:47.480]   They have a lot of more sophisticated requirements.
[00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:49.000]   And so you also wanna make sure
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.600]   that you have someone that understands you
[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:51.320]   and your decisions
[00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:54.200]   because they still have to exercise their own discretion.
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:55.960]   Sometimes it's not a black and white decision.
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:57.960]   The trustee has to make a choice.
[00:34:57.960 --> 00:34:59.880]   You wanna make sure that choice that is made
[00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:01.240]   is one that you would agree with.
[00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:04.760]   So choosing someone who can handle all of those duties well,
[00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:06.200]   it can be difficult.
[00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:06.600]   You're right.
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:09.000]   Most people do look to name a spouse or a child
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.680]   or a family member as their trustee.
[00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:12.600]   But if you don't have a spouse
[00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:13.960]   or if your children are very young,
[00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:15.400]   they may not be good choices.
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:18.680]   You can look to name a sibling or a parent,
[00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:20.520]   but is that the right person?
[00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:22.680]   It's ultimately gonna depend on what's right for you.
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:25.560]   The most common choices are spouse and children,
[00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:26.920]   other near family members,
[00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:29.320]   close friends are a common option.
[00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:31.560]   There are business partners that you can choose
[00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:33.640]   if you have a close working relationship.
[00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:34.680]   But if none of those apply,
[00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:37.320]   there are professional fiduciaries or even a bank
[00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:39.800]   who can step in and serve as trustee.
[00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:41.000]   They charge a fee for it,
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.680]   but it's more of a corporate approach
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:43.560]   of what you're getting.
[00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:45.000]   You're opting into,
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.280]   "I am choosing to have this bank serve as my trustee."
[00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:50.360]   They're gonna make very corporate decisions.
[00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:51.320]   But sometimes that's good
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:52.840]   if you don't have another alternative
[00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:55.000]   that you can comfortably rely on to fill in
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.360]   and make those decisions for you.
[00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:59.880]   Yeah. I mean, I know for our circumstances,
[00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:02.520]   we didn't want to leave our children
[00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:04.920]   who right now are one about to be born
[00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:07.560]   and two years old with money at that age,
[00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:09.560]   which I don't even know if you could legally do.
[00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:12.760]   So this person was gonna have to manage our assets
[00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:14.120]   until the right age,
[00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:16.120]   which meant managing the investments.
[00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:17.960]   What happens when the funds
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:19.320]   that you're invested in pay dividends?
[00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:20.520]   Do you reinvest them?
[00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:22.440]   When do you change asset classes?
[00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:23.960]   If you look at a trust
[00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:26.280]   that was maybe written 10 years ago,
[00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:27.240]   you probably never thought
[00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:29.400]   maybe you'd want to invest some percentage
[00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:31.080]   of your portfolio in cryptocurrency,
[00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:32.040]   but now you might.
[00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:33.560]   So for us, we thought about
[00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:36.200]   who can make those kind of investment decisions.
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:38.680]   And it was just a very different calculus
[00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:42.360]   than "Who do we want to take care of our children?"
[00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:44.520]   Those are just fundamentally very different.
[00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:47.080]   And so we didn't choose the same person for that.
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:49.560]   And it was much more of an investment mindset
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:51.400]   that we wanted someone to think about
[00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:52.920]   and be fair with money.
[00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:55.640]   Because am I right calling them "Him's clauses"?
[00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:58.440]   There's like a phrase of what discretion
[00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:00.360]   you give the trustee over things.
[00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:01.640]   And that really helped me think about
[00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:02.840]   who could make those decisions.
[00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:04.360]   - Yeah, it's a really important point.
[00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:06.360]   And it is a "Him's clause", H-E-M-S,
[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:08.040]   health, education, maintenance, and support.
[00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:09.400]   You can talk to your favorite lawyer about it,
[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:11.400]   but it provides certain instruction
[00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:13.800]   as the terms of when assets can be paid out
[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:15.640]   to a beneficiary or when assets
[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:17.000]   have to be held in the trust.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.120]   But the bigger point is the person
[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:23.160]   who fills the role of the trustee best for you
[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:25.640]   may not be the person who fills the role of guardian
[00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:27.080]   or fills the role of executor,
[00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:28.440]   fills the role of your power of attorney.
[00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:31.320]   So the default many people think is
[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:33.480]   "I'm going to name my spouse for everything."
[00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:35.640]   But that may work, but maybe your spouse
[00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:37.000]   isn't the person who wants to handle
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.080]   these complex financial situations.
[00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:40.440]   So maybe you want to name your spouse
[00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:41.880]   to care for your children, obviously,
[00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:43.720]   make personal decisions for you.
[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:45.000]   But maybe you want to name your brother
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.600]   who's a tax lawyer to handle
[00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:48.040]   your financial investment decisions
[00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:50.440]   if that's more suitable for your particular needs.
[00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:53.160]   So you don't have to name one person in every role.
[00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:55.160]   You can name individuals that are suited
[00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:56.600]   for each particular role.
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:58.040]   You want to make sure they're coordinated
[00:37:58.040 --> 00:37:59.640]   and able to work together.
[00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:02.040]   But each role should be accounted for different
[00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:03.480]   or as a one-off, if you will.
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:05.800]   So it can be someone that serves another role,
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:07.240]   but it doesn't have to be one person
[00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:09.880]   filling every fiduciary role throughout your estate plan.
[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:14.040]   One thing we did, which isn't required,
[00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:17.720]   but we wrote a side letter for the successor trustee
[00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:20.360]   because they have this ability to control
[00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:22.920]   the health, the education, the maintenance.
[00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:25.000]   Do the kids go to private school or not?
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.120]   That's a financial decision.
[00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:27.880]   The trustee would get to decide that.
[00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:30.360]   So we just wrote a letter to that person and said,
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:33.080]   "We want you to know that here's how we would think
[00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:35.080]   about spending money on our children.
[00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:36.680]   Would we want them to have some money
[00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:40.120]   to go on vacations or study abroad?"
[00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:41.000]   Things like that.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.680]   It was less about we thought this person
[00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:43.960]   would make the wrong decision,
[00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:46.120]   but we just wanted to make it easier for them
[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:47.960]   to make the decision we would have made.
[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:49.880]   I don't think you guys have built in a feature
[00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:51.480]   to write a letter to a friend,
[00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:53.080]   which doesn't really need a product.
[00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:55.640]   But that is something that we did on the side
[00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:57.880]   just to make sure that we weren't doing
[00:38:57.880 --> 00:38:59.000]   what a lot of people do.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.120]   And if you Google online,
[00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:02.920]   there's some crazy Reddit posts about people saying,
[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:05.560]   "Well, did you decide that the trust will only pay
[00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:07.960]   for their college if they get above a 3.7?"
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:10.520]   And then someone said, "Well, I don't know.
[00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:11.720]   What if it's a 3.6?"
[00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:13.720]   And you get into these really tough situations
[00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:17.080]   where if a kid were to get sick or have an accident,
[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:18.440]   maybe their GPA drops.
[00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:20.040]   Now you don't pay for their college.
[00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:23.960]   And so we took the approach of not trying to outline
[00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:26.040]   every little nuance of everything that would happen,
[00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:28.040]   but to choose a person we trusted
[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:29.640]   and give them some guidance
[00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:32.040]   and give them the discretion to make those decisions.
[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:35.080]   That's always been my professional recommendation
[00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:37.640]   is it's really hard to predict the future.
[00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:40.280]   But it's a lot easier to find someone that you trust
[00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:41.560]   and give them direction.
[00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:43.240]   And then ultimately, you're just relying on them
[00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:45.320]   to make the best choice that they can.
[00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:47.320]   As a parent, that's all you're trying to do every day
[00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:50.040]   is make the best choice that you can in a situation.
[00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:51.800]   Nobody knows what next year is going to be like.
[00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:53.000]   If you'd asked this 5 years ago,
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.840]   "Were we going to have a global pandemic?"
[00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:56.360]   No one would have raised their hand.
[00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:57.560]   If those few who did,
[00:39:57.560 --> 00:39:59.480]   we would have looked at with skeptical eyes.
[00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:01.480]   But you can't predict the future.
[00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:03.880]   But what you can do is you can pick people you trust.
[00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:05.000]   And if you can do that,
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.600]   and you can give them the guidance
[00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:07.640]   in that letter of instruction,
[00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:10.280]   it may not be legally binding, but it's helpful.
[00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:11.960]   And sometimes helpful is all you need.
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:14.520]   Do you have to tell or do you recommend
[00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:16.200]   telling all of these people this thing?
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:18.600]   I know that one of the decisions that we had to make
[00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:20.760]   was "Gosh, who we might want now?"
[00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:22.040]   We actually thought about it in hindsight.
[00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:24.680]   We said, "Gosh, if we had to make this decision 5 years ago,
[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:26.200]   some of those people are people
[00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:28.280]   that we're not as close to anymore,
[00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:30.200]   or maybe something happens to them."
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:32.040]   And we thought, "Gosh, if we tell the person
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:34.520]   who is the trustee or the guardian now,
[00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:35.640]   and then we change it,
[00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:37.080]   that's going to be pretty awkward to be like,
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:38.680]   "Hey, I know for the last 4 years,
[00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:40.680]   I've thought you'd be good to manage my affairs."
[00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:41.880]   I changed my mind.
[00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:44.120]   Is this something you have to tell people about?
[00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:45.160]   Or should you?
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:46.360]   You don't have to.
[00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:49.000]   But generally, it's a good idea to tell people.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.040]   And when it's a good idea,
[00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:53.560]   what I mean is having that conversation in advance
[00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:56.520]   is one of the easiest ways to avoid conflict
[00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:59.320]   or disagreement or dispute after death.
[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:00.920]   You save so much hassle
[00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:02.520]   by having that conversation upfront.
[00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:03.480]   It's not easy.
[00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:05.080]   People don't want to have that conversation
[00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:07.320]   about death in most cases.
[00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:08.840]   But it also doesn't have to be hard.
[00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:10.120]   It can be as simple as,
[00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:12.120]   "Hey, I've created an estate plan,
[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:14.120]   and I've named you as trustee.
[00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:16.600]   Are you okay with that?
[00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:18.360]   Also, here's where my documents are
[00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:19.880]   in case something happens to me."
[00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:21.640]   And you don't have to get into the details,
[00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:24.680]   but you can at least inform people of the decisions.
[00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:26.360]   And if those decisions change later,
[00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:27.480]   it can be as simple as,
[00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:29.320]   "Hey, I've updated my estate plan.
[00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:31.560]   I've named someone else as trustee
[00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:33.240]   to fill these needs right now.
[00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:35.160]   But I still have these documents in this place."
[00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:37.400]   Or "You're still serving as my power of attorney."
[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:38.920]   Whatever the update may be.
[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:41.720]   People respect the information.
[00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:43.000]   It's ultimately your choice.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:47.480]   And is it worth trying to save an awkward conversation now
[00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:49.320]   if you know that the likelihood
[00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:51.080]   is that you're going to wind up having
[00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:53.000]   your family, your heirs, your beneficiaries
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.840]   dealing with that situation later on?
[00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:56.920]   Most people, when they think about it, say,
[00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:58.840]   "I'd rather just go ahead and get this out of the way
[00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:00.600]   and have maybe an awkward conversation.
[00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:02.920]   But I know I'm not going to have a fight
[00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:05.000]   that I'm leaving for my family after my death."
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.440]   That makes sense.
[00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:07.880]   I created my estate plan.
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:08.920]   Things change in life.
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:12.120]   How do you think about when it makes sense to update them?
[00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:13.640]   Is that something you do every year?
[00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:15.480]   Every time you have a major life event?
[00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:17.000]   So, many people think of estate planning
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.160]   as a one-and-done situation.
[00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:21.880]   And unfortunately, it's not that way.
[00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:22.920]   Estate planning should be something
[00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:24.440]   that evolves with your life.
[00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:26.600]   So, what's good for you now
[00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:27.960]   may not be what's good for you
[00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:29.800]   in 5, 10, 20 years from now.
[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:31.240]   So, your estate plan should change
[00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:32.600]   as your life changes as well.
[00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:34.760]   But there's a simple rule at Trust and Will.
[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:37.480]   We think that after any major life events,
[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:39.080]   you should look to update your estate plan.
[00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:41.320]   So, if there's been a birth or a death,
[00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:43.560]   a change in marital status, anything like that,
[00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:45.000]   take a look at your estate plan.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.080]   But even if you haven't had any major changes
[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:48.680]   and you look at your plan and you go,
[00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:51.080]   "Everything's about how I still want this to be."
[00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:52.440]   Every three to five years,
[00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:54.040]   it's worth just reviewing your plan,
[00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:55.160]   maybe even refreshing it
[00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:57.400]   because the laws do sometimes change.
[00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:59.320]   And you wanna make sure that you don't have a stale
[00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:00.360]   or an outdated plan.
[00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:02.200]   You wanna make sure that your plan continues
[00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:04.760]   to represent your interests and your desires.
[00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:07.320]   So, any major life events every three to five years,
[00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:08.760]   or if you have some specific change,
[00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:10.840]   you need a new guardian, anything like that,
[00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:12.360]   go ahead and take a look, update your plan.
[00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:14.280]   It's really not that hard to get a plan updated
[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:15.800]   once you have the first plan in place.
[00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:16.840]   Great.
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:19.240]   And you just mentioned where you keep the documents.
[00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:22.040]   I'll share a company that I started using on my own
[00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:23.160]   called Trustworthy,
[00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:26.040]   which is basically this family operating system
[00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:29.000]   where you store all the documents while you're alive
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.080]   are great for just managing between your partner.
[00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:32.600]   And were you to pass,
[00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:34.520]   you can actually nominate people
[00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:37.400]   who find out in advance that were something to happen,
[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:39.720]   they could reach out to the company and get access to.
[00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:42.760]   So, we've put things like our estate plan,
[00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:44.200]   our insurance documents,
[00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:47.560]   just where we hold bank accounts and financial accounts,
[00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:49.800]   all those kinds of different things we put there
[00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:52.280]   and then just sent a few friends that we trusted.
[00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:53.400]   Here's where they are.
[00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:55.160]   If something happens to us, you know where to get them.
[00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:58.040]   So, that's another company like Trust and Will that I use.
[00:43:58.040 --> 00:43:59.160]   So, my Trust and Will docs
[00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:01.720]   are in my Trustworthy account online.
[00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:02.280]   And that's great.
[00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:04.680]   Trust and Will, we've recently added the ability
[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:06.200]   to upload additional documents
[00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:07.640]   to be stored with your estate plan.
[00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:08.600]   It's a slightly different approach.
[00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:11.400]   Ours is typically focused more on the estate planning side.
[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:12.760]   But the ultimate goal is to make sure
[00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:14.360]   that all the documents that you need,
[00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:15.800]   which includes your estate plan
[00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:17.320]   and things like your insurance documents,
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:18.600]   other important information,
[00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:20.680]   they're available to the people who need them.
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:22.680]   So absolutely, find a solution for that
[00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:25.160]   because having a will is the first step.
[00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:27.080]   But having a will that no one can find
[00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:28.440]   doesn't do you any good.
[00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:30.680]   You need to make sure that people know where that is,
[00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:32.360]   how to access it when they need it.
[00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:33.960]   So, it's important to have the document,
[00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:37.000]   but make sure there's also still accessible when it's needed.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.160]   Are there any other tips, tricks,
[00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:41.080]   hacks on protecting your family?
[00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:42.360]   Things that you've picked up along the way
[00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:43.160]   that are worth sharing?
[00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:46.360]   Well, I think the recommendation that I always give
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:48.040]   is to have that discussion upfront.
[00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:49.560]   Tell people what your plans are.
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:51.320]   And if you have a plan, let people know,
[00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:53.560]   "I have a plan. Here's where it's located."
[00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:54.920]   Maybe fill them in on some details.
[00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:57.080]   That is the number one tip.
[00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:59.400]   But beyond that, you can really consider
[00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:02.760]   the importance of having backups and plans in place.
[00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:05.080]   You want to think about trying to over-plan
[00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:07.400]   rather than under-planning for any situation.
[00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:09.560]   So your situation is unique.
[00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:12.200]   What I plan for may not meet your needs.
[00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:15.080]   What you plan for may not be appropriate for my needs.
[00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:18.680]   So, if you are worried about some particular specific scenario
[00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:20.360]   that may only apply to you,
[00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:21.640]   or even if it may never apply to you,
[00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:25.400]   but it's just this nagging doubt in your head, plan for it.
[00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:28.280]   Put a provision in place that will buy you that peace of mind
[00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:30.120]   just to know that you have something there.
[00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:32.360]   That peace of mind, that self-confidence,
[00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:35.400]   that is worth its weight in gold for so many people.
[00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:36.680]   The relief that people feel
[00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:38.680]   once they've completed this process,
[00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:40.760]   they then wonder, "Why did I put this off so long?
[00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:42.440]   This was, A, not that hard.
[00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:44.280]   And B, I feel so much better."
[00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:47.160]   But the last tip, to make sure that your family
[00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:49.080]   has a plan in place as well.
[00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:51.480]   So if you have kids and they're getting to the age of 18,
[00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:52.840]   talk to them about estate planning.
[00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:55.080]   It's awkward, it's difficult, but you're a parent,
[00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:57.960]   you have to guide them into becoming adults as well.
[00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:00.920]   But if you have siblings or parents that don't have a plan,
[00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:02.920]   guess who's going to be stuck dealing with that mess?
[00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:04.360]   You are.
[00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:06.840]   So yeah, it's a bit of a self-interested conversation,
[00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:08.360]   but talk to your family members.
[00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:09.720]   Do you have a plan in place?
[00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:10.920]   What do you want to happen?
[00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:12.840]   You can start that conversation
[00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:16.440]   and ultimately not rely on them to start it,
[00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:17.880]   but you can start that conversation
[00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:19.320]   and you're still both going to be better off
[00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:20.680]   for having raised the topic
[00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:21.960]   with your family members as well.
[00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:24.200]   Any tips for that conversation?
[00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:26.440]   I imagine, at least in my circumstance,
[00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:27.880]   my parents had never really talked to me
[00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:30.440]   about their plans or anything like that,
[00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:32.280]   but I can see how it can come off a little bit.
[00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:34.600]   "Hey, how much money am I going to get when you die?"
[00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:35.960]   That kind of conversation.
[00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:38.520]   Any suggestions for broaching the topic
[00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:39.560]   in the best way possible?
[00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:43.720]   The easiest way to raise it is to start with yourself and say,
[00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:45.960]   "Hey, I've created an estate plan.
[00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:47.320]   Here's where it's located."
[00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:49.720]   But it made me think, "Do you have an estate plan?
[00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:53.400]   What can I know to ensure that your wishes are carried out
[00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:54.440]   after your death?"
[00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:55.560]   And that's the focus is,
[00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:59.320]   "What can I do to ensure that you get what you've planned for?"
[00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:01.480]   You don't have to talk about specific assets.
[00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:02.440]   And if it comes up that like,
[00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:04.760]   "Hey, you've been named as guardian for my children."
[00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:06.120]   Then you can have the conversation of,
[00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:09.240]   "Okay, well, what would you like to happen for your kids?
[00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:11.320]   Would you want them to go to private school or public school?
[00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:12.600]   Do you want to go to summer camp?
[00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:15.400]   What should you tell me that I can be
[00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:17.800]   as best a guardian as possible for your plans?"
[00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:20.760]   Ultimately, you're trying to learn how to fill
[00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:23.080]   that expectation as best as possible.
[00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:24.360]   And if you focus on it that way,
[00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:26.680]   most people don't see that as,
[00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:27.640]   "You're trying to figure out
[00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:29.000]   what you're going to get when I die."
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:30.600]   It's not money-grubbing, greedy.
[00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:32.920]   It's really, "Oh, how can I help you out with this?"
[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:35.080]   And it tends to be received a little bit better.
[00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:36.680]   That's really helpful.
[00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:38.360]   Well, I also want to thank Trust & Will

[00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:33.720]   Yeah.
[00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:34.440]   Yeah.
[00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:34.920]   Awesome.
[00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:36.520]   Patrick, thank you so much for being here.
[00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:38.120]   I love it. It's been great.
[00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:39.160]   I've enjoyed speaking with you.
[00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:44.040]   When we think about trust, we think about more advanced things.
[00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:46.280]   And so I'm not the expert here.
[00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:49.560]   I wanted to talk to someone who I think really understands
[00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:52.360]   all of the advanced tactics people are using
[00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:55.960]   to both avoid taxes now, avoid taxes in the future,
[00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:58.040]   be able to transfer money to their children.
[00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:01.480]   So I'm really excited to bring on Mani from Valor,
[00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:04.840]   who has built an entire business around this that's really interesting.
[00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:06.440]   Mani, thanks for joining me.
[00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:07.800]   Really appreciate it, Chris.
[00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:09.080]   Excited to join you.
[00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:12.200]   I'll give you a little bit of context on those things that you're talking about.
[00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:13.320]   TV context on ourselves.
[00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:16.280]   So Valor, our entire idea is how do we use technology
[00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:20.360]   to make these tax and estate planning tactics more accessible
[00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:22.600]   so that everyone can build wealth more efficiently.
[00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:24.920]   The problem we're solving is most of these things,
[00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:26.840]   your audience may know about it, you may know about it,
[00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:28.920]   but it's a black box to most people.
[00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:32.760]   But let's start at the top of what is tax planning and estate planning,
[00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:33.800]   which you've both mentioned.
[00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:35.640]   When most people think about tax planning,
[00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:38.120]   it's how do they use legal tax rules,
[00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:43.080]   things that the IRS has okayed or the government has okayed to reduce their taxes.
[00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:47.080]   So this could be their taxes on their salary, their capital gains,
[00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:50.200]   their stock they've received from their company or their side hustles.
[00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:52.680]   It's how do you take advantage of whatever rules
[00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:55.720]   and opportunities the government has laid out to reduce your taxes
[00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:59.480]   so you can keep as much income for your use during your lifetime.
[00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:02.600]   That's what tax planning is really focused on.
[00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:05.720]   Now, estate planning is thinking about a little bit longer time horizon.
[00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:09.560]   It's taking the assets and the wealth that you, your family have built up,
[00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:13.800]   and how do you pass on as much of that as possible to the next generation?
[00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:17.400]   The big constraint here is the lifetime gift exemption.
[00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:21.720]   In the US, there's a limitation on how much you can gift in assets to other people
[00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:24.200]   before the government starts to tax it.
[00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:28.600]   So as of now, the individual limit is a little above $12 million.
[00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:33.480]   So that means as an individual, you can give $12 million or as a couple,
[00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:39.720]   a little above $24 million before the government starts to tax your assets with the estate tax.
[00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:41.080]   Which is a really high rate.
[00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:43.480]   Yeah, the estate tax makes all other taxes look low.
[00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:46.760]   So just the federal tax rate alone is 40%.
[00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:50.280]   It does graduate, but it gets to 40% pretty quickly.
[00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:51.720]   And that's just federal.
[00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:56.840]   So then you can start to layer on state taxes on top of that, and it can get much, much higher.
[00:50:56.840 --> 00:51:01.160]   Now, some of these state estate taxes actually start at levels below this $12 million.
[00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:03.000]   It depends on a state-by-state basis.
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   But the federal is the most punitive.
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.480]   And that's primarily what people are concerned about.
[00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:12.840]   If they're trying to pass on as much of their hard-earned wealth to their kids or grandchildren,
[00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:15.640]   how do they work around the estate tax?
[00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:17.480]   And this is where estate planning comes into play.
[00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:19.240]   So it's a little bit different time horizon of,
[00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:22.360]   "Are you focused on how do you maximize assets for your use?
[00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:26.200]   Or how do you maximize assets for future generations or some combination?"
[00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:30.440]   And that's where more of these different structures come into play like irrevocable trust.
[00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:35.560]   Yeah. And we've talked a bit earlier about the basics of estate planning.
[00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:38.920]   And I think what you're doing is interesting because it marries the two a little bit.
[00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:42.760]   Some of the tactics that we'll talk about are things that you might be able to use,
[00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:47.720]   even if you're nowhere close to hitting $24 million with a spouse.
[00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:52.600]   And some of them might be less ideal or not worth it if you're not that close.
[00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:55.400]   And just so everyone knows, I'm not an attorney.
[00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:57.080]   Monty, I don't think you're an attorney.
[00:51:57.080 --> 00:52:00.840]   This is not meant to be personalized financial or tax advice.
[00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:05.400]   But we're just going to explore some of these tactics that I think are really mystified.
[00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:07.560]   You hear trust and people are like, "Oh, they're so fancy."
[00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:10.840]   I just want to break down a bunch of them and walk through them.
[00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:13.720]   So people understand what they are, how they work,
[00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:18.440]   how people are legally either avoiding or postponing taxes,
[00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:22.440]   and for many people, how they could fit into their lives and when they make sense.
[00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:24.360]   Yeah, that sounds great.
[00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:27.800]   I wrote a newsletter a few months ago, and I did my own research.
[00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:29.560]   And I'm not the expert like you are.
[00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:30.920]   I'd known about a few of these.
[00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:34.520]   And I wrote about GRATS, and Charitable Remainder Trusts,
[00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:37.000]   and ILITS, and Family Limited Partnerships.
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.720]   Those are the things I highlighted and wrote a paragraph on.
[00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:42.920]   And even in just preparing for this interview and looking at your company,
[00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:45.560]   I realized, "Gosh, I really didn't know what I was talking about then."
[00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:49.400]   And I caveat it with, "I don't know what I'm talking about, but this is my quick research."
[00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:51.720]   So I'm glad we can clear things up.
[00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:53.880]   So maybe we start with Charitable Remainder Trusts.
[00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:58.440]   At a high level, Charitable Remainder Trusts are typically used for
[00:52:58.440 --> 00:53:01.720]   people when they're selling highly appreciated assets
[00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:04.520]   because their core thing is their tax exempt structure.
[00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:07.960]   And the easiest way to understand these and the most relatable thing is
[00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:12.360]   Charitable Remainder Trusts are very similar to a standard IRA
[00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:14.440]   that most Americans use to build their wealth.
[00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:19.480]   IRAs, just as a quick reminder, it's individual retirement accounts.
[00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:23.800]   And the core benefit for most people is that you can contribute between $5,000 to $8,000
[00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:25.560]   per year to your IRA.
[00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:29.320]   And the assets grow in your IRA on a tax-free basis.
[00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:35.000]   Until you take money out of the IRA, you can buy and sell the assets, and you won't pay taxes.
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.240]   And this is to the power of compound wealth,
[00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:41.720]   which it creates an incredible amount of wealth for people over a long time period.
[00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:44.120]   Charitable Remainder Trusts are very similar to that.
[00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:48.680]   They're also a tax-exempt structure where assets that are sold in the trust,
[00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:53.400]   you don't pay taxes on until you receive a distribution from the trust.
[00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:56.520]   Now, the big difference and where this comes into play is,
[00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:57.800]   there's a couple of key differences.
[00:53:57.800 --> 00:54:01.640]   One, you can contribute an unlimited amount of assets to a Charitable Remainder Trust
[00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:03.560]   instead of being limited to $5,000 to $8,000.
[00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:07.960]   So common use cases, if someone has paid off the mortgage on their house
[00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:10.600]   that they've lived in for 20 years, and they want to sell it,
[00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:16.520]   they can't put it into their IRA, but they could move that house into a Charitable Remainder Trust
[00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:22.840]   and then sell it and avoid the taxes when they sell their house and reinvest that money.
[00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:28.040]   So just to take kind of a quick example, let's just say the house is worth a million dollars.
[00:54:28.040 --> 00:54:32.680]   And to keep numbers simple, their cost basis was close to zero when they bought it.
[00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:35.400]   So they bought in a really great place that's exploded in value.
[00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:38.760]   If they lived in California, probably when they sell it,
[00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:46.040]   pay 35% or $350,000 in taxes and take away $650,000 if they didn't do anything.
[00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:48.520]   But instead, if they put it into a Charitable Remainder Trust,
[00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:53.800]   they would upfront get about 10% of that value as a charitable deduction to write off their income.
[00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:55.880]   So $100,000 charitable deduction.
[00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:59.000]   But critically, when they sell that million-dollar home,
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.480]   the trust wouldn't owe any taxes on it.
[00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:05.160]   So it would keep a million dollars to reinvest, put into the market,
[00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:07.560]   or any of the other investment options that they're looking at.
[00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:12.520]   And just with simple math of if a million dollars invested at the market versus $650,000,
[00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:16.040]   you're going to generate a lot more income and wealth for yourself.
[00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:17.560]   That's the key piece.
[00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:20.920]   So let's say you work at a company, you've got some shares.
[00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:24.600]   When they were granted to you, they're really inexpensive and you exercise them.
[00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:26.040]   Now they're worth a lot.
[00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:28.360]   Yeah, you could pay taxes and invest it.
[00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:31.560]   Or you could contribute these to a Charitable Remainder Trust
[00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:35.400]   and then not pay the taxes because it is a charitable vehicle.
[00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:37.400]   And you get a deduction for that donation.
[00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:40.840]   And then the trust can use that full million dollars to keep investing it.
[00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:44.440]   So if you otherwise were going to donate a million dollars to charity,
[00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:46.120]   that seems comparable.
[00:55:46.120 --> 00:55:48.040]   But can you talk a little bit about how
[00:55:48.040 --> 00:55:52.520]   this is not just something that is beneficial to charity, which it is,
[00:55:52.520 --> 00:55:54.200]   but it also is beneficial to you?
[00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:56.440]   Yeah, it's a great question.
[00:55:56.440 --> 00:56:00.440]   This is where a lot of people are wondering, "Why is it called the Charitable Remainder Trust?"
[00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:03.880]   And the way that this works is every year from a Charitable Remainder Trust,
[00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:07.880]   or at least annually, you're allowed to take money out of the Charitable Remainder Trust.
[00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:13.000]   That amount is set up front when you create the trust of what percentage of trust assets it is.
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:16.360]   But that's kind of the critical thing is the core part of this is that
[00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:20.120]   you're expected to get 90% of the value out of the trust.
[00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:22.440]   And the charity is expected to be left about 10%.
[00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:25.800]   And that 10% that you leave behind,
[00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:30.280]   this is what enables the structure to stay tax exempt so assets can grow.
[00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:33.800]   And you only give that 10% at the end of the trust term.
[00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:36.200]   And for most folks, this is at the end of their life.
[00:56:36.200 --> 00:56:39.240]   So they'll take their highly appreciated equity in the company,
[00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:41.320]   they'll put it into Charitable Remainder Trust,
[00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:45.160]   they'll sell it, they'll keep that entire principle in the trust, reinvest it.
[00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:49.320]   And then every year, they can start to take distributions from that trust.
[00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:51.000]   And then at the end, they'll leave a piece.
[00:56:51.560 --> 00:56:55.320]   When they pass away, that'll go to a charitable cause that they care about.
[00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:58.520]   The easiest way to think about it is the government is giving you a 0%
[00:56:58.520 --> 00:57:02.360]   interest loan on your taxes, so that you can reinvest in the market in exchange
[00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:05.880]   for leaving a small percentage for charity at the end of the trust.
[00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:09.800]   I've seen the calculators you make on your website.
[00:57:09.800 --> 00:57:16.920]   And because you're able to invest money without paying taxes and grow it along the way,
[00:57:16.920 --> 00:57:20.280]   it turns out you end up over your lifetime with
[00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:23.080]   more money coming back than you would have otherwise.
[00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:26.200]   So you actually... The charity benefits and you benefit.
[00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:28.520]   Yeah, that's 100% right.
[00:57:28.520 --> 00:57:32.360]   If you're selling an appreciated asset, or if you live in a high-tax state,
[00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:37.960]   you will come out ahead personally by using a Charitable Remainder Trust to sell the asset
[00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:41.880]   and do the money that you receive over time by being able to avoid that taxes.
[00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:46.600]   And as like a cherry on top, a charitable cause will also benefit.
[00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:50.040]   But even if you ignore that piece, you will personally benefit.
[00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:54.440]   And if you really care about the charitable cause, then it's a real win-win all around.
[00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:56.760]   I know what you give up is a little bit of liquidity.
[00:57:56.760 --> 00:58:00.760]   So can you talk about the trade-off is that million dollars in my example,
[00:58:00.760 --> 00:58:03.960]   you can't take it all out next year if you wanted it.
[00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:08.120]   Yeah, exactly. It's a great call out of the way these Charitable Remainder Trusts work is
[00:58:08.120 --> 00:58:11.000]   every year you can take out a certain percentage of the assets.
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.640]   This is the downside and the benefit is...
[00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:19.640]   If you sold all those assets personally in your name, that $650,000 after taxes,
[00:58:19.640 --> 00:58:23.000]   you can pull it out and do whatever you want with it at any time.
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:27.640]   The Charitable Remainder Trust, you can only withdraw a certain percentage per year.
[00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:30.200]   That percent depends on how long you set the trust up for.
[00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:33.080]   But let's just say you can pull out 10% a year.
[00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:35.320]   Instead of if there's a million dollars in the trust,
[00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:38.280]   that means you can pull out $100,000 that year.
[00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:42.600]   Now, that means that you don't have access to that full $650,000 or a million dollars.
[00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:44.840]   So you have less upfront liquidity.
[00:58:44.840 --> 00:58:48.120]   And this is one of the key trade-offs you're making is you get less upfront
[00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:51.800]   liquidity in exchange for your assets being able to stay in a
[00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:56.360]   tax-free environment and continuing to compound and grow on a pre-tax basis.
[00:58:56.360 --> 00:59:00.360]   It's a little bit of the "Do you need the money now or are you trying to create more
[00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:04.680]   long-term wealth?" And that tilts the "Should you sell it in your name or should you use this
[00:59:04.680 --> 00:59:07.480]   structure?" And it's not all or nothing, right?
[00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:12.120]   So if in a given year, you were to make $2 million, you don't have to put all $2 million
[00:59:12.120 --> 00:59:16.360]   in any of these vehicles, you could put 10% of it or 20%, correct?
[00:59:16.360 --> 00:59:21.080]   Yeah, exactly. So for instance, we have some customers who are tech employees.
[00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:26.920]   And as part of the IPOs last year, they had a couple million dollar exit for their assets.
[00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:29.480]   And they ended up putting 50% into a shareable remainder trust.
[00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:32.840]   And then they sold the other 50% in their own name to buy a home.
[00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:37.480]   So it depends. It's not all or nothing. One of the big benefits of these shareable remainder trusts
[00:59:37.480 --> 00:59:39.800]   is you don't have to put in all the assets upfront.
[00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:43.160]   You can put a little bit of assets initially. You can add assets a year from now,
[00:59:43.160 --> 00:59:47.640]   two years from now. They're fairly flexible. So you don't have to make the decision upfront.
[00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:51.800]   Now, this is an irrevocable trust, which is part of why you get these tax benefits.
[00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:55.320]   So once you do put assets in, you can't decide to change your mind
[00:59:55.320 --> 00:59:59.400]   after the fact. But you will start to get those distributions.
[00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:02.600]   And you don't have to make the big decision upfront. You can set up, put a little bit in,
[01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:07.400]   add more over time, or you can split your shares up. So it's fairly flexible that way.
[01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:10.600]   And ultimately, what people do, it just depends on your life situation.
[01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:15.320]   Do you have a lot of big purchases coming out? Or life events changing in your life?
[01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:19.640]   Do you plan to take some time off? Or do you not need the money and you want to reinvest and create
[01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:23.880]   more long-term wealth for years down the line when your kid's going to school or you want to
[01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:28.360]   take a couple years off from working? That tends to be very situational dependent based on the
[01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:33.400]   person, their lifestyle, and what their needs are. One quick follow-up. So yes, it's irrevocable.
[01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:36.440]   You can't take the money out. But how much control do you have over the investments?
[01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:40.200]   Can you set it up in a way that you have just a brokerage account and you can go in and trade
[01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:45.000]   and buy anything? Yeah, you can be in charge of making your own investments. So you can
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.440]   set it up to have a robo-advisor control it. You can set it up so that you're making those
[01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:53.480]   investments. Charitable remainder trust, one of the great things is you can invest in almost
[01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:59.320]   any asset. There's really just 2 restrictions. And this is similar to self-directed IRAs for
[01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:04.200]   people that are familiar with it. There's what's called a self-dealing prohibition where you can't
[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:07.800]   invest in assets that you will personally benefit from. So for instance, the charitable
[01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:12.760]   remainder trust could invest in a rental property for real estate, which is allowed to do. But you
[01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:17.560]   couldn't buy a rental property and then live in it yourself. So as long as it's a passive
[01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:24.360]   investment, you can invest in real estate, stocks, crypto, do angel investments for people in tech.
[01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:28.840]   There's a huge myriad of opportunities. And really, the restrictions are self-dealing
[01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:33.000]   and taking leverage. You don't want to create debt inside of the charitable remainder trust.
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:36.760]   So you don't want to be taking high leveraged options or trades like that.
[01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:40.280]   So for most people, they don't have to change their investment philosophy or what they want
[01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:44.520]   to invest in, or who's managing their investments. It fits into their lifestyle that way.
[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:49.240]   Awesome. Okay. So that's charitable remainder trust. I know
[01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:54.200]   Grats are similar in that you often want to donate highly appreciated assets.
[01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:56.280]   Can you talk a little bit about how they're different?
[01:01:56.280 --> 01:02:01.160]   Yeah. So in most cases, the people that are benefiting from the charitable remainder trust
[01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:05.160]   are the same people who put the assets in. So if you set up a charitable remainder trust,
[01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:09.480]   in most cases, you're also going to be receiving those annual distributions from the trust
[01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:14.360]   and benefiting personally, financially. Grats, that's in the tax planning situation.
[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:19.720]   Grats fit more into the estate planning bucket of solutions where Grats are focused on how do
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:25.560]   you efficiently pass on assets from one generation to the next, and are really focused on minimizing
[01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:31.800]   your estate taxes. So just to start with, Grats stand for the Grant to Retained Annuity Trust.
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:37.560]   And kind of an interesting aside, the way that they were created was the previous favorite
[01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:43.800]   estate planning tool was called a GRIT, and Congress tried to outlaw GRITs. And when they
[01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:48.520]   changed the legislation to outlaw GRITs, they actually created a loophole that enabled Grats,
[01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:54.040]   which are significantly more exploitative towards avoiding estate taxes. So
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:59.000]   they took a broken system, they tried to make it better, broke it and made it worse.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:04.520]   Now, how do Grats work? They essentially take advantage of, in most cases, an arbitrage between
[01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:09.240]   what is the government's discount rate, or what is the government's assumed growth rate of assets,
[01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:13.240]   and what do you actually achieve? Same, you're starting with a million dollars. And let's say
[01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:19.880]   the government's interest rate is 2%, or it was not that long ago. Obviously, things are changing
[01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:25.320]   pretty quickly right now. So the government is assuming that a year from now on that million
[01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:32.200]   dollars, you're going to gain 2%, or $20,000. The way a Grat is set up is that the Grat,
[01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:36.040]   you set up for a number of years, and let's just say you set up for two years in this example,
[01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:41.880]   it is going to pay you what's called an annuity stream, which is why it's called a Grant to
[01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:47.000]   Retained Annuity Trust. It's going to pay you a set amount of money. Let's just say it's going
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:55.720]   to pay you $500,000 for two years. So, in year one, it pays you $500,000. Now, the government
[01:03:55.720 --> 01:04:01.320]   is going to assume that there's $520,000 left in the trust, because they assume assets grow at 2%
[01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:08.120]   a year. And then in year two, it's going to pay you another $500,000, and it's going to assume that
[01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:17.320]   the $520,000 grew to $530,000 and left $30,000 behind. That $30,000, from the government's
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:21.720]   point of view, is going to, in most cases, it's your kid or whoever you're trying to
[01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:27.800]   have inherit your assets. So, the government assumes $30,000 passed on to your kid. Now,
[01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:32.600]   the reality that most of us know is your assets are probably going to grow faster than 2%. The
[01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:37.480]   historical market return of the S&P is a little above 10%. So, let's say your assets are actually
[01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:43.320]   growing at 10% a year. So, after year one, that $1 million is worth $1.1 million. Okay,
[01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:49.400]   you lose $500,000, there's $600,000 left. After that second year, when there's $600,000, there's
[01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:57.480]   now $660,000 left. That $500,000 then comes back to you, and then there's $160,000 left in the
[01:04:57.480 --> 01:05:04.680]   trust. The government, from its calculations, only says that you gifted $30,000 to the inheritor
[01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:11.640]   or the beneficiary of your grant, even though you passed $160,000 on. So, this is where you can
[01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:18.200]   essentially pass on, in this case, $130,000 estate tax-free from a federal standpoint.
[01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:24.520]   The big advantage here is the higher you can grow your assets than the government's interest rate,
[01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:29.640]   the more you can pass on and avoid the estate tax. It's your comment on highly appreciated assets,
[01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:33.880]   why it's become so valuable. If you take, let's just say, startup equity or something that has a
[01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:38.120]   low current market value, but you feel like there's a good bet in two years it's going to be
[01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:43.080]   worth $10,000 or $100,000 X that value, the government's assuming if you put it in, it's
[01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:47.960]   worth $10,000 today. And let's just say, three years from now, it's going to be worth $10 million.
[01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:52.760]   The government is assuming that $10,000 is growing at 2% a year.
[01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:58.280]   So, it's negligibly going to be worth nothing in $10,000 to $15,000 in three years. All of that
[01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:04.520]   upside passes on without paying the estate tax. That's so interesting. So, it's probably not
[01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:09.800]   a tool that's useful to the average person who's not even coming close to $24 million.
[01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:14.120]   But if you own a business or you own a piece of a business that's worth
[01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:18.360]   10s or 100s of millions of dollars, or you think you might, it could come into play.
[01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:22.840]   The purpose of this conversation is not to necessarily share every tactic that everyone
[01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:28.120]   listening can use, but to unveil the mystery behind some of these things we hear about. And so,
[01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:33.400]   it's fascinating to hear. And your example, by the way, was just for two years. I assume if we
[01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:40.440]   continue that example for 20-30 years, the compounding of the S&P at 10% leaves a whole
[01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:47.720]   lot more than $30,000 or what would have grown at 2%. Yeah, exactly. Every year that you do this,
[01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:51.080]   you're able to leverage the difference between the government's assumed growth rate and what
[01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:55.720]   you can get to pass on even more value. One of the more prominent examples was when before
[01:06:55.720 --> 01:07:01.720]   Facebook IPO-ed Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, Dustin Moskovitz, they all set up grats. They took
[01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:06.520]   the pre-IPO price of their Facebook shares. They put those shares in. They set up for I don't know
[01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:12.360]   how many years. And then after the IPO, all of that appreciation was able to pass on and avoid
[01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:17.800]   the estate tax. So, this is to your point of if you have a family business that's worth 8 or 9
[01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:23.640]   figures or you're already above that, it's a really powerful tool to minimize those estate
[01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:29.880]   taxes and preserve as much of your hard-earned income for future generations. That's so fascinating.
[01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:36.040]   So, I am quite comfortable right now, which is actually true almost every day. And that's thanks
[01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:40.520]   to Viore. And I'm excited to be partnering with them for this episode. They make performance
[01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:45.480]   apparel that's incredibly versatile. Everything is designed to work out in, but it doesn't look
[01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:50.200]   or feel like it at all. And it's so freaking comfortable, you will want to wear it all the
[01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:54.200]   time. Seriously, I am pretty sure it's more comfortable than whatever you're wearing right
[01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:58.920]   now, unless you're wearing Viore, in which case you already know what I mean. And it's not just
[01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:05.000]   for men. My wife is as obsessed with Viore as I am. My favorite is the Sunday Performance Joggers.
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:09.560]   I think I have three pairs and they are probably the most comfortable pants I've ever owned.
[01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:14.920]   Their products can be used for just about any activity, whether it's running, training, or yoga.
[01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:19.320]   They're also great for lounging, running around town, or their meta pants can even work for a
[01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:24.840]   night out. Honestly, I think Viore is an investment in your happiness. And for all the Hacks listeners,

[01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:13.000]   and let our sponsor Drizzly, the go-to app for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:17.640]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together. It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:22.040]   It could be your dog's birthday, that the sun finally came out, or maybe you just want to
[01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:27.400]   celebrate that you got through another week. With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy by taking the
[01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:32.200]   drink run off your to-do list, which means you can entice your friends to leave their houses
[01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:37.160]   without ever leaving yours. And since I know you like a good deal, Drizzly compares prices
[01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:41.960]   on their massive selection of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores. So, when I really
[01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:46.120]   wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting family last week, not only could I get
[01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:51.800]   an Italian Amaro delivered in less than an hour, but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor
[01:09:51.800 --> 01:10:00.440]   store. So, whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com. That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com

[01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:31.560]   to come back to charitable lead trust. Less about appreciated assets, but still helpful to avoid
[01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:34.760]   taxes in a high-income year. Can you talk a little bit about those?
[01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:39.160]   Yeah. The long name of it is charitable lead annuity trust. This is a really powerful tool
[01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:43.880]   if you've got a big bonus, or short-term capital gains, or high ordinary income,
[01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:48.360]   to be able to write off your income today. And the way that this works is you set up
[01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:52.680]   this charitable lead trust for a number of years, let's just say 20 years,
[01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:56.840]   and you put a million dollars into it. You get a million-dollar charitable deduction
[01:10:56.840 --> 01:11:02.760]   today to write off your income. But you're not giving that entire million dollars away now.
[01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:06.680]   You're actually able to reinvest it. So, you're able to take that million dollars,
[01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:11.000]   you put it in charitable lead trust, you put it into the market where it's going to grow
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:15.960]   10% a year, 8% a year, whatever you assumed is, and you get a charitable deduction now.
[01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:19.640]   Probably wondering like, "Why would you get a charitable deduction now if you're not giving
[01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:24.840]   away the money?" It's similar in some sense to a donor advice fund, where with a charitable
[01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:28.760]   lead trust, you're promising in the future years to give away a set amount of money
[01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:33.800]   to a charitable cause. So, it could be a donor advice fund, could be a foundation,
[01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:37.160]   could be the American Red Cross. But you're promising to do that in the future.
[01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:43.400]   So, you can say that in year two, I'm going to give $10,000. Year three, $15,000. Year four,
[01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:47.640]   $20,000. And when you are setting up this charitable lead trust, essentially,
[01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:52.520]   the government is taking their interest rate, and they're figuring out what is the present value of
[01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:58.520]   their future donations. And so, they're taking that and they're giving you an upfront charitable
[01:11:58.520 --> 01:12:03.160]   deduction for the present value of those future charitable deductions. Now, a big part of this
[01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:08.280]   advantage is that discount rate that they're using, again, to the same kind of example as a
[01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:12.440]   grant, it tends to be lower than what you would be able to get if you invest your assets in the
[01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:19.160]   market. Right now, it's 2.2%. And I'm willing to bet that the markets are a little bit choppy now.
[01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:22.760]   But in a long time horizon, most of us would hope to achieve a better than 2.2%
[01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:28.120]   return in the market. So, you're able to write off your high tax income now,
[01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:33.320]   reinvest that money in the market, and give those charitable donations in the future.
[01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:39.480]   And any appreciation above what is donated to charity, you're able to at the end of the trust,
[01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:44.520]   so in 20 years in this situation, keep that money for yourself or have that money returned back to
[01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:50.600]   yourself or future generations. So, it's a great opportunity for folks that you can write off high
[01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:55.720]   tax income now, reinvest that money, and then give to charity later in the future.
[01:12:55.720 --> 01:13:00.360]   If people are just charitably inclined, it's a really good way to set aside money to go to a
[01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:05.960]   charity in the future, very comparable to a donor advice fund, except it also has some tax planning
[01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:11.240]   and estate planning benefits, if those matter to you as well. But it also just guarantees that,
[01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:15.320]   "Hey, this cause that you care about, you're going to set them up to receive X amount of money for
[01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:20.920]   how many ever years you set up the trust for." So, it has a lot of purposes, but really underutilized
[01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:27.240]   for folks who have a big bonus or high tax year. I know the assumed interest rate affects
[01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:31.240]   everything and the government's interest rate changes. But if you take an example of $1 million,
[01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:36.280]   you get that full write-off, you put $1 million in a charitable lead annuity trust,
[01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:41.400]   you're going to end up donating probably at least $1 million to charity.
[01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:48.040]   But because of the arbitrage, do you end up getting back $1 million? What ends up coming back?
[01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:51.640]   The easiest way to think about this is the longer you set the structure up for,
[01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:56.600]   and the faster your assets grow, the higher the rate. So, if you set this up for 25 years,
[01:13:56.600 --> 01:14:02.040]   and your assets are growing at 10% a year, you may get a 50% return on your capital than if
[01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:07.160]   you've done nothing at all. It may be an additional $500,000 in absolute cash that
[01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:10.520]   you're going to get on top of whatever that million is going to compound to.
[01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:15.960]   In a circumstance like this, I would give away $1 million into a charitable lead annuity trust,
[01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:19.480]   there would be donations made over the years, and I'd get the remainder.
[01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:24.680]   Had I not done that, I would have paid taxes. If you're in the highest brackets in California,
[01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:29.480]   I might have paid half a million dollars in taxes and I'm left with half a million to invest.
[01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:34.840]   Would I have been better off ever if I don't factor in the charitable donation? Do I actually
[01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:40.120]   ever end up being better off over a period of time if we assume a higher interest rate,
[01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:44.600]   like you said, a 10%? Yeah, this is where you can generate an additional
[01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:49.640]   half a million dollars. And this is the whole point. Take your situation that you brought up.
[01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:53.560]   If you're in a high tax rate place like California, if you earned a million dollars,
[01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:59.480]   you may pay literally half of it or more to the government. So you only have $500,000 to invest,
[01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:04.760]   versus if you're able to avoid taxes on that million dollars. If you have $500,000 in the
[01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:10.040]   market versus a million dollars being reinvested in the market, that million dollars is going to
[01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:14.360]   create a lot more compounding wealth. And that million dollars, you're going to give some of
[01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:20.280]   that to charity every single year. But just that million dollars compounding at 8% or whatever our
[01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:25.000]   assumed growth rate is here, it's going to over a long period, over 20 plus years, 25 years,
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:28.760]   going to create a lot more wealth. For 25 years, taking a base case, you'll probably create an
[01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:31.960]   additional half a million dollars of wealth for yourself after taxes.
[01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:37.080]   Not factoring in the fact that you're generating probably at least that or more
[01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:40.040]   in charitable contributions. Yeah. Yeah. So it's really like
[01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:43.560]   you're creating an additional half a million dollars of wealth for yourself,
[01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:49.480]   plus you're creating probably $1.2-$1.3 million in charitable causes to help advance things that you
[01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:54.040]   personally care about. So you're doing good in the world, you're creating wealth for yourself.
[01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:58.120]   It's a really powerful combination. Let's say someone decided that this year was a really big
[01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:03.640]   year, they had a big windfall, and they were going to donate $100,000 to their donor advised fund,
[01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:07.080]   or just to the American Red Cross or whatever the cause it may be.
[01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:12.200]   If you were already planning on giving away money, is there any reason that this wouldn't
[01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:17.160]   have as much or more impact on both the charity and the returns you get back?
[01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:21.000]   No. This has tax benefits. Using this, you're going to come out further ahead
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:25.480]   than any of those other strategies. The only downside, if you take the charity's point of view,
[01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:31.000]   if you give $1 million to the Red Cross this year, they'll get $1 million this year.
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:36.040]   Whereas if you put it into a charitable lead annuity trust, they may get $1.2 million over
[01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:40.680]   25 years. So there's a "when you plan to give it, how much do you want to give?"
[01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:46.520]   But from a "they'll, over the long run, get more money." But with a donor advised fund,
[01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:50.920]   or just giving directly to the Red Cross, you're not going to get any tax benefits out of it.
[01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:54.680]   So that's the big difference. With a donor advised fund, you also get that big upfront
[01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:58.600]   charitable deduction. So if you put in $1 million into a donor advised fund,
[01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:01.080]   or you give to the Red Cross, you get that upfront charitable deduction.
[01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:05.320]   But you don't get any money at the end of the trust that comes back to you.
[01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:09.560]   When you give it to those two causes, that kind of money is gone. It's doing good in the world,
[01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:15.320]   but you're not getting any money that returns to you. With the charitable lead annuity trust,
[01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:19.800]   you get that upfront charitable deduction. Money over those 25 years goes to the Red Cross,
[01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:22.920]   and then whatever's left in the trust at the end returns back to you.
[01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:27.000]   So that's the cherry on top that you get at the end that's not available with those other
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:31.560]   structures. I don't know why, but for some reason, it seems like every time I talk to
[01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:37.080]   someone from New York, they all seem really excited about islets, which I know are related
[01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:40.920]   to life insurance. Is there a reason why it's so great in New York? I don't understand,
[01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:44.280]   as I read them, why they're as cool as some people make them sound.
[01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:50.280]   Yeah. Insurance is its own interesting niche where there's a lot of tax opportunities.
[01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:53.720]   The core thing is it tends to be more of an estate planning structure. Essentially,
[01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:58.920]   an islet stands for irrevocable life insurance trust. And what you're really doing is you're
[01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:03.640]   buying life insurance, you're putting it into this irrevocable trust. And so you're really
[01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:09.880]   gifting the benefits of life insurance. So i.e. the payout when you pass away to your kids or
[01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:15.720]   spouse or whoever it is. The big benefit is hopefully when you buy your life insurance,
[01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:20.920]   your risk of dying is pretty low. So your life insurance is valued at a pretty low rate.
[01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:27.160]   So let's say it's worth $100,000 now. It's worth $100,000. You put it in this irrevocable trust.
[01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:32.120]   Over time, you will continue contributing the premiums towards the life insurance.
[01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:37.080]   And that money in the life insurance is being reinvested in the market, or it's increasing
[01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:41.240]   the value of the policy as you naturally get older. And let's just say when you pass away,
[01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:47.560]   it's worth $5 million. That $5 million doesn't count towards your state gift limit. Because
[01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:52.760]   you contributed the asset when it was worth $100,000, it only counts if you give a $100,000
[01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:58.040]   gift to your kids or your future generations. Even though when you pass away, it may be worth
[01:18:58.040 --> 01:19:04.280]   $5 million. That's the key benefit is you're able to essentially lock in a low gift value
[01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:09.400]   and allow it to appreciate over time. Now, why is it so big in New York? I don't know.
[01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:14.120]   There's also a big thing to broadly watch out with life insurance. There's a lot of people
[01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:18.120]   who take a lot of cuts of the pie when they're selling it to you. And it tends to be really
[01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:24.040]   lucrative for brokers, agents, advisors. So people do love to sell life insurance because
[01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:28.280]   they know they're locking you in for a really long time horizon. And so there's a lot of
[01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:33.480]   commission that gets spread out. I don't know if that impacts New York, but it is definitely
[01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:38.200]   a powerful tool. I don't know if it's quite as important for folks who aren't worried about the
[01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:43.160]   estate tax to start with. My advice for life insurance has always been that term life is
[01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:47.800]   the thing that makes sense for almost everyone. And unless you're working with an accountant
[01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:52.520]   and an estate planning attorney that together decide that there's some more complex way to
[01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:58.840]   take advantage of a whole universal etc life set in a trust or even... And we won't go into it now,
[01:19:58.840 --> 01:20:04.600]   but private placement, life insurance, these other things. One, stick to term life. And two,
[01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:09.800]   almost all the other strategies are not really as beneficial unless you're at,
[01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:13.160]   approaching or over that $24 million estate tax limit.
[01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:17.320]   Yeah, 100% agree with that. I think in most cases, people a lot of times overthink this,
[01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:23.240]   or they get sold to. Most cases, people should just do the standard, "This term life insurance,
[01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:26.760]   you know what it is, you know what you're getting, you're not being sold to and being ripped off."
[01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:32.280]   And unless you have really particular needs, or a team that's getting each different answer,
[01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:37.480]   where it's like PPLI, etc, which makes sense in certain situations, it's better to keep it simple.
[01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:44.040]   I agree. I even had a listener send me an email and say, "Hey, I spent the last 10 years selling
[01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:48.200]   whole life. Please don't tell anyone on your show to buy it. I won't name who they are because I
[01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:52.120]   don't want to get them in trouble with their job." But even a guy who sells it said he wouldn't
[01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:57.320]   recommend it. And ultimately, what I understand is with this estate tax limit, all of the estate tax
[01:20:57.320 --> 01:21:04.280]   planning tactics are really just about trying to take a bigger amount of money and fit it into a
[01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:09.000]   smaller amount now so that you can donate it when it's less and counts less towards your limit.
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:13.640]   Another one that I know I found, which is outside of the trust world, so I'll do my
[01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:19.240]   best to explain it, is around setting up a partnership or an LLC for your family.
[01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:25.320]   And the way I understood it was, you create this LLC, you put assets in it or a partnership,
[01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:33.240]   and you give the value of that business goes to your heirs, but the control of the asset
[01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:38.200]   stays with you. And so the IRS will give you this benefit of saying, "Oh, well,
[01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:44.840]   if you're giving your children a business that has $50 million, but you control all of it and
[01:21:44.840 --> 01:21:48.440]   they don't get to choose what happens, well, you could lose it all. You could make terrible
[01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:52.280]   investments. So we're going to give a huge discount." And I don't know what that discount
[01:21:52.280 --> 01:21:57.080]   is. I think it's closer to like 80%. So now you're able to say, "Oh, I'm giving my kids
[01:21:57.080 --> 01:22:02.600]   a $10 million business instead of a $50 million business." And then when you pass away,
[01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:06.760]   the control is transferred. My understanding is that all these estate planning tactics are like,
[01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:10.840]   "How do you find a way to give large sums of money either now or in the future today,
[01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:13.720]   when you can price them or value them at a lot less?"
[01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:18.120]   Yeah. That nailed it on the head. And there's 3 descriptions people often
[01:22:18.120 --> 01:22:21.800]   call this. They call it like, "How do you gift values?" It's called the freeze.
[01:22:21.800 --> 01:22:25.640]   You freeze it at its current value when you expect it to appreciate in the future.
[01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:29.640]   Let's just say you have startup equity or something you expect to appreciate significantly.
[01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:33.560]   You gift it at the low value today. And then when it appreciates in the future,
[01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:37.160]   it's already in the ownership of a trust or your kids.
[01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:40.920]   And that future value doesn't count as your gift value. So that's the freeze.
[01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:45.080]   There's also a term called the burn. Whether it's you paying taxes, this is where
[01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:51.800]   grats come into play. So in a grat, even though the assets, some of the money is coming back to you,
[01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:58.920]   all the appreciation passes on to your kids, you are liable for the taxes that are paid on assets
[01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:02.920]   income realized in the trust. And the big advantage of this is you're literally...
[01:23:02.920 --> 01:23:07.080]   By paying the taxes personally, you're reducing the value of your estate.
[01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:11.880]   So in other words, you're burning down your estate. And then the third category is discounting.
[01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:16.440]   Whether it's control with these family partnerships of... You can structure these
[01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:21.560]   things in all sorts of different ways, whether it's control, or it's a hard-to-value asset,
[01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:24.920]   or you reduce the intangibles. How do you reduce the value
[01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:29.880]   below what you probably think it's worth or what you can actually realize in the market?
[01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:33.960]   There's a famous example where Phil Knight, the founder of Nike,
[01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:39.800]   took Nike shares, put it in an LLC. And then he gifted parts of it over time to his son.
[01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:44.680]   And each time he just gave it to his son, it was at a discount because it was a non-controlling
[01:23:44.680 --> 01:23:48.520]   interest. And so he's able to take something like a 15 or a little bit higher discount on
[01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:53.880]   those assets, even though Nike shares are very liquid. We can sell them at any time in the market.
[01:23:53.880 --> 01:23:57.480]   But because it was part of this structure, they're able to discount it.
[01:23:57.480 --> 01:24:01.560]   And so as a result, from an IRS standpoint, he was giving less value,
[01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:04.760]   which means there's less taxable gifting that he had to pay to the government.
[01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:10.200]   I'm holding this document up here that I got from Morgan Stanley at a talk once.
[01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:13.960]   And it's like, "Here are the better outcomes of using all these strategies." And in this case,
[01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:18.600]   it's a crazy one that I'll run through it. But it said, "If you just set up a basic
[01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:22.520]   revocable trust and you transfer money, and you have exactly $45 million,
[01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:28.680]   by the time your children get the money 30 years later, you're going to have $281 million,
[01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:32.920]   but you'll pay $112 million in taxes, and they'll only get $190 million."
[01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:37.400]   And they're like, "But if you go through..." And in this example,
[01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:42.840]   they set up a family limited partnership, a grat and a revocable trust, and then 2
[01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:47.960]   defective irrevocable trusts. So it's like the most complex, insane example that...
[01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:51.960]   By the way, if you have $45 or $50 million, you're probably working with someone to do
[01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:57.560]   stuff like this. But at the end of the day, it says your net estate post-tax with this example
[01:24:57.560 --> 01:25:04.040]   was $500 million versus the $198 million that you would have paid in the previous example,
[01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:08.920]   netting you an extra $300 million. So we talked about some of these strategies.
[01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:13.320]   And while they might not practically be relevant for most people listening,
[01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:20.040]   it's pretty crazy to dig into the way they work for certain people and how they're able to unlock,
[01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:22.520]   in this case, hundreds of millions of dollars of value.
[01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:28.440]   There's one more thing that you guys do around stretch IRAs that I think might actually benefit
[01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:31.880]   people who are in circumstances like this. Correct me if I'm wrong.
[01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:33.160]   Do you want to talk a little bit about that?
[01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:38.440]   Yeah. And before I get into that, people hear about these trusts. And for most people,
[01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:42.280]   they don't mean much. But the returns are pretty incredible. In that situation,
[01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:49.320]   it's an additional $300 million on $200 million of assets. Whether you have $50 million or a
[01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:53.480]   couple $100,000, there's a lot of these opportunities. Now, the big challenge for
[01:25:53.480 --> 01:26:00.760]   most people is... A sad fact is the US tax code for the last 50 years has grown by 150,000 words
[01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:06.360]   a year. There's just no way you can keep up. And so what this means is unless you have that team
[01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:10.360]   of lawyers and accountants, you're going to miss out on these opportunities and you're going to
[01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:14.680]   significantly fall behind. And not to get too biased, that's the problem we're trying to solve
[01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:18.600]   is how do we use technology to help people find and take advantage of these opportunities?
[01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:23.640]   Because otherwise, the tax code is not built for someone who doesn't have high 9-figures.
[01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:28.360]   It's funny, you mentioned someone who has $50 million. Most of the situations we see in this
[01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:31.720]   world is there's folks with that, they don't actually have access to good folks in this.
[01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:35.800]   Because it's one of the hardest things to get access to is high-quality folks who can help
[01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:40.040]   you with this tax and estate planning. Because guess what? Like all the family offices with
[01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:45.800]   billionaires, they tend to snap up the best folks in those spaces. Because it's just so valuable.
[01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:49.000]   You're talking about those results that you're seeing there, that's hundreds of percent of
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:53.480]   additional value for your children. If you're a billionaire, what price aren't you going to pay?
[01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:59.240]   And there's no way that me or you or your audience can compete on a per hour basis or salary to hire
[01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:04.520]   that best person that billionaire wants. It just creates this huge challenge for folks to take
[01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:08.760]   advantage of the stuff despite how meaningful it is. Jumping to the Stretch IRA piece, this is
[01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:14.440]   probably one of the most applicable things for most people of tax planning opportunities for
[01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:19.800]   context. Most Americans, when they're building wealth for their retirement and their financial
[01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:25.800]   safety net, they use either a standard IRA or a Roth IRA. They're actually irrevocable trusts
[01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:30.760]   that the government has specifically created and outlined benefits for to help people better save
[01:27:30.760 --> 01:27:38.360]   assets for their retirement. With a standard IRA, it allows you to contribute pre-tax money,
[01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:43.480]   and it allows the assets to grow in an IRA on a tax-free basis until you start taking withdrawals
[01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:49.240]   after you're 59 and a half. Now, historically, when people pass away and they have an IRA with
[01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:55.880]   money, they would do what's called over a Stretch IRA or Rollover IRA, where let's say it was my
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:28:01.480]   parents. Their IRA would roll into my IRA. And so, it would stay on a pre-tax basis,
[01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:06.920]   and it would keep growing and compounding. And I would wait until I'm 59 and a half to start taking
[01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:14.440]   distributions and paying taxes. Now, in 2020, there was a law called the Secure Act passed,
[01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:19.240]   which essentially stopped people from being able to roll over their IRA between generations.
[01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:24.200]   So now, instead of my parents' IRA being able to roll over into my IRA, I have to keep it in their
[01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:29.400]   IRA for a max of 10 years. And then when I do withdraw it, I have to pay ordinary income tax
[01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:34.600]   rates on all the withdrawals. So, if you're in California and New York, you may be paying 50%
[01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:42.840]   to 55% of those assets. The solution that's come about since the Secure Act was passed in 2020
[01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:48.760]   is people taking their parents' IRA, being willed and rolled over into a charitable remainder trust.
[01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:54.360]   And the big benefit of this is when it passes the charitable remainder trust,
[01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:58.920]   it can remain in there for more than 10 years and keep compounding on a pre-tax basis.
[01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:03.800]   So you get a lot of the benefits of the Stretch IRA, where instead of rolling over from my
[01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:10.360]   parents' IRA to my IRA, it is rolling over from my parents' IRA to my charitable remainder trust,
[01:29:10.360 --> 01:29:16.120]   but can keep growing on a pre-tax basis and isn't constrained to 10 years. And once it's in the
[01:29:16.120 --> 01:29:22.040]   charitable remainder trust, the appreciation after that rollover isn't taxed at ordinary
[01:29:22.040 --> 01:29:25.880]   income rates. So, that appreciation isn't going to be taxed at 50%. If you're in California,
[01:29:25.880 --> 01:29:31.320]   it'll be taxed at 35% long-term capital gains. So, you get more pre-tax growth,
[01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:34.600]   as well as you can pay lower tax rates on the withdrawals.
[01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:38.600]   We see a lot of folks whose parents are getting elderly and they're planning for
[01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:42.600]   how do they pass on these assets, particularly a lot of financial advisors who are trying to
[01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:47.640]   help their clients for intergenerational planning, really roll this out to their clientele,
[01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:50.520]   for them to help create more wealth in the family, preserve that.
[01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:55.720]   Because the Secure Act was just passed in 2020, most folks aren't aware of the best way to deal
[01:29:55.720 --> 01:30:00.600]   with it. Because again, unfortunately, the tax code isn't accessible. And so, you've got a lot
[01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:04.760]   of folks where they have money, they've contributed money to their life, but it's really hard to
[01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:09.000]   figure out what do I do. And even though it is meaningful, it's a tough challenge.
[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:13.960]   You said some of the tax code is not accessible. But on top of that, a long time ago, before I
[01:30:13.960 --> 01:30:20.200]   think the myths of the tax avoidance trusts to avoid state taxes, which we won't get into now
[01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:25.000]   because I think it came out that a lot of states outlawed them. I was looking into this and I
[01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:31.240]   realized, "Oh, wow. One of the reasons that this isn't easy for people to do is that the cost to
[01:30:31.240 --> 01:30:36.600]   administer these trusts and to set up the trust were so high that I spent all this time talking
[01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:41.800]   to someone and found out, "Wow, this is a great way to maybe avoid high California taxes," only
[01:30:41.800 --> 01:30:46.280]   to find out they were like, "Well, it's going to cost us $25,000 to set up a trust. And you're
[01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:50.760]   going to pay 1.5% a year for someone to manage and administer it and do the investments."
[01:30:50.760 --> 01:30:53.720]   And I was immediately like, "Well, you should have said that up front because I didn't have
[01:30:53.720 --> 01:30:58.760]   enough money for that to make any difference." But can you tell us a little bit before we wrap
[01:30:58.760 --> 01:31:04.440]   about how you guys are trying to make this a little bit more accessible and affordable,
[01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:09.800]   especially for people that might benefit from the charitable remainder, the charitable lead trust,
[01:31:09.800 --> 01:31:13.960]   which aren't necessarily tools for people with $24+ million.
[01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:19.240]   Yeah, definitely. Funny enough, the situation you talked about, that was the reason I started
[01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:23.560]   the company, was I went through that exact situation. And when I saw lawyers' costs and
[01:31:23.560 --> 01:31:28.520]   accountants' costs, it made the ROI negative for me to set it up. And going through that process,
[01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:32.680]   you realize there's a better way to do it. And so, the idea behind Valor is that we've
[01:31:32.680 --> 01:31:37.320]   automated a lot of the setup and administration for these charitable remainder trusts,
[01:31:37.320 --> 01:31:42.440]   charitable lead trusts, and GRATS so that there are no legal fees up front. So, instead of paying
[01:31:42.440 --> 01:31:48.440]   that lawyer $25,000, you're avoiding that. And then also, the annual fees to administer these
[01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:52.600]   trusts, we've dropped those. Compared to that situation, we're less than a sixth of their costs.
[01:31:52.600 --> 01:31:56.280]   Compared to most of the other folks we see in the market, we're less than half the cost.
[01:31:56.280 --> 01:32:01.240]   And the whole idea is, by dropping these costs, we can make the ROI worthwhile for more folks and
[01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:05.960]   help them build more wealth. We've obviously both been building companies in this space.
[01:32:05.960 --> 01:32:11.320]   The whole premise of fintech is that you can use technology to enable others to build wealth more
[01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:15.480]   efficiently and open up opportunities. And that's what we're doing here. How do you take
[01:32:15.480 --> 01:32:21.080]   these black box of irrevocable trust and wealth building structures that historically have only
[01:32:21.080 --> 01:32:25.640]   been available to those with 9 figures and help everyone build wealth using them?
[01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:30.040]   Yeah, it's fantastic. The blog posts you guys have written on the Valor site are great. They
[01:32:30.040 --> 01:32:34.120]   go into more detail than most companies do. I'm going to link to a handful of them in the show
[01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:38.200]   notes so that people can go check them out. If they have any questions or want to reach out to
[01:32:38.200 --> 01:32:46.040]   you guys, where should people find you? valor.io, V-A-L-U-R.io. Always happy to chat with folks
[01:32:46.040 --> 01:32:50.760]   there to answer more questions. We have, as you mentioned, a lot of content. We also take calls
[01:32:50.760 --> 01:32:54.920]   with folks to help walk them through and understand these structures as well. So that's the best place
[01:32:54.920 --> 01:33:00.040]   to reach us. Awesome. Thank you so much for being here. Yeah, really appreciate it, Chris. I
