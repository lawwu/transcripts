[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.400]   We come this evening to a consideration of verses 4 and 5 in the ninth chapter of Paul's
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.880]   epistle to the Romans.
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:19.960]   Verses 4 and 5 in the ninth chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans.
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:27.080]   Who are Israelites, to whom pertaineth the adduction, and the glory, and the covenants,
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:33.520]   and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises.
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:42.040]   Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all God
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.360]   blessed forever.
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:50.280]   Now, these two verses come, as most of you will remember, immediately after what the
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.120]   apostle has been saying in these first three verses.
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:03.760]   "I could," he says, "wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen,
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:10.400]   according to the flesh, who are Israelites," etc.
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:18.280]   In other words, in these two verses, the great apostle proceeds now to give us his exact
[00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:26.040]   and his detailed reasons for feeling this continual sorrow in his heart and his great
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:33.040]   heaviness for his kinsmen, according to the flesh.
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:39.500]   Now, we were emphasizing last week and the week before that there is undoubtedly in this
[00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:46.760]   a very great element of what one may call nationalism or natural human feeling.
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:53.960]   We stressed the point that though we become Christian, we do not become unnatural.
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:01.440]   The fundamental orders of creation are not abolished by Christianity, and there is nothing
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:08.120]   wrong in that a man should be particularly interested in the affairs of his own nation
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.800]   and in his own family.
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:17.800]   It is God who has appointed the bounds of all nations and has ordained that we should
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.660]   come into this world into families.
[00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:30.840]   So we were emphasizing that there was not only nothing wrong in feeling and experiencing
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:38.480]   such sentiments, as the apostle gives expression to here, but we must not stop at that.
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.440]   We have got to go beyond that, because it is made abundantly plain and clear here that
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:50.440]   the apostle's chiefest concern for his kinsmen, according to the flesh, was not a national
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:59.720]   one or even a natural one, but was indeed particularly a religious one.
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.400]   And what makes him grieve, as he does, is his realization, as he here points out to
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:12.080]   us, of their unique relationship to God.
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.800]   And that is the thing that he proceeds to expound in these two verses.
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:25.120]   The apostle, after all, was primarily and essentially now a Christian man and an apostle,
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.360]   a man with a profound understanding of God's ways with respect to men and the whole great
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.840]   purpose and scheme and plan of salvation.
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.400]   And it is as he contemplates the condition of his kinsmen, according to the flesh, in
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:45.480]   the light of that, and particularly in the light of God's purpose of salvation, as
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:51.280]   it was worked out under the Old Testament dispensation, that he finds himself thus in
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:57.920]   a state of perpetual great heaviness and continual sorrow of heart.
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:08.680]   Very well, so we come to look at these two verses, in which he shows us the unique position
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:17.320]   of the Jews, the children of Israel, the people to whom he belonged by nature.
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:24.520]   Here he puts before us the unique privileges that they had always enjoyed, because they
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.360]   were the people that they were.
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.720]   Now then, come and let us look at these two verses together.
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.720]   They are two very important verses, and they are important for many reasons.
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:42.880]   One is that an understanding of them and their meaning is absolutely essential to following
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.680]   the apostle's argument in this chapter and in the following chapters.
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.040]   That is why he puts it here at the beginning.
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.280]   If we are not clear about these people and what was true of them, obviously we shall
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:01.640]   be in difficulties when we come to try to follow his detailed argument as he works it
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.040]   out in the three chapters.
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.760]   So it is a very important statement from that standpoint.
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.880]   But I suggest that it is an important statement also in another way, and this is also a very
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.360]   practical one.
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.000]   These two verses I suggest to you, before we look at them any further, are a very good
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.920]   test of us, a very good test of our method of Bible study and Bible reading.
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.080]   We have probably read these two verses many times.
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.340]   What have they told us?
[00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.640]   What have they meant to us?
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.320]   What have they really conveyed to us?
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:46.600]   How easy it is to skip over these two verses and read these great statements without stopping
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:52.200]   to consider what exactly they are saying, what exactly they mean, and what exactly they
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.920]   are to convey to us.
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:59.880]   I wonder what the result would be if I turned this meeting into a kind of examination at
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:05.080]   the moment and just said, "Well, now, what have these two verses always said to you?
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.320]   What has been their significance to you?
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:11.560]   What effect have they had upon you?"
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:18.320]   I say this for this good reason, that while I, of course, am in entire agreement with
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:24.680]   all schemes for Bible readings, it does seem to me that we must always remember that the
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.840]   mere reading of the Bible in and of itself is not sufficient.
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.920]   Indeed, it can be quite useless.
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.400]   How do we read?
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.200]   Are we merely content with saying, "I've done my daily portion," and then go on to
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:43.000]   something else, or do we stop and allow the Scriptures to speak to us and to give us their
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.840]   own message and to lead us into the truth?
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:52.720]   Now, what have these two verses said to us in the past?
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:58.400]   Have we found that they are verses that make us stop and explore them, or have we just
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.880]   regarded them as a kind of catalogue of things that are true about the children of Israel
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:07.720]   and have gone on to see this great argument that comes later on?
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.560]   Let every man examine himself.
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:15.120]   It's very valuable, therefore, from that purely practical standpoint.
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:22.040]   Well, then, another value in this statement, in these two verses, is this, that they really
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:27.640]   do give us a most extraordinary summary of the whole of the Old Testament.
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:33.600]   The apostle here, in two verses, has really given us a masterly summary of the whole of
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:39.200]   the Old Testament, in a sense, so that it's of extreme importance in that respect.
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:44.000]   And may I emphasize this, a summary not only of the teaching of the Old Testament, but
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.960]   also of the history of the Old Testament.
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:51.760]   I emphasize that, of course, because there are certain superficial, foolish people at
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:57.240]   the present time, calling themselves Christians in the Church, who think it's clever to
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:02.240]   attack the Old Testament, and particularly the history of the Old Testament.
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.720]   They think they're being clever, they think they're being very spiritual.
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.760]   They're not interested in the history, they say.
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:12.200]   They're interested in the Jesus of the New Testament and what he's got to say.
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:17.080]   And they're not interested in the giving of the law and Mount Sinai and things like that.
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.800]   And they're very doubtful about Abram and so on.
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:25.440]   You know, these superficial, clever people, who like to get a little notoriety from doing
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.880]   that sort of thing.
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:37.000]   Well, you see, these two verses alone show us the utter vacuity of such a procedure,
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.880]   of such statements.
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:42.440]   You can't divide the two Testaments in that way.
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:48.360]   So that it's very interesting as a summary of the whole of the Old Testament.
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:55.520]   But still more important, and this is the last general point I make about it, is this.
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:09:03.280]   Here we are shown very plainly how essential the Old Testament is to a true understanding
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:06.280]   of the New Testament.
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:09.120]   I'm going to try to show you that.
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:14.120]   That there are terms which are used in the New Testament which become quite meaningless
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:19.000]   unless we know something about the Old Testament.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.040]   That is why the Christian Church undoubtedly at the beginning, when she came to form this
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:29.760]   book of hers, which we call the Bible, was led of the Holy Spirit not to throw overboard
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:33.840]   the Old Testament, but to incorporate it with her new documents.
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:38.920]   So you have your old and your new, and they're put together, and it's one book, one volume,
[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:42.520]   because the two are so intermingled.
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:46.600]   The old points to the new, and the new is constantly pointing back to the old.
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:52.280]   And as I say, you just can't interpret certain things in the new unless you have a knowledge
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:53.280]   of the old.
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:58.440]   Very well, these two verses are of extreme importance in all those different ways.
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:03.280]   Very well, having said that, let's now proceed to an examination of the very statements which
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:04.840]   are made by the Apostle.
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:05.840]   Who?
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:06.840]   Who are Israelites?
[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.920]   That's how he introduces it.
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:14.920]   "I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according
[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:15.920]   to the flesh."
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:16.920]   Who are Israelites?
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:24.680]   Now, the word translated here, "who," is a very interesting word.
[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:30.180]   And this "who" alone is really not enough.
[00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:40.800]   The Apostle here used a double word, a double relative, in order to bring out the elements
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:50.480]   of character and of quality that characterize these people about whom he is writing.
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:57.240]   He says, "These kinsmen of mine according to the flesh are of the following character
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.240]   and quality."
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.040]   That's what "who" really means.
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.640]   It's a very strong word.
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:08.080]   "My kinsmen according to the flesh who are such that"—that would be a better translation—"who
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:12.760]   are such that they are Israelites," and so on.
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:15.000]   Or another way of putting it is this.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:24.560]   Instead of "who," the very ones who inasmuch as they are Israelites, etc., or still you
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:30.040]   might put it like this, "who are of such a character or quality to be Israelites."
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:31.040]   Now that's it.
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:33.560]   That's perhaps the best of them all.
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:38.200]   "These kinsmen of mine according to the flesh," he says, "are of such a character and quality
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.200]   as to be."
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:47.040]   And then comes the various items in the list that he puts before us.
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:52.880]   Well, you notice that that in itself then is a matter of interest and of importance.
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:59.200]   You see, the Apostle is out to show us this terrible tragedy, this almost inconceivable
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:05.560]   tragedy, this fact that he came unto his own and his own received him not.
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:06.560]   That's what he's saying.
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:09.800]   John is in amazement at it in his prologue.
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:14.280]   The Apostle here is expressing the same thing but with much greater fullness in order to
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:17.680]   bring out this utter astonishment at the thing.
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:23.640]   Very well, the little word "who," translated "who" in and of itself, opens up a kind
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:28.500]   of vista thereof, "such a character and such a quality as to be."
[00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:32.680]   And the first word we come to is the word "Israelites."
[00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:35.880]   Now then, let's look at this.
[00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:38.780]   Why did the Apostle, do you think, use this particular word?
[00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:41.860]   Why didn't he say, "who are Jews?"
[00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:45.360]   Why didn't he say, "who are Hebrews?"
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:48.240]   Because both things are true.
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:52.240]   But he says, "who are Israelites."
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:55.960]   And this, of course, has very real significance.
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.600]   Now let me put it to you like this.
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:03.920]   Let's look at these three terms, Jew, Hebrew, Israelite.
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:10.240]   You will generally find that one or the other is used in particular places with a very definite
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.440]   and specific object.
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:14.300]   Now, we mustn't press this too far.
[00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:16.320]   It can be carried too far.
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:20.200]   You know there are friends who do that, and they form movements as the result of doing
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.200]   that.
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:26.800]   There are those who would say that we in this kingdom are Israelites.
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:30.880]   We're not Jews, but we're Israelites, British Israelites.
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:37.560]   That's because of over-pressing the distinction between these various terms as they're used
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:38.560]   and implied.
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:46.920]   Now, we mustn't overdo it, but we must recognize that there is a difference, and that very
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:52.400]   often, indeed, generally we may even say, when the one or the other is used, there is
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:54.520]   some reason for doing so.
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:59.520]   Very well, let's start with the commonest, which is Jew.
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:06.120]   When the term Jew is used to describe these people, why is it used?
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:12.000]   And the answer is that it's generally used in order to draw the contrast and the distinction
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.220]   between the Jews, these people, and the Gentiles.
[00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:21.200]   Jew is generally the opposite, the antithesis, to Gentile.
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:26.080]   Now, we've got an example of that in the 24th verse of this very chapter that we are
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.080]   studying.
[00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:34.360]   "Even us," he says, "whom he hath called not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles."
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:37.040]   That's quite a typical illustration of this very thing.
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:42.640]   Then we've got it again in the 12th verse of the next chapter, the 10th chapter, where
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:47.080]   we read, "For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek, for the same Lord over
[00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:52.240]   all is rich unto all that call upon him."
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.440]   Exactly the same distinction.
[00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:58.520]   We've already met it in chapter 3, in verse 29.
[00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:01.560]   Is he the God of the Jews only?
[00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:04.880]   Is he not also of the Gentiles?
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:10.720]   You see, it's generally the term which is used to bring out the contrast and the difference
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:16.280]   between these people and the Gentiles.
[00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:22.320]   This peculiar race, this nation, and all the others who are the Gentiles, Jew as opposite
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.320]   to Gentile.
[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:25.920]   Very well, look at the second term, Hebrew.
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:30.960]   "I am a Hebrew of the Hebrews," says the apostle.
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:34.320]   When the term Hebrew is used, why is it used?
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:41.440]   And the answer is that these people are described as Hebrews when the object is to bring out
[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.760]   the fact that they spoke Hebrew.
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:50.360]   Now, there were certain Jews at the time of our Lord in the first century, there were
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:54.240]   certain Jews who did not any longer speak Hebrew.
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:57.240]   These were some of the Jews of the dispersion.
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:02.000]   They had long since left the land of Palestine and they'd mixed up with other races and nations
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.440]   and people, and they were no longer Hebrew-speaking people.
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:10.280]   But they had adopted the Greek language or other languages.
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:13.520]   And therefore, they could not be called Hebrews.
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:17.000]   They are still Jews, but they are no longer called Hebrews.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.240]   You'll find that in the New Testament they are sometimes referred to as Hellenists, which
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:26.760]   simply tells us that they were Greek-speaking Hebrews.
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:28.200]   You get it in Acts 6.1.
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:33.880]   And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:40.840]   of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.
[00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:47.160]   Now the point is that Grecians and Hebrews were Jews.
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:52.640]   But the distinction is the Greek-speaking Jews and the Hebrew-speaking Jews.
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:56.320]   And it was between them that this dispute arose.
[00:16:56.320 --> 00:17:02.280]   So that when you get the term Hebrew, it generally brings out that idea that they still were
[00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:04.800]   those who spoke Hebrew.
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:11.720]   The others, you see, these Grecians, these Hellenists, they still had their Old Testament.
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:19.500]   But they used that Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Old Testament, instead of the Hebrew
[00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:20.720]   Old Testament.
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:22.880]   So that's why the term Hebrew is used.
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:27.440]   Now then, we come to the term in our text, Israelite.
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:29.000]   Why does he here say, "Who are Israelites?"
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.320]   Why doesn't he say, "Who are Jews," or "Who are Hebrews," or "Who are Grecian
[00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:35.320]   Jews?"
[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:36.320]   Why Israelites?
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:40.040]   Well, now this is the significant point, of course.
[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:44.800]   And in order to understand it, we've got to go back to what we read at the beginning
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:52.440]   this evening, that incident in the life of Jacob when he struggled there on that famous
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:58.200]   and fateful night at Peniel.
[00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:04.640]   And you remember this man came to him and they struggled until the breaking of the day.
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:09.200]   And the man said to Jacob, "Let me go, for the day breaketh."
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:13.120]   It's in Genesis 32, beginning at verse 24.
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:16.480]   And he said, "I will not let thee go, except thou bless me."
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.200]   And he said unto him, "What is thy name?"
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:19.600]   And he said, "Jacob."
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:23.560]   And he said, "Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel.
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:31.520]   For as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed."
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:39.920]   From that point, Jacob is known as Israel, and Israelites are the descendants of Jacob.
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:43.160]   Well, what is the significance of this?
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:48.520]   Well, of course, the significance is, as was pointed out there, in the giving of the name
[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:49.920]   to Jacob.
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:54.000]   He is one who has prevailed with God and with men.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.520]   He therefore becomes a prince.
[00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:03.440]   He becomes an object of special attention on God's part.
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:10.640]   They become God's chosen people in this peculiar manner, and are given this name to show that
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:13.720]   they are God's covenant people.
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:18.520]   God is now in a new and a unique relationship to these people.
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:19.800]   He becomes their God.
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:21.680]   He becomes their governor.
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:23.160]   They become God's people.
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:29.360]   They become a kind of theocracy, a people governed by God directly and immediately.
[00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:33.520]   Now that was true of no other nation whatsoever.
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:37.200]   You find this term constantly in the Old Testament and the New.
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:42.440]   We read that we as Christians now have become a chosen generation, a royal, priesthood,
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:47.200]   and holy nation, a peculiar people, a people for God's own peculiar position.
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.820]   That's what it means.
[00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:55.120]   Now that is the essence of this term "Israelite".
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:58.680]   You shall no longer be called Jacob, you shall be called Israel.
[00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:00.200]   God said that to him.
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:04.440]   And then out of that comes all the promises to these people.
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:11.040]   It is through these now that God is going to do his great work in this world and carry
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:15.120]   out his great purpose of salvation.
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:21.400]   So you see the apostle uses the term "Israelite" very deliberately indeed.
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:29.440]   Now this word in and of itself really sums up all the terms that are to follow apart
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:32.800]   from the reference to our Lord himself.
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:36.480]   But all these other things that are true of these people, the adoption of the glory and
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:42.840]   the covenants and the giving of the law and the service of God and the promises, are all
[00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:48.480]   the result of the fact that they have become Israelites.
[00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:55.880]   It is this word that tells us then of the unique relationship of these people to God
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:21:05.520]   as his chosen people in whom and through whom he is going to do this great work.
[00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:13.040]   Now you notice that the apostle uses the term here "of the whole nation", "of the people
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:15.600]   as a whole".
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:18.920]   That is something that is done very commonly in the Bible.
[00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:21.600]   There are statements made about the whole nation.
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:27.200]   Later on we shall find him saying that they are not all Israel that are of Israel.
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:30.680]   But here he is using it of them all.
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:33.400]   They are of Israel, all of them.
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:38.040]   Then he narrows it down when he wants to talk in particular about the saved.
[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:40.160]   They are the true Israel.
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:46.040]   But here he is using the term in as wide and as broad a manner as is possible to cover
[00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:53.960]   all who are the physical and lineal descendants of Jacob who was first of all called Israel,
[00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:55.560]   Israelites.
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:22:00.640]   So we see that there is a very real significance in the choice of this word rather than the
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:01.640]   word Jew.
[00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:04.320]   It is an advance upon the word Jew.
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:07.000]   The Israelites are still Jews.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:13.320]   Yes but this term emphasizes their unique relationship to God as his people.
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:16.200]   I will be their God, they shall be my people.
[00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:20.080]   It is said of them and it is said of them alone, nobody else.
[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:26.960]   Or as Amos puts it, "Ye only have I known of all the nations of the earth".
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:31.640]   Now all that is in this word Israelite.
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:33.960]   Shall I ask my question?
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:38.640]   Did you always stop when you read this verse to ask why Israelite and not Jew?
[00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:40.520]   Is there any significance?
[00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:43.960]   In other words you see when we come to the scripture, let's remember it is the word
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:44.960]   of God.
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:47.400]   We are not reading a textbook.
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:49.360]   We are not preparing for an examination.
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:50.520]   It is not like any other book.
[00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:52.100]   We need the Holy Spirit.
[00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:53.880]   We need to be enlightened.
[00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:58.040]   We need to watch everything because there is hidden treasure everywhere if we take the
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:59.200]   trouble to look for it.
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:01.920]   So we must not just be concerned to read our daily portion.
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:04.720]   Let's make sure that we understand it.
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:06.280]   Let's grapple with it.
[00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:07.600]   Let's ask it questions.
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:11.400]   Let's see exactly what it is saying and why it is saying it.
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:12.400]   Israelite not Jew.
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:13.720]   Very well, let's go on.
[00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:15.840]   The next term is the term adoption.
[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:18.320]   Who are Israelites?
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:21.480]   To whom pertaineth the adoption?
[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:22.480]   Now then what is this?
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:26.320]   Well, it says somebody there is no difficulty about that because we have already met that
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:27.320]   word.
[00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:32.320]   Haven't we already met that word in the previous chapter where we read in verse 14,
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:37.640]   "For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.
[00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:41.320]   For ye have not received the spirit of bondage against the fear, but ye have received the
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:46.080]   spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, 'Abba, Father!'"
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:48.760]   And we have met it in verse 23.
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:54.560]   Not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first fruits of the Spirit.
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:24:02.520]   Even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to whip the redemption of
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:03.520]   our body.
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:10.200]   Does this therefore just mean precisely what it meant in Romans 8.15 and in Romans 8.23?
[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:13.000]   And the answer of course is most certainly not.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   Why not?
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:21.160]   Because in the fifteenth verse of that eighth chapter he is talking in particular about
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:24.680]   those who are truly the sons of God, spiritually so.
[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:27.840]   They were led by the Spirit.
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:33.520]   Here he is including those who have become Christian from amongst the Jews and the Gentiles
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:34.520]   who have become Christian.
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:39.600]   He is talking here about the true Christian, the one who is born again, who is truly a
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:40.800]   son of God.
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:46.040]   And he says we have got the spirit of adoption because God has adopted us into his family.
[00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:49.240]   In verse 23 he obviously is using it in a different sense.
[00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:50.520]   It is something yet to come.
[00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:55.560]   We are waiting for the adoption, but here we are told that these Israelites have the
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:25:03.000]   adoption, the adoption pertained unto them, to whom also pertaineth the adoption.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.200]   So that here we see that we must not merely take words again.
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:10.200]   Here is another snare in Bible study, isn't it?
[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:15.200]   You just become a student of words and you turn up your lexicon and you are interested
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:18.520]   in words, but you have got to pay attention, you see, to the context also.
[00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:21.600]   It is essential to know the meaning of the word.
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:26.440]   Your lexicon is very valuable, but remember, take your context as well, let the context
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:28.480]   speak to you as well as the particular meaning.
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:33.080]   Otherwise you can be easily sidetracked and you can become a heretic without realizing
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:34.640]   that anything has happened to you at all.
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:39.200]   Very well, clearly then our term is not used here in the same way.
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:44.800]   And indeed the whole of the following argument makes this abundantly clear also.
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:50.920]   In other words, the apostle here is using the term, as he used the term "Israelite"
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:55.480]   in a very general and in a very broad sense.
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:26:01.600]   He is saying that this is something that was true of the whole nation, of all these descendants
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:05.520]   of Abram, Isaac, and of Jacob.
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:11.360]   Now let me illustrate to you what he exactly means to show you the connotation at this
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:12.360]   point.
[00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:17.840]   And we go back to the book of Exodus, to chapter 4 and to verse 22.
[00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:25.000]   Here are the instructions given to Moses, and this is one of them, in Exodus 4, 22.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:35.080]   And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the Lord, Israel is my son, even my firstborn.
[00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:37.880]   Now that is a statement about the whole nation.
[00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:42.760]   Israel is my son, even my firstborn.
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:48.760]   Then let us go on to Deuteronomy, chapter 14 and the first verse.
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:53.920]   And this is what we will find there.
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:56.260]   The first verse of Deuteronomy 14.
[00:26:56.260 --> 00:27:03.000]   You are the children of the Lord your God, and because of that you shall not cut yourselves,
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:08.920]   nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead, because you are the children of
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:09.920]   God.
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:15.440]   Then you go on to Jeremiah, Jeremiah 31 9.
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:25.240]   And we have got a statement here again which will help us in the elucidation of this matter.
[00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:32.240]   Jeremiah 31 9.
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:37.640]   They shall come with weeping and with supplications will I lead them.
[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:42.160]   I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way wherein they shall
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:50.200]   not stumble, for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my firstborn.
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:53.600]   You see the same idea in all these instances.
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:28:00.480]   Let me give you one more from the book of the prophet Hosea, chapter 11 and the first
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:01.480]   verse.
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:08.800]   "When Israel was a child, then I loved him and called my son out of Egypt."
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:12.080]   Now that was the entire company that went out of Egypt.
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:15.640]   You remember most of them died in the wilderness, but it does not matter.
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:20.640]   The reference to them as son, as child, covers the whole nation.
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:26.760]   And it is in that sense that the apostle is using it in this passage that is before us.
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:32.480]   Now let us compare that with what we find in Matthew 8 and in the twelfth verse.
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:37.040]   Matthew 8 and verse 12, which reads like this.
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:44.600]   "But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness.
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:47.480]   There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
[00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:48.480]   Take the verse before it.
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:52.720]   "I say unto you that many shall come from the east and the west, and shall sit down
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:56.200]   with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:28:56.200 --> 00:29:03.640]   But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness.
[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:09.100]   There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
[00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:12.160]   You see, it is obviously a general use there again.
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:15.040]   Though they are described as children, they are cast out.
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:19.800]   The true spiritual children will never be cast out, as chapter 8 has proved to us.
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:28.200]   But in this general use of the term "adoption" and "son" and "children," there is the
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:30.760]   possibility in this way of being cast out.
[00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:33.920]   Now the apostle is preparing us, you see, for what he is going to say.
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:37.920]   His argument is going to be this, that though they are all in a sense Israelites and they
[00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:44.440]   are all in the adoption, they nevertheless are not all Israel that are of Israel, they
[00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:48.560]   are not all truly adopted who appear to be adopted.
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:54.880]   They are not all truly sons who have the general designation of sons and of children.
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:30:04.920]   It means, therefore, the placing in the position of a son to whom pertaineth the adoption.
[00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:08.920]   God placed this nation into the position of his son.
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:11.960]   Israel is my son.
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:14.560]   He regards this nation as his son.
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:16.240]   He put them into that position.
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:21.720]   Now that is one of the other privileges, says the apostle, that was true of these kinsmen
[00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:26.480]   of mine according to the flesh who are denying and rejecting the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:31.320]   God has not only given them this name, establishing them as his own peculiar people, he has put
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:33.840]   them into the position of a son.
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:39.520]   And he has dealt with them as son, as child, throughout the whole of the story that we
[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:41.440]   read in the Old Testament.
[00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:48.920]   Now that is the meaning of the term "adoption," "to whom pertaineth the adoption."
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:53.720]   And then we go on to our next term, which is "and the glory."
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:54.720]   Now then, what is this?
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:31:03.640]   Well, there are those who would say that it just means this, that it means the privilege
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:09.880]   of our position, of their position, the dignity of their position.
[00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:13.700]   We use this term sometimes, don't we, in conversation?
[00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:17.840]   We say that glory attaches to certain positions.
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:23.120]   People are appointed to certain posts or to certain exalted positions, and we say there
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:25.640]   is great glory attached to that.
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:28.120]   And there are those who would interpret it like that here.
[00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:31.440]   There are some indeed who would connect it with the previous word "adoption."
[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:36.960]   They say the glory of the adoption or the glorious adoption.
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:42.880]   But I think that is to be rejected on many grounds.
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:47.560]   One of them is that the apostle here is giving us a series of statements about them.
[00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:52.080]   And this is obviously a separate statement, so that on purely grounds of grammar and of
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:57.800]   syntax we say that it does not just qualify the adoption or anything else, and is not
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:01.680]   just a general statement.
[00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:07.520]   But there are stronger reasons for saying that.
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:13.760]   Here it seems to me is one of these remarkable things about these people.
[00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:18.920]   And I detect a kind of gradation here, that the apostle is leading from one thing to the
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:19.920]   other.
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:27.600]   They are Israelites, they have been put into the position of a son, not just a people that
[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:31.300]   God governs, not merely a theocracy, but much more.
[00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:35.560]   You narrow down, you see, from the state idea to a family idea.
[00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:40.000]   You noticed we had it there in that reading from Ephesians 2 at the beginning.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.080]   Citizens, fellow citizens, were the saints of the household of God.
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:45.480]   The same kind of narrowing.
[00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:48.940]   It is here, from Israelites to adoption.
[00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:51.480]   And then this next term, the glory.
[00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:54.320]   Now what does this mean exactly?
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:59.080]   Well, this to me is one of those astounding things.
[00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:07.360]   It means this, that God has shown to these people something of himself and of his own
[00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:10.000]   glorious nature.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.080]   The glory, the glory of God himself.
[00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:21.040]   Now there is an indication of more or less what this means to be found in the book, in
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:25.520]   the epistle of James.
[00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:31.360]   This is how it reads in the second chapter, "My brethren, have not the faith of our
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:41.920]   Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory; it should be the glory with respect of persons."
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:48.280]   That gives us some indication as to what exactly it means at this point.
[00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:58.960]   It means, I say, that God has given manifestations of himself and his own eternal glory to these
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:02.080]   people, not to anybody else.
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:05.440]   And of course there are many records of that in the Old Testament.
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:10.600]   I must not keep you tonight with them all, but here is one, of course, which would strike
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:11.720]   us all at once.
[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:16.400]   The thing that happened to Moses when he was there at the backside of that mountain, you
[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:23.400]   remember, with the sheep, and he suddenly saw a burning bush, a bush aflame and burning,
[00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:24.400]   and yet it was not consumed.
[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:31.680]   Well, that is a manifestation of the glory of God.
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:34.120]   It was given to him, of course, for a very special purpose.
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:39.700]   It was really the call of Moses at that point, and something very special was needed.
[00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:47.240]   So God gave him this manifestation, some glimpse of the everlasting and eternal glory which
[00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:48.240]   is God.
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:51.960]   The ultimate attribute of God is his glory.
[00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:56.240]   It is used only with respect to God himself.
[00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:58.080]   But there are further instances of this.
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:04.300]   Take for instance what you read in the fourteenth chapter of the book of Exodus, of the way
[00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:08.520]   in which the children of Israel were taken through the Red Sea.
[00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:09.640]   You remember what we are told?
[00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:13.360]   Well, here it is in Exodus 14, 19 and 20.
[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:19.000]   And the angel of God which went before the camp of Israel removed and went behind them.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.300]   And the pillar of the cloud went from before their face and stood behind them.
[00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:27.480]   And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel.
[00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:33.120]   It was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave light by night to these, so that one
[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:38.800]   came not near the other all the night.
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:42.640]   The fiery, cloudy pillar.
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:45.200]   That is a manifestation of the glory.
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:50.920]   Or look at it again in Exodus 16, 10.
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:56.400]   And it came to pass as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel,
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:36:01.440]   that they looked toward the wilderness, and behold, the glory of the Lord appeared in
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:04.560]   a cloud.
[00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:06.920]   No other nation ever had this.
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:14.120]   But God gave these glimpses, these manifestations of himself and his own eternal being to these
[00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:15.120]   people.
[00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:17.360]   Look, says Paul, look at this tragedy.
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:21.080]   These are the people who are rejecting the Son of God, and they have had glimpses of
[00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:26.520]   the glory to whom pertaineth the adoption and the glory.
[00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:27.520]   It's not true of anybody else.
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:33.080]   He's not just talking about the glory of their position, but of their having had glimpses
[00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:34.400]   of the glory itself.
[00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:37.520]   Take another one in Exodus 29, 43.
[00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:42.080]   I'm giving these in detail because the whole subject is to me such an important one for
[00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:44.120]   us to grasp.
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:46.440]   This is how it reads.
[00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:51.960]   And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and the tabernacle shall be sanctified
[00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:56.160]   by my glory.
[00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:57.840]   You remember about that.
[00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:03.360]   And then you remember that great incident of Moses in conversation with God after the
[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:05.640]   incident of the golden calf.
[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:11.000]   It's in the 33rd chapter of this book of Exodus, where Moses rises to the height of
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:17.120]   his daring and says, "I beseech thee, show me thy glory."
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:20.640]   You remember God put him in the cliff of that rock.
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:24.760]   God said, "There is a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock, and it shall come
[00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:29.480]   to pass while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a cliff to the rock, and
[00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:34.680]   will cover thee with my hand while I pass by, and I will take away mine hand, and thou
[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:42.120]   shalt see my back parts, but my face shalt thou not see, shalt not be seen."
[00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:46.200]   A glimpse again of the glory of God.
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:49.360]   The most amazing and astounding thing.
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:54.400]   And the other illustration of it is found in the 40th chapter of this book of Exodus,
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:58.360]   the last chapter, and in verse 34.
[00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:08.680]   "And a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle."
[00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:17.920]   But of course we remember, do we not, that in that innermost sanctum, in the tabernacle
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:22.640]   which the children of Israel had in the wilderness, and again later when they had their temple
[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:32.400]   in Jerusalem, you remember that in that innermost, the holiest of all, there was a mercy seat.
[00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:36.920]   And there the glory of God came and appeared.
[00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:41.280]   It was to signify God's presence amongst his people.
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:44.200]   Wherever the children of Israel went, the tabernacle went.
[00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:49.840]   And in the tabernacle there was this innermost sanctuary, the holiest of all, and there
[00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:54.720]   God's presence, so that they might know that he was always with them.
[00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:58.000]   "I will be to you a God, and you shall be to me a people."
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.160]   He said he'd be with them and that he'd go with them.
[00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:05.240]   And there he gives this symbol, this sign of his presence amongst them.
[00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:11.100]   And there, through their high priest who went in once a year only with an offering of blood,
[00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:14.520]   they were able to meet with God and to speak with God.
[00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:19.260]   Now you've got the account of that in the case of the temple, and it's good that we
[00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:25.600]   should have these references complete in the first book of Kings, in chapter 8 and in verse
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:26.600]   11.
[00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:29.840]   It's just to make the record complete.
[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:32.920]   One Kings 8 and verse 11.
[00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:37.840]   So, "And it came to pass when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the
[00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:43.640]   cloud filled the house of the Lord, so that the priests could not spend to minister because
[00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:50.800]   of the cloud, for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of the Lord."
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:40:00.000]   Now, the children of Israel, later you remember, came to refer to this glory of the Lord in
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   this most holy place as the Shekinah.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:11.560]   And Shekinah means the presence of God.
[00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:17.760]   This means, I say, that God dwelt amongst the people, that luminous cloud that led them
[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:23.020]   out of Egypt through the Red Sea on their journey, that same thing that rested upon
[00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:25.040]   the mercy seat.
[00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:34.460]   This is a manifestation of the everlasting and eternal God.
[00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:40.240]   And it is the most wonderful thing that can ever happen to a nation or to a people or
[00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:50.200]   to an individual, to have some conception of the glory of the Almighty and the everlasting
[00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:51.200]   God.
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:54.440]   Well, very well, I'm afraid my time has gone.
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:41:00.000]   I don't apologize for keeping you with these grey terms.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:03.680]   They're all of supreme importance.
[00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:09.360]   You see, the teaching of the New Testament is this, that you and I, you are Gentiles
[00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:15.360]   by nature, have been brought into a share of all this.
[00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:17.920]   That's what Ephesians 2 told us, wasn't it?
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:22.800]   You, says the apostle to these people, you were at that time outside the commonwealth
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:23.840]   of Israel.
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:25.880]   You were not sharers in these things.
[00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:31.280]   Remember, he says, that you being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who were called
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:36.640]   uncircumcision by that which is called circumcision in the flesh made by hens, that at that time
[00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:42.120]   you were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers from
[00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:48.800]   the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world.
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:53.800]   But he says, you are now in Christ Jesus, you who sometimes were far off, are made nigh
[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:55.840]   by the blood of Christ.
[00:41:55.840 --> 00:42:00.840]   Listen, you are therefore no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the
[00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:03.280]   saints and of the household of God.
[00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:06.040]   That's what happens to us when we become Christians.
[00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:12.000]   We are brought into the realm of these great and glorious privileges that have been given
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.800]   to this people of God in the past.
[00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:18.760]   Here are their descendants not recognizing all this and denying Christ.
[00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:20.360]   That's what breaks the apostles heart.
[00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:30.040]   Yes, but let us remember the other side, that we now become a part of the Israel of God.
[00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:32.200]   We become a part of the people of God.
[00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:39.200]   That's how Peter puts it, isn't it, in 1 Peter 2, 9, "You are a holy nation, a
[00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:45.480]   royal people for a peculiar possession, a holy nation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation,
[00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:52.720]   a peculiar people, that ye may show forth his praises, his glory, if you like, his excellences,
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:57.040]   who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light."
[00:42:57.040 --> 00:43:00.600]   What was true of them becomes true of us.
[00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:02.840]   That's why these things are so important for us.
[00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:08.800]   And you see, Israelites, we have entered into this.
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:10.680]   We are in the commonwealth.
[00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:17.340]   We become God's children, adoption, and the glory.
[00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:19.120]   We get to know God.
[00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:21.580]   We are no longer without God in the world.
[00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:22.820]   We get to know him.
[00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:28.400]   And if we take advantage of what's offered to us, we will know something about this glory,
[00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:30.960]   manifestations of God to the soul.
[00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:35.440]   It's in our hymns, "Manifest thyself to me."
[00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:37.400]   And there are manifestations promised.
[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:41.680]   Our Lord, you remember, in John 14 says he's going to give them this other comforter, and
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:44.480]   he says, "I will manifest myself unto you."
[00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:47.480]   And he says, "The Father will come and take up his abode in you."
[00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:50.680]   We, the Father and the Son, will come and take up their abode.
[00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:57.080]   The glory, not the glory in our position only, but a knowledge of the glory, some glimpse
[00:43:57.080 --> 00:44:02.560]   into it, some understanding of it, some experience of it, some realization of it.
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:05.720]   Very well, says the apostle.
[00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:13.880]   The glory had been manifested to these people, and yet in spite of all these great and high
[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:21.400]   privileges which had been theirs, here they are, rejecting their Savior, their Messiah,
[00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:28.200]   and in their blindness, turning their backs upon so great and so glorious a salvation.
[00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:33.400]   Very well, God willing, we'll go on to consider this tremendous next statement, the covenant
[00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:38.360]   and the giving of the law, and the remainder of the things that are enumerated next Friday
[00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:39.360]   evening.
[00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:40.360]   Let us pray.
[00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:46.920]   O Lord, our God, we come into thy presence once more.
[00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:52.340]   We thank thee, O Lord, for all thy wonderful patience and kindness with us.
[00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:59.480]   We see how we are so much like those Israelites of old, taking our high and wonderful privileges
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:05.440]   lightly, loosely, thoughtlessly, not stopping to investigate them, to consider them, to
[00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:08.320]   realize their content and their greatness.
[00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:11.160]   O God, have mercy upon us.
[00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:17.560]   We read of these people to whom all these things were given, grumbling in their tents,
[00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:22.880]   complaining because they were fed only with mammoth, lusting after the leeks and the garlic
[00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:29.560]   and the onions and the flesh pots of Egypt, failing to realize their privileges and all
[00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:32.640]   these wonderful things that thou didst do for them.
[00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:40.040]   And O God, we see so much of that in ourselves, with our grumblings and complainings, and
[00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:44.960]   we acknowledge and confess before thee that they are all due to our failure to realize
[00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:45.960]   our privileges.
[00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:49.080]   God, have mercy upon us.
[00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:55.440]   Open our eyes, we pray thee, by thy most holy Spirit, to a living, active realization of
[00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:57.720]   all that thou hast done for us.
[00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:04.240]   Help us to know tonight that we are truly the children of Abraham, truly Israelites,
[00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:10.960]   that we have received the adoption, and that it is unto us thou art prepared to reveal
[00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:14.160]   something of thine eternal and everlasting glory.
[00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:21.080]   O God, give us a living apprehension, we pray thee, of these wonderful things, that we may
[00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:26.760]   the more worthily represent thee in this world and ever live to the praise of the glory of
[00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:27.760]   thy grace.
[00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:34.520]   Hear us then, O Lord, in this our prayer, as we plead nothing in thy holy presence,
[00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:38.240]   save the name and the merit of thy dear Son.
[00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:44.880]   And now, may the grace of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the
[00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:50.960]   fellowship and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night,
[00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:58.040]   throughout the remainder of this our short and certain earthly life and pilgrimage, and
[00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:05.400]   until we shall be in the glory everlasting and see God.
[00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:07.480]   Amen.
[00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:11.400]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
