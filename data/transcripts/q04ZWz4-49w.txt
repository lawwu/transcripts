[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.320]   [Music]
[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.400]   We close out a full week with a really good question from a podcast listener named Matt.
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.240]   "Hello Pastor John, how have you dealt with receiving feedback and criticism from people
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.720]   you don't really respect, even if what they're saying has some truthfulness in it?"
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.960]   Or another way of asking it is this, "How have you dealt with receiving feedback and
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.320]   criticism from people who are just simply not good at giving feedback in a loving and
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.880]   encouraging way?"
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.440]   What would you say?
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.340]   Good question.
[00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:45.880]   No criticism is pleasant to receive, and all of us have a great spiritual work to do in
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:54.120]   our hearts, in humbling ourselves under God's mighty hand, as Peter says in chapter 5 of
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:01.000]   his first letter, and as Philippians 2 says, counting others more significant than ourselves
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.320]   and taking thought for the interests of others, not just our own, and emptying ourselves the
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.580]   way Christ emptied himself to become a servant.
[00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.960]   So we need to overcome our pride that makes it so difficult to be corrected.
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.600]   Ooh, how we hate to be corrected.
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:27.160]   It is emotionally, it just feels so bad, and yet it's so good for us sometimes.
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:34.880]   If we don't overcome that pride, we will lose our usefulness in God's service, we'll never
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:43.340]   grow beyond the mistakes we make, and we might even make shipwreck of our faith.
[00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:50.360]   But if I understand Matt's question correctly, and I could be wrong here, is that he's not
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:57.120]   just asking how we can be humble enough to receive criticism and profit from it, he's
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:04.160]   asking about that particular relationship where the criticism is delivered in a way
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:10.800]   that is not encouraging or hopeful or loving, as far as he can tell.
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:17.460]   And my guess is, it's just a guess, that he is asking this about a relationship with someone
[00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:24.940]   who is close to him, because the criticism that comes to us from a distance, say through
[00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:31.440]   social media, isn't usually as painful as the criticism that comes from a family member
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.440]   or a friend or a colleague at work or church.
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:44.120]   And I think I understand the situation, because I know there are people who seem incapable
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:54.040]   of joyful, spontaneous affirmation, but are spring-loaded to give spontaneous correction.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.560]   It's just their personality.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.120]   They would have to work at saying anything positive, and the most natural thing in the
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.400]   world is to say something negative.
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:14.760]   The first thing I would say is that in a good long-term closer relationship, it would be
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:23.600]   fitting at some point to approach the other person and tell him or her how you perceive
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.840]   that and how you experience that correction or criticism.
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.080]   And of course, that's a very delicate thing, and it runs the risk of making the relationship
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:41.840]   harder instead of better, although it could make the relationship way better if God intervenes.
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.200]   And of course, when you do that, when you approach someone, you follow Jesus' counsel
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.120]   to take the log out of your eye so that you can see clearly, to take the speck out of
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.120]   your brother's eye.
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.900]   In other words, he should feel, that person you're going to should feel that you are coming
[00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:04.280]   to him in a spirit of humility, with a clear sense of your own inadequacies and failures
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:10.640]   and the ways you may have hurt him or the way you even do now annoy him.
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:16.800]   And you keep in mind Galatians 6, 1, "Brothers, if anyone is caught in transgression, you
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.480]   who are spiritual, restore him in a spirit of gentleness.
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.040]   Keep watch over yourself, lest you too be tempted."
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:33.920]   And you tell him that you think your relationship would be better if he mingled more affirmation
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:40.840]   with his corrections, and if you spoke more gently, perhaps, whatever it is, you explain
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:47.120]   to him about his words that are off-putting to you or hurtful to you.
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:54.440]   And then, with hope, you leave it, and you go on your way doing your business, modeling
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:01.480]   for him as much affirmation as you can without being flattering or manipulative.
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:08.960]   And if no change comes about, and my guess is that's where he is, it's where many of
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:14.960]   us are, in fact, everybody probably in some relationship, if no change comes about, then
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.520]   we have our work cut out for us.
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:25.960]   In the New Testament, it is replete with instructions about how Christians should respond to those
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:32.280]   who mistreat them, whether it's huge mistreatment like persecution or death, or whether it's
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:40.400]   tiny little mistreatment like excessive criticism or insensitive and repeated correction.
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:48.560]   So here are four simple brief pointers that I have found helpful, even though I don't
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:54.480]   think I've arrived in my own ability to handle these things the way I would like, but here's
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.840]   how I'm working at it.
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:02.320]   Number one, remember that there are words for the wind.
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:11.600]   Job says in Job 626, "Do you think that you can reprove words when the speech of a
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.280]   despairing man is wind?"
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:23.840]   In other words, always be alert that there are probably elements of brokenness and pain
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:30.160]   in a person's life that may cause them to have broken patterns of communication with
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:38.520]   others, so that the brokenness, which feels damaging and offensive to us, is more about
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:44.380]   their own woundedness than about your deficiencies.
[00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:45.800]   Keep that possibility in mind.
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:52.240]   That was certainly the case with Job as he spoke words that they then jumped on, and
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:57.640]   he said, "Look, don't you realize that a despairing man sometimes says things that
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:59.760]   he wished he hadn't said?"
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:07.840]   Number two, remember that Paul describes love in 1 Corinthians 13 as longsuffering.
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:13.760]   Love suffers long, bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:14.760]   things.
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:18.640]   So there's longsuffering, there's bearing all things, there's enduring all things.
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:24.720]   So just when you think you have borne this criticism, as long as you can, as long as
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:32.160]   you can, the Holy Spirit will enable you to bear the fruit of patience and endure it another
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:40.480]   day, and then another day, and then another day, because we're called to be longsuffering.
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:47.960]   Third, when Peter gave Jesus as an example of how he did not revile when reviled, or
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:54.880]   we could say did not criticize when criticized, Peter said he did not threaten but continued
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.640]   entrusting himself to the one who judges justly, that is, to God.
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:03.360]   In other words, God is the final judge about whether you are being mistreated, and he will
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.440]   settle the matter perfectly.
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:10.960]   You may feel sometimes a righteous indignation, but Peter is telling us you don't need to
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.640]   act on that.
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:20.240]   You can keep turning, returning good for evil, and leave the matter to God.
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:27.040]   And finally, in order to keep your bearings in a relationship that seems unduly critical,
[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:34.680]   you need a fellowship of godly people around you who give you both godly affirmation for
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:39.360]   the evidences of God's grace in your life and loving criticism.
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:44.400]   Proverbs 11:14 says, "In the abundance of counselors there is safety."
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:50.160]   And one of the implications of that, I think, is that the plurality of godly people in your
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:59.000]   life tend to give you a more realistic echo of your virtues and your faults than if you
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.360]   only have one person responding to you.
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:08.720]   And that'll help you, I think, it sure helps me, to maintain our emotional stability in
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:14.760]   the face of a few people in your life who are unduly critical.
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:22.120]   And I would just end this by giving thanks for people that God has surrounded me with
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:29.080]   over the years who have been able to give balanced biblical assessment of my strengths
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:37.400]   and weaknesses, my virtues and my sins, the things that I do that are helpful to others,
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:40.680]   and the habits I have that are not helpful to others.
[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:46.240]   So I would just encourage everybody, find such a fellowship of friends.
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:52.400]   Yes, thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for modeling this accountability for us all.
