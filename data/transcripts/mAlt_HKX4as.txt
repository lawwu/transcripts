[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.700]   where we discuss science
[00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.880]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.520]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.780]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.780]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.400]   My guest today is Dr. Stuart McGill.
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.920]   Dr. Stuart McGill is a distinguished professor
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.360]   of spine biomechanics at the University of Waterloo.
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.600]   As a professor for more than three decades,
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.680]   Dr. McGill has analyzed the spines of injured people
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.320]   as well as healthy people,
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.360]   and developed methods to treat spine injuries and pain,
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.680]   as well as to improve spine biomechanics in anybody.
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.140]   He has authored more than 250 peer-reviewed
[00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.240]   research articles on these topics,
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.520]   making him a true world expert.
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.240]   During today's episode, we discuss spine anatomy,
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.160]   as well as the common sources of back pain.
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.920]   And we discuss some of the controversies
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.440]   as to the origins and different treatments for back pain.
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.600]   As you'll quickly learn,
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.160]   there is no one specific source of back pain,
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.380]   nor is there one specific solution to back pain,
[00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.200]   but as Dr. McGill spells out very clearly,
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.080]   there are things that anyone and everyone can do
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.740]   in order to strengthen their back
[00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.620]   and to reduce the amount of pain they may be experiencing.
[00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.140]   He explained some specific ways
[00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.040]   to self-diagnose your back pain,
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.680]   which of course is critical for understanding
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.080]   what specific things to do,
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.040]   as well as to avoid in dealing with any pain,
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.920]   and as it relates to applying in sport
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.280]   and in everyday life.
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.920]   Dr. McGill and I also discuss
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.600]   several of the avid controversies
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.240]   within the field of back pain
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.780]   and the treatments for back pain.
[00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.200]   We talk about the so-called biopsychosocial model of pain,
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.960]   which points to the various sources
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.520]   that pain can arise from,
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.100]   everything from emotional to lack of sleep,
[00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.680]   to specific locations in the spine and brain
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.960]   and elsewhere in the body,
[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.520]   and the ways those mesh together
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.080]   to give us what we call pain,
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.360]   as well as to direct us towards specific treatments for pain
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.480]   that tend to be especially effective.
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.620]   Dr. McGill is a true encyclopedia
[00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.540]   on the topics of back physiology and anatomy,
[00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.020]   sources of back pain and treatments for back pain.
[00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.940]   So it's truly a special opportunity
[00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.880]   to be able to learn from him in such immense detail
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.300]   and in such a clear and actionable way.
[00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.980]   By the end of today's episode,
[00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:12.820]   you will have a quite thorough understanding
[00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.160]   about the anatomy and physiology of the back
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.100]   as it relates to a healthy back, to back pain,
[00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.380]   and of course, you'll have various remedies
[00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.900]   for dealing with back pain, preventing back pain,
[00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.460]   and for strengthening your back
[00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.420]   for all sorts of different kinds of movement,
[00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.140]   not just for exercise and sport,
[00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.840]   but also to move through your daily activities pain-free
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.660]   and with ease and mobility at any age.
[00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.460]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize
[00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.020]   that this podcast is separate
[00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.200]   from my teaching research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.320]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.260]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.300]   about science and science-related tools
[00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.680]   to the general public.
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.940]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.580]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.860]   Our first sponsor is Helix Sleep.
[00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.700]   Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows
[00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.300]   that are customized to your unique sleep needs.
[00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.660]   Now, I've spoken many times before
[00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.500]   on this and other podcasts about the fact
[00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.860]   that getting a great night's sleep
[00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.500]   is the foundation of mental health,
[00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.100]   physical health, and performance.
[00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.000]   Now, one of the keys to getting a great night's sleep
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.500]   is to make sure that your mattress
[00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.020]   is suited to your unique sleep needs.
[00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.840]   What does that mean?
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.360]   Well, if you go to the Helix website,
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.020]   you can take a brief two-minute quiz,
[00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.900]   and it asks you questions such as,
[00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.140]   do you sleep on your back, your side, or your stomach?
[00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.980]   Do you tend to run hot or cold during the night?
[00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.100]   Things of that sort.
[00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.780]   Maybe you know the answers to those questions,
[00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:24.820]   maybe you don't.
[00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.140]   Either way, Helix will match you
[00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.700]   to the ideal mattress for you.
[00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:28.940]   For me, that turned out to be
[00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.000]   the Dusk mattress made by Helix.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.500]   I started sleeping on a Dusk mattress
[00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.900]   about three and a half years ago,
[00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.980]   and it's been far and away the best sleep
[00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:36.860]   that I've ever had.
[00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.000]   So if you'd like to sleep better
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.900]   by sleeping on a mattress that's customized
[00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.600]   to your unique sleep needs,
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.420]   go to helixsleep.com/huberman,
[00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.020]   take that brief two-minute sleep quiz,
[00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.680]   and Helix will match you to a mattress
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.020]   that's ideal for you.
[00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.740]   Right now, Helix is giving up to 30% off mattresses
[00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.100]   and two free pillows.
[00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.980]   Again, that's helixsleep.com/huberman
[00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.860]   to get 30% off and two free pillows.
[00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.980]   Today's episode is also brought to us by BetterHelp.
[00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.740]   BetterHelp offers professional therapy
[00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.900]   with a licensed therapist carried out entirely online.
[00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.700]   I've been doing weekly therapy for well over 30 years.
[00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:10.940]   Initially, I didn't have a choice.
[00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.500]   It was a condition of being allowed to stay in school,
[00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.020]   but pretty soon I realized that therapy
[00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.300]   is an extremely important component to overall health.
[00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:18.580]   There are essentially three things
[00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:19.920]   that great therapy provides.
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.860]   First of all, great therapy consists of having good rapport
[00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.460]   with somebody that you can really trust
[00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.900]   and talk to about the issues that you're dealing with.
[00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.820]   Second of all, that therapist should provide support
[00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.180]   in the form of emotional support or directed guidance.
[00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.060]   And third, expert therapy should provide useful insights,
[00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.260]   insights that allow you to better understand
[00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.860]   not just your emotional life and your relationship life,
[00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.340]   but of course also your relationship to yourself
[00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.140]   and to career goals and school goals,
[00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.660]   meaning excellent therapy
[00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.060]   should also inspire positive action.
[00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.660]   BetterHelp makes it very easy for you
[00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.460]   to find an expert therapist
[00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.020]   with whom you really resonate with
[00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.740]   and that can provide the benefits that I just described.
[00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.220]   If you'd like to try BetterHelp,
[00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.380]   you can go to betterhelp.com/huberman
[00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.460]   to get 10% off your first month.
[00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.700]   Again, that's betterhelp.com/huberman.
[00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.900]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Waking Up.
[00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.440]   Waking Up is a meditation app
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.900]   that offers hundreds of guided meditation programs,
[00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.280]   mindfulness trainings, yoga nidra sessions, and more.
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.720]   I started practicing meditation
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.560]   when I was about 15 years old
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.220]   and it made a profound impact on my life.
[00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:24.060]   In recent years,
[00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.540]   I started using the Waking Up app for my meditations
[00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.680]   because I find it to be a terrific resource
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.440]   for allowing me to really be consistent
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.920]   with my meditation practice.
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.440]   What I and so many other people love
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.480]   about the Waking Up app
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.280]   is that it has a lot of different meditations to choose from
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.800]   and those meditations are of different durations.
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:40.960]   So it makes it very easy
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.920]   to keep up with your meditation practice,
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.800]   both from the perspective of novelty,
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.520]   you never get tired of those meditations,
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.080]   there's always something new to explore
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.280]   and to learn about yourself,
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.920]   and you can always fit meditation into your schedule,
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.720]   even if you only have two or three minutes per day
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:55.840]   in which to meditate.
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.480]   I also really like doing yoga nidra
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.860]   or what is sometimes called non-sleep deep rest
[00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.440]   for about 10 or 20 minutes
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.680]   because it is a great way to restore mental
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.880]   and physical vigor without the tiredness
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:06.760]   that some people experience
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.600]   when they wake up from a conventional nap.
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.140]   If you'd like to try the Waking Up app,
[00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:13.000]   please go to wakingup.com/huberman
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.080]   where you can access a free 30-day trial.
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.960]   Again, that's wakingup.com/huberman
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.000]   to access a free 30-day trial.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.360]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Stuart McGill.
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.240]   Dr. Stuart McGill, welcome.
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.720]   - Thank you, sir.
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.920]   - Great to have you here.
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.400]   I'm a big fan of your work.
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.800]   I've watched a lot of your other content,
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:38.280]   read your books, and I'm excited to discuss today
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:42.880]   what makes for a really strong, resilient back,
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.460]   what causes back pain and how to relieve it.
[00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:51.320]   And perhaps the bigger issue is what all of that allows
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.980]   for in terms of mobility and functionality,
[00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:56.680]   not just in sport, but in everyday life.
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.920]   So to kick things off, I'd like to ask a question
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.960]   that I think is on a lot of people's minds.
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.060]   Most people aren't thinking about their back
[00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.480]   unless they have pain.
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:10.080]   So what causes back pain?
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.940]   You start with the easy questions.
[00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:18.360]   Let me give context before I define it
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.180]   as tightly as I can for you.
[00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:23.680]   Back pain is a symptom.
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.880]   So let's just change the topic for a moment
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.200]   and talk about leg pain.
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.800]   Can you imagine asking someone,
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.720]   "Well, could you give me an exercise
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:36.260]   "or a prevention strategy for leg pain?"
[00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.520]   Okay, so that sets the stage a little bit.
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.120]   We're talking about a symptom
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:44.120]   for which there's a hundred or more different pathways
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.840]   and mechanisms there.
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:49.040]   So we've got to have a fairly comprehensive assessment now
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:54.040]   and understanding to focus on the type of back pain
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:08:00.080]   and then matching an appropriate intervention.
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.840]   I was listening to your new podcast
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:05.360]   with Andy Galpin this morning.
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.440]   - The Perform podcast.
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.800]   - With the Perform podcast, yeah.
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:12.800]   And he said, "I'm going to try and follow the three I's."
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:16.760]   And it was, I think, gather information,
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:20.280]   interpret the information, and then intervene.
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.520]   So it's the same kind of deal here.
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:27.520]   And of course, that's pan-medical condition, shall we say.
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:32.520]   So with that context, I'm going to answer it like this.
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:33.960]   What causes back pain?
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:37.320]   Genetics loads the gun.
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.220]   Exposure pulls the trigger.
[00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:44.960]   And then the psychosocial milieu around the individual
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:49.560]   influences how they respond to the pain.
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:51.320]   So there's a start.
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:55.080]   We can break it down in those three categories if you wish.
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.800]   - Sure, so when you say genetics loads the gun,
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.880]   what comes to mind, because it's my experience,
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:04.360]   is that I have a right shoulder
[00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.920]   that sits a little bit lower than my left shoulder,
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:09.040]   unless I'm mindful of that.
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:11.200]   My dad has the same thing.
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:16.200]   And I can, you know, put an ankle on my other knee
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:20.300]   a bit more easily on one side versus the other.
[00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:22.520]   I tend to pronate one foot a little bit more
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.000]   than the other when I run.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.380]   These are subtle things.
[00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:28.740]   They don't necessarily result in back pain,
[00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:30.560]   but I'm guessing that a lot of that
[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:35.200]   is either developmental overuse, particular sport.
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.520]   I'm regular footed, I skateboarded a bunch,
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:38.880]   so I push with my right foot,
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.440]   I kick a soccer ball with my right foot,
[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:41.280]   those sorts of things.
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:44.400]   But let's assume that genetics played some role,
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.480]   created some bias.
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:49.000]   If I were to tell you that, which I just did,
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.480]   would then you immediately think
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:56.720]   to a particular intervention if I told you,
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:57.880]   okay, you know, I have a little bit
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:01.960]   of lower right side pain, which I occasionally do.
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:05.180]   I know I've got this imbalance that was loaded by genetics,
[00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:07.560]   and presumably experience as well.
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:10.000]   And would your mind immediately go
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.440]   to a particular origin of that pain,
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:15.960]   or perhaps even more importantly,
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.480]   a particular remedy to that pain?
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:19.200]   Or do we need to drill a little bit deeper
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:23.720]   and really understand more about what I do,
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.880]   what I don't do, if I'm more thin set
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:30.280]   or heavily set at the level of a bone structure?
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:31.720]   You know, what are some of the other questions
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.520]   one would ask in the investigate category?
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:37.140]   - My thought would not go to one or the other,
[00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:38.780]   but it would go to both.
[00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:43.780]   And I'd start that conversation with this analogy.
[00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:46.980]   Let's talk about breeds of dogs.
[00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:48.120]   We both love dogs.
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:52.900]   If I said to you, we're gonna take two dogs
[00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:55.340]   and we're gonna train them for the Greyhound track.
[00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:58.540]   One's a Greyhound, and one's a St. Bernard.
[00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:01.740]   How do you think you're going to make out the St. Bernard,
[00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:04.920]   no matter how you train it or condition it,
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:08.640]   will never make it to the performing on a Greyhound track.
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.320]   You're gonna end up with a broken St. Bernard.
[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:15.100]   So there's a little bit of a start from a big perspective.
[00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:17.680]   But now let's drill down and talk about spines.
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:23.900]   It's interesting when you look at the basic
[00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:26.500]   anatomical structure of an individual.
[00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.620]   We just did that with dogs.
[00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:31.200]   Imagine if I took a thin willow branch,
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.540]   I could bend that willow branch back and forth
[00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:37.220]   over and over, and it wouldn't accumulate stress.
[00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:39.260]   But if I took that same willow branch
[00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.340]   and loaded it top to bottom, like an I-beam,
[00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:44.160]   it would just bend and break.
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.800]   So it supports bending cycles,
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.520]   but it doesn't support compression.
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:52.380]   Now I'm going to change that willow branch
[00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:54.180]   into a thicker stick.
[00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:57.080]   And I bend the stick once and it shatters.
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:02.080]   In other words, the thickness and radial diameter
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:06.380]   being larger means the stress is bigger in bending.
[00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:08.980]   However, let's compress the same stick.
[00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:11.300]   It can bear tremendous compression.
[00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:14.260]   So there's a very fast example on spines.
[00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.580]   There's a fellow who has the world record
[00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:21.260]   in consecutive sit-ups, thousands of them.
[00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.860]   Given what I've just said, what's your prediction?
[00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:25.860]   Do you think he has a big strong fellow
[00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:28.940]   with a thick spine, or do you think he's a very slender man
[00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:30.620]   with a willowy thin spine?
[00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:33.460]   - He's a willowy bendy guy who can just keep bending
[00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:34.620]   up and down off the ground.
[00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:38.480]   - Bingo, bingo, he has to be, there's no option.
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:41.520]   So there's a start on the genetics.
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.740]   Not everybody can play offensive tackle
[00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:45.660]   and not everybody can be a gymnast,
[00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:49.100]   or not everybody can simply tolerate
[00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:52.140]   sitting in a chair being a computer operator.
[00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:55.420]   There's a very mundane example for you.
[00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:57.740]   - Could I ask you a question about the willow
[00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:01.700]   versus thicker trunk example?
[00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:07.460]   Can we look to torso thickness or wrist thickness
[00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:12.460]   or ankle circumference as a way to assess ourselves
[00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:18.900]   as to whether or not we are likely to be more willowy
[00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:20.940]   or Redwood-like?
[00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:24.100]   I mean, it should be obvious just by looking at ourselves,
[00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:25.380]   knowing ourselves.
[00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:27.740]   But for instance, I have a short torso.
[00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:29.740]   I'm kind of thick through the torso front to back.
[00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:31.460]   I always have been since I was a kid.
[00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:34.820]   But, and my wrist, the wrist circumference isn't small,
[00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:36.020]   but isn't huge.
[00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:40.120]   I had a bulldog mastiff and he would often look at me
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.220]   and I knew in his mind, he was thinking,
[00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:46.060]   "My wrists are really thick compared to yours, Andrew."
[00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:47.860]   I knew that's what he was thinking.
[00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:52.420]   He had forearms, he had forearms like a longshoreman.
[00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:54.860]   - And of course he had never done any work whatsoever.
[00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:56.420]   Actually, primary goal of the bulldog
[00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:58.620]   is to do as little work as possible in life.
[00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:02.740]   But I have friends who, you know, have thick knees,
[00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:04.940]   some have smaller joints, smaller ankles.
[00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:07.220]   Can we make some general assessment about our spine
[00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:08.420]   without imaging it,
[00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:10.380]   by looking at some of these peripheral markers?
[00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:11.660]   - Absolutely, yeah.
[00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:16.660]   So the knee width, the bi-iliocrystal width,
[00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:21.220]   which is the width of your iliac crests,
[00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:23.860]   hip width are all surrogates
[00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:27.200]   to indicate general heaviness of the skeleton.
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:32.680]   So yes, that's one good marker.
[00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:35.740]   But there's more to the story for genetics
[00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:38.280]   and how bendy a spine can be.
[00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:41.900]   The shape of the disc matters.
[00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:46.340]   So if you take on average, a group of top golfers,
[00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:48.920]   you'll notice that their spines,
[00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:51.420]   that the disc shape, if we were to cut through,
[00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:54.300]   which is a transverse scan on an MRI,
[00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:56.500]   the discs are more ovoid.
[00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:59.340]   If you take someone who can bear a lot of compressive load,
[00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:02.540]   the discs look more like a lima bean,
[00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:04.700]   and that's called a limacon shaped disc.
[00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:07.460]   - And of course the discs are in repeating fashion
[00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:09.140]   throughout the spine, top to bottom.
[00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:09.980]   - Correct.
[00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:13.420]   - And the discs are the soft tissue
[00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:17.380]   that allow for mobility of the vertebrae,
[00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:18.840]   the bony segments.
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:19.680]   - Exactly.
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:20.500]   They are the joints,
[00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:21.760]   but they're not a ball and socket joint.
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:25.560]   They're actually a fabric of layer upon layer
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:26.640]   of collagen fibers.
[00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:28.320]   And we can talk about that as well.
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:30.000]   - What a beautiful adaptation, right?
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.160]   Take a bunch of bony.
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.560]   If you want to be able to bend a bone, right?
[00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:35.920]   You need to break it up into segments,
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:37.600]   kind of like beads on a necklace.
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.880]   And then in between those beads,
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:42.620]   you put some pliable yet,
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:49.500]   I guess a tissue that you can still compress.
[00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:52.500]   So it's both pliable and it can squeeze down
[00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:54.740]   and become more narrow in the vertical direction.
[00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:58.320]   And it can also squeeze down on one side
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.180]   or the other to some degree.
[00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:01.980]   - Yeah.
[00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:04.460]   We evolved discs
[00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:07.420]   and there really is no other better architecture.
[00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:09.020]   People say, well, why don't we have ball
[00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:10.420]   and socket joints in our spine?
[00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:11.980]   And the reason is this.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.920]   Can you imagine stacking five oranges,
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:17.480]   one on top of the other?
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.200]   And then you could make them mobile
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:21.600]   by putting a ball and socket joint in between them.
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.260]   The amount of control that you would need
[00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.920]   on every single orange,
[00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:29.560]   you move one orange, you have to control all the others.
[00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:30.840]   It's mission impossible.
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:32.640]   We would, I would do an experiment
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:34.240]   with students in my lectures.
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:36.360]   I would take four coffee cans
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:38.880]   and put a tennis ball between each coffee can.
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:40.420]   And then I would put a rope
[00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:43.520]   at the front and the back of each coffee can,
[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:45.100]   and then one on the side.
[00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:48.220]   And I had four students take those four ropes.
[00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:50.180]   And then I took another four students
[00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:53.420]   who had the ropes on the next coffee can,
[00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:55.100]   and then on the next coffee can.
[00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:59.340]   And then I'd say, okay, group, flex the spine forward.
[00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:01.860]   So the students on the front would pull a little bit,
[00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:06.100]   but the guy on top had to pull more than the next coffee can
[00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:08.500]   and then the next coffee can a little bit less,
[00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:10.320]   vice versa, the people on the other side
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:12.760]   had to pay out the rope in sequence.
[00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:16.400]   And then I would say, okay, now let's twist a little bit.
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:21.020]   Anyway, you could imagine it was impossible to control.
[00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:26.020]   And then I took out the tennis balls
[00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:28.340]   and I put in what was a disc,
[00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:31.640]   a big round cylindrical piece of foam rubber.
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:34.160]   All of a sudden that added stiffness.
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:37.420]   So now, because the body uses stiffness
[00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:41.900]   as the control parameter, now we've added control
[00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:46.580]   in that the foam rubber would create a buffer.
[00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:50.140]   And as the deviation in motion occurred,
[00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:52.820]   the foam rubber would add more resistance.
[00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:54.580]   So it was an automatic control.
[00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:56.940]   And that's what a shock absorber does on a car.
[00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:58.980]   It has an elastic element plus the damper,
[00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:01.100]   but it's the elastic element.
[00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:03.620]   And we're gonna talk about stiffness and stability,
[00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:08.540]   I hope, that really creates the control.
[00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:12.380]   So that's why we have evolved discs.
[00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:13.940]   It's highly efficient.
[00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:16.580]   I can bend the spine to tie my shoe.
[00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:21.100]   But if I have to carry home these days,
[00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:25.020]   heavy shopping bags, I need stiffness of that flexible rod
[00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:26.600]   so it doesn't collapse.
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:29.880]   Or years ago, I might've been carrying home
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:31.500]   an animal for dinner.
[00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:35.100]   And I needed those discs to provide the stiffness
[00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:36.940]   in a very economical way.
[00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:41.260]   And in a way that didn't create stress concentrations
[00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:43.640]   the way ball and socket joints would.
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:47.860]   So that's an evolutionary necessity.
[00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:50.540]   Also, when we look at spines,
[00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:52.260]   there are the column of vertebrae
[00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:53.580]   with the intervening discs.
[00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:55.500]   But behind them, there's two more joints.
[00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:56.900]   And those are called facet joints.
[00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:58.860]   And they guide motion.
[00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:01.780]   Those facet joints have a variety of angles.
[00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:05.900]   They can have open angles, which allow you to twist.
[00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:09.500]   So if you took a group of golfers,
[00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:14.180]   could you imagine if they had facet angles like this,
[00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:15.380]   you can't twist.
[00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:18.020]   - So facet angles that are too close together, basically.
[00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:19.260]   - Well, it's a small angle.
[00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:23.820]   If the angle is orientated fore and aft, you can't twist.
[00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:26.180]   And you won't find, if you're dealing with a group
[00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:29.340]   of professional golfers, you'll find they all
[00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:31.740]   have open facet joints.
[00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:32.780]   - Is that genetic?
[00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:35.820]   - It's absolutely 100% genetic.
[00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:39.620]   Now, interestingly enough, when you arch back,
[00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:42.220]   when the facet joints are orientated open,
[00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:44.820]   as I'm describing, when you arch back,
[00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:48.320]   one pushes hard on the other, like shingles on a roof.
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:52.660]   That stresses a bone called the pars bone.
[00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:57.660]   And gymnasts, for example, get a very typical fracture
[00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:02.300]   pattern called a spondylolisthesis,
[00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:03.820]   which is a fracture of that bone.
[00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:06.460]   And then the spine shifts a little bit at that joint.
[00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:11.300]   I'm just finishing rehabbing a pro tennis player
[00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:13.420]   who had the same thing after they tried
[00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:16.020]   to have too much range of motion in their serve.
[00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:18.780]   The coach gave them excessive extension
[00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:20.940]   to try and put more miles an hour on the ball,
[00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:23.440]   but it didn't suit the spine.
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:25.940]   And they ended up having a stress fracture.
[00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:30.060]   - I mean, is it fair to say that if we can,
[00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:33.100]   if we are naturally flexible, for instance,
[00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:35.660]   like my sister can, you know, like her fingers
[00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:38.620]   can bend back really easily, her shoulder extension,
[00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:40.060]   which I guess for people that aren't familiar
[00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:42.620]   with shoulder extension, you know, she can,
[00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:45.100]   like, let's say you're leaning up against a railing
[00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:46.380]   with your back to the railing.
[00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:48.180]   The railing's just, let's just say,
[00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:50.860]   is just above lower back height,
[00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:54.100]   and you can put both hands on it parallel.
[00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:56.300]   So your arms are close together,
[00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:57.620]   like very close to the torso.
[00:20:57.620 --> 00:21:00.380]   And then, and people don't do this quickly
[00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:03.460]   'cause you can tear something or injure something.
[00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:05.900]   But then with feet about, I don't know,
[00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:09.860]   a foot or two away from that bar,
[00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:11.700]   you can do a knee bend and basically
[00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:13.540]   the arms go back behind you.
[00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:15.340]   Like I happen to have a fair degree of shoulder,
[00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:17.620]   just natural shoulder extension ability.
[00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:19.620]   I'm not particularly flexible, quote unquote,
[00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:22.340]   but that's just how I'm structured.
[00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:25.180]   I have some friends that can't do that to save their life.
[00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:28.780]   But I wouldn't consider myself hyper-flexible.
[00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:30.180]   My sister is a bit more flexible.
[00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:32.300]   We're related, obviously.
[00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:36.740]   So would people like her or people that tend
[00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:38.440]   to be pretty flexible naturally,
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:42.500]   would they be wise to avoid certain activities
[00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:44.740]   if their goal is to remain pain-free?
[00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:46.980]   I mean, you talk about the St. Bernard running
[00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:49.620]   on the Greyhound track.
[00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:51.620]   We all can enjoy things recreationally,
[00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:54.100]   but of course we don't wanna injure ourselves.
[00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:56.000]   So is somebody who's naturally flexible,
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.580]   should they avoid certain sports and activities?
[00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:02.460]   And conversely, if somebody is naturally stiffer,
[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:04.260]   thicker spine, thicker joints,
[00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:06.500]   should they avoid certain activities?
[00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:08.060]   - That's a huge question.
[00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:12.920]   And there's many more variables to consider.
[00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:17.920]   But I will say that when we are rehabilitating a athlete
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:20.320]   or just a person to get back to work,
[00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:22.400]   they're an occupational athlete,
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:24.600]   we take all of this into consideration.
[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:27.700]   So as you were describing your sister arching back,
[00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:32.480]   A, I know she has plump discs,
[00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:36.380]   discs that are full of fluid to allow the mobility
[00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:37.960]   to take place in the discs.
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:41.780]   I also know that if we looked at an X-ray from the side,
[00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:44.480]   you know the posterior spinous processes.
[00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:47.780]   If you run your thumb down the midline of a person's back,
[00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:51.100]   you will feel the bumps of bone up the middle of the spine.
[00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:53.100]   Those are the posterior spines.
[00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:58.360]   She will have a large space between each one
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:22:59.720]   when she's standing upright.
[00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:04.720]   So when she extends back, those spaces will come together
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:08.320]   and eventually the spines, what we call it kissing spines.
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:12.180]   And it takes me back to some of the old Russian techniques
[00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:13.060]   for bench press.
[00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:16.220]   They would bench press with a huge arch in their back.
[00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:17.340]   And then other people would say,
[00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:18.980]   "Oh, well, I'm going to try and mimic
[00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:21.380]   "that particular bench press technique
[00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:23.740]   "because it allows you to get much more force
[00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:26.300]   "out of the latissimus dorsi, a stiffer back,
[00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:28.540]   "and you get a different force vector
[00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:33.360]   "and actually more effective force on the bar."
[00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:38.900]   They didn't realize that when we work with a person
[00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:41.940]   who has a huge arch, they have big spaces
[00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:44.100]   between those spinous processes.
[00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:46.020]   And if you don't have those big spaces,
[00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:48.780]   you are going to crush the interspinous ligaments,
[00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:51.520]   which naturally are between those spaces.
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:56.520]   And you will now fire off a whole set of new problems.
[00:23:56.520 --> 00:24:03.700]   So what is a mechanical advantage for one person
[00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:06.980]   is a mechanical disadvantage for another?
[00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:08.020]   Do you follow?
[00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:12.380]   So all of this matters.
[00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:16.860]   Going back to the disc being a fabric
[00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:20.680]   of layer upon layer of collagen strands.
[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:25.680]   Typically, the disc is about 80% type one collagen.
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:30.300]   That is the stiff strength collagen.
[00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:37.140]   About another 20% is elastic collagen, type two.
[00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:40.580]   But there's types three through 10
[00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:44.060]   that bind those collagen fibers together.
[00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:46.940]   That's where there's a much greater degree
[00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:50.040]   of genetic variability.
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:54.340]   So there are some people who can get away
[00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:56.160]   with doing many sit-ups.
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:59.100]   They have a slender spine and they have the type
[00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:03.560]   of binding collagen that holds all those fibers together.
[00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:07.900]   But if I wanted to work these fibers of my shirt apart,
[00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:09.120]   get them to delaminate,
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:11.760]   I would create repeated stress strain reversals.
[00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:16.140]   The resistance of that fabric depends
[00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:19.580]   on the stuff holding the fibers together.
[00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:22.160]   So there will be binding fibers there.
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:26.040]   That's where the genetic variance lies in many people.
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:29.280]   So even there, the person's resilience
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:34.280]   to repeatedly doing a bending drill is determined
[00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:38.600]   by your parents to some degree, both in the size,
[00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:42.740]   the collagen type three through 10 makeups.
[00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:45.800]   As many of you know, I've been taking AG1
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:47.380]   for more than 10 years now.
[00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:49.840]   So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring this podcast.
[00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:52.600]   To be clear, I don't take AG1 because they're a sponsor.
[00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:55.720]   Rather, they are a sponsor because I take AG1.
[00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:59.120]   In fact, I take AG1 once and often twice every single day,
[00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:02.600]   and I've done that since starting way back in 2012.
[00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:05.200]   There is so much conflicting information out there nowadays
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.360]   about what proper nutrition is,
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:10.340]   but here's what there seems to be a general consensus on.
[00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:12.680]   Whether you're an omnivore, a carnivore,
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:15.560]   a vegetarian or a vegan, I think it's generally agreed
[00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:18.200]   that you should get most of your food from unprocessed
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:20.120]   or minimally processed sources,
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:22.620]   which allows you to eat enough, but not overeat,
[00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:24.200]   get plenty of vitamins and minerals,
[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:26.960]   probiotics and micronutrients that we all need
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:28.640]   for physical and mental health.
[00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:30.440]   Now, I personally am an omnivore,
[00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:32.880]   and I strive to get most of my food from unprocessed
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:34.780]   or minimally processed sources.
[00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:36.760]   But the reason I still take AG1 once
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:39.360]   and often twice every day is that it ensures
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:43.120]   I get all of those vitamins, minerals, probiotics, et cetera,
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:45.940]   but it also has adaptogens to help me cope with stress.
[00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:48.200]   It's basically a nutritional insurance policy
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:50.920]   meant to augment, not replace quality food.
[00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:53.120]   So by drinking a serving of AG1 in the morning,
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:55.160]   and again in the afternoon or evening,
[00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:57.800]   I cover all of my foundational nutritional needs.
[00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:00.480]   And I, like so many other people that take AG1,
[00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:03.520]   report feeling much better in a number of important ways,
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:06.680]   such as energy levels, digestion, sleep, and more.
[00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:08.880]   So while many supplements out there are really directed
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:11.240]   towards obtaining one specific outcome,
[00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:13.860]   AG1 is foundational nutrition designed to support
[00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:16.300]   all aspects of wellbeing related to mental health
[00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:17.700]   and physical health.
[00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:19.120]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:22.560]   you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:23.980]   to claim a special offer.
[00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:26.080]   They'll give you five free travel packs with your order,
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:28.700]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.
[00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:32.840]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman.
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:36.200]   Unless somebody is seeking to be a world-class athlete
[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:37.840]   in something, in which case,
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:39.920]   they should probably pay attention to their genetics
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:42.400]   and see whether or not it lines up well with a given sport.
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:44.680]   Although there have been exceptions
[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:48.620]   where people who are incredibly genetically,
[00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:54.540]   let's just say biased toward not being able to perform well
[00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:56.980]   in a sport have nonetheless succeeded in performing
[00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:58.220]   at a world-class level.
[00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:01.140]   But those are exceedingly rare exceptions.
[00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:05.540]   For most people who want to do things recreationally,
[00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:07.820]   like the heavier set person with a thicker spine
[00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:12.820]   who wants to golf or do ballet perhaps,
[00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:17.100]   or the thinner willowy person who wants to get
[00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:19.520]   into powerlifting, for instance.
[00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:24.940]   Are there certain things that they should each consider
[00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:26.900]   and embrace as activities
[00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:29.420]   in order to make themselves more resilient,
[00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:33.780]   more pain resilient and more apt to have higher performance?
[00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:38.540]   For instance, would the willowy person, so to speak,
[00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:42.200]   do well to build up some of the musculature around the spine
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:45.060]   to compensate for the thinness of that spine?
[00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:49.380]   And would the person with the heavier or thicker spine
[00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:52.860]   do well to try and encourage more pliability
[00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:54.820]   of their discs somehow?
[00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:58.020]   - The answer is yes, but it's a very limited yes.
[00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:02.120]   So if I can set the stage and give some context here.
[00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:08.260]   Every system in the body requires stress
[00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:09.520]   for optimal health.
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:13.580]   Think of the cardiovascular system,
[00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:16.140]   the musculoskeletal system, the endocrine system,
[00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:18.020]   even the psychological system.
[00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:23.020]   It needs stress to create adaptation for robustness,
[00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:28.940]   but you cannot cross what's known as the tipping point.
[00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:33.500]   Because if you do, you start building cumulative trauma
[00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:37.100]   of some form, whether it's emotional trauma psychologically
[00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:41.540]   or it's cumulative stress at the tissue level,
[00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:42.880]   at the level of the cell.
[00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:48.260]   So we have to talk about those tipping points.
[00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:50.460]   We've got to define where they are.
[00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:54.820]   Try and expand them, adapt them, but don't cross them.
[00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:58.140]   So with that context now, we can talk about
[00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:04.700]   a person's suitability for the stresses
[00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:05.940]   on different parts of their body
[00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:08.500]   associated with different sports.
[00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:12.900]   We can talk about the rate at which the adaptation occurs,
[00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:15.060]   the amount of deloads and rest that are required.
[00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:18.220]   All of these things are genetically influenced.
[00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:23.140]   The way that they perform the movement
[00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:25.100]   is going to move the stress concentration.
[00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:29.300]   Here's an interesting demonstration for you.
[00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:33.060]   If you go to the Olympics and look at the podium winners
[00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:37.620]   of a javelin thrower, they look identical.
[00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:41.220]   Do you think the swimmers look like the javelin throwers?
[00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:43.460]   No, they don't. But they look like each other.
[00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:44.980]   But they look like each other.
[00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:48.100]   The people on the podium look very similar in structure.
[00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:53.100]   Yeah, let me just give another very poignant example
[00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:53.940]   of that.
[00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:57.620]   Consider a sport that has three very separate demands
[00:30:57.620 --> 00:30:59.100]   of the athlete.
[00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:00.780]   Consider a triathlete.
[00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:04.020]   The triathlete has to swim a certain distance,
[00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:06.180]   then they bike a certain distance,
[00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:08.360]   and then they run a certain distance.
[00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:13.420]   Have you ever known a person who comes out of the lake
[00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:17.820]   or the pool, whatever it is, first winning the triathlon?
[00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:19.220]   It doesn't work that way.
[00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:21.740]   What suited them to be a fish?
[00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:23.300]   Fast in water.
[00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:27.020]   They have to be somewhat floppy in the ankles
[00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:29.340]   because they're creating a fish's fin.
[00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:31.000]   Longer in the torso.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:37.900]   Consider a power lifter performing a butterfly stroke.
[00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:40.060]   Wouldn't look very pretty.
[00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:45.100]   Then they get on the bike where they have to stiffen
[00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:47.620]   to stiffen the core.
[00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:49.140]   I don't know if you know bike design.
[00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:50.260]   Well, I'm sure you do.
[00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:52.580]   You're paying for stiffness of the frame.
[00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:53.420]   That's what a really elite-
[00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:54.260]   I did not know that.
[00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:56.540]   Yeah, so when a person pushes on the pedal,
[00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:57.860]   the frame doesn't flex
[00:31:57.860 --> 00:31:59.860]   because that would be an energy leak.
[00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:01.340]   You pay for a very stiff frame,
[00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:06.340]   so every ounce of force that you apply to the crank handle
[00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:08.620]   to propel you forward propels you forward
[00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:11.100]   instead of being wasted and bending the frame.
[00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:16.060]   The same way the cyclist will lock in on the bike.
[00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:20.020]   They'll squeeze the saddle between their legs,
[00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:24.480]   lock into the bars, lock their core down
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:29.480]   so that when they create power through the hips
[00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:32.660]   and through the legs, it's transferred to the power.
[00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:36.340]   It isn't transferred to bending their willowy body.
[00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:39.260]   That is very different from the neurology
[00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:41.540]   and the mechanics of a swimmer.
[00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:43.220]   Now let's run.
[00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:47.420]   To run, the most efficient runners
[00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:53.180]   store and recover elastic energy in tuned springs.
[00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:57.860]   A wonderful book to read is "The Lost Art of Running"
[00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:02.260]   by Shane Benzie, who studied the Kenyan runners
[00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:05.980]   and how they store and recover elastic energy
[00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:09.580]   with each stride, almost the same way as a kangaroo would.
[00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:12.340]   A kangaroo is more efficient when it hops
[00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:14.020]   versus plodding along
[00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:17.460]   using eccentric concentric muscle contraction.
[00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:22.460]   So again, the polar opposite of a swimmer,
[00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:24.960]   it's a very tuned stiffness.
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:27.300]   The most efficient runners
[00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:32.300]   for the third leg of the triathlon pre-stiffen.
[00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:34.460]   They have a pre-contraction of the muscle.
[00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:36.220]   So when the foot hits the ground,
[00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:39.060]   they're already storing the elastic elements
[00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:40.960]   and they get that back for free.
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:42.620]   But if the springs were not tuned
[00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:44.300]   and they'd stretched away their muscles
[00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:46.580]   just to be passive elements,
[00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:49.920]   which serves them very well in the swimming element.
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:52.900]   Think of doing a pogo jump.
[00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:55.140]   So you're just pogoing through the ankles now.
[00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:58.940]   If you had no tone in the legs,
[00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:00.940]   you would just flop into the ground
[00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:01.820]   and you would have to use
[00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:04.540]   concentric eccentric muscle contraction.
[00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:06.500]   But if you stiffened too much,
[00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:07.940]   you're now a piece of iron
[00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:09.540]   and you won't be able to jump either,
[00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:12.900]   but you'll get a beautiful resonance, a beautiful pogo
[00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:15.180]   when you have the tuning just right.
[00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:17.300]   So when a muscle contracts, it creates force.
[00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:19.300]   We all know this, but people don't appreciate
[00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:21.740]   you're also tuning the stiffness.
[00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:25.980]   If I maximally contract my muscles, I can't move.
[00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:27.820]   So athletes have to tune muscle
[00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:30.740]   if they're impacting athletes,
[00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:34.620]   but they also have to pulse and relax.
[00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:37.140]   Pulse, we're talking about Mike Tyson
[00:34:37.140 --> 00:34:39.740]   before the podcast today
[00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:43.060]   and the mechanics of how he pulses
[00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:45.880]   and then he's got to relax to get closing velocity
[00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:47.620]   of the fist to the opponent.
[00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:50.540]   And then when his fist hits the opponent,
[00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:52.180]   he turns to granite.
[00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:55.140]   And it is just such an awesome experience
[00:34:55.140 --> 00:34:56.700]   to feel that a little bit.
[00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:57.940]   It's one of the joys of my life
[00:34:57.940 --> 00:35:01.300]   working with elite athletes to feel their athleticism,
[00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:04.320]   but then dissect it down as to how they do it.
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:06.580]   So there's a lot in that,
[00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:10.580]   but that lesson from the triathlete really shows us
[00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:15.420]   how you can't be good at everything.
[00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:18.180]   There's always a trade-off with athleticism
[00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:19.540]   and the genetic part.
[00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:23.040]   And then of course, in the appropriate training
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:28.040]   to optimize and express that genetic gift
[00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:32.540]   through technique, through technique.
[00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:34.820]   So some athletes are very loose.
[00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:36.580]   Some athletes are very tight.
[00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:38.520]   Some are very elastic.
[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:41.260]   You won't hit a golf ball 330 yards
[00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:43.380]   if you're not an elastic athlete.
[00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:45.020]   You'll notice if you measure a golfer
[00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:47.920]   who can hit 330 yards, they don't test very strong.
[00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:54.060]   They have a beautiful, tuned, elastic body.
[00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:57.060]   You can almost see it
[00:35:57.060 --> 00:35:59.460]   if you've worked with enough of them.
[00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:02.020]   There's a smoothness to the muscle.
[00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:04.360]   So underneath the skin is a fascial net.
[00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:10.340]   Someone who can throw a baseball 110, 115, 120 miles an hour
[00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:11.460]   will be the same,
[00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:16.460]   but now you have a very asymmetric elastic effect.
[00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:22.000]   - So I know that you loathe and avoid generalizations
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.540]   with good reason,
[00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:30.540]   but given that most people listening to or watching this
[00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:33.260]   are probably not aiming to become elite athletes.
[00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:34.600]   I know I'm certainly not.
[00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:41.700]   Can we safely make at least one or two generalizations
[00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:46.300]   about what we each and all can do to try and avoid,
[00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:49.220]   let's say back pain and injury,
[00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:54.820]   by either diversifying our training
[00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:56.820]   or avoiding certain types of training?
[00:36:56.820 --> 00:37:00.860]   For instance, let's take the three major phenotypes.
[00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:03.180]   And this is obviously not how the world works,
[00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:05.940]   but the classic, you know, ectomorphic phenotype,
[00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:09.100]   very thin, very willowy, small joints,
[00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:12.520]   long and lithe, you know, or lithe.
[00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:17.060]   The mesomorph, thicker, more muscular.
[00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:22.240]   And then the so-called endomorph, the more heavier set,
[00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:25.100]   maybe even carrying some extra body fat, et cetera.
[00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:27.340]   Don't really know what's under there.
[00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:30.300]   They could fall into either of the other two phenotypes.
[00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:32.880]   I could imagine based on everything that you're saying
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:36.040]   that a good rule of thumb would be,
[00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:39.720]   avoid the types of activities
[00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:44.720]   that are outside of your natural genetic propensity
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:49.800]   based on body type, at least in the extremes.
[00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:52.000]   Like if you're not very bendy,
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.200]   don't do seven days a week of yoga, okay?
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:57.040]   But I could also imagine the opposite,
[00:37:57.040 --> 00:37:59.640]   which is if you're not very bendy, do seven days of yoga,
[00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:03.300]   because that's going to allow you to become more bendy.
[00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:05.120]   Or the person that is naturally shaped
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:06.320]   more like a shot putter,
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:09.440]   let's say the mesomorph or endomorph,
[00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:12.920]   and you could say, well, there'd be great power lifter.
[00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:14.160]   I mean, I knew kids like this in high school,
[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:15.320]   you know, PE class, they're like, okay,
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:16.200]   weight training today.
[00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:17.320]   None of us had done weight training.
[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:19.920]   And then the kid, you know, lies down and, you know,
[00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:22.680]   and pushes, you know, 315, and you're like, oh goodness.
[00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:24.880]   You know, like that's wild.
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:29.060]   But maybe they shouldn't be weight training.
[00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:31.600]   If their goal is to be all around fit,
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:34.160]   to be able to, which I think is the goal of most people,
[00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:35.000]   to be able to, you know,
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.400]   carry some luggage at the airport without, you know,
[00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:39.440]   having to stop every once in a while and suck for air.
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:40.800]   To be able to, you know,
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:43.000]   lean down and grab something out of a cabinet, you know,
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.840]   you know, pick up a kid, you know, you know,
[00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:48.680]   do some hard labor in the yard, you know,
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:50.160]   move some logs and things like that.
[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:52.560]   To be able to do stuff without getting injured
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:54.620]   and without being so sore in the following days
[00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:58.240]   that you feel like you need extensive rehabilitation.
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:01.220]   So again, I know you like to avoid generalizations,
[00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:05.500]   but should we make it a point to train
[00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:08.900]   against our predisposition
[00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:11.800]   in order to offset the imbalances
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:13.660]   that would otherwise occur?
[00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:16.100]   Or would we be wise to lean into our strengths
[00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:19.680]   and just not touch stuff that taps into our weaknesses?
[00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:22.100]   - I understand the question.
[00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:26.420]   The answer is, I don't know.
[00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:28.700]   But I know people will say,
[00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:32.200]   "Oh, well, this professor, he's avoiding the question."
[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:33.420]   And I'm not going to do that.
[00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:36.160]   So I'm gonna tell you how I find the answer.
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:37.440]   And it's through assessment.
[00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:39.520]   And I'm glad we're getting back to back pain, by the way,
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:44.460]   because it's my real, the cornerstone of my expertise.
[00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:50.420]   Our assessment is very comprehensive.
[00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:55.600]   It starts out by me simply asking the person,
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:56.900]   "Tell me your story."
[00:39:56.900 --> 00:40:02.720]   And some people never tell me about their pain
[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:05.240]   when I ask them to tell me their story.
[00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:08.040]   They will be telling me about their family life
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:10.760]   and the pressures that they have to still go to work
[00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:13.280]   because they have two kids in school
[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:15.040]   or four kids in school.
[00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:20.720]   They might tell me about the passions that they have,
[00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:23.300]   or they might tell me about their goals.
[00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:27.060]   So the goals are the beginning
[00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:28.860]   of answering your question, Andrew.
[00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:32.460]   We all know people who aren't suited
[00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:35.180]   for a certain occupation, or they aren't suited,
[00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:39.100]   or they, I'll take myself, for example.
[00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:42.160]   I had a high school careers counselor tell my father,
[00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:45.280]   "Well, McGill, he's not really suited academically.
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:46.940]   He should go to trade school."
[00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:50.560]   And so I registered for plumbing school.
[00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:51.400]   - No, you just went, "Oops,"
[00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:52.800]   'cause clearly that's not the way you went.
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:55.080]   Not that going to plumbing school
[00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:56.440]   would be a bad decision for some,
[00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:58.640]   but in your case, you went a very different direction.
[00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:01.120]   - I think I would have been okay as a plumber.
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:06.120]   But anyway, my point in that is, what are the goals?
[00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:11.800]   Then the assessment, I'm paying attention
[00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:13.400]   to the person's learning style.
[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:14.680]   How are we gonna coach them?
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:17.180]   And then we get down to the details of their pain.
[00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:18.540]   What's the nature of the pain?
[00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:20.300]   Is it when they get out of bed in the morning?
[00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:22.780]   Is it associated with a certain activity?
[00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:26.140]   Is it associated with certain motions, postures, or loads?
[00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:31.580]   Try and hone, does the pain change?
[00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:33.980]   Does it start out on one side of the back,
[00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:36.100]   and then later in the day, it's in the left glute?
[00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:38.020]   Or does it go down to your right toes?
[00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:40.060]   All of these things are telling me
[00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:42.120]   about the stability of the pain.
[00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:48.200]   It's giving me clues on what I'm going to assess.
[00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:50.700]   Then we go and assess them.
[00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:54.280]   And it begins with what we call provocative testing.
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:56.940]   I'm purposefully provoking their pain.
[00:41:56.940 --> 00:42:00.820]   If I can provoke their pain, I've nailed the mechanic.
[00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:03.660]   If I can't provoke it, it's not mechanical.
[00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:05.820]   Okay, well, that tells me something now.
[00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:10.820]   So now I'm starting to see, I know what their job is.
[00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:13.800]   I know what sport it is they want to do.
[00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:15.860]   I know enough about that job and sport
[00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:18.140]   that I know the physical demands.
[00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:21.580]   I know the psychological demands.
[00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:25.340]   Do they have what's required of the job or sport?
[00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:28.420]   And then I test that.
[00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:30.900]   If it triggers their pain, we have a problem.
[00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:34.740]   So now we have to focus the trainings very specifically,
[00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:37.860]   because people do not have infinite training capacity.
[00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:39.100]   They only have so much.
[00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:41.800]   And when you're hurt, you have even less.
[00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:46.300]   So we try and focus on things
[00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:49.000]   that are going to make a difference to enable them
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:52.180]   to have the ability to meet those specific demands
[00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:53.500]   that we've identified.
[00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:55.480]   So do you see how it's a long-winded answer,
[00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:59.200]   but I know how to get there to know how to train them.
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:03.080]   So now that we've recognized the very specific nature
[00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:05.740]   of their pain pathway,
[00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:11.240]   and it may be something that's going through the linkage.
[00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:15.380]   In other words, when they run,
[00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:20.100]   I could give you an example of if we put a group
[00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:23.300]   of Canadian hockey players on an elliptical trainer,
[00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:27.420]   they don't do very well because typical of the sport,
[00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:30.820]   the hockey players tend to get stiffer in the hips.
[00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:31.660]   It's the way they are.
[00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:33.040]   They skate a little bit flexed
[00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:34.980]   and they carry all heavy skates
[00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:36.860]   and heavy equipment down the legs.
[00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:39.080]   They get stiffer in the hips.
[00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:40.820]   When they go on the elliptical,
[00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:42.720]   their hips don't have the range of motion
[00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:44.940]   and their spine and pelvis gyrates
[00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:47.560]   with every rotation on the elliptical trainer.
[00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:49.480]   The elliptical gives them back pain
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:53.420]   if they already have motion triggered back pain.
[00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:56.060]   We take another group who has mobile hips.
[00:43:56.060 --> 00:43:58.300]   They do very well on elliptical trainers.
[00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:03.940]   The stress doesn't go into their backs.
[00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:06.600]   So now do you see why I know why one group does well
[00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:08.860]   with ellipticals, the other group does not.
[00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:11.180]   I know why one group who they,
[00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:14.320]   I'll give them a lateral shear test,
[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:16.340]   which is basically a bear hug.
[00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:18.500]   I pull their pelvis towards me
[00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:21.420]   as I hook down their shoulder in my armpit.
[00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:24.260]   So I'm shearing their spine laterally.
[00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:26.660]   If that triggers their pain, exactly.
[00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:30.120]   I had a pro hockey player the other day.
[00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:32.260]   I gave him the lateral shear test
[00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:35.460]   and he had a right-sided flash of pain
[00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:37.180]   going around his right flank.
[00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:39.420]   It exactly replicated the pain.
[00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:42.660]   I just found with precision the mechanism.
[00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:44.980]   Okay, what's the antidote?
[00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:47.020]   I put my fingers into his oblique muscles
[00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:49.540]   and I said, "Push my fingers out."
[00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:50.420]   And he did it too hard.
[00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:52.820]   And he says, "Oh no, that hurts even more."
[00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:54.860]   Okay, dial it back a bit.
[00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:57.980]   Tune what we're trying to achieve here.
[00:44:57.980 --> 00:44:59.240]   Fight me just a little bit.
[00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:02.120]   I repeated the formerly offensive test.
[00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:03.660]   The symptom was gone.
[00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:05.160]   So now I'm getting more precision
[00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:07.060]   on knowing what I need to do.
[00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:10.580]   He was doing the Pallof Press.
[00:45:10.580 --> 00:45:14.040]   The Pallof Press is a long lever exercise.
[00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:19.040]   So you take a load, usually with a cable or a band
[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:20.460]   that's held laterally,
[00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:22.260]   and you increase the length of the lever,
[00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:23.540]   which you have to resist because it's trying to--
[00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:24.940]   So you punch it out from the body.
[00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:28.260]   Yeah, you try and it's causing you to twist,
[00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:30.980]   but it also creates a tremendous shear load on your spine.
[00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:32.940]   That was triggering his pain.
[00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:35.420]   So we took out the Pallof Press,
[00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:39.780]   which for him right now is replicating his symptoms.
[00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:41.340]   But if you're playing in the NHL,
[00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:43.540]   you should be able to do a Pallof Press.
[00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:44.360]   You follow?
[00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:45.200]   Yeah.
[00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:46.460]   Yeah, it's a requirement
[00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:49.920]   of the rigors of professional hockey,
[00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:51.280]   but he can't do it now.
[00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:53.940]   So this is informing the programming
[00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:55.100]   that we're going to do.
[00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:59.340]   So if somebody has pain in a given movement,
[00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:03.280]   say standing up, after they sit for too long,
[00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:08.120]   a particular style of hip hinge,
[00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:13.120]   deadlift or squat, or when they run, for instance,
[00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:19.380]   would it be wise for them to think about the exact movement
[00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:21.180]   that makes the pain the worst
[00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:25.180]   in the moment that they're doing the movement or afterwards?
[00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:27.700]   Because oftentimes pain will arrive
[00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:29.580]   after we engage in a certain activity,
[00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:31.820]   but during the activity, that pain is shut down,
[00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:33.460]   which by the way is an interesting phenomenon
[00:46:33.460 --> 00:46:34.300]   in its own right.
[00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:37.860]   And might be worth some mention
[00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:40.960]   as to a couple of the reasons why that occurs.
[00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:42.800]   We always think, oh, blood flow, it's warm,
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:44.100]   but clearly it's more-
[00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:44.940]   - It's much more than that.
[00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:45.780]   - It's much more than that.
[00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:47.420]   - Yeah, for sure.
[00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:52.420]   - So let's say I have pain in a knee when I run.
[00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:57.020]   Should I avoid running in that gate that causes pain
[00:46:57.020 --> 00:46:58.940]   and work around it?
[00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:01.340]   Seems to me that would be the logical choice.
[00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:02.800]   - Right.
[00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:06.740]   Every person that comes to us comes with back pain.
[00:47:06.740 --> 00:47:09.600]   So initially we avoid it.
[00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:14.100]   We can have a neurological discussion if you like,
[00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:15.900]   we can have a biomechanical discussion,
[00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:18.420]   or we can have a psychological discussion.
[00:47:18.420 --> 00:47:22.400]   We can take it in the framework of any of those if we like.
[00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:29.480]   If the pain is causing a sensitization,
[00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:31.980]   I'm gonna use the example here of stubbing your toe.
[00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:34.220]   You stub your toe once, okay, well, it hurts a bit
[00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:36.100]   and the pain goes away fairly quickly.
[00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:38.080]   But if every day you stubbed your toe,
[00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:40.140]   you would increase the sensitivity
[00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:42.180]   so that you don't have to stub it anymore.
[00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:44.940]   All you have to do is lightly touch that sensitized toe
[00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:49.840]   and you are going to have a maladaptive heightened response.
[00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:55.560]   So if we keep creating pain on that toe,
[00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:57.500]   it will never get better.
[00:47:57.500 --> 00:48:00.900]   So we have to start a desensitization wind down,
[00:48:00.900 --> 00:48:04.020]   which is tissue based,
[00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:06.800]   but it's also neurologically based as well.
[00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:12.700]   And so because everyone comes to us with pain,
[00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:19.600]   we work very hard to hack our way around it.
[00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:24.700]   So let's say sitting causes their pain.
[00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:29.820]   All right, we'll find out that when we do a sitting test,
[00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:32.420]   if they sit slouched, that causes their pain.
[00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:34.860]   When they sit upright, their pain goes away.
[00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:38.000]   So I will give them a lumbar support,
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.260]   which I'm just happening to use now.
[00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:42.880]   I had to sit on an airplane for five hours yesterday
[00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:44.860]   coming to see you.
[00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:48.060]   And this allows me to not get back pain
[00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:49.900]   on the airplane while I'm sitting.
[00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:52.140]   Because if I sit flexed for five hours,
[00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:53.420]   I will have a grumpy back.
[00:48:53.420 --> 00:48:55.780]   And I won't feel like when I get into the hotel
[00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:58.920]   to go for a walk and train a bit,
[00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:03.560]   because that's what we have to do to create a stress
[00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:05.900]   below the tipping point to optimize health.
[00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:12.220]   So it's the same thing in putting together the program.
[00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:17.220]   First of all, know the cause and try and eliminate it.
[00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:18.820]   And try and eliminate it.
[00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:21.780]   So we'll teach them, you know,
[00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:24.460]   we spend a lot of time with spine hygiene.
[00:49:24.460 --> 00:49:29.460]   We teach them how to hip hinge or squat.
[00:49:29.460 --> 00:49:33.300]   We teach them how to lunge, how to get to the floor.
[00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:35.540]   We teach them how to roll
[00:49:35.540 --> 00:49:37.900]   without twisting their spine into pain,
[00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:40.420]   but using their ball and socket joints.
[00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:42.700]   We teach them how to do a baby's crawl,
[00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:47.840]   which eliminates the torso twisting,
[00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:51.240]   which in their current state will offend
[00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:53.200]   the sensitized pain trigger.
[00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:54.760]   - That must be humbling for adults
[00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:56.600]   to get down and do a baby's crawl.
[00:49:56.600 --> 00:50:02.600]   - It's so humbling to take a world record holding athlete
[00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:05.540]   and humble them right back.
[00:50:05.540 --> 00:50:08.800]   I, as you know, I've had the current holder
[00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:11.560]   of the world's all time record squat, Brian Carroll.
[00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:14.240]   And Brian and I have written a book together.
[00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:15.720]   So I can use his name.
[00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:16.880]   - What's the squat record?
[00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:20.120]   - 1,306 pounds, if you can believe that.
[00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:22.560]   Down to parallel, down to parallel.
[00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:24.480]   No other human has done that.
[00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:25.840]   That was four years ago.
[00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:27.760]   Now no one's replicated it.
[00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:30.200]   - Does he wear one of those elastic lifting suits
[00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:31.120]   when he does that?
[00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:34.660]   - Yeah, so he's putting on an exoskeleton of stiffness,
[00:50:34.660 --> 00:50:38.920]   but I want to come back to how humbling it was
[00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:42.260]   to have someone who already held world records
[00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:44.740]   in squatting in two different weight categories.
[00:50:44.740 --> 00:50:46.440]   And I had to show him how to get off the toilet,
[00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:47.540]   but that's another story.
[00:50:47.540 --> 00:50:49.780]   And we both laugh at this now,
[00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:52.100]   but that was what pain had done.
[00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:55.460]   Pain had corrupted his movement patterns
[00:50:55.460 --> 00:50:58.720]   and he forgot how to squat, but he held the world record.
[00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:03.100]   That's how corruptive pain is to the neurological engram.
[00:51:03.100 --> 00:51:05.800]   And we can talk about inhibition and facilitation
[00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:07.260]   and all of the things.
[00:51:07.260 --> 00:51:08.980]   I mean, I'd love to have that conversation
[00:51:08.980 --> 00:51:10.660]   because I know who I'm sitting with.
[00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:12.220]   - The neural aspects are fascinating.
[00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:16.220]   When he does that incredible squat poundage,
[00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:20.380]   does he take the bar off a standard squat rack
[00:51:20.380 --> 00:51:21.340]   and then walk it back?
[00:51:21.340 --> 00:51:23.820]   Or is it one of those ones where the bar is suspended
[00:51:23.820 --> 00:51:25.820]   from two hooks and then he takes it from there?
[00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:29.220]   - Yeah, so that particular lift was lifted off a monolith
[00:51:29.220 --> 00:51:30.900]   where he didn't have to walk it out.
[00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:33.260]   - So he takes it off, so it's hanging from hooks,
[00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:35.180]   then the hooks are brought away.
[00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:38.780]   The reason I ask is it sounds like he's optimized
[00:51:38.780 --> 00:51:43.780]   for one very specific movement in a couple of planes
[00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:44.620]   and nothing else.
[00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:46.780]   Because walking with a thousand plus pounds
[00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:49.500]   on one shoulders is also a feat in and of itself.
[00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:50.340]   - Okay, well-
[00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:51.620]   - Shuffling backwards, as it were.
[00:51:51.620 --> 00:51:53.460]   - All right, you're not letting me off the hook,
[00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:54.300]   which is fine.
[00:51:54.300 --> 00:51:57.820]   So I've worked with competitors who compete in strong men
[00:51:57.820 --> 00:52:00.660]   and they can carry and walk with a thousand pounds
[00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:01.500]   on their shoulders.
[00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:02.700]   It's called the super yoke.
[00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:08.860]   Another client of ours who held the world Wilkes score
[00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:13.180]   in the IPF, International Powerlifting Federation,
[00:52:13.180 --> 00:52:15.860]   where they do not lift out of a monolith.
[00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:18.740]   They take the bar off a squat rack
[00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:20.900]   and they have to step back.
[00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:25.900]   And that is, if you don't have enough lateral strength
[00:52:25.900 --> 00:52:31.020]   and control in your torso, that's when you become hurt.
[00:52:31.020 --> 00:52:33.540]   Not during the squat, it's during the walkout.
[00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:36.020]   So it's a very different feat of strength.
[00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:39.100]   So you're very astute to say lifting from a monolith
[00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:42.540]   is a different athleticism and strength distribution
[00:52:42.540 --> 00:52:45.060]   than an IPF style where they lift off a rack
[00:52:45.060 --> 00:52:46.220]   and have to walk it out.
[00:52:46.220 --> 00:52:48.020]   So you're standing on one leg.
[00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:50.380]   So can you imagine a thousand pounds
[00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:53.180]   coming down your axial spine, down your midline?
[00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:55.780]   It hits your pelvis and then it has to shear
[00:52:55.780 --> 00:52:58.220]   across the pelvis and go down the stance leg
[00:52:58.220 --> 00:53:00.700]   as you're stepping back with the right.
[00:53:00.700 --> 00:53:02.980]   So it requires tremendous strength
[00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:07.300]   to hold the pelvic platform up on the swing leg side.
[00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:12.300]   And so that is a tremendous core strength component.
[00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:17.780]   - So best not be carrying a willow spine for that one.
[00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:22.500]   You wanna be like a Muir Woods, a Redwood trunk.
[00:53:22.500 --> 00:53:25.300]   - Well, you wanna be built like Blaine Sumner,
[00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:28.500]   who's another one of our clients.
[00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:31.260]   I've worked with Blaine for quite a number of years.
[00:53:31.260 --> 00:53:33.480]   - I love the analogy to dog breeds.
[00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:35.900]   I love going to dog shows.
[00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:36.980]   I've only done it a few times,
[00:53:36.980 --> 00:53:39.620]   not to actually see the prancing around of the dogs.
[00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:41.200]   That doesn't interest me at all.
[00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:43.460]   Best part about a really excellent dog show
[00:53:43.460 --> 00:53:46.360]   is you go back behind the arena
[00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:49.500]   where all the different breeds reside.
[00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:53.220]   So you can see the lineup of the finest Irish Wolfhounds,
[00:53:53.220 --> 00:53:57.300]   the finest English Bulldogs, et cetera.
[00:53:57.300 --> 00:53:58.460]   Hundreds of different breeds.
[00:53:58.460 --> 00:54:00.340]   And you really get to see these genetic extremes,
[00:54:00.340 --> 00:54:02.940]   not just of structure, but of temperament.
[00:54:02.940 --> 00:54:05.300]   And you get to see the similarity
[00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:07.460]   and temperament of the Bulldogs.
[00:54:07.460 --> 00:54:08.640]   And of course there's variation.
[00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:11.960]   Some of them are a bit more jolly, others more stoic.
[00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:17.520]   You know, the Terriers are magnificent in their own right.
[00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:20.220]   And as you pointed out earlier with respect to the podium,
[00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:22.100]   more similar to each other within breed
[00:54:22.100 --> 00:54:24.100]   than across breeds in terms of temperament,
[00:54:24.100 --> 00:54:25.860]   but there's variation within breed.
[00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:26.780]   The reason I bring this up,
[00:54:26.780 --> 00:54:28.460]   and the reason I bring this up now
[00:54:28.460 --> 00:54:32.380]   is that if you look at the movement to those animals,
[00:54:32.380 --> 00:54:34.140]   even just the way they walk,
[00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:39.020]   whether or not they enjoy a flexion of the paw
[00:54:39.020 --> 00:54:40.620]   as they stride or whether or not
[00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:42.220]   they tend to stride differently.
[00:54:42.220 --> 00:54:43.540]   I don't have language for this.
[00:54:43.540 --> 00:54:44.700]   I'm not an expert in this,
[00:54:44.700 --> 00:54:47.260]   but I have a visual system that works
[00:54:47.260 --> 00:54:49.820]   and I can see that they may move differently.
[00:54:49.820 --> 00:54:52.720]   They actually walk differently, even at the same pace.
[00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:56.580]   And then you look at human beings.
[00:54:56.580 --> 00:54:59.940]   Shorter, taller, medium, more lithe, more heavyset.
[00:54:59.940 --> 00:55:04.460]   And it's amazing that we don't take this into consideration,
[00:55:04.460 --> 00:55:08.300]   that we all move very differently, even within species,
[00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:11.600]   but that we've been into these groups.
[00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:15.360]   So when someone walks into your laboratory, as it were,
[00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:17.260]   your clinic/laboratory,
[00:55:17.260 --> 00:55:19.240]   do you, are you paying attention
[00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:22.020]   to how they move into the room, irrespective of pain?
[00:55:22.020 --> 00:55:27.020]   - 100%, we time the clients.
[00:55:27.020 --> 00:55:29.200]   I see one in the morning and one in the afternoon
[00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:30.900]   and they're three hour appointments.
[00:55:30.900 --> 00:55:32.420]   So I know when they're coming.
[00:55:32.420 --> 00:55:34.780]   I watch them get out of the car if I can.
[00:55:34.780 --> 00:55:36.700]   And that's when the assessment starts.
[00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:40.780]   But just to go back to the dogs, my sister's a vet,
[00:55:40.780 --> 00:55:43.260]   her husband's a vet and her daughter's in vet training.
[00:55:43.260 --> 00:55:45.660]   So we have these conversations all the time.
[00:55:45.660 --> 00:55:49.140]   Do you know she's already made an assessment of that dog
[00:55:49.140 --> 00:55:51.420]   on how it's going to behave when she injects it
[00:55:51.420 --> 00:55:53.700]   or has to do a rectal exam or whatnot
[00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:56.300]   and what dog or breed, and even in cats,
[00:55:56.300 --> 00:55:57.780]   which ones she's going to muzzle,
[00:55:57.780 --> 00:56:00.860]   because she's usually right on who's going to get vet.
[00:56:00.860 --> 00:56:05.260]   Yeah, and interestingly as well,
[00:56:05.260 --> 00:56:08.940]   it's how the dog feeds off the owner.
[00:56:08.940 --> 00:56:10.540]   And she can look at the owner
[00:56:10.540 --> 00:56:13.740]   and usually determine how the dog is going to behave.
[00:56:13.740 --> 00:56:18.220]   So talk about the psychosocial view around dog behavior.
[00:56:18.220 --> 00:56:19.060]   Absolutely.
[00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:24.420]   Going back to your question, when a person walks in.
[00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:29.260]   So I've had, have I had a gold medalist in sprints?
[00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:31.120]   Yes, I have, from the Olympics.
[00:56:31.120 --> 00:56:33.420]   I've had a silver medalist.
[00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:36.500]   I've had just about every athlete that you can.
[00:56:36.500 --> 00:56:39.300]   And then a person walks in off the street,
[00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:41.260]   all with back pain.
[00:56:41.260 --> 00:56:45.020]   In your mind's eye,
[00:56:45.020 --> 00:56:49.100]   conjure up the image of a good sprinter.
[00:56:50.100 --> 00:56:53.160]   Do you think they have a flat lower back
[00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:55.480]   or do you think they have a lot of lordosis,
[00:56:55.480 --> 00:56:58.140]   which is an extension hollow in their low back?
[00:56:58.140 --> 00:57:00.020]   A sprinter now, what will they have?
[00:57:00.020 --> 00:57:05.560]   I recall seeing Michael Johnson sprinting very upright.
[00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:06.540]   Yes.
[00:57:06.540 --> 00:57:09.040]   So when I think upright, I think either, you know,
[00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:12.600]   flat lower back or a little bit of an arch
[00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:14.520]   in the lower back, you know, this kind of movement.
[00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:16.040]   Yeah, he was 200 meters, wasn't he?
[00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:16.880]   200 and 400.
[00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:19.020]   I think he was 200 and 400.
[00:57:19.020 --> 00:57:20.060]   He was.
[00:57:20.060 --> 00:57:23.340]   Which is unusual, someone that could win gold in both.
[00:57:23.340 --> 00:57:26.500]   Well, I'll think of some of the sprinters now,
[00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:29.820]   the 100 meter men and women, you will find
[00:57:29.820 --> 00:57:32.860]   they have a lot more lordosis than the-
[00:57:32.860 --> 00:57:33.860]   So arch in the back.
[00:57:33.860 --> 00:57:36.060]   Yeah, they have a low, and what that does,
[00:57:36.060 --> 00:57:39.940]   I'll just explain the running mechanics here for a minute.
[00:57:39.940 --> 00:57:43.940]   So if you're running along, you have a center of mass.
[00:57:43.940 --> 00:57:47.800]   You have to bias the force under your feet
[00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:50.620]   behind the center of mass to propel you forward.
[00:57:50.620 --> 00:57:52.540]   Because if it's in front of the center of mass,
[00:57:52.540 --> 00:57:53.720]   you're actually breaking,
[00:57:53.720 --> 00:57:55.820]   which wouldn't win you a gold medal.
[00:57:55.820 --> 00:58:00.820]   So footfall has to occur behind the center of mass,
[00:58:00.820 --> 00:58:03.140]   and then you get a very brief period of time
[00:58:03.140 --> 00:58:06.900]   to create an extensor pulse and then recover the leg.
[00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:09.760]   If you can pre-turn the pelvis
[00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:11.780]   with a lot of lordosis in the spine,
[00:58:11.780 --> 00:58:14.440]   you get much more power development
[00:58:14.440 --> 00:58:17.500]   behind the center of mass through the extensor range.
[00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:21.340]   If you have a flat back, it's difficult now,
[00:58:21.340 --> 00:58:22.940]   you've just shortened up the range
[00:58:22.940 --> 00:58:26.740]   that you can pulse into propulsive force as a sprinter.
[00:58:26.740 --> 00:58:28.540]   So they bow the body.
[00:58:28.540 --> 00:58:31.660]   Yeah, but you'll notice it's very difficult
[00:58:31.660 --> 00:58:34.140]   for a sprinter to kick high.
[00:58:34.140 --> 00:58:39.140]   So I look at these different forms in the combat athletes.
[00:58:39.300 --> 00:58:42.860]   If you look at someone who can kick high in a roundhouse,
[00:58:42.860 --> 00:58:44.840]   they will tend to have a flatter back.
[00:58:44.840 --> 00:58:49.620]   So combat athletes tend to have a flatter back.
[00:58:49.620 --> 00:58:50.860]   Going back to the runners,
[00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:52.860]   you'll notice that the Michael Johnsons
[00:58:52.860 --> 00:58:57.860]   and the runners with more distance have a flatter spine.
[00:58:57.860 --> 00:58:59.140]   They're more upright,
[00:58:59.140 --> 00:59:03.380]   and they're tuning that ability
[00:59:03.380 --> 00:59:05.340]   to store and recover elastic energy.
[00:59:05.340 --> 00:59:07.220]   Where the sprinter out of the blocks,
[00:59:07.220 --> 00:59:10.980]   it's horsepower, it's concentric and eccentric muscle pulsing.
[00:59:10.980 --> 00:59:15.980]   But anyway, there would be an example
[00:59:15.980 --> 00:59:18.840]   since you mentioned it with running,
[00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:22.380]   the style of running, the event.
[00:59:22.380 --> 00:59:25.340]   Running isn't running, running is very different.
[00:59:25.340 --> 00:59:27.180]   And again, look at the podium winners
[00:59:27.180 --> 00:59:30.660]   of the sprinters versus the 10,000 meters,
[00:59:30.660 --> 00:59:32.940]   very different architecture.
[00:59:32.940 --> 00:59:34.020]   I'd like to take a brief break
[00:59:34.020 --> 00:59:36.340]   to thank one of our sponsors, Element.
[00:59:36.340 --> 00:59:37.740]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:39.900]   that has everything you need and nothing you don't.
[00:59:39.900 --> 00:59:42.100]   That means the electrolytes, sodium, magnesium,
[00:59:42.100 --> 00:59:45.780]   and potassium in the correct ratios, but no sugar.
[00:59:45.780 --> 00:59:47.920]   Now, I and others on the podcast have talked a lot
[00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:49.900]   about the critical importance of hydration
[00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:52.060]   for proper brain and bodily function.
[00:59:52.060 --> 00:59:54.780]   Research shows that even a slight degree of dehydration
[00:59:54.780 --> 00:59:57.700]   can really diminish cognitive and physical performance.
[00:59:57.700 --> 01:00:00.040]   It's also important that you get adequate electrolytes
[01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:02.760]   in order for your body and brain to function at their best.
[01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:05.300]   The electrolytes, sodium, magnesium, and potassium
[01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:06.700]   are critical for the functioning
[01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:07.920]   of all the cells in your body,
[01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:09.900]   especially your neurons or nerve cells.
[01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:11.340]   To make sure that I'm getting proper amounts
[01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:12.980]   of hydration and electrolytes,
[01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:14.420]   I dissolve one packet of Element
[01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:16.340]   in about 16 to 32 ounces of water
[01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:17.500]   when I wake up in the morning,
[01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:20.100]   and I drink that basically first thing in the morning.
[01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:21.820]   I also drink Element dissolved in water
[01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:24.020]   during any kind of physical exercise I'm doing,
[01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:25.980]   especially on hot days if I'm sweating a lot
[01:00:25.980 --> 01:00:28.100]   and losing water and electrolytes.
[01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:29.300]   If you'd like to try Element,
[01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:32.060]   you can go to drinkelement.com/huberman,
[01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:35.900]   spelled drinkelement.com/huberman,
[01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:37.620]   to claim a free Element sample pack
[01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:39.900]   with the purchase of any Element drink mix.
[01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:43.020]   Again, that's drinkelement.com/huberman
[01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:45.060]   to claim a free sample pack.
[01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:46.820]   I love where this conversation is going
[01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:48.780]   because there's tremendous variation
[01:00:48.780 --> 01:00:50.900]   in body shape and form out there.
[01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:52.300]   And I'm certain that by now,
[01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:54.340]   everybody listening is starting to think about,
[01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:58.100]   oh, am I more likely to have a willowy spine,
[01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:01.040]   a thinner spine, or a thicker spine?
[01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:03.360]   The kind of pliability
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:07.240]   or what you called vertical stacking resilience
[01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:10.660]   that one spine or the other would have.
[01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:13.400]   And it brings me back to this question
[01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:17.160]   of what can we each and all do
[01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:21.160]   to try and create the strongest back
[01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:25.400]   as well as limit the propensity for pain,
[01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:27.720]   assuming we don't have it yet, okay?
[01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:30.480]   So I would say I'm kind of in the middle.
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:32.320]   I'm neither extremely lithe
[01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:35.520]   nor am I shaped like a kettlebell,
[01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:36.560]   somewhere in between.
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:40.840]   So for me, I make it a point across my training week
[01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:44.480]   to include three resistance training sessions,
[01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:47.920]   three "cardiovascular training sessions,"
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:51.200]   one long, one medium, one short cardiovascular session.
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:52.480]   The lifting sessions are geared
[01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:55.720]   toward building or maintaining strength
[01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:57.120]   in a balanced way for me.
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:01:59.480]   Everyone is going to have different requirements.
[01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:00.840]   In other words,
[01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:03.920]   nothing is skewed toward one particular outcome
[01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:06.600]   like endurance or strength or power.
[01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:08.640]   And I think most people probably want something similar
[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:10.040]   because they'd like to be able to meet
[01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:12.400]   the various demands of life.
[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:17.400]   So I frame the question I'm about to ask that way
[01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:22.000]   because as people start to assess themselves,
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.760]   the question arises again,
[01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:27.600]   should we try and compensate for our weaknesses
[01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:29.760]   by emphasizing a certain style of training
[01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:31.200]   a little bit more?
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:32.880]   And if so, what does that look like for the spine?
[01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:35.240]   You said earlier, and I love this quote,
[01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:38.080]   and I want to make sure I attribute it to you
[01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:39.000]   now and going forward,
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.520]   that all systems in the body
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:43.240]   require stress for better health.
[01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:44.480]   - Optimal health.
[01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:46.200]   - Thank you, for optimal health.
[01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:50.880]   So assuming that somebody has a thinner stature,
[01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:52.280]   they're more bendy,
[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:56.360]   would they be wise to build up the muscles of the core,
[01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:57.600]   not just the abdominals,
[01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:00.320]   but the obliques and the lower back muscles,
[01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:03.080]   all around the spine in order to give it more stability?
[01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:05.720]   And would the person who has a thicker torso,
[01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:08.040]   thicker spine, thicker joints,
[01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:11.880]   do well to emphasize some additional yoga training,
[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:16.360]   some additional, anything that allows them to be more bendy?
[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:18.640]   - I'm gonna go back to the fact
[01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:20.840]   that they're coming to me with pain.
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:24.280]   We are going to figure out through the thorough assessment
[01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:26.640]   what triggers their pain.
[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:30.840]   Most people, it's true, don't want ultimate performance.
[01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:33.000]   They're not being paid $10 million
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.360]   to be able to throw a fastball or something like that.
[01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:37.480]   They want to enjoy life.
[01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:39.760]   Let's say they love golf.
[01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:44.720]   My job is to get them sufficiently robust and out of pain
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:47.480]   to go and play recreational golf.
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:50.360]   So it becomes a moot point now,
[01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:53.120]   whether they have a willowy spine or not.
[01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:56.760]   I will look at their basic golf swing.
[01:03:56.760 --> 01:04:00.680]   If I can divide that up to just binary,
[01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:03.640]   some people are what we call twisters.
[01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:05.360]   They don't have a lot of hip mobility
[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:06.480]   and they twist their spine.
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:08.480]   So it's called the X factor in golf
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:10.840]   and they store and recover elastic energy.
[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:14.280]   Again, it is an elastic athleticism.
[01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:17.440]   But the next person isn't so much a twister,
[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:18.320]   they're a turner.
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:20.040]   They have what we call quick hips.
[01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:21.600]   So their hips turn
[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:25.200]   and their spines don't sustain as much twist.
[01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:28.840]   And then we measure, well, when they impact the ball,
[01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:32.800]   if they have 100% violent lateral crunch,
[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:34.560]   and then we measure them and assess them,
[01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:36.960]   and that turns out to be their pain trigger,
[01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:38.920]   what we do is we don't allow them
[01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:43.200]   to go to 100% in lateral crunch at impact,
[01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:45.080]   they go to 95%.
[01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:47.360]   And that just moved them off the tipping point.
[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:49.280]   So they're not stubbing their toe
[01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:54.280]   or slamming into the pain sensitizer.
[01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:56.880]   They just stay off the desensitizer now.
[01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:58.600]   - So backtracking a little bit,
[01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:02.480]   but making sure that I'm doing that with purpose,
[01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:04.720]   you need to know what generates the pain
[01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:06.480]   in order to try and localize the pain.
[01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:07.880]   - It all comes back to the assessment.
[01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:10.400]   - But then the goal is not to repeat
[01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:12.280]   whatever creates the pain.
[01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:13.120]   - Correct.
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:14.700]   - Perhaps, what I'm hearing,
[01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:18.880]   the goal is to get near the proximity of the pain,
[01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:19.800]   but not go there,
[01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:22.460]   not generate the movement that recreates the pain,
[01:05:22.460 --> 01:05:25.680]   but take the movement as far as one can
[01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:28.040]   without creating the pain.
[01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:32.680]   And then think about where the instability or weakness
[01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:37.680]   or biomechanical failure is contributing to the pain.
[01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:41.400]   Okay, so now I understand why.
[01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:43.340]   - If I can just add one, I don't want to interrupt,
[01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:46.480]   but this is a good juncture, Andrew.
[01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:49.480]   Then we get into the volume of exposure.
[01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:51.560]   So remember the tipping point.
[01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:56.560]   We can have somewhat of an offense to their former pain,
[01:05:56.560 --> 01:06:00.960]   but if we do it sparingly, that's another key.
[01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:04.360]   So it isn't a matter of selecting the exercise sometimes
[01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:06.880]   as much as it is controlling the volume
[01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:09.440]   and then having a period of time off
[01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:11.280]   or a deload or whatnot.
[01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:14.020]   So it may simply be,
[01:06:14.020 --> 01:06:18.500]   I've got an athlete that comes to mind right now.
[01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:20.900]   In fact, I got an email.
[01:06:20.900 --> 01:06:21.740]   It wasn't an email.
[01:06:21.740 --> 01:06:23.380]   It was a WhatsApp message.
[01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:24.460]   Oh, I just won.
[01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:28.100]   So she's at an international tournament today
[01:06:28.100 --> 01:06:30.300]   and they play every day.
[01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:35.300]   But in getting her back,
[01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:39.900]   it was a matter of we have to do these things
[01:06:39.900 --> 01:06:43.840]   that were former pain triggers, but control the volume.
[01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:48.480]   You can think of, again, combat athletes.
[01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:52.320]   Jiu-jitsu requires a lot of spine mobility.
[01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:55.400]   And typically, jiu-jitsu athletes get pain
[01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:58.180]   when they use too much spine mobility.
[01:06:58.180 --> 01:07:01.000]   What we do is we limit their training.
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.680]   In other words, they have the skill of jiu-jitsu,
[01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:08.240]   but they don't need to push the end range every day.
[01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:09.860]   Because if they do,
[01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:12.060]   they're in so much pain they can't train.
[01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:13.780]   So we back off the volume.
[01:07:13.780 --> 01:07:15.220]   And I could tell you stories
[01:07:15.220 --> 01:07:17.340]   about professional football players.
[01:07:17.340 --> 01:07:20.860]   They were their strongest when they were in college.
[01:07:20.860 --> 01:07:23.620]   Their bodies can't take the heavy strength training
[01:07:23.620 --> 01:07:25.300]   once they get into the NFL.
[01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:29.180]   They don't squat and deadlift what they used to.
[01:07:29.180 --> 01:07:32.780]   They're limiting the depth.
[01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:34.580]   They're pulling off blocks.
[01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:38.100]   The game changes.
[01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:40.080]   And it's not what people think.
[01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:41.640]   - And well, there's some wisdom
[01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:45.240]   to not pushing into pain and extremes all the time.
[01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:48.600]   If the goal is to have a long arc of fitness
[01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:51.880]   or athletic career, a good friend of mine,
[01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:54.600]   who's very accomplished in the fitness community,
[01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:56.480]   he says one of the best ways to get
[01:07:56.480 --> 01:07:59.640]   and stay in excellent shape your entire life
[01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:03.280]   is to train consistently, train reasonably hard.
[01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:05.720]   And we can talk about what his recommendation is.
[01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:07.400]   I'd love your thoughts.
[01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:11.120]   But as best as one can to not get hurt.
[01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:12.220]   You know, we forget about this.
[01:08:12.220 --> 01:08:13.960]   We hear so much about training consistently
[01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:15.220]   and pushing hard,
[01:08:15.220 --> 01:08:18.720]   but the not getting hurt part is key as well.
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:20.380]   Here's his recommendation on intensity.
[01:08:20.380 --> 01:08:22.280]   Can I share it with you and just get your thoughts?
[01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:23.320]   - Yeah.
[01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:24.680]   I have a short attention span.
[01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:28.120]   Can I just add added value to that?
[01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:29.720]   Don't get hurt.
[01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:33.000]   Getting hurt is tremendously asymmetric.
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:37.280]   Let me, do you know the book by Taleb Nassim?
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:38.380]   - Oh, Nassim Taleb.
[01:08:38.380 --> 01:08:39.440]   - Nassim Taleb, yeah.
[01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:40.280]   - "Antifragile."
[01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:41.100]   - Yeah.
[01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:44.040]   Oh, in "Antifragile," he quotes our work.
[01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:46.360]   He quotes my "Low Back Disorders" book
[01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:48.880]   as an example of antifragile medicine.
[01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:51.440]   Interesting.
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:55.520]   Anyway, when you talk to Taleb,
[01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:02.960]   in an economic sense,
[01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:05.480]   if I gave you $100 to invest,
[01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:08.440]   if you had a 50% gain,
[01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:10.480]   you'd end up with 150 bucks.
[01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:13.280]   If you had a 50% loss, you'd end up with 50.
[01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:18.040]   It's much more hurtful to lose 50
[01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:22.720]   than the relative jolly you would get of gaining 50.
[01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:24.160]   - Yeah, there's some neuroscience,
[01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:25.360]   certainly some psychology,
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:27.880]   but certainly some neuroscience to support that
[01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:32.880]   in terms of how we reset our reinforcement threshold.
[01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:37.460]   - Right, and so it is so asymmetric with injury.
[01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:42.360]   Training, if you push, is taking a risk.
[01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:46.200]   You might gain a little bit in short-term resilience
[01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:47.900]   or short-term performance,
[01:09:47.900 --> 01:09:51.380]   but you have a chance of really screwing things up,
[01:09:51.380 --> 01:09:55.220]   and an injury is really asymmetrically harmful.
[01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:59.640]   So when we work with people and athletes,
[01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:01.520]   we really try and avoid injury
[01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:04.640]   because of the asymmetry of the consequence.
[01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:06.220]   Injury's bad.
[01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:08.260]   That's the first part that I wanted to say.
[01:10:08.260 --> 01:10:11.420]   The second part is people train hard
[01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:13.480]   and they feel the muscle burn,
[01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:15.120]   and they talk about muscle,
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:17.300]   but they don't talk about their joints.
[01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:21.000]   And the key to long life is don't mess up your joints.
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.940]   You can train hard and build muscle,
[01:10:22.940 --> 01:10:24.960]   but muscle is adaptive and resilient.
[01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:28.960]   Joints are not so much.
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:31.460]   And if you start messing those up when you're younger
[01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:33.800]   by training too hard, you'll find that,
[01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:35.640]   oh, I was training at this intensity
[01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:38.300]   because I wanted to be strong when I'm 70 and 80.
[01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:40.820]   They'll find that, no, their knees ache.
[01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:42.740]   They can't get down on their knees anymore.
[01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:46.180]   They have to crawl up a chair or a wall.
[01:10:46.180 --> 01:10:47.300]   - Very sad picture.
[01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:48.580]   - It is.
[01:10:48.580 --> 01:10:50.340]   Don't mess up your joints.
[01:10:50.340 --> 01:10:53.180]   So that's an overarching principle
[01:10:53.180 --> 01:10:55.940]   of which the spine is one, obviously.
[01:10:55.940 --> 01:10:58.080]   But that's some wisdom
[01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:01.400]   with training intensely when you're young.
[01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:03.680]   Don't base the outcome on muscle.
[01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:06.040]   Think about the joints.
[01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:09.600]   - No, it's excellent recommendations for everyone.
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:10.720]   His suggestion, and by the way,
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:12.600]   this is not for competitive athletes.
[01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:17.280]   This is just for exercisers, if you will,
[01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:22.280]   is to make 85% of one's workouts across the year
[01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:27.280]   at about 85% of maximal intensity and output.
[01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:30.240]   So still constraining the total length of a session
[01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:32.760]   to whatever the goal of that session is,
[01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:35.440]   whether it's resistance training or cardiovascular training,
[01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:37.280]   but to not go all out,
[01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:40.880]   to go at 85% of one's subjective understanding
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:44.220]   of what all out on that day would be, on that day.
[01:11:44.220 --> 01:11:49.840]   To make 10% of one's workouts across the year
[01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:54.320]   at somewhere between 90 to 95% intensity
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:56.920]   of what one could generate that day.
[01:11:56.920 --> 01:12:01.040]   Again, 100% all out being subjective for that day.
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:06.040]   And then 5% or even less of their workouts all out,
[01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:09.720]   everything you could possibly give,
[01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:12.360]   quote unquote, leaving it all on the mat,
[01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:14.120]   whatever phrase one prefers.
[01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:15.800]   And I like that recommendation
[01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:19.400]   because it keeps things in check
[01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:21.320]   and it also creates an awareness
[01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:23.800]   of how intense one is training.
[01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:28.540]   And it allows us to not let the great night's sleep
[01:12:28.540 --> 01:12:30.360]   or the extra cup of coffee that we had
[01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:32.340]   or the great song that happens to be playing
[01:12:32.340 --> 01:12:35.340]   or the competitive spirit that's arising
[01:12:35.340 --> 01:12:36.700]   because someone joined you that day
[01:12:36.700 --> 01:12:38.320]   or asked you to join a workout
[01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:42.760]   to take you into the domain of harming yourself.
[01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:45.800]   In fact, I can look to the times
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:49.480]   when I've been injured training and almost always,
[01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:52.480]   it's because somebody invited me to join their workout.
[01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:55.240]   And we got into a little bit of a competitive spirit.
[01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:57.400]   And I'm not an ultra competitive person,
[01:12:57.400 --> 01:13:02.400]   but you push yourself to 100% on that day.
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:05.760]   And two weeks later,
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:07.400]   you've got something you're dealing with
[01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:09.480]   or two days later, you've got something
[01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:11.320]   and you go, "God, was that really worth it?"
[01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:13.640]   And I think unless one is a competitive athlete
[01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:16.160]   and that's competition day, it's probably not worth it.
[01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:17.040]   Right.
[01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:21.360]   Well, I'm very sympathetic to the overall sentiment
[01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:22.860]   of what you just described,
[01:13:22.860 --> 01:13:28.400]   but I think it's much more individual than that.
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:32.640]   You can take a younger person and drive them quite hard
[01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:36.240]   as some trainers do, and they have success.
[01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:41.240]   A young person responds, they recover faster, et cetera.
[01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:45.160]   You try doing that to a 65 year old,
[01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:47.640]   and you'll find that they don't recover as quickly.
[01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:50.860]   They need many more deload and rest days.
[01:13:50.860 --> 01:13:54.920]   So if you go to 85%, you just committed to a five day rest.
[01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:56.480]   Well, maybe that's not wise.
[01:13:56.480 --> 01:14:00.120]   If you went to 50%, you only need one day of rest between.
[01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:03.200]   So do you see how you play and you optimize this?
[01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:06.480]   And it's like what we call tapering down an athlete
[01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:10.880]   or in my life, I have seasons.
[01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:13.840]   Up until two years ago,
[01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:17.460]   I rode snowmobiles hard in the winter.
[01:14:17.460 --> 01:14:21.480]   Two years ago, I hit a rock at 100 miles an hour on a lake.
[01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:22.660]   I fractured my spine.
[01:14:22.660 --> 01:14:25.400]   You can spot the professor.
[01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:27.200]   So that was my passion.
[01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:30.960]   So my training would start in August.
[01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:34.640]   Every year I'd get into shape to ride sleds
[01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:37.600]   fairly aggressively.
[01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:40.000]   I couldn't do it all year, Andrew.
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:41.600]   I'd become injured.
[01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:46.080]   So I would have a cycle of three months getting ready
[01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:48.420]   and then really have some fun.
[01:14:48.420 --> 01:14:53.120]   But obviously I don't do that anymore.
[01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:56.440]   But my point in telling that story is
[01:14:56.440 --> 01:15:02.840]   I need much more information than just, okay, 85%.
[01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:06.920]   You may get away with that when you're 20 to 25.
[01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:08.720]   I don't think you're gonna get away with that
[01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:11.840]   when you're 50, as an example.
[01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:16.360]   As we optimize performance in our clients,
[01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:21.160]   sometimes you gotta leave a lot of gas in the tank
[01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:25.280]   because you want to train every other day.
[01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:31.280]   Certainly if you do two days in a row, 85%, there's no way.
[01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:32.460]   So do you see what I mean?
[01:15:32.460 --> 01:15:36.080]   It depends on their age, their injury history,
[01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:39.200]   their genetics and their body type and all the rest of it.
[01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:41.840]   What are we actually pushing to 85%?
[01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:44.120]   Is it a distance on a run?
[01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:46.520]   Is it a deadlift weight?
[01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:49.120]   That's pretty heavy.
[01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:51.680]   - Yeah, here I'm thinking about intensity, meaning,
[01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:54.400]   well, for resistance training,
[01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:58.640]   let's say that one could complete six repetitions
[01:15:58.640 --> 01:15:59.720]   at a given weight.
[01:16:01.540 --> 01:16:03.080]   But if they had a gun to their head,
[01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:04.700]   they could complete nine.
[01:16:04.700 --> 01:16:08.640]   Well, then you're doing six.
[01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:12.560]   Again, this is crude calculations, right?
[01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:13.960]   But six, maybe seven,
[01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:16.320]   maybe cheating a little bit on that seventh repetition.
[01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:20.200]   If it's a run and like for me on Sundays,
[01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:22.180]   typically there's a long, slow jog,
[01:16:22.180 --> 01:16:27.520]   but the slow in that component is a little bit subjective.
[01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:30.980]   So am I pushing a little bit harder than I'm comfortable
[01:16:30.980 --> 01:16:33.360]   or am I hitting kind of a cruising pace?
[01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:35.920]   Okay, so 85% of max intensity for me
[01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:37.520]   would be staying at cruising pace
[01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:41.480]   and occasionally bumping up the speed a little bit.
[01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:46.480]   But on all out day, if it happens to be one,
[01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:50.520]   then it's long, quote unquote, slow distance,
[01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:52.600]   but I'm trying to increase the speed
[01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:54.040]   of what I'm referring to as slow.
[01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:55.900]   So again, this is all very subjective,
[01:16:55.900 --> 01:16:58.020]   but we know on a given day,
[01:16:58.020 --> 01:17:02.300]   whether or not we're pushing past our comfort zone or not.
[01:17:02.300 --> 01:17:04.200]   And I'm not somebody who relies heavily
[01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:06.560]   on heart rate monitors and things like that.
[01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:10.040]   What I rely on is my consistency.
[01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:11.240]   This is the way that I've decided
[01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:16.240]   to stay in all around shape for more than three decades.
[01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:17.840]   I feel like I'm in decent shape.
[01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:18.680]   I'm not a great athlete.
[01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:20.480]   I'll never be the strongest person in the room
[01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:21.600]   or have the best endurance
[01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:23.100]   or the most speed or explosiveness,
[01:17:23.100 --> 01:17:24.720]   but I'm pretty sure I can keep up
[01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:27.480]   with most things pretty well.
[01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:29.520]   And I don't have pain.
[01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:31.520]   And I feel very grateful to not have pain.
[01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:34.280]   And I think it's because I've adopted a stance
[01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:38.440]   of, I don't want to call it moderation, but of modulation.
[01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:43.440]   - Well, I appreciate all what you've said.
[01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:48.420]   In my world, everyone has a back pain history.
[01:17:48.420 --> 01:17:51.680]   So it's always, I just let the,
[01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:55.520]   it's the information that we gather from the assessment
[01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:59.040]   that guides our decision on how we're going to,
[01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:02.000]   A, get them out of pain, build some base resilience,
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:03.920]   which is tuning their body,
[01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:07.000]   strategic mobility, strategic stability.
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.720]   Now, if one thing we haven't talked about
[01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:14.040]   is various types of pain and how yet that impacts
[01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:17.760]   on how we're going to approach their programming for life.
[01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:20.480]   You did a podcast with somebody,
[01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:23.160]   I can't remember what their name was,
[01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:25.480]   but it was a pain podcast.
[01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:27.880]   And you were developing this idea
[01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:32.880]   that if the mechanism of their pain
[01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:37.520]   was really part of the changed engram,
[01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:41.020]   they were traumatized at the time of the event,
[01:18:41.020 --> 01:18:43.920]   or maybe it was a history of sexual abuse or whatever.
[01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:48.520]   But I can detect that person almost always,
[01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:50.640]   I'll start to put my hands on them to feel,
[01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:51.840]   oh, is there any intelligere?
[01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:52.680]   And they recoil.
[01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:55.720]   That's an abused person.
[01:18:55.720 --> 01:18:58.560]   That's a very characteristic response.
[01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:01.800]   So you start putting together some of these reactions
[01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:05.040]   and you know that there's something deeper
[01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:08.960]   than an injury to a part of their spine.
[01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:11.720]   - Yeah, we had Dr. Sean Mackey.
[01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:12.880]   - That was it.
[01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:16.560]   - Yeah, Dr. Sean Mackey is our head of the,
[01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:17.760]   essentially the pain division
[01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:20.040]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:21.200]   He's an MD and PhD,
[01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:23.800]   and he's a big proponent
[01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:26.120]   of the biopsychosocial model of pain,
[01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:28.980]   which probably makes sense for us to discuss now.
[01:19:28.980 --> 01:19:30.120]   As the name suggests,
[01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:32.960]   it incorporates psychological elements.
[01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:35.080]   It incorporates, of course, physiological elements.
[01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:36.800]   And it points to, as I recall,
[01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:40.400]   seven or more sort of paths to dealing with pain.
[01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:45.360]   Some of which include thoughts about one's emotional state,
[01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:48.520]   stress level, sleep.
[01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:51.840]   I mean, all of these things clearly play a role
[01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:55.040]   in pain and rehabilitation from pain.
[01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:56.320]   - Right.
[01:19:56.320 --> 01:19:59.360]   I love that podcast, by the way,
[01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:03.080]   because it's so consistent with what we've found
[01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:04.040]   and what we do.
[01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:08.200]   If a person has,
[01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:14.800]   it was just a mechanical exceeding of their tipping point,
[01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:18.880]   and they now have some tissue damage,
[01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:23.960]   we address that by creating a strategy
[01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:28.960]   that they don't move or load in a way to stress that,
[01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:31.600]   and we allow the injury to heal if we can.
[01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:36.040]   And we should talk about whether the disc adapts
[01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:37.520]   or you have to manage it.
[01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:40.640]   But that's another very interesting topic to get into.
[01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:44.600]   But nonetheless, we are tuning their body
[01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:47.260]   with strategic mobility and stability,
[01:20:47.260 --> 01:20:49.920]   giving them core exercise,
[01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:53.000]   unleashing their hips and shoulders, et cetera.
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:58.080]   And we will have a reasonable level of success.
[01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:00.000]   And we know, by the way, what our success is,
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:03.520]   because uniquely, we follow up with every patient we see
[01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:05.520]   to know if we were successful or not.
[01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:09.040]   But now we have that person,
[01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:14.000]   and I can think of many examples just to give a spectrum.
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.880]   Perhaps the person was in a car accident.
[01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:18.960]   They survived, but the person beside them
[01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:21.240]   who might've been their mother died.
[01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:23.160]   So now they're carrying a hell of a lot
[01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:25.440]   of emotional trauma, guilt, trauma.
[01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:29.120]   Maybe they nodded off at the time of the accident
[01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:30.240]   they were driving.
[01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:34.320]   Tremendous psychological stress.
[01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:38.080]   Maybe they were sexually abused or whatever.
[01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:41.780]   That rewires their brain.
[01:21:42.620 --> 01:21:46.120]   So now they come in and the pain pattern doesn't fit.
[01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:51.120]   We do physical stressing of their various tissues.
[01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:54.920]   And the reactions, they change, they're variable.
[01:21:54.920 --> 01:21:57.180]   They're not what they should be.
[01:21:57.180 --> 01:22:01.400]   The way that their brain perceives the pain
[01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:02.760]   has been rewired.
[01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:06.780]   If we give them the traditional approach
[01:22:06.780 --> 01:22:10.840]   of giving them more fitness and ability, it won't work.
[01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:14.080]   We can't break through that maladaptive response.
[01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:17.720]   We completely change.
[01:22:17.720 --> 01:22:21.200]   Now it might be just to desensitize,
[01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:22.520]   and you'll laugh at this.
[01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:25.720]   We might get a feather and brush it over their back.
[01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:28.920]   And they'll say, "Oh, yeah, that triggers my pain."
[01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:29.760]   "Really?"
[01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:30.600]   "Yes."
[01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:32.600]   "Oh, and now I'm getting a headache."
[01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:33.500]   "Okay."
[01:22:33.500 --> 01:22:37.480]   So we have to come up with what can they do
[01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:40.200]   without triggering that maladaptive response.
[01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:42.200]   And it might be that.
[01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:44.880]   Simply, the most simple of movements
[01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:48.520]   where the afferent and efference,
[01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:51.520]   all the information going into that engram,
[01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:54.880]   which is formerly triggering pain,
[01:22:54.880 --> 01:22:58.840]   we now figure out what it is that doesn't trigger pain
[01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:01.800]   and then slowly desensitize it with repetition,
[01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:04.600]   never triggering pain, and then we expand that repertoire.
[01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:07.560]   So you've heard of fibromyalgia,
[01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:10.920]   which is a little bit of a catch-all term,
[01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:14.020]   but a flashing light,
[01:23:14.020 --> 01:23:18.000]   surprising someone.
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:19.360]   They're walking down the street
[01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:22.680]   and someone comes out of a shop and surprises them somehow,
[01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:25.720]   and that triggers off this massive pain response.
[01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:31.440]   We do that with very gentle love,
[01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:33.440]   doing the things that doesn't cause pain
[01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:36.920]   and try and slowly expand that engram
[01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:38.280]   into a pain-free one.
[01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:43.320]   There are those in what's called work hardening.
[01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:45.320]   It's usually funded by insurance companies.
[01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:48.000]   So if you have intransigent back pain,
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.200]   we are now going to get you to do your job.
[01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:51.480]   We start out with an hour a day.
[01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:53.560]   You're a bricklayer, you're gonna lay bricks for an hour.
[01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:55.460]   Tomorrow, you're gonna lay for an hour and a half.
[01:23:55.460 --> 01:23:58.920]   And occasionally they have some success
[01:23:58.920 --> 01:24:03.280]   or they have some really miserable failures.
[01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:04.300]   And the person says,
[01:24:04.380 --> 01:24:07.320]   I cannot do another day of bricklaying for four hours,
[01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:10.000]   even though it's only a portion of my job.
[01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.160]   And so now they get kicked out of the program
[01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:14.440]   because they're called a non-compliant.
[01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:16.200]   In other words, there's something psychological
[01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:21.200]   wrong with them and they're shattered.
[01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:23.000]   Those are the people we see.
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.600]   So these are, you know,
[01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:28.620]   talk about the biopsychosocial approach.
[01:24:28.620 --> 01:24:32.800]   I know I get labeled sometimes as the biomechanist
[01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:34.400]   and I ignore all the psychosocial,
[01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:36.960]   but these are people who've never read our work
[01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:37.800]   and they don't know it.
[01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:39.560]   So I really appreciate you bringing this
[01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:44.000]   'cause I'm not often asked this perspective.
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.360]   But again, I know with your background,
[01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:48.040]   you'll appreciate all of this.
[01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:49.240]   - Yeah, surely the, you know,
[01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:51.640]   the nervous system is involved in generating movement
[01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:54.520]   and feedback from the muscles and proprioception.
[01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:56.560]   And as you're describing,
[01:24:56.560 --> 01:25:00.820]   the nervous system creates our sense of pain.
[01:25:00.820 --> 01:25:04.120]   There's an emotional component to it as Dr. Mackey pointed
[01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:07.600]   out and as you're reinforcing and the neural circuits
[01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:10.660]   that control quote unquote pain or give rise to pain
[01:25:10.660 --> 01:25:15.200]   involve the confluence of all of these things at some level.
[01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:17.880]   And I appreciate that you're willing to go
[01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:21.720]   into this biopsychosocial model of pain and acknowledge it
[01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:26.000]   because I think all too often in this space of biomechanics
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:30.860]   and pain and back pain in particular people,
[01:25:30.860 --> 01:25:34.700]   you in some cases get labeled as only subscribing
[01:25:34.700 --> 01:25:37.300]   to one particular pattern of remedy
[01:25:37.300 --> 01:25:38.620]   or one particular framework.
[01:25:38.620 --> 01:25:39.820]   And that's simply not true.
[01:25:39.820 --> 01:25:41.380]   It's just not true.
[01:25:41.380 --> 01:25:42.700]   In fact, I'll go so far as to say
[01:25:42.700 --> 01:25:45.280]   that that's actually a reflection of other people
[01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:48.540]   placing a singular lens on you and your work
[01:25:48.540 --> 01:25:50.420]   as opposed to your work having a singular lens.
[01:25:50.420 --> 01:25:51.420]   I know that you look at things
[01:25:51.420 --> 01:25:55.740]   through the rather complex prism that is back pain
[01:25:55.740 --> 01:25:57.400]   and back rehabilitation.
[01:25:57.400 --> 01:26:01.000]   So thank you for touching into the biopsychosocial model
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.320]   and we'll put a link in the show note captions
[01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:05.000]   to that episode with Dr. Mackey
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.600]   because he went into this in some depth.
[01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:11.000]   And so it is the case that we've covered that model
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.760]   in pretty extensive detail.
[01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:16.900]   There's something that you said to me once
[01:26:16.900 --> 01:26:19.160]   that I really wanna make sure we highlight,
[01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:21.500]   which is that people who embark
[01:26:21.500 --> 01:26:23.880]   on a particular style of training,
[01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:25.940]   not just sport selection, but style of training,
[01:26:25.940 --> 01:26:28.620]   like resistance training with heavier weights
[01:26:28.620 --> 01:26:31.740]   versus endurance training, running longer distances
[01:26:31.740 --> 01:26:34.060]   or swimming longer distances,
[01:26:34.060 --> 01:26:37.620]   will sometimes cultivate a certain,
[01:26:37.620 --> 01:26:39.220]   what should we call it?
[01:26:39.220 --> 01:26:43.140]   Personality style or reactivity style
[01:26:43.140 --> 01:26:47.420]   that is probably independent of who they started off as.
[01:26:47.420 --> 01:26:49.380]   I mean, you can never separate these things completely.
[01:26:49.380 --> 01:26:52.020]   I mean, we could argue people
[01:26:52.020 --> 01:26:54.960]   who have a lot of mental endurance pick endurance sports
[01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:57.920]   or people that are rather ballistic in their personality,
[01:26:57.920 --> 01:26:59.960]   here I'm playing psychologist,
[01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:01.720]   pick sports with a lot of speed
[01:27:01.720 --> 01:27:04.140]   and ballistic motion involved.
[01:27:04.140 --> 01:27:07.080]   But perhaps the reverse is also true,
[01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:09.960]   that the more we engage in activities
[01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:12.200]   for which the nervous system is required
[01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:14.800]   to generate a particular pattern of movement,
[01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:17.640]   like ballistic movement or endurance or strength,
[01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:22.600]   that we exacerbate certain aspects of our mental self,
[01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:24.640]   our emotional self as well.
[01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:26.920]   I realize this is not the stuff
[01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:30.280]   of detailed peer-reviewed studies necessarily,
[01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:31.880]   or at least I'm not aware of them,
[01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:33.220]   but in your experience,
[01:27:33.220 --> 01:27:34.880]   working with a variety of different people
[01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:36.240]   from the general population
[01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:37.720]   who engage in different activities,
[01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:41.800]   as well as athletes who engage in very different activities.
[01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:43.880]   And let's keep in mind the discussion we had earlier
[01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:45.640]   about dog breeds.
[01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:48.640]   They are selected for not just based on physical phenotype
[01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:53.640]   and movement, but also personality type, temperament.
[01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:58.480]   What sort of broad correlations have you observed
[01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:01.380]   in say endurance runners?
[01:28:01.380 --> 01:28:04.520]   Do they have more mental endurance for other activities
[01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:08.240]   versus say strength athletes or sprinters?
[01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:09.240]   Do they tend to have less,
[01:28:09.240 --> 01:28:12.880]   but tend to excel in other domains of their mental life?
[01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:17.280]   - You're right in that I haven't seen good science
[01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:20.120]   to back up this whole issue.
[01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:24.720]   But after working with people for 40 years
[01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:28.360]   and seeing the extremes of the phenotype,
[01:28:28.360 --> 01:28:31.980]   I do have some opinions on this.
[01:28:31.980 --> 01:28:35.320]   And it comes from coaching.
[01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:40.320]   So if you take an athlete who has by nature,
[01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:43.800]   they're very explosive neurologically.
[01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:45.800]   They're quick, they're explosive.
[01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:47.860]   But they can't do it for very long.
[01:28:47.860 --> 01:28:52.360]   It's almost, and I hate using this label,
[01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:55.800]   but it's just a way to describe it.
[01:28:55.800 --> 01:28:57.960]   They have attention deficit.
[01:28:57.960 --> 01:29:00.160]   Now, I've been told I have this.
[01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:02.120]   Every high school teacher would have told you,
[01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:04.000]   yeah, McGill, he's attention deficit.
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:05.000]   Now, maybe it was just,
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:06.960]   I wasn't interested in what they were talking about.
[01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:08.460]   My brain was thinking about something else.
[01:29:08.460 --> 01:29:11.200]   But I think I do have a certain degree
[01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:12.560]   of attention deficits.
[01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:13.920]   If someone's not holding my attention,
[01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:16.920]   I'm thinking of something that's more important.
[01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:21.080]   The more explosive the athlete is,
[01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:23.400]   the shorter the time you have to coach them,
[01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:24.900]   that they're present with you.
[01:29:24.900 --> 01:29:30.240]   The less explosive they are,
[01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:32.080]   the more time you have to coach them.
[01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:34.160]   So I will say that.
[01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:36.880]   - Find that really interesting.
[01:29:37.880 --> 01:29:40.680]   And I can think of a number of self-experiments
[01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:43.240]   that I'd like to embark on of,
[01:29:43.240 --> 01:29:45.480]   including more endurance training
[01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:46.720]   at particular times of year
[01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:50.320]   and seeing how that correlates with mental focus
[01:29:50.320 --> 01:29:55.240]   and endurance for, say, writing or preparing podcasts,
[01:29:55.240 --> 01:29:56.680]   things of that sort.
[01:29:56.680 --> 01:29:58.580]   But of course, now that I have some sense
[01:29:58.580 --> 01:30:00.100]   of what the answer could be,
[01:30:00.100 --> 01:30:02.320]   I'd be biasing the outcomes.
[01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:03.980]   But if it's a self-experiment
[01:30:03.980 --> 01:30:06.140]   and the goal is simply to shift one's,
[01:30:07.820 --> 01:30:09.460]   mental life or behavior,
[01:30:09.460 --> 01:30:11.840]   then I don't know that it matters that much.
[01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:13.600]   - Can I go with a little anecdote there
[01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:15.200]   that you may appreciate?
[01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:18.080]   I'll get a call from a coach,
[01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:20.360]   say an NBA coach,
[01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:23.720]   and it'll be with their medical staff.
[01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:25.580]   And they'll say, "We have this player.
[01:30:25.580 --> 01:30:28.420]   "They play 18 minutes a game.
[01:30:28.420 --> 01:30:29.260]   "Can you help?"
[01:30:29.260 --> 01:30:30.760]   And they have a back pain history.
[01:30:30.760 --> 01:30:34.940]   "Could you help us to get them to play 27 minutes a game?
[01:30:34.940 --> 01:30:38.520]   "And then I'll investigate and understand the player.
[01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:43.520]   "And then I may ask a question to the coach.
[01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:48.560]   "What puts paying bums in the seats in the stadium?"
[01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:52.320]   And they'll say, "Well, what do you mean?"
[01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:53.560]   And I said, "Well, it's that player
[01:30:53.560 --> 01:30:55.420]   "that we're talking about.
[01:30:55.420 --> 01:30:58.180]   "That player is magical for the 18 minutes that they play
[01:30:58.180 --> 01:31:00.960]   "because they're sparky, they're explosive."
[01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:03.500]   If we train them,
[01:31:03.500 --> 01:31:06.100]   and they have a plastic physiology and neurology
[01:31:06.100 --> 01:31:09.060]   that we can train so that they can last 27 minutes,
[01:31:09.060 --> 01:31:13.380]   you realize that you're trading off the explosiveness.
[01:31:13.380 --> 01:31:16.300]   You cannot have a really high VO2 max
[01:31:16.300 --> 01:31:17.820]   and be maximally explosive.
[01:31:17.820 --> 01:31:19.060]   They're competing mechanisms.
[01:31:19.060 --> 01:31:23.340]   One's a fast twitch mechanism for speed and explosiveness.
[01:31:23.340 --> 01:31:26.700]   And the other one is an endurable physiology.
[01:31:26.700 --> 01:31:30.280]   And you trade one for the other.
[01:31:30.280 --> 01:31:35.280]   So do you really want to compromise that explosiveness?
[01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:41.420]   And you see this when you're on a team
[01:31:41.420 --> 01:31:44.620]   getting a combat athlete ready.
[01:31:44.620 --> 01:31:46.620]   If they are neurologically explosive,
[01:31:46.620 --> 01:31:50.060]   you design the fight and the training
[01:31:50.060 --> 01:31:51.980]   that they pretty much have to win in the first round.
[01:31:51.980 --> 01:31:53.620]   And if they don't win in the first round,
[01:31:53.620 --> 01:31:55.900]   they're going to gas out.
[01:31:55.900 --> 01:32:00.900]   And the person who is preparing to compete against them
[01:32:00.900 --> 01:32:05.120]   is training to survive the first round
[01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:06.960]   and then come on in the second.
[01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:08.460]   So they're training endurance.
[01:32:08.460 --> 01:32:12.480]   To compare those two different athletes
[01:32:12.480 --> 01:32:15.060]   from a psychological point of view,
[01:32:15.060 --> 01:32:16.000]   and if you do it enough,
[01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.360]   I think you'll come to agree with me.
[01:32:18.360 --> 01:32:21.440]   And you will notice that there is how you coach them.
[01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.860]   It has to be in short consumable bites.
[01:32:25.860 --> 01:32:29.820]   And it's not that they're any more or less intelligent.
[01:32:29.820 --> 01:32:34.500]   They get it, but you have to be on cue
[01:32:34.500 --> 01:32:36.360]   and choose your words, be efficient.
[01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:38.920]   Do you see what I mean?
[01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:41.340]   The coaching style changes quite a bit.
[01:32:41.340 --> 01:32:44.880]   - Do you think that if somebody has pain,
[01:32:44.880 --> 01:32:47.220]   that they should have the capacity
[01:32:47.220 --> 01:32:50.420]   both to like lean into and push into the pain,
[01:32:50.420 --> 01:32:52.040]   not exacerbate it,
[01:32:52.040 --> 01:32:56.080]   but to sit with it and feel it
[01:32:56.080 --> 01:32:58.080]   as opposed to just avoiding it?
[01:32:58.080 --> 01:33:00.300]   How should people think about their own pain
[01:33:00.300 --> 01:33:01.140]   and how to work with it?
[01:33:01.140 --> 01:33:02.260]   That's the reason I'm asking.
[01:33:02.260 --> 01:33:03.900]   - Right.
[01:33:03.900 --> 01:33:06.840]   It depends and it's a dance.
[01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:08.200]   So I can give you some examples.
[01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:13.160]   One chapter in my "Back Mechanic" book is called,
[01:33:13.160 --> 01:33:15.120]   well, it's about surgery.
[01:33:15.120 --> 01:33:17.180]   And should you have surgery?
[01:33:18.700 --> 01:33:21.280]   We did this because as you know,
[01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:23.520]   in our experimental clinic at the university,
[01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:26.820]   we followed up with every patient we ever saw.
[01:33:26.820 --> 01:33:30.120]   We would assess them
[01:33:30.120 --> 01:33:34.120]   and then we would subcategorize them into different bins.
[01:33:34.120 --> 01:33:40.120]   If a person was told you've tried everything,
[01:33:40.120 --> 01:33:41.640]   you've been to the chiropractor,
[01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:44.120]   you've been to the physical therapist, the osteopath,
[01:33:44.120 --> 01:33:46.240]   you've had a surgical consult,
[01:33:46.240 --> 01:33:49.620]   you've been to the psychologist, et cetera,
[01:33:49.620 --> 01:33:51.180]   and you failed every single one of them.
[01:33:51.180 --> 01:33:53.740]   So basically you've been conditioned to fail.
[01:33:53.740 --> 01:33:59.400]   We tried a process called virtual surgery.
[01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:02.420]   So I'm defining the group now.
[01:34:02.420 --> 01:34:03.500]   You've tried everything
[01:34:03.500 --> 01:34:06.880]   and you've been told the last thing for you is surgery.
[01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:09.300]   That's the subcategory of people
[01:34:09.300 --> 01:34:11.180]   that we're now gonna talk about.
[01:34:11.180 --> 01:34:12.020]   And I'll say, fine,
[01:34:12.020 --> 01:34:14.740]   you can go and roll the dice and have surgery.
[01:34:14.740 --> 01:34:17.180]   Most of them don't want it, obviously.
[01:34:17.180 --> 01:34:18.880]   And I'll say, but what we're going to do
[01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:21.600]   is try virtual surgery.
[01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:24.120]   And I make a bit of a production out of it.
[01:34:24.120 --> 01:34:25.500]   I anoint them like a knight.
[01:34:25.500 --> 01:34:28.060]   I touch them on the shoulder and I say, that's your surgery.
[01:34:28.060 --> 01:34:29.960]   And I'm looking into their eyes
[01:34:29.960 --> 01:34:32.120]   and now I give them one of these.
[01:34:32.120 --> 01:34:35.620]   We're looking into each other's soul now.
[01:34:35.620 --> 01:34:36.940]   You've had surgery.
[01:34:36.940 --> 01:34:39.380]   You're gonna behave like you've had surgery.
[01:34:39.380 --> 01:34:42.740]   Tomorrow, your first post-surgical recovery day,
[01:34:42.740 --> 01:34:45.460]   you're going to lay in bed, relax,
[01:34:45.460 --> 01:34:47.840]   get up for a pee every two or three hours,
[01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:50.580]   have short little shuffles.
[01:34:50.580 --> 01:34:53.940]   The next day we'll add a little bit more, et cetera.
[01:34:53.940 --> 01:34:56.920]   We give you a post-surgical recovery program,
[01:34:56.920 --> 01:34:57.980]   a really good one.
[01:34:57.980 --> 01:35:02.180]   And then we start tuning the body strategically,
[01:35:02.180 --> 01:35:04.120]   stability, mobility,
[01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:06.100]   eventually adding a little bit of endurance
[01:35:06.100 --> 01:35:07.860]   long before strength,
[01:35:07.860 --> 01:35:10.820]   and then getting the movement patterns, et cetera.
[01:35:11.820 --> 01:35:14.100]   (sighs)
[01:35:14.100 --> 01:35:18.180]   If the person was an exercise addict as well,
[01:35:18.180 --> 01:35:21.860]   so you can imagine the person who has the personality
[01:35:21.860 --> 01:35:23.020]   that you're describing.
[01:35:23.020 --> 01:35:25.840]   They tell me in the interview,
[01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:28.540]   I have to ride the elliptical for 40 minutes every day,
[01:35:28.540 --> 01:35:31.780]   because if I don't, I'm gonna murder my kids and my husband
[01:35:31.780 --> 01:35:33.180]   because that's my stress relief.
[01:35:33.180 --> 01:35:34.020]   - Oh my goodness.
[01:35:34.020 --> 01:35:35.860]   - Not literally, but that's what they'll say
[01:35:35.860 --> 01:35:38.180]   as painting the picture.
[01:35:38.180 --> 01:35:39.220]   - Give that person a treadmill.
[01:35:39.220 --> 01:35:40.060]   - Right.
[01:35:40.060 --> 01:35:40.900]   - An exercise book.
[01:35:40.900 --> 01:35:43.460]   - Okay, so they've won that negotiation
[01:35:43.460 --> 01:35:44.780]   with every previous clinician.
[01:35:44.780 --> 01:35:46.020]   Well, they're not gonna win it with me
[01:35:46.020 --> 01:35:48.980]   because all I care about is outcome.
[01:35:48.980 --> 01:35:53.940]   My job is to get them better by whatever means.
[01:35:53.940 --> 01:35:59.240]   So I have to tame that.
[01:35:59.240 --> 01:36:03.340]   Surgery works in a lot of cases because it's forced rest.
[01:36:03.340 --> 01:36:06.620]   Surgery for that exercise addict
[01:36:06.620 --> 01:36:08.820]   forced them to have rest
[01:36:08.820 --> 01:36:10.580]   and allowed them to desensitize.
[01:36:10.580 --> 01:36:13.340]   So we fake it and we do it.
[01:36:13.340 --> 01:36:14.600]   Now for the evidence.
[01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:16.300]   We followed up with every patient
[01:36:16.300 --> 01:36:18.300]   and in a two-year follow-up,
[01:36:18.300 --> 01:36:22.540]   95% of those people who avoided surgery
[01:36:22.540 --> 01:36:26.880]   but did the virtual surgery were glad that they did.
[01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:28.380]   - Yeah, that answers the question.
[01:36:28.380 --> 01:36:31.080]   It's follow the advice of the clinician.
[01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:36.540]   And it gets back to this issue of predisposition
[01:36:36.540 --> 01:36:38.980]   to move a certain way,
[01:36:38.980 --> 01:36:42.380]   to therefore avoid other forms of movement,
[01:36:42.380 --> 01:36:45.500]   to engage in certain activities, but not other activities.
[01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:48.420]   I realized that I'll get in trouble if I say,
[01:36:48.420 --> 01:36:50.220]   70% of the training that we do
[01:36:50.220 --> 01:36:52.380]   should be in line with our predisposition
[01:36:52.380 --> 01:36:55.420]   and 30% should be countercurrent to that.
[01:36:55.420 --> 01:36:57.260]   But I'm kind of veering towards numbers
[01:36:57.260 --> 01:36:59.260]   more or less like that, right?
[01:36:59.260 --> 01:37:01.020]   I mean, we know for instance,
[01:37:01.020 --> 01:37:04.200]   in the machine learning algorithms
[01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:06.180]   that relate to learning in the nervous system
[01:37:06.180 --> 01:37:09.940]   that a rough, this is a rough estimate of difficulty
[01:37:09.940 --> 01:37:14.740]   should be about 15% of questions or challenges.
[01:37:14.740 --> 01:37:16.420]   So these could be cognitive challenges
[01:37:16.420 --> 01:37:20.200]   or physical challenges should lead to failures,
[01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:22.180]   non-injurious failures, right?
[01:37:22.180 --> 01:37:24.460]   Getting the answer wrong about 15% of the time
[01:37:24.460 --> 01:37:25.660]   tends to optimize learning
[01:37:25.660 --> 01:37:27.620]   across a number of different domains.
[01:37:27.620 --> 01:37:29.700]   Okay, like, is that true for everything?
[01:37:29.700 --> 01:37:31.740]   Is it true for language, math, dance?
[01:37:31.740 --> 01:37:33.900]   No, but it's true for a lot of things.
[01:37:33.900 --> 01:37:36.020]   - That's an argument that's used a lot
[01:37:36.020 --> 01:37:41.020]   and I, however, as I said,
[01:37:41.020 --> 01:37:44.940]   I've done the work and I've done the follow-up
[01:37:44.940 --> 01:37:46.740]   and I have an opinion for a reason.
[01:37:46.740 --> 01:37:53.300]   We start out by giving them the tools to not have pain.
[01:37:53.300 --> 01:37:57.780]   From a physical point of view, that's really important.
[01:37:57.780 --> 01:37:59.900]   From a psychological point of view,
[01:37:59.900 --> 01:38:01.900]   we've just empowered that person.
[01:38:01.900 --> 01:38:05.540]   They are now in control because they never had the tools.
[01:38:05.540 --> 01:38:06.820]   A, they didn't understand
[01:38:06.820 --> 01:38:09.340]   what the real mechanism of pain was,
[01:38:09.340 --> 01:38:12.960]   so they had no strategy to down-regulate it,
[01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:16.260]   if I'm a neuroscientist, or to desensitize it.
[01:38:16.260 --> 01:38:18.780]   But now they know with some precision
[01:38:18.780 --> 01:38:21.400]   what the moves, the loads, the activities are
[01:38:21.400 --> 01:38:22.580]   that cause their pain.
[01:38:22.580 --> 01:38:23.820]   They know the counterpoints,
[01:38:23.820 --> 01:38:26.660]   what actually are beneficial for their pain.
[01:38:26.660 --> 01:38:30.660]   And they begin this life
[01:38:30.660 --> 01:38:33.740]   of having as little pain as possible.
[01:38:33.740 --> 01:38:38.740]   Now I go back to the tipping point
[01:38:38.740 --> 01:38:40.900]   and all systems need stress.
[01:38:40.900 --> 01:38:44.100]   But in the beginning, we cannot cross the tipping point.
[01:38:44.100 --> 01:38:46.100]   And that's really the essence of your question.
[01:38:46.100 --> 01:38:48.140]   When do we start pushing them now
[01:38:48.140 --> 01:38:50.240]   to allow a little bit of pain?
[01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:51.860]   Some people start it way too early.
[01:38:51.860 --> 01:38:53.060]   We do not.
[01:38:53.060 --> 01:38:55.620]   We know where that tipping point is
[01:38:55.620 --> 01:38:58.660]   and we keep building the training capacity
[01:38:58.660 --> 01:39:01.620]   of being pain-free until we have a margin of safety.
[01:39:01.620 --> 01:39:04.860]   Now it's that margin of safety that we start to play with.
[01:39:04.860 --> 01:39:08.980]   Can we expand the volume of training
[01:39:08.980 --> 01:39:12.900]   and get them ready to go back to work
[01:39:12.900 --> 01:39:14.180]   or to go back to their sport?
[01:39:14.180 --> 01:39:16.540]   Or maybe they just wanna play recreational golf.
[01:39:16.540 --> 01:39:17.800]   We've talked about that.
[01:39:17.800 --> 01:39:21.820]   Eventually, we're going to go to the point
[01:39:21.820 --> 01:39:24.960]   where we're butting up against the tipping point now.
[01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:27.260]   Now we have another conversation.
[01:39:27.260 --> 01:39:28.900]   Remember what the goal is.
[01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:31.400]   How important is it for you
[01:39:31.400 --> 01:39:33.480]   to set a personal past in deadlift
[01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:36.520]   or to play 18 holes of golf five days a week?
[01:39:36.520 --> 01:39:41.000]   Would you settle for three?
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.720]   And now they've had a year of no pain.
[01:39:43.720 --> 01:39:45.320]   Their life has changed.
[01:39:45.320 --> 01:39:48.160]   They're mentally in a different place.
[01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:51.080]   They have their answer
[01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:53.520]   and they converged on it themselves.
[01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:54.520]   I'm not 18.
[01:39:54.520 --> 01:39:58.160]   I'm 55 years of age.
[01:39:58.160 --> 01:39:59.960]   I've got two young grandkids.
[01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:03.640]   I'm looking forward to playing golf with them when I'm 75.
[01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:06.400]   So do you see how, when we bring them through that way,
[01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:09.320]   accepting a certain amount of pain,
[01:40:09.320 --> 01:40:13.040]   that's more of a younger person's outlook.
[01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:14.920]   There's still some warriors left.
[01:40:14.920 --> 01:40:17.780]   A lot of us soften up as we get older.
[01:40:17.780 --> 01:40:20.080]   But I just think of my own journey.
[01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:22.960]   I trained heavy as a kid.
[01:40:22.960 --> 01:40:24.200]   And I remember my dad saying,
[01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:26.480]   well, why are you doing this?
[01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:29.160]   You're really shortening your athletic career.
[01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:31.200]   Not that I had one, but you know.
[01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:34.040]   And he was right.
[01:40:34.040 --> 01:40:38.360]   And now my training has totally changed.
[01:40:38.360 --> 01:40:40.560]   But as you know, I have no pain.
[01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:44.220]   I'm still fairly physical.
[01:40:44.220 --> 01:40:46.200]   - Yeah, you're in great shape at 67.
[01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:47.020]   - Yeah.
[01:40:47.020 --> 01:40:48.760]   - Just remarkable shape.
[01:40:48.760 --> 01:40:50.440]   For those listening and not watching,
[01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:52.360]   I encourage you to take a look at the top card
[01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:53.200]   or the YouTube video.
[01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:56.280]   I mean, Stu moves around great
[01:40:56.280 --> 01:41:00.040]   and your posture's great
[01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:03.840]   and you're in awesome shape for any age,
[01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:05.760]   much less 67.
[01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:07.640]   So that's a testament to your methods.
[01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:09.680]   - Well, the point was,
[01:41:09.680 --> 01:41:12.940]   it's okay to push when you're younger.
[01:41:12.940 --> 01:41:14.840]   You don't have the capacity to push now.
[01:41:14.840 --> 01:41:18.520]   If I go into pain, I'm in pain for a few days,
[01:41:18.520 --> 01:41:19.520]   not an hour.
[01:41:19.520 --> 01:41:20.360]   - So you're cautious.
[01:41:20.360 --> 01:41:23.400]   - Yeah, and older people will get to that point.
[01:41:24.280 --> 01:41:27.560]   - I'd like to ask you about McGill's Big Three.
[01:41:27.560 --> 01:41:29.320]   I know that, again, you loathe
[01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:32.160]   to impart generalizations on people,
[01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:34.200]   but at some point you realized
[01:41:34.200 --> 01:41:37.740]   that people need something to do,
[01:41:37.740 --> 01:41:41.900]   to work with in order to try and "pain-proof" their back
[01:41:41.900 --> 01:41:43.880]   or reinforce their back.
[01:41:43.880 --> 01:41:48.680]   So we did a video that included the Big Three.
[01:41:48.680 --> 01:41:50.880]   We'll provide a link to those in the show note captions
[01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:52.400]   where I performed the Big Three,
[01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:55.000]   probably not perfectly, admittedly.
[01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.920]   I should have invited you to critique my form,
[01:41:57.920 --> 01:41:59.840]   and we can always shoot another one of those,
[01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:03.340]   but I think it captures the Big Three well enough.
[01:42:03.340 --> 01:42:08.620]   The bird dog, the roll-up and the side plank,
[01:42:08.620 --> 01:42:14.720]   designed to build strength and stability around the spine
[01:42:14.720 --> 01:42:17.320]   and to stave off back pain,
[01:42:17.320 --> 01:42:21.160]   or in some cases, rehabilitate back pain.
[01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:23.080]   An enormous number of people wrote to us
[01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:26.200]   and commented how much the Big Three have helped them.
[01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:28.120]   So I just want to make sure that it's clear
[01:42:28.120 --> 01:42:32.760]   that despite the fact that you are appropriately reluctant
[01:42:32.760 --> 01:42:35.360]   to say that the Big Three is the solution to everything
[01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:37.000]   in terms of back pain for everyone,
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:41.960]   they have helped a large, large number of people avoid,
[01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:45.020]   and in some cases, rehabilitate back pain.
[01:42:45.020 --> 01:42:49.940]   If you were to add a fourth exercise to the Big Three,
[01:42:51.080 --> 01:42:52.160]   what would it be?
[01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:53.760]   - It depends on the assessment.
[01:42:53.760 --> 01:42:56.360]   - Let's say somebody has a willowy spine
[01:42:56.360 --> 01:42:58.960]   and they want more spine stability.
[01:42:58.960 --> 01:43:02.440]   They want to be able to generate more spine rigidity
[01:43:02.440 --> 01:43:03.680]   for whatever purpose.
[01:43:03.680 --> 01:43:05.440]   - What are their pain triggers?
[01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:10.400]   - They have a lower back pain that's unilateral,
[01:43:10.400 --> 01:43:13.320]   and when they sit too long and then stand up,
[01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:15.240]   it feels like that side is locked up
[01:43:15.240 --> 01:43:16.880]   and there's some pain shooting down the leg.
[01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:19.440]   - Okay, so they've got mechanical back pain,
[01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:21.320]   they've got neurological involvement
[01:43:21.320 --> 01:43:23.360]   if it's shooting down the leg.
[01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:24.480]   How old are they?
[01:43:24.480 --> 01:43:27.360]   - Early 50s, maybe in their 40s, or older.
[01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:28.200]   - Okay. - It's a big range.
[01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:31.000]   - So they will have some discogenic disorder.
[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.600]   There's a disorder of the joint
[01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:38.600]   and it will be causing the nerve to react in such a way.
[01:43:38.600 --> 01:43:43.200]   - And when they walk a bit, 10, 15 minutes,
[01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:44.280]   they tend to feel better.
[01:43:44.280 --> 01:43:47.000]   - Ah, okay, so they have a younger spine
[01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:50.000]   because discogenic disorders
[01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:53.080]   are more common among younger people
[01:43:53.080 --> 01:43:57.080]   and sitting is the causative pathway.
[01:43:57.080 --> 01:43:59.280]   Going for a walk is the relieving pathway,
[01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:02.440]   but that will switch over when they get older.
[01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:03.280]   - Is that right?
[01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:04.340]   - Yeah, sitting becomes the relief
[01:44:04.340 --> 01:44:08.420]   and walking then becomes the exacerbator of their pain.
[01:44:08.420 --> 01:44:13.760]   Well, again, I need to know with some precision
[01:44:14.780 --> 01:44:17.980]   what the pathway is,
[01:44:17.980 --> 01:44:22.020]   but if they have neurological parts,
[01:44:22.020 --> 01:44:24.740]   I need to know why, what makes them worse.
[01:44:24.740 --> 01:44:27.100]   So I might have them sit upright in a chair,
[01:44:27.100 --> 01:44:30.100]   grab the seat pan of the chair and pull up.
[01:44:30.100 --> 01:44:31.860]   I'm adding compression.
[01:44:31.860 --> 01:44:36.400]   Does that cause more nerve radiation?
[01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:37.940]   If it does, they've got a little bit
[01:44:37.940 --> 01:44:39.600]   of compression intolerance.
[01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:41.620]   Okay, so now I have to choose an exercise
[01:44:41.620 --> 01:44:44.880]   that is not compressive by nature.
[01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:52.040]   If I move the nerve, so if I extend their leg,
[01:44:52.040 --> 01:44:54.440]   at the same time, ask them to look up,
[01:44:54.440 --> 01:44:58.240]   it releases the whole spinal cord
[01:44:58.240 --> 01:45:00.260]   and all the nerve roots from above
[01:45:00.260 --> 01:45:01.420]   and it pulls it from below.
[01:45:01.420 --> 01:45:03.780]   In other words, it flosses it through.
[01:45:03.780 --> 01:45:06.240]   If that causes pain as they're doing it,
[01:45:06.240 --> 01:45:08.020]   they've got nerve friction.
[01:45:08.020 --> 01:45:11.940]   If they do it and it's tensile tension,
[01:45:11.940 --> 01:45:13.380]   then it's nerve tension.
[01:45:13.380 --> 01:45:18.380]   So these are very different mechanisms of their pain
[01:45:18.380 --> 01:45:21.100]   and they require different approaches.
[01:45:21.100 --> 01:45:24.540]   So do you see why I'm still hedging on that next exercise?
[01:45:24.540 --> 01:45:28.060]   It might be mobilizing the nerve.
[01:45:28.060 --> 01:45:32.860]   It might be giving them more thoracic spine extension
[01:45:32.860 --> 01:45:37.260]   through a thoracic, and now they've taken the load off
[01:45:37.260 --> 01:45:39.900]   when they sit and stand.
[01:45:39.900 --> 01:45:41.860]   So you can imagine standing,
[01:45:41.860 --> 01:45:44.100]   you can palpate your erector spinae muscles
[01:45:44.100 --> 01:45:45.500]   and they might be relaxed.
[01:45:45.500 --> 01:45:48.140]   You poke your chin and those muscles come on.
[01:45:48.140 --> 01:45:51.740]   And if the, but the cramp was on one side
[01:45:51.740 --> 01:45:55.740]   and if it was muscular, that's probably not related to this.
[01:45:55.740 --> 01:46:00.100]   That's still a very discogenic sign.
[01:46:00.100 --> 01:46:03.300]   There's a bulge or there's something off that's mechanical
[01:46:03.300 --> 01:46:05.180]   that we will determine.
[01:46:05.180 --> 01:46:10.180]   I might just say walk more, but not in a single dose.
[01:46:10.180 --> 01:46:14.820]   And again, I've described all of this in back mechanic.
[01:46:14.820 --> 01:46:20.660]   Instead of walking an hour in one dose,
[01:46:20.660 --> 01:46:22.620]   have three 20 minute walks.
[01:46:22.620 --> 01:46:26.620]   Walking for an hour, increase the risk of getting pain.
[01:46:26.620 --> 01:46:29.580]   Walking for 20 minutes, guaranteed you have no pain.
[01:46:29.580 --> 01:46:32.900]   So do it in three doses, you've just guaranteed success.
[01:46:32.900 --> 01:46:35.260]   So I might add another exercise,
[01:46:35.260 --> 01:46:38.140]   but I might program it very strategically as well.
[01:46:38.140 --> 01:46:40.660]   - What are your thoughts on inversion tables
[01:46:40.660 --> 01:46:44.700]   and anti-gravity boots and things to deload the spine?
[01:46:44.700 --> 01:46:49.340]   - Right, well, again, if you follow our work,
[01:46:49.340 --> 01:46:54.340]   we do do deloading of the spine through traction.
[01:46:54.340 --> 01:46:59.940]   It's usually applied by one of our trained clinicians.
[01:46:59.940 --> 01:47:01.340]   And the reason for that is,
[01:47:01.340 --> 01:47:03.340]   let's take that younger person again,
[01:47:03.340 --> 01:47:06.800]   as you just described, maybe laying on their tummy.
[01:47:06.800 --> 01:47:10.860]   As they exhale, they allow the low back
[01:47:10.860 --> 01:47:13.860]   to sink into the table, increasing the lordosis,
[01:47:13.860 --> 01:47:16.300]   which is, we measured this in the lab.
[01:47:16.300 --> 01:47:19.260]   If they have a posterior disc bulge with an open fissure,
[01:47:19.260 --> 01:47:21.900]   which is probably one of the more common ones,
[01:47:21.900 --> 01:47:27.940]   that maneuver vacuums in the disc bulge.
[01:47:27.940 --> 01:47:31.140]   If that immediately reduces the pain down their leg,
[01:47:31.140 --> 01:47:35.340]   I would say lay prone and have someone pull on your legs
[01:47:35.340 --> 01:47:38.800]   along the plane of the table, five or six pounds per leg.
[01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:41.600]   Now the next person comes in and say, "Oh, that hurts."
[01:47:41.600 --> 01:47:43.540]   Well, now we play what we call jazz.
[01:47:43.540 --> 01:47:45.580]   This is the art of therapy.
[01:47:45.580 --> 01:47:48.100]   I'm playing with how we're going to apply
[01:47:48.100 --> 01:47:50.080]   a twisting torque to their feet.
[01:47:50.080 --> 01:47:54.260]   No decompression table does all of this.
[01:47:54.260 --> 01:47:57.900]   It doesn't have the art.
[01:47:57.900 --> 01:48:00.860]   It's more of a brutal hammer.
[01:48:00.860 --> 01:48:02.720]   And to really get difficult people,
[01:48:02.720 --> 01:48:05.140]   because remember, no one has back pain and says,
[01:48:05.140 --> 01:48:06.300]   "Oh, I think I'll go see Miguel."
[01:48:06.300 --> 01:48:07.580]   It doesn't work that way.
[01:48:07.580 --> 01:48:11.700]   We only get the ones who've failed 10 previous attempts.
[01:48:11.700 --> 01:48:12.520]   The difficult ones.
[01:48:12.520 --> 01:48:14.140]   - Try every other treatment.
[01:48:14.140 --> 01:48:17.300]   - No, we've got to know, we've got to have some skills here.
[01:48:17.300 --> 01:48:18.860]   - Well, I started doing the big three
[01:48:18.860 --> 01:48:20.740]   on the basis of your book.
[01:48:21.720 --> 01:48:25.640]   And it certainly has helped my lower right side back pain
[01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:27.280]   that occasionally flares up.
[01:48:27.280 --> 01:48:30.980]   I also noticed I've gotten stronger in various lifts,
[01:48:30.980 --> 01:48:35.980]   but the most salient consequence has been when I run,
[01:48:35.980 --> 01:48:41.760]   I feel like my torso can stay more upright
[01:48:41.760 --> 01:48:45.120]   as I can kind of cycle my legs underneath me,
[01:48:45.120 --> 01:48:46.760]   like I'm pedaling on a bike.
[01:48:46.760 --> 01:48:49.280]   And I feel like I have endurance for days.
[01:48:49.280 --> 01:48:50.920]   - That's exactly what you should feel.
[01:48:50.920 --> 01:48:53.400]   So you've improved the cylinder.
[01:48:53.400 --> 01:48:56.680]   So the diaphragm pumps up and down inside the cylinder
[01:48:56.680 --> 01:48:58.640]   to allow you to lung ventilate.
[01:48:58.640 --> 01:49:03.000]   If you don't have that athletic diaphragm,
[01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.320]   you're entraining your abdominal muscles,
[01:49:05.320 --> 01:49:07.980]   the oblique muscles to the breathing effort
[01:49:07.980 --> 01:49:10.000]   while you're running, it wears you out.
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.120]   It also compromises your spine.
[01:49:12.120 --> 01:49:14.960]   So you need those muscles to form a girdle
[01:49:14.960 --> 01:49:16.680]   and hold it all together.
[01:49:16.680 --> 01:49:20.080]   Now, I know enough of your history
[01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:23.320]   that I suspect you will have a little bit of a disc bulge.
[01:49:23.320 --> 01:49:24.280]   - I do, yeah.
[01:49:24.280 --> 01:49:29.280]   I had a whole body scan for fun,
[01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:31.120]   I guess is the sort of thing I do for fun.
[01:49:31.120 --> 01:49:35.560]   And indeed, I think it's like an L3, L4 bulge on one side,
[01:49:35.560 --> 01:49:38.920]   which is fully consistent with the pattern of pain
[01:49:38.920 --> 01:49:40.240]   that I've had.
[01:49:40.240 --> 01:49:42.680]   And I've managed to avoid for a number of years now
[01:49:42.680 --> 01:49:46.520]   doing Cobra type pose, these kinds of things.
[01:49:46.520 --> 01:49:48.600]   - The Cobra doesn't work for everybody,
[01:49:48.600 --> 01:49:53.120]   but it is a powerful vacuuming in
[01:49:53.120 --> 01:49:55.040]   of certain types of disc bulges.
[01:49:55.040 --> 01:49:57.480]   So I'm glad it works for you and you found it.
[01:49:57.480 --> 01:49:59.320]   And it will work for some others,
[01:49:59.320 --> 01:50:01.680]   or it will make the pain worse than some others.
[01:50:01.680 --> 01:50:04.200]   And there's tests for figuring that out.
[01:50:04.200 --> 01:50:07.040]   - I noticed if I travel and it forces me to sit
[01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:09.400]   for long periods of time, and then the next day
[01:50:09.400 --> 01:50:13.360]   I train with any kind of hip hinge movement,
[01:50:13.360 --> 01:50:15.000]   it flares up again.
[01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:16.480]   - Right.
[01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:19.120]   - Don't forget to use your lumbar on the airplane.
[01:50:19.120 --> 01:50:20.200]   - Right, yes.
[01:50:20.200 --> 01:50:23.840]   Dr. McGill gave me this little pillow called lumbar
[01:50:23.840 --> 01:50:25.640]   that inflates you put it in the lower back.
[01:50:25.640 --> 01:50:27.840]   And it's a wonderful tool.
[01:50:27.840 --> 01:50:32.840]   - Right, that gives you resilience for travel.
[01:50:32.840 --> 01:50:34.840]   - If one didn't have access to that,
[01:50:34.840 --> 01:50:37.280]   they could just roll up a towel and put in their lower back.
[01:50:37.280 --> 01:50:39.520]   - Absolutely, yeah, or sitting in a lecture.
[01:50:39.520 --> 01:50:42.640]   If they're a student, travel with it.
[01:50:42.640 --> 01:50:45.000]   Sitting in a restaurant, people who go and say,
[01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:46.840]   "Oh, my back's killing me,"
[01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:49.880]   after sitting in that booth in the restaurant.
[01:50:49.880 --> 01:50:50.940]   - You might get some funny looks,
[01:50:50.940 --> 01:50:52.720]   but you'll be the person still mobile
[01:50:52.720 --> 01:50:54.680]   and not complaining about your pain
[01:50:54.680 --> 01:50:57.160]   when everyone else is grunting.
[01:50:57.160 --> 01:51:00.560]   - I'm past the funny looks, I'm okay with that.
[01:51:00.560 --> 01:51:03.760]   - That's an advanced neuroplasticity trick
[01:51:03.760 --> 01:51:06.420]   that comes with age, I'm right there with you.
[01:51:06.420 --> 01:51:10.200]   I have a question about walking.
[01:51:10.200 --> 01:51:12.760]   These days we're hearing more and more
[01:51:12.760 --> 01:51:15.200]   about benefits of walking after meals,
[01:51:15.200 --> 01:51:17.760]   walking several times per day, blood sugar regulation.
[01:51:17.760 --> 01:51:18.600]   I think it's all wonderful.
[01:51:18.600 --> 01:51:21.480]   Anything that gets people moving in healthy ways,
[01:51:21.480 --> 01:51:22.620]   I think is terrific.
[01:51:22.620 --> 01:51:26.280]   When it comes to walking,
[01:51:26.280 --> 01:51:28.460]   none of us want to be the person paying careful attention
[01:51:28.460 --> 01:51:30.980]   to our gait, especially when we're not in pain
[01:51:30.980 --> 01:51:32.160]   and things of that sort.
[01:51:32.160 --> 01:51:35.680]   But if you were going to recommend a daily walk,
[01:51:35.680 --> 01:51:38.920]   is there a duration and speed that you think
[01:51:38.920 --> 01:51:43.020]   could be beneficial in terms of staving off back pain,
[01:51:43.020 --> 01:51:46.880]   just general posture, things of that sort?
[01:51:46.880 --> 01:51:48.720]   Are we talking about a brisk five minute walk
[01:51:48.720 --> 01:51:51.180]   or a brisk 20 minute walk, this kind of thing?
[01:51:51.180 --> 01:51:55.200]   - I'm with you 100% with the notion
[01:51:55.200 --> 01:51:58.960]   that walking is one of the most healthy things you can do.
[01:51:58.960 --> 01:52:02.280]   I get stuck a little bit when you want me to give numbers
[01:52:02.280 --> 01:52:05.640]   in a generic broad application.
[01:52:05.640 --> 01:52:06.520]   - Ranges are fine.
[01:52:06.520 --> 01:52:11.520]   - If I saw the person and they have a back pain history,
[01:52:11.520 --> 01:52:16.960]   I would know, A, should I just leave walking alone
[01:52:16.960 --> 01:52:18.120]   and tell them to walk?
[01:52:18.120 --> 01:52:20.280]   It's quite fine, that's not your problem,
[01:52:20.280 --> 01:52:22.920]   but we still want you to walk three or four times a day.
[01:52:22.920 --> 01:52:24.680]   But I know what the question is
[01:52:24.680 --> 01:52:27.240]   and you want some general rules on all of this.
[01:52:27.240 --> 01:52:30.440]   Don't walk to pain.
[01:52:30.440 --> 01:52:33.680]   So if your tipping point is 40 minutes,
[01:52:33.680 --> 01:52:35.960]   you can't go and for a 40 minute walk,
[01:52:35.960 --> 01:52:39.500]   you've just guaranteed that you will be unsuccessful
[01:52:39.500 --> 01:52:41.440]   in having a pain-free day.
[01:52:41.440 --> 01:52:43.800]   But can you walk 20 minutes?
[01:52:43.800 --> 01:52:48.120]   Good, walk 20 minutes three times a day.
[01:52:48.120 --> 01:52:51.360]   Now you've got a full hour of pain-free walking guaranteed.
[01:52:51.360 --> 01:52:52.720]   So it was the exposure
[01:52:52.720 --> 01:52:54.720]   and how you dosed it throughout the day.
[01:52:54.720 --> 01:52:59.480]   If the person has discogenic back pain,
[01:52:59.480 --> 01:53:02.240]   they will find that they don't like to stand
[01:53:02.240 --> 01:53:03.720]   in one position for very long,
[01:53:03.720 --> 01:53:05.720]   sit in one position for very long,
[01:53:05.720 --> 01:53:08.480]   or do any single activity for a long period of time.
[01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:10.520]   So the key for their daily regimen
[01:53:10.520 --> 01:53:12.080]   is to keep changing posture.
[01:53:12.080 --> 01:53:15.680]   So something like a sit-stand desk at work
[01:53:15.680 --> 01:53:17.540]   would be a really good idea.
[01:53:17.540 --> 01:53:22.440]   But now the magic comes if they could sit for 20 minutes,
[01:53:22.440 --> 01:53:27.000]   stand for 30 minutes and walk for 10.
[01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:30.680]   Now that was the magic that just of the dosing
[01:53:30.680 --> 01:53:34.200]   that allows them to do their job as a computer programmer
[01:53:34.200 --> 01:53:36.480]   or whatever it is where they're a slave to the computer,
[01:53:36.480 --> 01:53:38.120]   there's no option.
[01:53:38.120 --> 01:53:41.340]   So there's an idea there.
[01:53:41.340 --> 01:53:45.320]   In my own life, it's a habit.
[01:53:45.320 --> 01:53:47.760]   I walk after every meal.
[01:53:47.760 --> 01:53:49.000]   I walk before I go to bed
[01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:52.060]   and that's my time with my wife and my dog.
[01:53:52.060 --> 01:53:53.620]   And it's our routine.
[01:53:53.620 --> 01:53:57.900]   And it is, even when we travel in the winter,
[01:53:57.900 --> 01:54:01.800]   we drive South, we break up the drive and we do our walks
[01:54:01.800 --> 01:54:04.800]   and it keeps us pain-free.
[01:54:04.800 --> 01:54:07.120]   If I say, it doesn't matter who you are,
[01:54:07.120 --> 01:54:12.120]   if you sit all day, chances are you will cause pain.
[01:54:12.120 --> 01:54:14.520]   I can talk about damage, which is interesting.
[01:54:14.520 --> 01:54:19.040]   We've probably loaded more spines
[01:54:19.040 --> 01:54:21.360]   than any other laboratory in the world.
[01:54:21.360 --> 01:54:23.260]   I think that's a fair thing to say.
[01:54:23.260 --> 01:54:27.440]   If we put a cadaveric spine,
[01:54:27.440 --> 01:54:29.460]   that is what we call a virgin spine.
[01:54:29.460 --> 01:54:31.480]   In other words, it came from a young donor,
[01:54:31.480 --> 01:54:33.360]   it wasn't traumatized.
[01:54:33.360 --> 01:54:37.560]   So there's no pre-existing cumulative damage to it.
[01:54:37.560 --> 01:54:39.520]   If you put it in a sitting posture,
[01:54:39.520 --> 01:54:42.100]   you cannot create new injury.
[01:54:42.100 --> 01:54:45.800]   So if a person has never had back pain,
[01:54:45.800 --> 01:54:47.080]   and I can give you an example.
[01:54:47.080 --> 01:54:49.780]   You know the person that they're probably overweight
[01:54:49.780 --> 01:54:51.320]   and all they do is sit.
[01:54:51.320 --> 01:54:53.440]   It's so unfair, they don't have any back pain.
[01:54:53.440 --> 01:54:55.360]   And then their colleague is much more fit.
[01:54:55.360 --> 01:54:57.880]   They go to the gym every day, they have back pain
[01:54:57.880 --> 01:55:00.380]   and they think this is so unfair.
[01:55:00.380 --> 01:55:02.480]   But what they didn't realize is,
[01:55:02.480 --> 01:55:05.600]   they are not training wisely at the gym.
[01:55:05.600 --> 01:55:10.240]   They are probably going far too hard
[01:55:10.240 --> 01:55:12.640]   in a short period of time with too much intensity
[01:55:12.640 --> 01:55:14.440]   and they're creating a little bit of micro trauma.
[01:55:14.440 --> 01:55:17.120]   So now they just made sitting painful.
[01:55:17.120 --> 01:55:19.160]   So do you see what I mean?
[01:55:19.160 --> 01:55:22.280]   You can't injure the spine sitting
[01:55:22.280 --> 01:55:24.080]   if you have no pre-existing injury.
[01:55:24.080 --> 01:55:27.960]   But if you have pre-existing delamination of the collagen,
[01:55:27.960 --> 01:55:30.580]   an old disc bulge, sitting for a long time
[01:55:30.580 --> 01:55:32.260]   will then make it painful.
[01:55:32.260 --> 01:55:35.260]   - If ever there were two exercises
[01:55:35.260 --> 01:55:40.260]   that bring to mind notions of back strengthening
[01:55:40.260 --> 01:55:43.260]   and potentially back pain,
[01:55:43.260 --> 01:55:46.840]   it's the deadlift and the squat.
[01:55:46.840 --> 01:55:50.980]   What are your thoughts on deadlifts and squats
[01:55:50.980 --> 01:55:55.980]   as a function of one's age, one's perhaps phenotype,
[01:55:56.220 --> 01:55:59.920]   ecto, endo or mesomorph or any other factors
[01:55:59.920 --> 01:56:04.920]   that would lead you to say, yes, deadlift and or squat.
[01:56:04.920 --> 01:56:07.880]   No, don't deadlift and or squat.
[01:56:07.880 --> 01:56:11.680]   Or maybe you should deadlift and or squat.
[01:56:11.680 --> 01:56:15.800]   - Okay, those who know me know it could be
[01:56:15.800 --> 01:56:17.480]   any of those three options.
[01:56:17.480 --> 01:56:24.540]   At the highest level, every exercise is a tool
[01:56:24.540 --> 01:56:26.840]   and it's a tool to reach a specific goal.
[01:56:26.840 --> 01:56:29.280]   So in our world of limited capacity,
[01:56:29.280 --> 01:56:32.640]   when a person is fresh coming out of back pain
[01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:36.600]   or they're training to really achieve something physically,
[01:56:36.600 --> 01:56:39.440]   have they defined the goal
[01:56:39.440 --> 01:56:41.820]   and have they chosen the best tool
[01:56:41.820 --> 01:56:45.840]   to keep as much capacity as they can
[01:56:45.840 --> 01:56:48.720]   for training other things that really matter?
[01:56:48.720 --> 01:56:53.880]   The deadlift is an extraordinary exercise.
[01:56:53.880 --> 01:56:56.780]   And as you know, I don't know of anyone
[01:56:56.780 --> 01:57:01.780]   who's been involved with more world-class deadlifters
[01:57:01.780 --> 01:57:07.380]   than myself through the back pain relationship.
[01:57:07.380 --> 01:57:12.100]   So on one hand, I can say, well, I love the deadlift.
[01:57:12.100 --> 01:57:14.940]   And on another hand, I can say, I hate the deadlift.
[01:57:14.940 --> 01:57:19.260]   I can tell you, Andrew, that if you take the clients
[01:57:19.260 --> 01:57:23.640]   who ask for consults now and they're under 30 years of age,
[01:57:23.640 --> 01:57:27.740]   I will say half of them will say in their interview with me,
[01:57:27.740 --> 01:57:29.920]   it started with the deadlift.
[01:57:29.920 --> 01:57:32.620]   So I would say that is getting onto the category
[01:57:32.620 --> 01:57:34.200]   of an epidemic.
[01:57:34.200 --> 01:57:38.260]   And yet I will still tell you, I love the deadlift.
[01:57:38.260 --> 01:57:43.260]   So there's a lot of variables here, a lot of moving parts.
[01:57:43.260 --> 01:57:47.220]   The deadlift is a tremendously
[01:57:47.220 --> 01:57:51.140]   neurologically dense exercise.
[01:57:51.140 --> 01:57:55.640]   Whether you're lifting a light weight or a heavy weight,
[01:57:55.640 --> 01:57:59.920]   I love these bodybuilding charts that say,
[01:57:59.920 --> 01:58:03.360]   oh, well, to do a deadlift, it lights up the erector spinae,
[01:58:03.360 --> 01:58:05.560]   the glutes and the quads perhaps.
[01:58:05.560 --> 01:58:08.120]   Every single muscle of the body should be involved
[01:58:08.120 --> 01:58:09.920]   at a deadlift, every single muscle.
[01:58:09.920 --> 01:58:12.480]   There are no agonists and antagonists.
[01:58:12.480 --> 01:58:16.680]   Every muscle, the full fascial complex will be tightened up
[01:58:16.680 --> 01:58:20.400]   to take the slack out, to pull a bar from the ground.
[01:58:20.400 --> 01:58:21.640]   That's a good deadlift.
[01:58:21.640 --> 01:58:26.080]   That's what minimizes the risk of injury.
[01:58:26.080 --> 01:58:28.500]   And as you know, competitive deadlifters
[01:58:28.500 --> 01:58:31.380]   will actually put on a exoskeleton
[01:58:31.380 --> 01:58:34.040]   of even more fascial stiffness.
[01:58:34.040 --> 01:58:35.980]   It's called a lifting suit.
[01:58:35.980 --> 01:58:39.940]   But not everybody obviously is in that category.
[01:58:39.940 --> 01:58:46.420]   Now, I'm going to talk about one of the most potent pathways
[01:58:46.420 --> 01:58:49.500]   to disc herniation.
[01:58:49.500 --> 01:58:52.620]   So we have the disc from an anatomical point of view.
[01:58:52.620 --> 01:58:56.940]   It's a gel core wrapped with layer upon layer,
[01:58:56.940 --> 01:58:59.780]   concentric layers of collagen fibers
[01:58:59.780 --> 01:59:03.580]   that in order to get a disc bulge or a disc herniation,
[01:59:03.580 --> 01:59:07.580]   they needed to delaminate and the gel nucleus,
[01:59:07.580 --> 01:59:10.780]   when it's pressurized under a heavy bend,
[01:59:10.780 --> 01:59:14.900]   will seek the weak spot between these fibers,
[01:59:14.900 --> 01:59:18.820]   work through the delamination and create a disc bulge.
[01:59:18.820 --> 01:59:23.820]   Now, there's been several recent studies now
[01:59:23.820 --> 01:59:28.700]   that have done assays, investigations
[01:59:28.700 --> 01:59:33.000]   of the harvested nucleus in a disc surgery.
[01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:36.460]   More than half the time, that harvested nucleus
[01:59:36.460 --> 01:59:39.500]   contained fragments of broken end plate.
[01:59:39.500 --> 01:59:43.780]   Broken end plate comes from excessive compression.
[01:59:43.780 --> 01:59:46.080]   And then you go into the history of the person.
[01:59:46.080 --> 01:59:48.140]   Oh, well, maybe they fell on ice
[01:59:48.140 --> 01:59:49.660]   and they pile-drived their back.
[01:59:49.660 --> 01:59:51.580]   There's a candidate mechanism
[01:59:51.580 --> 01:59:55.980]   to create small fractured bits of end plate.
[01:59:55.980 --> 01:59:58.500]   But then they will say, no,
[01:59:58.500 --> 02:00:01.980]   this whole disc herniation story,
[02:00:01.980 --> 02:00:05.060]   it started with a deadlift two years ago.
[02:00:05.060 --> 02:00:06.860]   My back got a bit tweaky after that.
[02:00:06.860 --> 02:00:08.700]   I kept deadlifting and whatnot.
[02:00:08.700 --> 02:00:11.260]   And then they find the fragments of bone.
[02:00:11.260 --> 02:00:14.700]   So more than half of that harvested nucleus
[02:00:14.700 --> 02:00:17.780]   shows evidence of an overload and compression.
[02:00:17.780 --> 02:00:21.380]   When you put that together with the history,
[02:00:21.380 --> 02:00:24.180]   and again, it's not the fault of the deadlift.
[02:00:24.180 --> 02:00:28.700]   It's the fault of the progression.
[02:00:28.700 --> 02:00:31.060]   There are some trainers who will take a person
[02:00:31.060 --> 02:00:35.300]   from an unfit state through to lifting in a deadlift
[02:00:35.300 --> 02:00:38.700]   twice their body weight in half a year.
[02:00:38.700 --> 02:00:41.460]   When you look at the stimulus to bone growth,
[02:00:41.460 --> 02:00:43.260]   it takes a lot longer than half a year.
[02:00:43.260 --> 02:00:48.260]   And when you look at the characteristics
[02:00:48.260 --> 02:00:51.300]   of really successful deadlifters,
[02:00:51.300 --> 02:00:52.900]   they're not young men and women.
[02:00:52.900 --> 02:00:58.020]   They are people who've trained their body over many years
[02:00:58.020 --> 02:01:00.140]   to get that density of bone,
[02:01:00.140 --> 02:01:03.940]   because that really is the weakest link in a deadlift
[02:01:03.940 --> 02:01:07.340]   as far as back injury goes.
[02:01:07.340 --> 02:01:10.900]   So there's something to consider, first of all.
[02:01:11.700 --> 02:01:16.340]   Let's go back to the back pained person now.
[02:01:16.340 --> 02:01:19.180]   And there are some people who do not perform an assessment
[02:01:19.180 --> 02:01:20.860]   and they say, "Oh, if you've got back pain,
[02:01:20.860 --> 02:01:23.020]   the symptom of back pain, do deadlifts."
[02:01:23.020 --> 02:01:25.140]   Well, hold on a second.
[02:01:25.140 --> 02:01:32.460]   One of the first things we do after we've assessed them
[02:01:32.460 --> 02:01:34.300]   is to try and get rid of the cause
[02:01:34.300 --> 02:01:37.260]   that almost always involves teaching them
[02:01:37.260 --> 02:01:38.780]   how to bend at the hips
[02:01:38.780 --> 02:01:42.060]   and not stressing and creating concentrations in the spine.
[02:01:42.060 --> 02:01:43.260]   It's called a hip hinge.
[02:01:43.260 --> 02:01:47.340]   Then we may put a load in their hands
[02:01:47.340 --> 02:01:49.700]   and then we have to assess their hips
[02:01:49.700 --> 02:01:53.180]   to determine whether the hips have shallow sockets
[02:01:53.180 --> 02:01:54.060]   or deep sockets.
[02:01:54.060 --> 02:01:55.660]   In other words, what's the hip range of motion
[02:01:55.660 --> 02:01:58.540]   that will allow you to pick a bar off the ground?
[02:01:58.540 --> 02:01:59.460]   There are many people
[02:01:59.460 --> 02:02:02.340]   who shouldn't be picking heavy bars off the ground.
[02:02:02.340 --> 02:02:06.660]   When you look at the size of an Olympic,
[02:02:06.660 --> 02:02:10.060]   I call them cookies, but a 45 pound plate, I suppose,
[02:02:10.060 --> 02:02:12.700]   that was arbitrarily chosen.
[02:02:12.700 --> 02:02:14.300]   In fact, it was actually chosen
[02:02:14.300 --> 02:02:17.300]   that if someone dropped the bar on the ground,
[02:02:17.300 --> 02:02:20.020]   your head could fit between the bar and the ground.
[02:02:20.020 --> 02:02:22.600]   That was where that original size of the cookie came from,
[02:02:22.600 --> 02:02:24.020]   is my understanding of it.
[02:02:24.020 --> 02:02:26.480]   - People lifting alone quite often, is that why?
[02:02:26.480 --> 02:02:27.380]   - Oh yeah.
[02:02:27.380 --> 02:02:29.200]   Well, there's lots of YouTubes of those injuries,
[02:02:29.200 --> 02:02:30.040]   but anyway.
[02:02:30.040 --> 02:02:33.920]   - Yeah, that's something that I both encourage
[02:02:33.920 --> 02:02:36.840]   and discourage people from searching for
[02:02:36.840 --> 02:02:38.440]   because it can scare you appropriately,
[02:02:38.440 --> 02:02:40.720]   but it's also can be traumatizing to see.
[02:02:40.720 --> 02:02:41.560]   - Right.
[02:02:41.560 --> 02:02:44.120]   So now we've put together the idea
[02:02:44.120 --> 02:02:48.460]   of what anatomy do they have in the hips
[02:02:48.460 --> 02:02:50.260]   and where's the tipping point
[02:02:50.260 --> 02:02:52.440]   in picking something off the ground.
[02:02:52.440 --> 02:02:57.440]   We may start to progress the hip hinge
[02:02:57.440 --> 02:02:59.380]   into a loaded situation
[02:02:59.380 --> 02:03:02.360]   if the person doesn't have compressive load triggers
[02:03:02.360 --> 02:03:04.440]   to their back pain pattern.
[02:03:04.440 --> 02:03:07.000]   I doubt we'll be pulling a bar off the ground though.
[02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.160]   We will elevate the bar and put it on blocks.
[02:03:09.160 --> 02:03:13.280]   So if you come to BackFit Pro and you look at our rack
[02:03:13.280 --> 02:03:18.280]   that has 1,300 pounds there available to lift if you wish,
[02:03:18.280 --> 02:03:20.560]   they pull off pins.
[02:03:20.560 --> 02:03:24.020]   In other words, we're matching the height of the pull
[02:03:24.020 --> 02:03:28.100]   to their biomechanical optimum in the beginning.
[02:03:28.100 --> 02:03:33.100]   And then we have to decide is the deadlift the best tool
[02:03:33.100 --> 02:03:35.340]   to get them to their goal?
[02:03:35.340 --> 02:03:38.660]   You know, I did the podcast with Peter Attia
[02:03:38.660 --> 02:03:43.140]   and Peter had a little section on the deadlift
[02:03:43.140 --> 02:03:45.180]   and he asked me the same question,
[02:03:45.180 --> 02:03:49.760]   but he just told me his personal story of conflict
[02:03:49.760 --> 02:03:51.140]   and whether he should be deadlifting.
[02:03:51.140 --> 02:03:53.140]   You know, he's had a couple of spine surgeries
[02:03:53.140 --> 02:03:54.860]   as a younger man when, you know,
[02:03:54.860 --> 02:03:57.660]   none of us knew better in those days, I suppose.
[02:03:57.660 --> 02:04:01.340]   And my answer was to him and a lot of people took it
[02:04:01.340 --> 02:04:03.740]   and we got a lot of blowback on this,
[02:04:03.740 --> 02:04:07.300]   that it was a generic answer for deadlifts and it wasn't.
[02:04:07.300 --> 02:04:09.500]   It was an answer for him where I started to talk about,
[02:04:09.500 --> 02:04:13.260]   well, maybe for yourself, why don't we walk backwards
[02:04:13.260 --> 02:04:15.560]   up a hill in a monster walk style
[02:04:15.560 --> 02:04:18.020]   and you will feel the quads burning?
[02:04:18.020 --> 02:04:21.300]   How many squats and deadlifts do you really need to do?
[02:04:21.300 --> 02:04:24.380]   And then urology comes into this.
[02:04:24.380 --> 02:04:28.220]   You walk backwards up a hill, say it's about 50 yards.
[02:04:28.220 --> 02:04:29.540]   Your quads are burning.
[02:04:29.540 --> 02:04:31.140]   Then walk down to the bottom of the hill
[02:04:31.140 --> 02:04:33.360]   and walk forwards up the hill.
[02:04:33.360 --> 02:04:37.620]   The brain says, I'm perceiving exhausted quads.
[02:04:37.620 --> 02:04:40.640]   Let's go get the next in the hierarchy, your glutes.
[02:04:40.640 --> 02:04:43.500]   It's a fabulous stimulator to glutes.
[02:04:43.500 --> 02:04:45.100]   So there you go.
[02:04:45.100 --> 02:04:46.540]   I've just found a better tool
[02:04:46.540 --> 02:04:49.420]   for a person who has limited capacity.
[02:04:49.420 --> 02:04:52.120]   Deadlift was not the way to go.
[02:04:52.120 --> 02:04:53.460]   They're gonna walk backwards up a hill
[02:04:53.460 --> 02:04:54.660]   and then they're gonna walk forward
[02:04:54.660 --> 02:04:58.300]   and really feel tremendous exhaustion
[02:04:58.300 --> 02:05:00.300]   if that's how they get their jollies.
[02:05:00.300 --> 02:05:02.820]   And if that's what we need in the athleticism
[02:05:02.820 --> 02:05:05.460]   to keep them going and building robustness.
[02:05:05.460 --> 02:05:07.780]   - What are your thoughts on glute ham raises?
[02:05:07.780 --> 02:05:10.140]   I'm a big fan of Nordic curls and glute ham raises
[02:05:10.140 --> 02:05:11.620]   for the posterior chain.
[02:05:11.620 --> 02:05:14.220]   To me, a glute ham raise, folks can look it up,
[02:05:14.220 --> 02:05:18.420]   is basically a deadlift into a leg curl,
[02:05:18.420 --> 02:05:19.980]   into a hamstring leg curl,
[02:05:19.980 --> 02:05:21.540]   except that your feet are,
[02:05:21.540 --> 02:05:24.940]   instead of being on the floor for the deadlift part,
[02:05:24.940 --> 02:05:28.360]   you've rotated yourself 90 degrees
[02:05:28.360 --> 02:05:31.380]   so that the feet are effectively at the wall, right?
[02:05:31.380 --> 02:05:32.820]   And from the bottom position
[02:05:32.820 --> 02:05:35.060]   up to the parallel to floor position,
[02:05:35.060 --> 02:05:36.900]   that's more or less a deadlift, right?
[02:05:36.900 --> 02:05:39.500]   Stiff-legged or partially stiff-legged deadlift.
[02:05:39.500 --> 02:05:42.200]   And then the rest of the way is the Nordic curl
[02:05:42.200 --> 02:05:43.040]   or the leg curl.
[02:05:43.040 --> 02:05:45.140]   To me, that seems like almost the perfect exercise
[02:05:45.140 --> 02:05:48.020]   for the posterior chain, hamstrings and glutes,
[02:05:48.020 --> 02:05:49.860]   which is why I do them regularly.
[02:05:49.860 --> 02:05:52.460]   What are your thoughts about them for back strengthening
[02:05:52.460 --> 02:05:55.660]   and for people that are trying to avoid back pain,
[02:05:55.660 --> 02:05:58.740]   both in the present and in the future?
[02:05:58.740 --> 02:06:01.700]   - It's exactly the same answer that I gave you for deadlifts.
[02:06:01.700 --> 02:06:04.940]   A, it depends, and B, is it the best tool to reach the goal?
[02:06:04.940 --> 02:06:07.460]   That is an auxiliary exercise.
[02:06:07.460 --> 02:06:08.500]   It's not a deadlift.
[02:06:08.500 --> 02:06:13.220]   It's just challenging a part of the chain involved
[02:06:13.220 --> 02:06:15.660]   in the full chain that's required for a deadlift.
[02:06:18.140 --> 02:06:21.740]   If I go back to some of the criticism
[02:06:21.740 --> 02:06:25.980]   after that original deadlift statement,
[02:06:25.980 --> 02:06:28.780]   there was a lot of older fellows who were saying,
[02:06:28.780 --> 02:06:30.240]   you know, I love the deadlift.
[02:06:30.240 --> 02:06:34.100]   When I stop deadlifting, my back pain actually increases
[02:06:34.100 --> 02:06:38.500]   and deadlifting keeps the bogeyman away.
[02:06:38.500 --> 02:06:39.540]   I get it.
[02:06:39.540 --> 02:06:42.300]   Okay, that was the right tool for them,
[02:06:42.300 --> 02:06:46.400]   but I can tell you about the characteristic of those people.
[02:06:46.400 --> 02:06:48.460]   They will be somewhat unidimensional
[02:06:48.460 --> 02:06:50.020]   in their athleticism.
[02:06:50.020 --> 02:06:52.380]   I will bet you dollars to donuts.
[02:06:52.380 --> 02:06:54.540]   Actually, donuts are getting more expensive now,
[02:06:54.540 --> 02:06:56.700]   so that's a poor analogy.
[02:06:56.700 --> 02:06:58.420]   That worked when I was a kid.
[02:06:58.420 --> 02:07:01.900]   But anyway, ask them to throw a football.
[02:07:01.900 --> 02:07:04.020]   Ask them to swing a golf club.
[02:07:04.020 --> 02:07:06.820]   I'll bet you the ones who say deadlifts are good
[02:07:06.820 --> 02:07:08.940]   for their back pain won't do well
[02:07:08.940 --> 02:07:10.860]   in either of those activities.
[02:07:10.860 --> 02:07:13.180]   So it's a very unidimensional.
[02:07:13.180 --> 02:07:15.640]   - Because they can't generate that kind of twist and snap
[02:07:15.640 --> 02:07:19.140]   with the throwing a football, for instance,
[02:07:19.140 --> 02:07:21.580]   like the stiffening up of the body
[02:07:21.580 --> 02:07:23.980]   at precisely the right moment
[02:07:23.980 --> 02:07:27.900]   and the relaxing of the arm kind of flicking and spiral.
[02:07:27.900 --> 02:07:29.460]   - A deadlift is not a pulsing strength.
[02:07:29.460 --> 02:07:31.180]   It's a grinding strength.
[02:07:31.180 --> 02:07:36.180]   And again, if you want neurology to adapt, to create,
[02:07:36.180 --> 02:07:41.080]   you know, again, I know people don't like when I do this,
[02:07:41.080 --> 02:07:44.300]   but when I, I love athletic examples
[02:07:44.300 --> 02:07:47.360]   and I learn so much because it's like a car mechanic
[02:07:47.360 --> 02:07:50.940]   working on a McLaren and then a dump truck,
[02:07:50.940 --> 02:07:53.940]   which carries heavy load, and then a Baja racer,
[02:07:53.940 --> 02:07:56.620]   which is incredibly endurable because it shows you
[02:07:56.620 --> 02:08:00.060]   in terms of engineering and automotive technology
[02:08:00.060 --> 02:08:01.180]   what is possible.
[02:08:01.180 --> 02:08:02.880]   So when you work with a great athlete,
[02:08:02.880 --> 02:08:05.300]   you learn what is humanly possible.
[02:08:05.300 --> 02:08:06.820]   So something like a deadlift,
[02:08:06.820 --> 02:08:10.300]   it teaches the nerves to carry electricity.
[02:08:10.300 --> 02:08:15.300]   When you measure a very good deadlift, it is an exhausting,
[02:08:15.300 --> 02:08:18.220]   but think of it, what is strength?
[02:08:18.220 --> 02:08:20.820]   Strength starts with this thought,
[02:08:20.820 --> 02:08:23.540]   and now you have to densify that thought.
[02:08:23.540 --> 02:08:27.420]   Then you have to densify the pulse train
[02:08:27.420 --> 02:08:28.460]   down through the nerves,
[02:08:28.460 --> 02:08:29.860]   and you've got to teach the nerves
[02:08:29.860 --> 02:08:32.340]   to carry that amount of electrical pulse.
[02:08:32.340 --> 02:08:34.940]   Then you've got to teach the muscles to utilize it.
[02:08:34.940 --> 02:08:38.540]   So in terms of grinding strength capacity,
[02:08:38.540 --> 02:08:40.060]   a deadlift is pretty good,
[02:08:40.060 --> 02:08:44.700]   but does that have to do with most people with back pain?
[02:08:44.700 --> 02:08:50.100]   A few years ago, the professional golf community,
[02:08:50.100 --> 02:08:55.900]   led by a few personalities, got into heavier lifting.
[02:08:55.900 --> 02:08:57.500]   Now, this was rather odd.
[02:08:57.500 --> 02:08:59.780]   If you go back to the old days of Jack Nicklaus
[02:08:59.780 --> 02:09:01.420]   and Gary Player and Arnold Palmer,
[02:09:01.420 --> 02:09:03.860]   do you think they lifted heavy weights?
[02:09:03.860 --> 02:09:06.180]   And I think Arnold Palmer is still playing.
[02:09:06.180 --> 02:09:08.600]   - I mean, some of those guys back when were known
[02:09:08.600 --> 02:09:12.260]   for having a few alcohol drinks,
[02:09:12.260 --> 02:09:17.260]   plus smoking cigarettes on the course.
[02:09:17.260 --> 02:09:20.460]   - But my point is, the more you deadlift,
[02:09:20.460 --> 02:09:24.860]   the less you will be able to throw a football and play golf.
[02:09:24.860 --> 02:09:29.860]   So if your goal in life is to be generally able
[02:09:29.860 --> 02:09:35.220]   to enjoy a really diverse array of activities,
[02:09:35.600 --> 02:09:38.260]   be careful on the tools that you choose.
[02:09:38.260 --> 02:09:44.580]   So going back to the pro golfers of, say, 15 years ago,
[02:09:44.580 --> 02:09:47.140]   when a few of them got into Olympic lifting,
[02:09:47.140 --> 02:09:49.820]   which is heavy hip mobility,
[02:09:49.820 --> 02:09:51.720]   down to the deep squat for the snatch,
[02:09:51.720 --> 02:09:56.720]   and tremendous shoulder mobility and deadlifts,
[02:09:56.720 --> 02:10:00.980]   not one of them, to my knowledge,
[02:10:00.980 --> 02:10:03.220]   and I know some of them intimately well,
[02:10:03.220 --> 02:10:05.220]   hit the ball further.
[02:10:06.200 --> 02:10:09.620]   But they ended up with sore knees and disc bulges.
[02:10:09.620 --> 02:10:14.660]   Essentially, really heavily compromising their careers.
[02:10:14.660 --> 02:10:15.900]   And then a few of them,
[02:10:15.900 --> 02:10:18.280]   and I've worked with quite a number of them,
[02:10:18.280 --> 02:10:21.400]   have now backed off that heavy lifting,
[02:10:21.400 --> 02:10:24.220]   and they have less pain, far more resilience.
[02:10:24.220 --> 02:10:26.440]   And I think they're gonna be playing a lot longer for it.
[02:10:26.440 --> 02:10:29.420]   So I know that's gonna create some controversy,
[02:10:29.420 --> 02:10:30.320]   but so be it.
[02:10:30.320 --> 02:10:31.160]   - Well, that's okay.
[02:10:31.160 --> 02:10:34.160]   I mean, I've gone on record saying that I'll do,
[02:10:34.160 --> 02:10:38.380]   and genuinely do, heavy hack squats,
[02:10:38.380 --> 02:10:40.760]   hack machine squats, leg extensions,
[02:10:40.760 --> 02:10:41.600]   those kinds of things,
[02:10:41.600 --> 02:10:44.760]   alternatives that, for me, have just led to,
[02:10:44.760 --> 02:10:47.320]   you know, progressively more of what I'm looking for,
[02:10:47.320 --> 02:10:52.320]   run training legs, and back, of course, lower back.
[02:10:52.320 --> 02:10:54.540]   And I do glute ham raises,
[02:10:54.540 --> 02:10:57.200]   and I can do all of those without pain.
[02:10:57.200 --> 02:10:59.760]   I don't know the last time I ever did a deadlift.
[02:10:59.760 --> 02:11:01.500]   I was never particularly strong in the deadlift,
[02:11:01.500 --> 02:11:03.920]   but if you're telling me that avoiding deadlifts
[02:11:03.920 --> 02:11:06.480]   as I get older, heavy deadlifts, that is,
[02:11:06.480 --> 02:11:09.740]   is going to help me avoid back and hip pain,
[02:11:09.740 --> 02:11:13.480]   then, you know, I'm all for avoiding heavy deadlifts.
[02:11:13.480 --> 02:11:15.240]   - If you want, first of all,
[02:11:15.240 --> 02:11:18.160]   I don't put you in the category of high risk
[02:11:18.160 --> 02:11:20.960]   for osteoporosis, which is mineral loss from your bones
[02:11:20.960 --> 02:11:25.960]   through genetics, and way under the tipping point
[02:11:25.960 --> 02:11:27.880]   in terms of load stimulation.
[02:11:27.880 --> 02:11:30.560]   So I'm not worried about that for you.
[02:11:30.560 --> 02:11:33.960]   So if I was, that would justify
[02:11:33.960 --> 02:11:36.800]   a heavier loading regimen for now.
[02:11:36.800 --> 02:11:41.800]   But as alternatives, a rear leg elevated split squat.
[02:11:41.800 --> 02:11:44.440]   You can do it just with body weight,
[02:11:44.440 --> 02:11:47.720]   or consider this, interlace your fingers,
[02:11:47.720 --> 02:11:50.880]   put them behind your head, become a peacock,
[02:11:50.880 --> 02:11:55.520]   lift your chest up, now do the split leg
[02:11:55.520 --> 02:12:00.000]   rear elevated squats, like lunge squats,
[02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:04.120]   and you're potentiating the erector spinae
[02:12:04.120 --> 02:12:06.160]   and the whole stabilizing mechanism
[02:12:06.160 --> 02:12:07.920]   by pushing up and resisting.
[02:12:07.920 --> 02:12:09.120]   Do you see how- - Do I need
[02:12:09.120 --> 02:12:11.160]   to flare my elbows back?
[02:12:11.160 --> 02:12:12.600]   - You can do, yeah. - Okay.
[02:12:12.600 --> 02:12:14.760]   - Now, do you see how that just stimulated
[02:12:14.760 --> 02:12:16.120]   your whole upper body?
[02:12:16.120 --> 02:12:18.280]   And the more you push- - The more traps,
[02:12:18.280 --> 02:12:19.120]   everything lined up. - Right.
[02:12:19.120 --> 02:12:21.360]   And you just lit up your whole erector spinae.
[02:12:21.360 --> 02:12:23.800]   We did all of that without a heavy bar.
[02:12:23.800 --> 02:12:28.120]   You could do a goblet squat, hold it in front.
[02:12:28.120 --> 02:12:32.140]   Now the whole body takes a more upright attitude.
[02:12:32.140 --> 02:12:33.280]   It's more knee load.
[02:12:33.280 --> 02:12:36.200]   If you want more knee load and less back and hip load,
[02:12:36.200 --> 02:12:40.440]   or a back squat, you add more hip and low back load
[02:12:40.440 --> 02:12:41.880]   and you take some off the knees.
[02:12:41.880 --> 02:12:44.280]   So you can band the knees.
[02:12:44.280 --> 02:12:46.760]   We can really play jazz on this
[02:12:46.760 --> 02:12:49.160]   to optimize the best variant
[02:12:49.160 --> 02:12:53.000]   to get optimal reward with minimal risk.
[02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:57.680]   And that will change as you recover from the back injury.
[02:12:57.680 --> 02:12:59.680]   It will change with age.
[02:12:59.680 --> 02:13:03.320]   It will change with other comorbidities.
[02:13:03.320 --> 02:13:04.460]   Oh, my neck's a bit sore.
[02:13:04.460 --> 02:13:05.480]   You've dinged up your shoulder,
[02:13:05.480 --> 02:13:06.880]   or whatever the case may be.
[02:13:06.880 --> 02:13:13.600]   Single leg step-ups would be another example.
[02:13:13.600 --> 02:13:16.120]   Now you've added a balance challenge.
[02:13:16.120 --> 02:13:20.320]   As you get older, your risk will not be mitigated
[02:13:20.320 --> 02:13:22.720]   by deadlifts because the biggest risk
[02:13:22.720 --> 02:13:24.400]   as you get older is falling.
[02:13:25.280 --> 02:13:28.440]   That will really change your life
[02:13:28.440 --> 02:13:30.520]   as it does in many people.
[02:13:30.520 --> 02:13:34.440]   Do you have the agility and neural dexterity
[02:13:34.440 --> 02:13:35.760]   that when you stumble,
[02:13:35.760 --> 02:13:40.520]   can you get your foot out ahead of the center of mass,
[02:13:40.520 --> 02:13:41.960]   which is now ahead of the base of support,
[02:13:41.960 --> 02:13:42.900]   so you're gonna fall.
[02:13:42.900 --> 02:13:44.080]   You gotta get that quick.
[02:13:44.080 --> 02:13:45.440]   So it's hip power, quick.
[02:13:45.440 --> 02:13:51.360]   Rest the fall and really mitigate against catastrophe,
[02:13:51.360 --> 02:13:54.460]   which is that fall.
[02:13:54.460 --> 02:13:55.760]   So do you see how that changed?
[02:13:55.760 --> 02:13:57.360]   But can I just finish off with one thing?
[02:13:57.360 --> 02:14:01.120]   And I wanna talk about deadlifts and capacity as well.
[02:14:01.120 --> 02:14:06.120]   And again, it's a lesson that we learn from elite athletes.
[02:14:06.120 --> 02:14:09.000]   When we have an athlete whose goal it is
[02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:10.240]   to set a world record,
[02:14:10.240 --> 02:14:13.040]   be it in deadlifting or squatting or whatever,
[02:14:13.040 --> 02:14:17.420]   they can't train maximum deadlifts and squats
[02:14:17.420 --> 02:14:18.940]   two or three times a week.
[02:14:18.940 --> 02:14:22.240]   It is just too exhausting.
[02:14:22.240 --> 02:14:25.820]   And the recovery period required between training sessions
[02:14:25.820 --> 02:14:27.600]   becomes so long,
[02:14:27.600 --> 02:14:31.540]   they actually lose the peak of the training progress.
[02:14:31.540 --> 02:14:34.520]   So we do it through auxiliary exercise.
[02:14:34.520 --> 02:14:36.780]   So when I think of someone like Brian Carroll,
[02:14:36.780 --> 02:14:40.120]   you know, again, this is all sort of content validity
[02:14:40.120 --> 02:14:41.460]   types of arguments.
[02:14:41.460 --> 02:14:42.300]   I get it.
[02:14:42.300 --> 02:14:45.900]   But until someone produces a few more winners,
[02:14:45.900 --> 02:14:50.900]   I'm going to stick with the way our science has shown to go.
[02:14:51.900 --> 02:14:56.900]   If you train and really push,
[02:14:56.900 --> 02:15:01.320]   you know, you're talking about training at 85%.
[02:15:01.320 --> 02:15:03.240]   Well, are you gonna set the world record
[02:15:03.240 --> 02:15:05.200]   if you only train at 85%?
[02:15:05.200 --> 02:15:06.700]   Probably not.
[02:15:06.700 --> 02:15:09.080]   But if you go to 100%,
[02:15:09.080 --> 02:15:11.080]   you've gotta take a couple of weeks off.
[02:15:11.080 --> 02:15:14.880]   So instead you do some auxiliaries
[02:15:14.880 --> 02:15:19.040]   like Brian used heavily the belt squat machine,
[02:15:19.040 --> 02:15:24.040]   which you can really train hips, legs, et cetera,
[02:15:24.040 --> 02:15:26.520]   tremendous power,
[02:15:26.520 --> 02:15:28.360]   but it doesn't take or exhaust
[02:15:28.360 --> 02:15:30.480]   the whole upper body and back system.
[02:15:30.480 --> 02:15:32.920]   Or you're not loading the spine or compressing the spine.
[02:15:32.920 --> 02:15:33.760]   That's right.
[02:15:33.760 --> 02:15:37.520]   Because you just can't do it.
[02:15:37.520 --> 02:15:42.120]   So if you see why, you know,
[02:15:42.120 --> 02:15:45.960]   it's very difficult for me without knowing the person,
[02:15:45.960 --> 02:15:47.100]   knowing what the goals are,
[02:15:47.100 --> 02:15:49.560]   knowing what their future risks are.
[02:15:49.560 --> 02:15:53.080]   Is it a bone mineral density issue?
[02:15:53.080 --> 02:15:56.160]   Or is it their knees are getting a bit cranky now?
[02:15:56.160 --> 02:15:57.300]   Or whatever the,
[02:15:57.300 --> 02:16:01.940]   I have to choose the most efficient tools.
[02:16:01.940 --> 02:16:05.520]   Occasionally it's a deadlift.
[02:16:05.520 --> 02:16:07.940]   But I also told you that right now,
[02:16:07.940 --> 02:16:11.800]   there's too many young people influenced by social media
[02:16:11.800 --> 02:16:13.200]   who are trying to set,
[02:16:13.200 --> 02:16:16.440]   oh, I'm gonna set a personal best in deadlift.
[02:16:16.440 --> 02:16:20.080]   Not really knowing how to densify the neural drive,
[02:16:20.080 --> 02:16:21.920]   take out all the slack.
[02:16:21.920 --> 02:16:24.680]   So when they grip the bar,
[02:16:24.680 --> 02:16:28.960]   the final squeeze of the bar actually gets the bar moving.
[02:16:28.960 --> 02:16:31.420]   They're breaking it from the floor with,
[02:16:31.420 --> 02:16:33.080]   they're so stiff throughout their body
[02:16:33.080 --> 02:16:35.320]   and they don't know this yet.
[02:16:35.320 --> 02:16:40.880]   And they end up with a back injury
[02:16:40.880 --> 02:16:43.460]   and those are long lasting.
[02:16:43.460 --> 02:16:45.800]   They're hard to recover from.
[02:16:45.800 --> 02:16:49.080]   - You've talked about the so-called biblical training week.
[02:16:49.080 --> 02:16:50.800]   I love this.
[02:16:50.800 --> 02:16:54.160]   It's something that I plan to adopt for myself.
[02:16:54.160 --> 02:16:55.900]   It's not too far off from what I do now,
[02:16:55.900 --> 02:16:58.560]   but it's distinctly different enough
[02:16:58.560 --> 02:17:02.140]   that I'm excited because it's going to require
[02:17:02.140 --> 02:17:04.840]   some psychological adaptation, physical adaptation.
[02:17:04.840 --> 02:17:07.840]   Tell me, what is the biblical training week
[02:17:07.840 --> 02:17:09.840]   and why is it so useful?
[02:17:11.820 --> 02:17:16.240]   - It is the underlying philosophy of how I train now.
[02:17:16.240 --> 02:17:17.760]   It wouldn't have appealed to me
[02:17:17.760 --> 02:17:19.620]   when I was in my 20s and 30s.
[02:17:19.620 --> 02:17:24.620]   In those days, it was all about strength, power,
[02:17:24.620 --> 02:17:28.120]   looking good, impressive, et cetera.
[02:17:28.120 --> 02:17:33.540]   But my joints aren't what they used to be.
[02:17:33.540 --> 02:17:38.200]   My training has evolved with my age.
[02:17:38.200 --> 02:17:42.660]   So the name training, biblical training week
[02:17:42.660 --> 02:17:45.740]   came from the idea that every major religion
[02:17:45.740 --> 02:17:48.260]   has a Sabbath day, a day off.
[02:17:48.260 --> 02:17:52.500]   And when I was a kid and working with my dad,
[02:17:52.500 --> 02:17:54.620]   you didn't do any work on Sunday.
[02:17:54.620 --> 02:17:58.480]   And that was his day of allowing all the cumulative work
[02:17:58.480 --> 02:18:02.140]   during the week to adapt and settle out.
[02:18:02.140 --> 02:18:04.620]   So it's a very wise thing to do.
[02:18:07.860 --> 02:18:10.120]   There's six days to train.
[02:18:10.120 --> 02:18:15.320]   In its basic form, two days a week, I strength train.
[02:18:15.320 --> 02:18:18.840]   Two days a week, I work on the things
[02:18:18.840 --> 02:18:21.860]   that are a bit sticky and not moving very well
[02:18:21.860 --> 02:18:25.520]   because I'm getting older and I have a few injuries.
[02:18:25.520 --> 02:18:28.560]   So those are the mobility days.
[02:18:28.560 --> 02:18:31.480]   Two days a week, I work on my ticker,
[02:18:31.480 --> 02:18:36.480]   cardiovascular system, things to challenge my heart,
[02:18:37.220 --> 02:18:38.760]   et cetera.
[02:18:38.760 --> 02:18:41.520]   There's more caveats to all of this.
[02:18:41.520 --> 02:18:44.760]   So I live in a rural setting most of the time.
[02:18:44.760 --> 02:18:49.240]   We heat our cabin.
[02:18:49.240 --> 02:18:52.240]   I live in most of the days of the week by wood.
[02:18:52.240 --> 02:18:53.880]   So I have to split firewood.
[02:18:53.880 --> 02:18:57.080]   If I split firewood, I've checked all the boxes.
[02:18:57.080 --> 02:18:59.640]   It's cardiovascular training, it's mobility training
[02:18:59.640 --> 02:19:00.580]   and it's strength training.
[02:19:00.580 --> 02:19:02.560]   So it's also a lot of power.
[02:19:02.560 --> 02:19:05.920]   So I've done my training for that particular day.
[02:19:05.920 --> 02:19:08.640]   But I wouldn't split wood two days in a row.
[02:19:08.640 --> 02:19:10.360]   I wouldn't strength train two days in a row.
[02:19:10.360 --> 02:19:12.680]   I wouldn't mobility train two days in a row.
[02:19:12.680 --> 02:19:14.080]   So that's another caveat.
[02:19:14.080 --> 02:19:16.720]   Don't do the same thing two days in a row
[02:19:16.720 --> 02:19:21.480]   and allow the soreness to really develop into something.
[02:19:21.480 --> 02:19:26.000]   Another thing that suits me well is routine.
[02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:27.680]   I try and go to bed at the same time,
[02:19:27.680 --> 02:19:29.080]   get up at the same time.
[02:19:29.080 --> 02:19:32.880]   So those are the basic tenets
[02:19:32.880 --> 02:19:34.800]   of the biblical training week.
[02:19:34.800 --> 02:19:36.720]   The components of each.
[02:19:36.720 --> 02:19:40.440]   You know, I've had some neck trauma, some shoulder trauma.
[02:19:40.440 --> 02:19:42.400]   I broke my hip, I'm hip replaced.
[02:19:42.400 --> 02:19:46.040]   These are the things that I focus on
[02:19:46.040 --> 02:19:48.360]   for strategic mobility.
[02:19:48.360 --> 02:19:53.800]   The strength training is a little bit of bodybuilding,
[02:19:53.800 --> 02:19:56.000]   a little bit of strength and patternings.
[02:19:56.000 --> 02:20:01.000]   So patterns of a squat, a lift, a lunge,
[02:20:01.120 --> 02:20:05.040]   a push, a pull, et cetera.
[02:20:05.040 --> 02:20:07.080]   And so I don't run because of my hips,
[02:20:07.080 --> 02:20:11.400]   but in the summertime, I will swim, kayak, canoe,
[02:20:11.400 --> 02:20:16.240]   but I'll put a bit of beef into it, a bit of effort.
[02:20:16.240 --> 02:20:17.760]   I ride my bike.
[02:20:17.760 --> 02:20:19.720]   In the winter, I cross country ski.
[02:20:19.720 --> 02:20:24.680]   Shovel snow is a big part where I live, et cetera.
[02:20:24.680 --> 02:20:29.800]   So those are the, oh, by the way,
[02:20:29.800 --> 02:20:33.800]   I do do the big three six days out of seven.
[02:20:33.800 --> 02:20:38.800]   And I didn't really discuss that of why they're essential.
[02:20:38.800 --> 02:20:42.360]   We didn't invent those exercises, but we measured.
[02:20:42.360 --> 02:20:43.960]   We were one of the few groups in the world
[02:20:43.960 --> 02:20:48.400]   who actually measured spine stability in a quantitative way.
[02:20:48.400 --> 02:20:51.560]   Doing the big three was the most efficient way
[02:20:51.560 --> 02:20:53.900]   to guarantee spine stability,
[02:20:53.900 --> 02:20:55.880]   but spare the spine while you're doing it.
[02:20:55.880 --> 02:20:56.800]   Well, some people will say,
[02:20:56.800 --> 02:20:58.180]   well, why are you sparing your spine?
[02:20:58.180 --> 02:21:00.120]   It allows me to have capacity,
[02:21:00.120 --> 02:21:02.500]   the limited capacity to do other things.
[02:21:02.500 --> 02:21:05.580]   So why would I waste them all on core training?
[02:21:05.580 --> 02:21:09.720]   The other thing is we live in a linkage.
[02:21:09.720 --> 02:21:13.040]   So the spine is a flexible rod.
[02:21:13.040 --> 02:21:16.180]   There's no coincidence that either end of your core
[02:21:16.180 --> 02:21:19.480]   is a ball and socket joint, the shoulder and the hips.
[02:21:19.480 --> 02:21:23.160]   If I wanted to push you or an object,
[02:21:23.160 --> 02:21:25.400]   a heavy door perhaps at the university
[02:21:25.400 --> 02:21:29.700]   or at a shopping mall, say I could bench press 300 pounds.
[02:21:29.700 --> 02:21:31.940]   Well, I can't anymore, but say I could.
[02:21:31.940 --> 02:21:34.500]   The bench press muscle is the pec major.
[02:21:34.500 --> 02:21:37.520]   Let's look at the architecture of the pec major.
[02:21:37.520 --> 02:21:39.920]   The pec major crosses the shoulder joint,
[02:21:39.920 --> 02:21:42.400]   distal to the shoulder joint,
[02:21:42.400 --> 02:21:46.480]   to where it connects on the upper arm bone, the humerus.
[02:21:46.480 --> 02:21:49.600]   The muscle contracts and creates the desired push.
[02:21:49.600 --> 02:21:53.700]   But proximal, it connects to my rib cage.
[02:21:53.700 --> 02:21:54.660]   Look what it does.
[02:21:54.660 --> 02:21:58.760]   It collapses my torso into my shoulder,
[02:21:58.760 --> 02:22:03.320]   which is an energy leak that is anti-push.
[02:22:03.320 --> 02:22:06.520]   But if I can use core control and core stiffness
[02:22:06.520 --> 02:22:08.880]   and lock down proximally,
[02:22:08.880 --> 02:22:11.060]   100% of that muscle activity
[02:22:11.060 --> 02:22:14.040]   now goes distally to the athleticism.
[02:22:14.040 --> 02:22:16.280]   So you may have heard the expression,
[02:22:16.280 --> 02:22:19.640]   a stronger core makes you stronger throughout your body.
[02:22:19.640 --> 02:22:20.960]   Well, how does that work?
[02:22:20.960 --> 02:22:22.540]   I've just explained to you
[02:22:22.540 --> 02:22:26.360]   that when you create proximal control and stiffness,
[02:22:26.360 --> 02:22:28.900]   it directs the athleticism distally.
[02:22:28.900 --> 02:22:30.500]   If you want to wiggle your finger quickly,
[02:22:30.500 --> 02:22:31.820]   you had to stiffen your wrist.
[02:22:31.820 --> 02:22:34.340]   If you want to wiggle your arm quickly,
[02:22:34.340 --> 02:22:37.000]   you had to stiffen your upper arm, et cetera.
[02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:42.000]   So the mother of all proximal stability is your core.
[02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:45.280]   In exactly the same way, a heavy equipment operator,
[02:22:45.280 --> 02:22:47.420]   using a backhoe, the first thing they do
[02:22:47.420 --> 02:22:49.180]   is they put down the stabilizers,
[02:22:49.180 --> 02:22:50.980]   which are posts that go into the ground
[02:22:50.980 --> 02:22:54.340]   and lift the tires off the ground to stabilize the tractor
[02:22:54.340 --> 02:22:58.660]   so that now the arm can be the athlete pulling earth.
[02:22:58.660 --> 02:22:59.980]   Failure to stabilize,
[02:22:59.980 --> 02:23:02.380]   you're just pulling the tractor around.
[02:23:02.380 --> 02:23:07.380]   So core stability is essential for ability and performance.
[02:23:07.380 --> 02:23:13.940]   It's arresting all little micro movements.
[02:23:13.940 --> 02:23:15.140]   We're all shrinking.
[02:23:15.140 --> 02:23:18.660]   You will notice this probably over the next decade.
[02:23:18.660 --> 02:23:20.940]   The disc height is now shrinking
[02:23:20.940 --> 02:23:23.040]   and there's gonna be a little bit more micro movement
[02:23:23.040 --> 02:23:24.060]   in the discs.
[02:23:24.060 --> 02:23:26.660]   - Is there anything that can be done to offset the shrinking?
[02:23:26.660 --> 02:23:28.120]   - Not that I know of.
[02:23:28.120 --> 02:23:29.780]   - People will ask whether or not hanging
[02:23:29.780 --> 02:23:31.860]   or anti-gravity boots.
[02:23:31.860 --> 02:23:33.220]   - Oh, well, I've measured that.
[02:23:33.220 --> 02:23:38.220]   Yes, it will increase disc height for 15 minutes
[02:23:38.220 --> 02:23:45.860]   and then gravity and the hydrostatic pressures
[02:23:45.860 --> 02:23:48.140]   will cause the fluid flow.
[02:23:48.140 --> 02:23:48.980]   And the fluid flow,
[02:23:48.980 --> 02:23:53.020]   there's a little bit through laterally through the disc,
[02:23:53.020 --> 02:23:54.700]   but most of it comes through the end plates.
[02:23:54.700 --> 02:23:59.300]   So from the vertebral body into the nucleus of the disc
[02:23:59.300 --> 02:24:03.060]   and you can draw fluid in under tension,
[02:24:03.060 --> 02:24:05.140]   but the hydrostatic pressure
[02:24:05.140 --> 02:24:08.100]   overrides the osmotic pressure in gravity
[02:24:08.100 --> 02:24:10.380]   and then the discs lose all the fluid.
[02:24:10.380 --> 02:24:14.340]   So it's a 15 minute effect.
[02:24:14.340 --> 02:24:17.500]   - I feel like every tissue in the body
[02:24:17.500 --> 02:24:21.180]   has been the target of an attempt
[02:24:21.180 --> 02:24:25.220]   to either restore its more youthful state
[02:24:25.220 --> 02:24:30.340]   or somehow augment its, I don't know,
[02:24:30.340 --> 02:24:31.880]   resilience over time.
[02:24:31.880 --> 02:24:36.260]   So these days we hear a lot about FDA approved treatments
[02:24:36.260 --> 02:24:38.820]   using so-called platelet rich plasma,
[02:24:38.820 --> 02:24:41.960]   PRP injected into the knee or PRP injected into an ovary
[02:24:41.960 --> 02:24:45.340]   or PRP injected into whatever tissue it is
[02:24:45.340 --> 02:24:49.460]   that people are attempting to restore youthful state to.
[02:24:49.460 --> 02:24:52.660]   Is there any evidence for any compounds
[02:24:52.660 --> 02:24:57.000]   or injectable drugs that can restore
[02:24:57.000 --> 02:25:01.260]   the tensile strength and thickness to the discs?
[02:25:01.260 --> 02:25:04.820]   - I haven't seen any evidence of PRP doing so.
[02:25:04.820 --> 02:25:09.540]   Now, I didn't condemn PRP throughout the body.
[02:25:09.540 --> 02:25:13.520]   I swear by it for stubborn muscle tears.
[02:25:13.520 --> 02:25:14.360]   - Interesting.
[02:25:14.360 --> 02:25:18.160]   - In one example, ball and socket articular joints.
[02:25:18.160 --> 02:25:24.720]   There's no question, not all the time,
[02:25:24.720 --> 02:25:28.560]   but it can make a measurable difference,
[02:25:28.560 --> 02:25:30.900]   but not injected into the disc.
[02:25:30.900 --> 02:25:35.900]   So I just need to give a little bit of a context to this now.
[02:25:36.060 --> 02:25:41.060]   If we take someone's disc who's never been traumatized,
[02:25:41.060 --> 02:25:43.080]   so they're a young person,
[02:25:43.080 --> 02:25:47.740]   they can expose their spine to mobility,
[02:25:47.740 --> 02:25:49.980]   be it yoga or ballet or whatever,
[02:25:49.980 --> 02:25:51.620]   and they will probably increase
[02:25:51.620 --> 02:25:53.940]   the range of motion and mobility.
[02:25:53.940 --> 02:25:56.820]   They can strength train and toughen the collagen
[02:25:56.820 --> 02:25:59.300]   and the end plate and build some bone.
[02:25:59.300 --> 02:26:02.440]   And in other words, they can do both, Andrew.
[02:26:02.440 --> 02:26:07.440]   They can increase the constituent strength
[02:26:07.440 --> 02:26:13.720]   of the various parts and they can create mobility.
[02:26:13.720 --> 02:26:17.180]   But once you have an injury to the disc
[02:26:17.180 --> 02:26:18.720]   and you lose a little bit of disc height,
[02:26:18.720 --> 02:26:20.400]   the world changes.
[02:26:20.400 --> 02:26:23.360]   It's not so easy to adapt those full range
[02:26:23.360 --> 02:26:25.480]   of athletic abilities anymore.
[02:26:25.480 --> 02:26:28.680]   So now you're forced to make a compromise.
[02:26:28.680 --> 02:26:32.200]   Most people, we can get them to do one or the other.
[02:26:32.200 --> 02:26:34.800]   They can maintain mobility to play golf
[02:26:34.800 --> 02:26:36.360]   after a disc injury,
[02:26:36.360 --> 02:26:39.680]   or they wanna pop up on a surfboard.
[02:26:39.680 --> 02:26:40.860]   That's their thing in life.
[02:26:40.860 --> 02:26:42.440]   They just wanna be able to surf.
[02:26:42.440 --> 02:26:47.080]   I'll say, good, we can manage.
[02:26:47.080 --> 02:26:48.440]   It's no longer adapting.
[02:26:48.440 --> 02:26:51.760]   We can manage you to achieve that,
[02:26:51.760 --> 02:26:53.740]   but you're gonna have to back off the deadlifts
[02:26:53.740 --> 02:26:56.760]   and some of the strength exposures
[02:26:56.760 --> 02:26:59.300]   because they will just further compromise
[02:26:59.300 --> 02:27:01.480]   the disc height of a damaged disc.
[02:27:02.320 --> 02:27:04.400]   And we can do the opposite.
[02:27:04.400 --> 02:27:06.640]   If you wanna strength train and bear a load,
[02:27:06.640 --> 02:27:09.200]   you're gonna have to give up the mobility.
[02:27:09.200 --> 02:27:11.960]   So that game, that dance with the devil,
[02:27:11.960 --> 02:27:14.160]   that comes after the back injury.
[02:27:14.160 --> 02:27:17.800]   So I think the question was a little bit about adaptation.
[02:27:17.800 --> 02:27:22.820]   If you haven't experienced disc damage yet,
[02:27:22.820 --> 02:27:26.240]   you have a lot more leeway to adapt your spine.
[02:27:26.240 --> 02:27:29.200]   After that, it becomes a game of management
[02:27:29.200 --> 02:27:33.520]   and encouraging an athletic ability.
[02:27:33.520 --> 02:27:35.640]   You become a little bit more unidimensional.
[02:27:35.640 --> 02:27:38.540]   And if you want a little bit of everything, okay,
[02:27:38.540 --> 02:27:40.180]   but you have to be very modest.
[02:27:40.180 --> 02:27:44.160]   You just have to try and achieve sufficient mobility,
[02:27:44.160 --> 02:27:46.600]   sufficient strength to do whatever,
[02:27:46.600 --> 02:27:47.800]   just to get through life.
[02:27:47.800 --> 02:27:49.960]   And it's a bit of a dance.
[02:27:49.960 --> 02:27:52.960]   So I don't know if that gives a bit of a context.
[02:27:52.960 --> 02:27:53.800]   - That's perfect.
[02:27:53.800 --> 02:27:54.760]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[02:27:54.760 --> 02:27:59.480]   - Could you walk us through your biblical week training
[02:27:59.480 --> 02:28:02.120]   with some examples of what one could select
[02:28:02.120 --> 02:28:04.200]   from the buffet of training options?
[02:28:04.200 --> 02:28:06.280]   - Right, I think I can.
[02:28:06.280 --> 02:28:11.280]   So let's say today I'm going into our clinic gym
[02:28:11.280 --> 02:28:15.120]   and I will start with doing the big three.
[02:28:15.120 --> 02:28:19.080]   So I will do bird dogs and I'm gonna work on good form.
[02:28:19.080 --> 02:28:21.480]   And then I'm gonna put some dynamicism into it.
[02:28:21.480 --> 02:28:24.120]   I don't lift the leg so much.
[02:28:24.120 --> 02:28:25.680]   I push the heel away.
[02:28:25.680 --> 02:28:28.800]   And it really causes you to lock the core
[02:28:28.800 --> 02:28:30.760]   to create the proximal stability.
[02:28:30.760 --> 02:28:32.680]   And then pushing the heel away
[02:28:32.680 --> 02:28:35.280]   really engages the glutes and hamstrings.
[02:28:35.280 --> 02:28:36.720]   Then I draw small squares.
[02:28:36.720 --> 02:28:38.420]   I square out with the hand and foot
[02:28:38.420 --> 02:28:40.600]   down towards the midline and up.
[02:28:40.600 --> 02:28:44.720]   So now I'm creating a little bit of a disassociation
[02:28:44.720 --> 02:28:46.960]   through the ball and socket joints with I want,
[02:28:46.960 --> 02:28:51.480]   which is what I want, with the core control.
[02:28:52.920 --> 02:28:55.640]   So that is translatable.
[02:28:55.640 --> 02:28:58.240]   We did an experiment with the Pensacola Fire Department,
[02:28:58.240 --> 02:29:02.760]   by the way, where those firefighters who were trained
[02:29:02.760 --> 02:29:07.600]   with a coach who explained why they were insisting
[02:29:07.600 --> 02:29:09.460]   on certain exercise forms,
[02:29:09.460 --> 02:29:13.400]   we measured them doing fire ground tasks
[02:29:13.400 --> 02:29:15.000]   before the training sessions.
[02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:18.360]   In other words, we measured them putting up a fire ladder,
[02:29:18.360 --> 02:29:19.840]   advancing a loaded fire hose,
[02:29:19.840 --> 02:29:23.100]   which is a tremendous reactive push, as you know,
[02:29:23.100 --> 02:29:25.400]   picking open an elevator door,
[02:29:25.400 --> 02:29:27.580]   chopping a hole in a burning roof.
[02:29:27.580 --> 02:29:29.920]   Then half of the group trained
[02:29:29.920 --> 02:29:33.260]   with this attention to exercise form.
[02:29:33.260 --> 02:29:35.400]   And we explained the principles to them.
[02:29:35.400 --> 02:29:38.840]   And then the other half of the firefighters
[02:29:38.840 --> 02:29:42.720]   had trainers who were more like cheerleaders,
[02:29:42.720 --> 02:29:45.520]   trying to get them to do more reps and encouraging them.
[02:29:45.520 --> 02:29:48.280]   Both groups got fit.
[02:29:48.280 --> 02:29:51.360]   And then we measured them all again out on the fire ground.
[02:29:51.360 --> 02:29:53.040]   Remember now, we never trained them
[02:29:53.040 --> 02:29:55.240]   how to do the fire ground tasks.
[02:29:55.240 --> 02:29:57.320]   They went back to the fire ground.
[02:29:57.320 --> 02:30:00.320]   Those who trained with the cheerleader types of,
[02:30:00.320 --> 02:30:05.200]   oh, just do more reps, had more known injury markers.
[02:30:05.200 --> 02:30:07.320]   Do you know valvular collapse of the knee
[02:30:07.320 --> 02:30:09.880]   is a very strong predictor of future risk
[02:30:09.880 --> 02:30:11.640]   of ACL injury being one of them.
[02:30:11.640 --> 02:30:13.560]   So there would be an example of that.
[02:30:16.400 --> 02:30:18.960]   Sagittal plane spine motion under load.
[02:30:18.960 --> 02:30:21.480]   I mean, every study that surveils groups
[02:30:21.480 --> 02:30:24.120]   who have to bend down through their spine
[02:30:24.120 --> 02:30:26.560]   and pick up more load has a much higher incidence.
[02:30:26.560 --> 02:30:30.440]   A Bill Maris' study showed 10 times the risk factor
[02:30:30.440 --> 02:30:34.420]   to having a disc injury if you do that.
[02:30:34.420 --> 02:30:39.420]   So I will then do side planks, rolling side planks.
[02:30:39.420 --> 02:30:45.520]   I will do a variety of abdominal exercises,
[02:30:45.520 --> 02:30:48.040]   the modified abdominal curl that you're familiar with,
[02:30:48.040 --> 02:30:51.500]   and I'll do some glute bridges.
[02:30:51.500 --> 02:30:53.840]   Then I'll do them one-legged
[02:30:53.840 --> 02:30:56.560]   and I'll get the arm involved and cross body.
[02:30:56.560 --> 02:31:01.760]   I may put a kettlebell on my belly
[02:31:01.760 --> 02:31:05.160]   and do some hip thrusts that way, but a very mindful way.
[02:31:05.160 --> 02:31:08.560]   I'm focused my brain on squeezing the glutes,
[02:31:08.560 --> 02:31:11.160]   pushing the feet away, et cetera.
[02:31:12.080 --> 02:31:15.880]   Then I will probably stand up and do the strength patterns.
[02:31:15.880 --> 02:31:18.960]   So I'll go over and do pushes.
[02:31:18.960 --> 02:31:23.960]   Now, consider a pushup, which rather than me load heavy
[02:31:23.960 --> 02:31:28.680]   with a bench press or something like that,
[02:31:28.680 --> 02:31:30.800]   I'll do pushups, you know, the clapping pushup
[02:31:30.800 --> 02:31:34.400]   where you dynamically explode up, clap, and go down.
[02:31:34.400 --> 02:31:36.280]   I'll do a variety of those,
[02:31:36.280 --> 02:31:39.440]   very dynamic power generating pushes.
[02:31:39.440 --> 02:31:40.820]   Then I'll do some pulls.
[02:31:41.920 --> 02:31:45.040]   I probably won't do a row with a barbell,
[02:31:45.040 --> 02:31:48.400]   but I'll do an inverted row pulling on a TRX,
[02:31:48.400 --> 02:31:50.440]   pronated grip, pulling into hammer grip,
[02:31:50.440 --> 02:31:52.140]   power breathing and exploding.
[02:31:52.140 --> 02:31:57.580]   Really trying to get some power into it.
[02:31:57.580 --> 02:32:04.440]   Then I will go to probably a split lunge,
[02:32:04.440 --> 02:32:09.380]   rear elevated foot squat, lunge squat,
[02:32:09.380 --> 02:32:11.680]   with the techniques that I showed you,
[02:32:11.680 --> 02:32:14.560]   hands interlaced behind my head,
[02:32:14.560 --> 02:32:18.240]   peacocking high, pushing back, pulling forward,
[02:32:18.240 --> 02:32:20.240]   and now doing the lunge squat.
[02:32:20.240 --> 02:32:23.440]   So that's challenging my balance,
[02:32:23.440 --> 02:32:28.440]   the whole extensor chain strength, et cetera.
[02:32:28.440 --> 02:32:33.280]   I might do some bilateral squats with my hips.
[02:32:33.280 --> 02:32:34.680]   I've broken my ankle.
[02:32:34.680 --> 02:32:38.720]   I do heel elevated squats, usually with a banded knee.
[02:32:38.720 --> 02:32:40.560]   And sometimes I just use my brain
[02:32:40.560 --> 02:32:42.800]   and try and spread the floor.
[02:32:42.800 --> 02:32:44.480]   Then I get into the auxiliaries.
[02:32:44.480 --> 02:32:45.680]   So I broke C4.
[02:32:45.680 --> 02:32:49.520]   I have to, yeah, not a good thing.
[02:32:49.520 --> 02:32:50.520]   - Playing football.
[02:32:50.520 --> 02:32:51.360]   - Hockey.
[02:32:51.360 --> 02:32:52.180]   - Hockey.
[02:32:52.180 --> 02:32:54.040]   - Head down into the boards, classic.
[02:32:54.040 --> 02:32:59.040]   Anyway, I can't really do shearing exercises
[02:32:59.040 --> 02:33:02.200]   where I push against resistance
[02:33:02.200 --> 02:33:04.760]   that will get my neck a bit cranky.
[02:33:04.760 --> 02:33:08.480]   So I take out the shear, I get tall,
[02:33:08.480 --> 02:33:11.680]   I push my tongue hard to the roof of the mouth,
[02:33:11.680 --> 02:33:12.600]   and I grimace.
[02:33:12.600 --> 02:33:14.800]   So now I've activated all the flexors
[02:33:14.800 --> 02:33:16.160]   and I put my hands underneath
[02:33:16.160 --> 02:33:20.040]   and I just push up isometrically and I control that.
[02:33:20.040 --> 02:33:21.280]   So there's no shear anymore,
[02:33:21.280 --> 02:33:25.080]   but I've really started to build the flexor family.
[02:33:25.080 --> 02:33:27.000]   - Keep your neck strong.
[02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:29.000]   - It's important for me.
[02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:32.680]   Yeah, now put your chin poking, retract.
[02:33:32.680 --> 02:33:35.160]   Now push up, you got it.
[02:33:35.160 --> 02:33:36.000]   That's it.
[02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:37.240]   Push your tongue.
[02:33:37.240 --> 02:33:39.240]   Yeah, don't go crazy.
[02:33:39.240 --> 02:33:41.600]   And add a little bit of endurance to that.
[02:33:41.600 --> 02:33:43.880]   I appreciate the neck work that you do though,
[02:33:43.880 --> 02:33:44.720]   which I-
[02:33:44.720 --> 02:33:46.960]   - I have a four-way neck machine, but I don't require one.
[02:33:46.960 --> 02:33:50.000]   I've actually found that taking a plate
[02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:52.640]   and wrapping it in a towel, lying on one side,
[02:33:52.640 --> 02:33:54.800]   making sure to hook my foot under the wrench
[02:33:54.800 --> 02:33:58.200]   and stabilize with my other hand on the ground,
[02:33:58.200 --> 02:34:00.560]   and then just gently doing repetitions.
[02:34:00.560 --> 02:34:02.040]   Jeff Cavalier from Athlean-X
[02:34:02.040 --> 02:34:03.960]   has a great set of videos on this,
[02:34:03.960 --> 02:34:05.540]   where he really spells out the dangers
[02:34:05.540 --> 02:34:07.560]   of things like neck bridges.
[02:34:07.560 --> 02:34:10.840]   They can be done, but there's a risk there
[02:34:10.840 --> 02:34:13.160]   that probably outweighs the potential benefits
[02:34:13.160 --> 02:34:14.700]   for most people.
[02:34:14.700 --> 02:34:16.360]   But every once in a while, I can't help myself,
[02:34:16.360 --> 02:34:19.240]   and I do some bridges, 'cause I really enjoy them.
[02:34:19.240 --> 02:34:22.160]   - If you're a wrestler at University of Iowa,
[02:34:22.160 --> 02:34:24.140]   you've been doing it for a good while,
[02:34:24.140 --> 02:34:26.520]   you're probably okay doing neck bridges.
[02:34:26.520 --> 02:34:28.580]   - Yeah, I get teased for saying this too often,
[02:34:28.580 --> 02:34:31.480]   but the value of having a strong neck
[02:34:31.480 --> 02:34:33.720]   is just hard to overstate.
[02:34:33.720 --> 02:34:35.120]   You don't have to have a big neck,
[02:34:35.120 --> 02:34:37.560]   but a strong neck for sake of stabilizing
[02:34:37.560 --> 02:34:39.600]   the whole shoulder girdle, excuse me,
[02:34:39.600 --> 02:34:42.840]   during pressing and pulling lifts,
[02:34:42.840 --> 02:34:47.680]   for posture, for feeling like your head
[02:34:47.680 --> 02:34:49.360]   is stably placed on your body.
[02:34:49.360 --> 02:34:51.240]   - Think of every pulling motion.
[02:34:51.240 --> 02:34:52.440]   Where does it start?
[02:34:52.440 --> 02:34:56.160]   The trapezius originates off the neck.
[02:34:56.160 --> 02:35:00.240]   Stack that flagpole and really get those muscles
[02:35:00.240 --> 02:35:01.420]   ready to pull.
[02:35:02.400 --> 02:35:05.280]   It requires a stiff, strong neck.
[02:35:05.280 --> 02:35:06.120]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[02:35:06.120 --> 02:35:07.200]   So every strong puller.
[02:35:07.200 --> 02:35:09.780]   - Yeah, as the dog was alive,
[02:35:09.780 --> 02:35:11.600]   he had the larger neck in the house.
[02:35:11.600 --> 02:35:16.500]   But again, it's not about building size into the neck.
[02:35:16.500 --> 02:35:18.960]   It's really that strength and stability
[02:35:18.960 --> 02:35:21.240]   that I just think translates to so many things
[02:35:21.240 --> 02:35:22.440]   that are valuable.
[02:35:22.440 --> 02:35:24.680]   Anyway, I'll finish out my strength routine
[02:35:24.680 --> 02:35:26.480]   with some more auxiliaries.
[02:35:26.480 --> 02:35:29.000]   People laugh at this, I call it sword play.
[02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:32.120]   The amount of athletic gain that we've achieved
[02:35:32.120 --> 02:35:33.160]   with sword play.
[02:35:33.160 --> 02:35:38.160]   I take an iron bar, like the old wieder dumbbell weight,
[02:35:38.160 --> 02:35:40.800]   it'll be an iron bar about that long,
[02:35:40.800 --> 02:35:43.960]   and I'll put maybe a two pound weight on the end.
[02:35:43.960 --> 02:35:48.160]   And then I grab it and I do figure eights over here,
[02:35:48.160 --> 02:35:50.640]   over here, over here, around there.
[02:35:50.640 --> 02:35:55.160]   You wouldn't believe I have professional hockey players
[02:35:55.160 --> 02:35:58.840]   in the NHL who say, wow, those figure eight sword plays,
[02:35:58.840 --> 02:36:03.140]   my wrist shot, my slap shot have, tour tennis players.
[02:36:03.140 --> 02:36:06.600]   I've never had such power and finesse off the racket
[02:36:06.600 --> 02:36:08.520]   because of that sword play exercise.
[02:36:08.520 --> 02:36:10.360]   - Yeah, this is interesting.
[02:36:10.360 --> 02:36:13.360]   I love older exercise books.
[02:36:13.360 --> 02:36:16.940]   And recently I came across one called "Heavy Hands."
[02:36:16.940 --> 02:36:18.840]   This must be from the '70s.
[02:36:18.840 --> 02:36:22.200]   And the entire book was centered around people
[02:36:22.200 --> 02:36:25.080]   being encouraged to carry some dumbbells during exercise,
[02:36:25.080 --> 02:36:26.680]   not all the time, and doing some lunges,
[02:36:26.680 --> 02:36:29.040]   or walking uphill and getting the weights out
[02:36:29.040 --> 02:36:29.880]   from their body.
[02:36:29.880 --> 02:36:34.320]   And I was kind of chuckling about it on the one hand,
[02:36:34.320 --> 02:36:37.680]   pun intended, but at the same time,
[02:36:37.680 --> 02:36:39.980]   we know based on a number of really good studies
[02:36:39.980 --> 02:36:42.480]   using neuroimaging and functional scoring
[02:36:42.480 --> 02:36:46.960]   of neural system function as one ages,
[02:36:46.960 --> 02:36:49.760]   that the innervation of some of the distal muscles
[02:36:49.760 --> 02:36:53.760]   and the fine control of the digits,
[02:36:53.760 --> 02:36:58.240]   the fingers and toes and toe spreading and things like that,
[02:36:58.240 --> 02:37:04.360]   even calf size and atrophy are fairly reliable markers
[02:37:04.360 --> 02:37:08.360]   of the extent to which there's been degeneration
[02:37:08.360 --> 02:37:11.520]   of the upper motor neuron pathways,
[02:37:11.520 --> 02:37:13.740]   other brain areas or not.
[02:37:13.740 --> 02:37:17.280]   So the idea of keeping the nervous system
[02:37:17.280 --> 02:37:21.400]   and neuromuscular connectivity youthful
[02:37:21.400 --> 02:37:24.920]   by "heavy hands" or maybe ankle weights,
[02:37:24.920 --> 02:37:26.800]   provided they're not going to induce injury,
[02:37:26.800 --> 02:37:28.160]   makes a lot of sense.
[02:37:28.160 --> 02:37:30.860]   Weighting the most distal portion of our body
[02:37:30.860 --> 02:37:34.000]   in order to generate adaptations,
[02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:35.980]   I think is going to be something that returns
[02:37:35.980 --> 02:37:40.980]   to the kind of modern sphere of fitness and longevity.
[02:37:40.980 --> 02:37:43.560]   - May I give you a couple of comments?
[02:37:43.560 --> 02:37:44.400]   - Please.
[02:37:44.400 --> 02:37:45.680]   - That was fabulous.
[02:37:45.680 --> 02:37:49.080]   It's so much fun when I see someone getting out of their car
[02:37:49.080 --> 02:37:52.720]   and walking up to the clinic door
[02:37:52.720 --> 02:37:55.080]   and I can see the muscle wasting on their calf
[02:37:55.080 --> 02:37:58.240]   and they'll say, "Oh, I have to get out my EMG
[02:37:58.240 --> 02:38:02.280]   nerve conduction velocity scores here."
[02:38:02.280 --> 02:38:03.440]   I said, "Are you kidding me?
[02:38:03.440 --> 02:38:06.800]   You telling me the doc needed to do EMG conduction velocity
[02:38:06.800 --> 02:38:08.760]   and all I had to do was look at your leg?"
[02:38:08.760 --> 02:38:11.560]   We know exactly the nerve roots that are deficit
[02:38:11.560 --> 02:38:13.840]   'cause I know exactly what serves those muscles
[02:38:13.840 --> 02:38:14.960]   that have wasted.
[02:38:14.960 --> 02:38:19.960]   I mean, it's crazy how technology has made so many people
[02:38:19.960 --> 02:38:26.120]   oblivious to the signs that we all show.
[02:38:26.120 --> 02:38:27.360]   That was my first comment.
[02:38:27.360 --> 02:38:29.900]   But the second one was going back to the old time books.
[02:38:29.900 --> 02:38:32.260]   I collect a lot of those actually.
[02:38:32.260 --> 02:38:34.680]   I have quite a library of the old time strength books
[02:38:34.680 --> 02:38:36.720]   from some from the 1800s,
[02:38:36.720 --> 02:38:39.840]   the old Inchbook of Strength and oh, they're fabulous.
[02:38:39.840 --> 02:38:42.600]   Indian clubs.
[02:38:42.600 --> 02:38:44.080]   Are you familiar with Indian clubs?
[02:38:44.080 --> 02:38:45.680]   So it's a wooden club
[02:38:45.680 --> 02:38:47.960]   that looks like a bowling pin basically.
[02:38:47.960 --> 02:38:51.520]   But some of the old style Indian clubs were this long.
[02:38:51.520 --> 02:38:55.840]   Well, there's a great manual strength athlete
[02:38:55.840 --> 02:38:59.060]   that not too many people have heard of, John Brookfield.
[02:38:59.060 --> 02:39:02.320]   He lives in North Carolina, Pinehurst, North Carolina.
[02:39:02.320 --> 02:39:06.720]   In Pinehurst, there's a sculpture of very heavy steel
[02:39:06.720 --> 02:39:08.680]   that John bent with his bare hands
[02:39:08.680 --> 02:39:10.680]   to make this sculpture with.
[02:39:10.680 --> 02:39:13.440]   Yeah, he'll take heavy rebar and bend it
[02:39:13.440 --> 02:39:17.400]   and put on strength shows with his hands.
[02:39:17.400 --> 02:39:19.300]   He's a fabulous fella too, by the way.
[02:39:19.300 --> 02:39:23.360]   He's got a set of Indian clubs.
[02:39:23.360 --> 02:39:24.720]   I can hardly pick one up,
[02:39:24.720 --> 02:39:26.560]   but he just picks up this Indian club
[02:39:26.560 --> 02:39:28.840]   and it was from some famous guy from the 1800s
[02:39:28.840 --> 02:39:31.000]   and somehow he got the Indian clubs
[02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:31.920]   and they're about this long,
[02:39:31.920 --> 02:39:36.160]   but he could just get them and play swordplay
[02:39:36.160 --> 02:39:38.720]   with very heavy Indian clubs.
[02:39:38.720 --> 02:39:41.280]   There's actually a good friend of mine.
[02:39:41.280 --> 02:39:43.200]   He's an Australian fellow, Andrew Locke.
[02:39:43.200 --> 02:39:45.760]   I don't know if you've ever heard of Andrew Locke.
[02:39:45.760 --> 02:39:48.760]   And Andrew has collected kettlebells
[02:39:48.760 --> 02:39:51.640]   and Indian clubs from the old timers.
[02:39:51.640 --> 02:39:54.280]   He's got quite a lovely collection in Melbourne,
[02:39:54.280 --> 02:39:56.180]   where he's from in Australia.
[02:39:56.180 --> 02:40:00.400]   But they're wonderful exercises.
[02:40:00.400 --> 02:40:03.040]   - And none of these things require fancy equipment.
[02:40:03.040 --> 02:40:06.840]   One could imagine just grabbing ahold of some either-
[02:40:06.840 --> 02:40:07.680]   - Well, an iron bar.
[02:40:07.680 --> 02:40:08.980]   - Yeah, an iron bar.
[02:40:08.980 --> 02:40:11.520]   Yeah, I really think there's something
[02:40:11.520 --> 02:40:16.520]   to this loading of the distal limbs cautiously, right?
[02:40:16.520 --> 02:40:19.480]   Properly, but there's something there
[02:40:19.480 --> 02:40:22.560]   in terms of keeping the neural pathways healthy and alive
[02:40:22.560 --> 02:40:24.040]   because we know they atrophy with age.
[02:40:24.040 --> 02:40:27.320]   And that explains in part the calf muscle atrophy,
[02:40:27.320 --> 02:40:31.080]   which as you point out is a well-known clinical marker
[02:40:31.080 --> 02:40:32.700]   for neurodegeneration.
[02:40:32.700 --> 02:40:34.840]   - Well, simply things,
[02:40:34.840 --> 02:40:37.000]   and you can certainly comment about this.
[02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:39.280]   I try and do things with my opposite hand.
[02:40:39.280 --> 02:40:40.640]   So today I'm just gonna brush my teeth,
[02:40:40.640 --> 02:40:42.800]   comb my hair with my opposite hand.
[02:40:42.800 --> 02:40:45.740]   Now don't ask me to throw a ball because I'm a moron,
[02:40:45.740 --> 02:40:50.080]   but if I'm splitting firewood, okay, it's 10 reps this way,
[02:40:50.080 --> 02:40:51.160]   10 reps that way.
[02:40:51.160 --> 02:40:56.720]   And that's all in an attempt to keep my brain
[02:40:56.720 --> 02:41:01.720]   as movement competent and dexterous as possible.
[02:41:01.720 --> 02:41:03.280]   - Well, certainly when I resistance train,
[02:41:03.280 --> 02:41:05.040]   if I'm doing anything standing,
[02:41:05.040 --> 02:41:09.160]   I make it a point to stagger my stance.
[02:41:09.160 --> 02:41:10.760]   - Yes.
[02:41:10.760 --> 02:41:12.640]   - And at the same time to make sure
[02:41:12.640 --> 02:41:14.600]   that my belly button is pointing forward
[02:41:14.600 --> 02:41:18.980]   so that I generate some anti-rotation effort
[02:41:18.980 --> 02:41:20.840]   so that most of my abdominal work
[02:41:20.840 --> 02:41:23.720]   can be placed within the workout for other things.
[02:41:23.720 --> 02:41:26.800]   I do some pikes and some direct abdominal work as well
[02:41:26.800 --> 02:41:28.920]   in the roll-up and things of that sort
[02:41:28.920 --> 02:41:30.240]   that you've recommended.
[02:41:30.240 --> 02:41:35.240]   But I find that from a coordination standpoint
[02:41:35.240 --> 02:41:38.800]   and especially from a balancing the musculature
[02:41:38.800 --> 02:41:40.800]   and the strength on both sides of the body,
[02:41:40.800 --> 02:41:42.140]   this is extremely important.
[02:41:42.140 --> 02:41:44.560]   And I know this because after years of skateboarding
[02:41:44.560 --> 02:41:47.800]   where you push with one leg, that was when I was younger,
[02:41:47.800 --> 02:41:52.400]   boxing where I'm traditional stance as opposed to Southpaw,
[02:41:52.400 --> 02:41:55.480]   you start getting into all these imbalances
[02:41:55.480 --> 02:41:57.920]   that goes way beyond anything aesthetic.
[02:41:57.920 --> 02:42:00.620]   I mean, the aesthetic stuff is my concern in certain people,
[02:42:00.620 --> 02:42:01.520]   but it was more of the feeling
[02:42:01.520 --> 02:42:03.360]   that I could turn to my right very easily
[02:42:03.360 --> 02:42:04.560]   without pain turning my left.
[02:42:04.560 --> 02:42:06.400]   I felt stiff and it was just an imbalance
[02:42:06.400 --> 02:42:11.080]   in some of the muscles controlling anti-rotation.
[02:42:11.080 --> 02:42:14.600]   So I think that weaving a symmetric stance,
[02:42:14.600 --> 02:42:19.320]   weaving the requirement for symmetric balancing
[02:42:19.320 --> 02:42:21.880]   of the musculature on both sides of the midline
[02:42:21.880 --> 02:42:25.200]   just makes all the sense in the world to me,
[02:42:25.200 --> 02:42:27.640]   especially if one is going to be a regular exerciser,
[02:42:27.640 --> 02:42:29.520]   which hopefully people are.
[02:42:29.520 --> 02:42:31.300]   - Well, if I can convince you
[02:42:31.300 --> 02:42:34.120]   to consider the biblical training week,
[02:42:34.120 --> 02:42:36.960]   all of that fits into your mobility days.
[02:42:36.960 --> 02:42:37.840]   Yeah, let's talk about those
[02:42:37.840 --> 02:42:39.080]   'cause you talked about the strength days.
[02:42:39.080 --> 02:42:41.360]   What about the two days of mobility?
[02:42:41.360 --> 02:42:45.800]   - Well, given my history, I do thoracic spine extension.
[02:42:45.800 --> 02:42:48.820]   I do a little bit of neck work, hip mobility,
[02:42:48.820 --> 02:42:51.500]   but again, I have a certain capacity there
[02:42:51.500 --> 02:42:54.040]   that I can't overdrive.
[02:42:54.040 --> 02:42:56.880]   And then once I've done the targeted ones,
[02:42:56.880 --> 02:43:00.760]   I just go through the motion of every joint
[02:43:00.760 --> 02:43:03.840]   and don't add load.
[02:43:03.840 --> 02:43:06.660]   And then I will do the footwork.
[02:43:06.660 --> 02:43:09.560]   So with my background, I'll do a little bit of shadow boxing.
[02:43:09.560 --> 02:43:14.560]   I'll play traditional southpaw, et cetera.
[02:43:14.560 --> 02:43:18.200]   - If you could just repeat the cardiovascular days
[02:43:18.200 --> 02:43:19.040]   since in the-
[02:43:19.040 --> 02:43:20.800]   - It depends on the time of year.
[02:43:20.800 --> 02:43:23.480]   I really like to be outside.
[02:43:23.480 --> 02:43:28.080]   So if it's winter time and I, for some reason,
[02:43:28.080 --> 02:43:30.960]   couldn't go for a cross-country ski that day or whatnot,
[02:43:30.960 --> 02:43:34.680]   I will ride a stationary bike in the clinic.
[02:43:34.680 --> 02:43:37.160]   I'd prefer not to, but I will.
[02:43:37.160 --> 02:43:39.720]   If it's summertime, I'm riding outside.
[02:43:39.720 --> 02:43:44.720]   And I could kayak, swim, canoe,
[02:43:44.720 --> 02:43:51.640]   just go to the hills and walk with Tico, my dog, hard.
[02:43:51.640 --> 02:43:55.760]   And that might be my cardiovascular that day.
[02:43:55.760 --> 02:43:58.200]   And going back to the genetics,
[02:43:58.200 --> 02:44:01.300]   which is how we started this podcast,
[02:44:01.300 --> 02:44:05.400]   have you ever had your athletic panel done
[02:44:05.400 --> 02:44:06.880]   from a genetic base?
[02:44:06.880 --> 02:44:08.680]   In other words, they look at your genes
[02:44:08.680 --> 02:44:11.240]   and determine what you're genetically good at
[02:44:11.240 --> 02:44:13.280]   and what you're genetically horrible at.
[02:44:13.280 --> 02:44:14.280]   Do you know that?
[02:44:14.280 --> 02:44:17.600]   - I mean, I know a few things that I'm horrible at.
[02:44:17.600 --> 02:44:20.060]   - But you haven't had it tested genetically?
[02:44:20.060 --> 02:44:20.900]   - No.
[02:44:20.900 --> 02:44:22.120]   I have.
[02:44:22.120 --> 02:44:26.320]   And they gave me a panel of 10 athleticisms.
[02:44:26.320 --> 02:44:28.080]   Now, interestingly enough,
[02:44:28.080 --> 02:44:30.200]   if I didn't have my athletic panel
[02:44:30.200 --> 02:44:31.760]   and you just asked me to check,
[02:44:31.760 --> 02:44:34.360]   am I good at this or am I bad at it?
[02:44:34.360 --> 02:44:35.840]   And check somewhere in between,
[02:44:35.840 --> 02:44:38.560]   I would have got every single one 100% right.
[02:44:38.560 --> 02:44:39.400]   - Interesting.
[02:44:39.400 --> 02:44:42.840]   - Yeah, so I know my abilities and it aligns 100%.
[02:44:42.840 --> 02:44:45.080]   In other words, I'm ultra,
[02:44:45.080 --> 02:44:47.440]   which is the highest for grip strength.
[02:44:47.440 --> 02:44:50.840]   I always knew that, you know, they're a pair of hands,
[02:44:50.840 --> 02:44:52.440]   but if I got my hands on you in football,
[02:44:52.440 --> 02:44:53.280]   you weren't getting it.
[02:44:53.280 --> 02:44:54.100]   You know what I mean?
[02:44:54.100 --> 02:44:56.180]   I've always had a very good grip strength.
[02:44:56.180 --> 02:44:58.240]   So genetically that came through as ultra.
[02:44:58.240 --> 02:44:59.840]   And the other thing I was ultra at
[02:44:59.840 --> 02:45:03.880]   was I can be quick for the first 35 milliseconds, boom.
[02:45:03.880 --> 02:45:05.760]   If you want something done like that,
[02:45:05.760 --> 02:45:08.140]   I can usually pop it, you know.
[02:45:08.140 --> 02:45:10.720]   When I was playing hockey,
[02:45:10.720 --> 02:45:16.680]   typically it's a 45, 50 second anaerobic blast.
[02:45:16.680 --> 02:45:18.280]   And you sit down for three minutes,
[02:45:18.280 --> 02:45:19.120]   there's two more shifts,
[02:45:19.120 --> 02:45:21.160]   and then the coach taps you on the helmet
[02:45:21.160 --> 02:45:22.640]   and I'm still breathing heavily.
[02:45:22.640 --> 02:45:25.360]   And my two line mates, they're ready to go again.
[02:45:25.360 --> 02:45:27.040]   I was terrible at recovering
[02:45:27.040 --> 02:45:30.320]   from an athletic anaerobic blast.
[02:45:30.320 --> 02:45:31.160]   Guess what?
[02:45:31.160 --> 02:45:33.120]   I'm the worst possible genetic category
[02:45:33.120 --> 02:45:37.360]   for recovery of heart rate.
[02:45:37.360 --> 02:45:39.680]   And I, you know, I've worked with
[02:45:39.680 --> 02:45:43.780]   some of the best heart rate recovery people
[02:45:43.780 --> 02:45:46.120]   and I'm hopeless at it.
[02:45:46.120 --> 02:45:48.560]   - I have a feeling I'm naturally inclined
[02:45:48.560 --> 02:45:50.280]   to do endurance work
[02:45:50.280 --> 02:45:52.220]   because once I start running distance,
[02:45:52.220 --> 02:45:53.600]   I can just run and run.
[02:45:53.600 --> 02:45:55.480]   And then eventually it just feels like
[02:45:55.480 --> 02:46:00.160]   the stopping comes from, you know, I don't know,
[02:46:00.160 --> 02:46:02.480]   some nagging little injury or something like that,
[02:46:02.480 --> 02:46:05.440]   or pain as opposed to anything stopping me
[02:46:05.440 --> 02:46:06.680]   from continuing to run,
[02:46:06.680 --> 02:46:08.440]   which is unfortunate because I tend to like
[02:46:08.440 --> 02:46:10.920]   the shorter workout type stuff.
[02:46:10.920 --> 02:46:13.480]   But it brings us back to what we were talking about earlier,
[02:46:13.480 --> 02:46:18.160]   trying to do a balance of those and everything in between.
[02:46:18.160 --> 02:46:19.660]   I love the biblical training week.
[02:46:19.660 --> 02:46:21.500]   And given that currently I've been doing
[02:46:21.500 --> 02:46:24.440]   three days of resistance training total per week
[02:46:24.440 --> 02:46:26.600]   and three days of cardiovascular training,
[02:46:26.600 --> 02:46:30.280]   all it requires is shifting one each of those days
[02:46:30.280 --> 02:46:31.500]   toward mobility training,
[02:46:31.500 --> 02:46:33.240]   still taking the full day off each week.
[02:46:33.240 --> 02:46:35.180]   - Make sure you take that day off.
[02:46:35.180 --> 02:46:40.180]   You will be less painful with your joints, I predict,
[02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:43.640]   when you're going into your 60s and 70s
[02:46:43.640 --> 02:46:48.320]   and knock on wood, having a blast when you're 80.
[02:46:48.320 --> 02:46:50.200]   - That's the plan.
[02:46:50.200 --> 02:46:53.280]   Well, I've certainly had a blast today, Dr. McGill.
[02:46:53.280 --> 02:46:54.640]   This has been amazing.
[02:46:54.640 --> 02:46:57.900]   I mean, you've given us such a wealth of knowledge
[02:46:57.900 --> 02:47:01.280]   about the back, its anatomy, neurology,
[02:47:01.280 --> 02:47:04.440]   the sources of pain for those that have back pain,
[02:47:04.440 --> 02:47:07.080]   avenues to relieve back pain,
[02:47:07.080 --> 02:47:09.440]   avenues for people to stave off back pain,
[02:47:09.440 --> 02:47:11.960]   including the big three, but not limited to the big three.
[02:47:11.960 --> 02:47:13.680]   You also gave us a wonderful window
[02:47:13.680 --> 02:47:18.680]   into the precision with which you approach assessment.
[02:47:18.680 --> 02:47:20.180]   And during the introduction
[02:47:20.180 --> 02:47:22.280]   and also in the show note captions,
[02:47:22.280 --> 02:47:25.300]   I mentioned and linked to the many clinicians
[02:47:25.300 --> 02:47:27.600]   that you've trained all over the world
[02:47:27.600 --> 02:47:30.520]   so that if people want to try and access
[02:47:30.520 --> 02:47:34.820]   direct coaching and rehabilitation, they can do that.
[02:47:34.820 --> 02:47:38.000]   I also really appreciate the books you've written,
[02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:41.180]   and we linked to that as well, "Back Mechanic."
[02:47:41.180 --> 02:47:43.520]   And I really just appreciate your devotion
[02:47:43.520 --> 02:47:46.500]   to public education through your own channels,
[02:47:46.500 --> 02:47:49.960]   through your students, the many, many, many
[02:47:49.960 --> 02:47:51.880]   peer-reviewed papers that you've published.
[02:47:51.880 --> 02:47:54.120]   I mean, I can't overemphasize this enough.
[02:47:54.120 --> 02:47:57.660]   You have a vast number of high-quality,
[02:47:57.660 --> 02:47:59.600]   peer-reviewed publications in these areas.
[02:47:59.600 --> 02:48:02.960]   And it's just wonderful to sit across from somebody
[02:48:02.960 --> 02:48:05.440]   who's devoted their professional life
[02:48:05.440 --> 02:48:06.920]   to this really important area
[02:48:06.920 --> 02:48:08.280]   that so many people confront,
[02:48:08.280 --> 02:48:11.520]   whether or not they be athletes or conventional exercisers
[02:48:11.520 --> 02:48:13.240]   or just people who are experiencing some pain
[02:48:13.240 --> 02:48:15.560]   or want to get in shape or all of the above.
[02:48:15.560 --> 02:48:19.160]   So on behalf of myself and everyone listening and watching,
[02:48:19.160 --> 02:48:22.000]   I just want to extend a really deep,
[02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:24.620]   heartfelt, and genuine thank you.
[02:48:24.620 --> 02:48:26.040]   Thank you so much.
[02:48:26.040 --> 02:48:28.820]   - Well, thank you, Professor Huberman.
[02:48:28.820 --> 02:48:33.920]   You know this, but I'm going to mention this
[02:48:33.920 --> 02:48:34.960]   for the listeners.
[02:48:34.960 --> 02:48:39.960]   You have done a great deed in changing the behavior
[02:48:39.960 --> 02:48:45.620]   of many people, myself included, and my family.
[02:48:45.620 --> 02:48:51.460]   It's not the easiest thing to do
[02:48:51.460 --> 02:48:53.520]   because there's always the critics,
[02:48:53.520 --> 02:48:56.420]   but you have done a tremendous service.
[02:48:56.420 --> 02:48:58.500]   And I thank you for that as well.
[02:48:58.500 --> 02:49:02.360]   And I thank you personally because you've improved my life.
[02:49:02.360 --> 02:49:05.120]   And hopefully I'll have a few more years to enjoy it,
[02:49:05.120 --> 02:49:06.040]   but thank you.
[02:49:06.040 --> 02:49:08.880]   - Well, thank you for those words.
[02:49:08.880 --> 02:49:11.440]   It's a labor of love for me,
[02:49:11.440 --> 02:49:14.140]   and that's extremely gratifying to hear.
[02:49:14.140 --> 02:49:18.200]   And God willing, I'll be in your kind of shape at your age.
[02:49:18.200 --> 02:49:19.640]   Let's do this again.
[02:49:19.640 --> 02:49:20.480]   - I would love it.
[02:49:20.480 --> 02:49:21.300]   Thanks.
[02:49:21.300 --> 02:49:23.320]   - Thank you for joining me for today's discussion
[02:49:23.320 --> 02:49:25.000]   with Dr. Stuart McGill.
[02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:26.200]   To learn more about his work,
[02:49:26.200 --> 02:49:28.600]   as well as to find a link to his excellent book,
[02:49:28.600 --> 02:49:31.640]   "Back Mechanic, The Step-by-Step McGill Method
[02:49:31.640 --> 02:49:34.760]   to Fix Back Pain," please see the show note caption.
[02:49:34.760 --> 02:49:38.600]   Also in the caption, you'll find a link to backfitpro.com,
[02:49:38.600 --> 02:49:40.400]   which is Dr. McGill's website,
[02:49:40.400 --> 02:49:42.500]   where he has links to specific practitioners
[02:49:42.500 --> 02:49:45.240]   you can work with if you're experiencing back pain.
[02:49:45.240 --> 02:49:47.640]   If you're learning from and/or enjoying this podcast,

[02:50:10.480 --> 02:50:12.040]   for the "Huberman Lab" podcast,
[02:50:12.040 --> 02:50:14.560]   please put those in the comments section on YouTube.
[02:50:14.560 --> 02:50:16.400]   I do read all the comments.
[02:50:16.400 --> 02:50:17.520]   For those of you that haven't heard,
[02:50:17.520 --> 02:50:18.720]   I have a new book coming out.
[02:50:18.720 --> 02:50:20.340]   It's my very first book.
[02:50:20.340 --> 02:50:21.760]   It's entitled "Protocols,
[02:50:21.760 --> 02:50:23.880]   An Operating Manual for the Human Body."
[02:50:23.880 --> 02:50:25.080]   This is a book that I've been working on
[02:50:25.080 --> 02:50:26.220]   for more than five years,
[02:50:26.220 --> 02:50:28.560]   and that's based on more than 30 years
[02:50:28.560 --> 02:50:30.120]   of research and experience.
[02:50:30.120 --> 02:50:33.160]   And it covers protocols for everything from sleep,
[02:50:33.160 --> 02:50:35.640]   to exercise, to stress control,
[02:50:35.640 --> 02:50:38.080]   protocols related to focus and motivation.
[02:50:38.080 --> 02:50:41.480]   And of course, I provide the scientific substantiation
[02:50:41.480 --> 02:50:43.560]   for the protocols that are included.
[02:50:43.560 --> 02:50:47.440]   The book is now available by presale at protocolsbook.com.
[02:50:47.440 --> 02:50:49.800]   There you can find links to various vendors.
[02:50:49.800 --> 02:50:51.600]   You can pick the one that you like best.
[02:50:51.600 --> 02:50:52.520]   Again, the book is called
[02:50:52.520 --> 02:50:55.920]   "Protocols, An Operating Manual for the Human Body."
[02:50:55.920 --> 02:50:58.080]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[02:50:58.080 --> 02:51:00.940]   I am Huberman Lab on all social media channels.
[02:51:00.940 --> 02:51:02.240]   So that's Instagram,
[02:51:02.240 --> 02:51:03.960]   X, formerly known as Twitter,
[02:51:03.960 --> 02:51:06.200]   Threads, LinkedIn, and Facebook.
[02:51:06.200 --> 02:51:07.640]   And on all those platforms,
[02:51:07.640 --> 02:51:09.820]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[02:51:09.820 --> 02:51:11.320]   some of which overlap with the contents
[02:51:11.320 --> 02:51:12.760]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[02:51:12.760 --> 02:51:14.120]   but much of which is distinct
[02:51:14.120 --> 02:51:16.400]   from the contents of the Huberman Lab podcast.
[02:51:16.400 --> 02:51:19.760]   Again, that's Huberman Lab on all social media channels.
[02:51:19.760 --> 02:51:21.000]   If you haven't already subscribed
[02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:23.000]   to our Neural Network newsletter,
[02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:24.400]   our Neural Network newsletter
[02:51:24.400 --> 02:51:26.120]   is a zero-cost monthly newsletter
[02:51:26.120 --> 02:51:27.960]   that includes podcast summaries,
[02:51:27.960 --> 02:51:30.640]   as well as protocols in the form of brief PDFs
[02:51:30.640 --> 02:51:32.020]   of one to three pages,
[02:51:32.020 --> 02:51:33.920]   where I spell out the specific do's,
[02:51:33.920 --> 02:51:35.140]   and in some cases do nots,
[02:51:35.140 --> 02:51:37.120]   but mostly do's related to things like
[02:51:37.120 --> 02:51:38.720]   how to optimize your sleep,
[02:51:38.720 --> 02:51:40.760]   how to regulate your dopamine levels.
[02:51:40.760 --> 02:51:43.720]   There's a protocol for neuroplasticity and learning,
[02:51:43.720 --> 02:51:45.840]   as well as protocols for fitness,
[02:51:45.840 --> 02:51:47.700]   which we call the Foundational Fitness Protocol,
[02:51:47.700 --> 02:51:50.200]   includes everything sets, reps, cardiovascular training.
[02:51:50.200 --> 02:51:52.440]   Again, all available, completely zero cost.
[02:51:52.440 --> 02:51:54.640]   You simply go to HubermanLab.com,
[02:51:54.640 --> 02:51:57.080]   go to the menu tab, scroll down to newsletter,
[02:51:57.080 --> 02:51:58.200]   and provide us your email.
[02:51:58.200 --> 02:51:59.240]   But I should point out,
[02:51:59.240 --> 02:52:01.480]   we do not share your email with anybody.
[02:52:01.480 --> 02:52:04.200]   Thank you once again for joining me for today's discussion
[02:52:04.200 --> 02:52:05.640]   with Dr. Stuart McGill.
[02:52:05.640 --> 02:52:08.120]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:52:08.120 --> 02:52:10.400]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:52:10.400 --> 02:52:12.980]   [upbeat music]
[02:52:12.980 --> 02:52:15.560]   (upbeat music)
