[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.240]   Well, building a ministry around joy in God leads to a lot of good and important questions
[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.760]   that we need to think through.
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:16.560]   Specifically, today, if our ministry centers on joy, then doesn't this invite sort of an
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.720]   emotional roller coaster type of rhythm into our lives?
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.800]   It's a really important question today from an anonymous listener who writes in to ask
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.800]   this.
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.560]   "Pastor John, I struggle with thinking that feelings, feelings of peace, love, and joy
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.440]   are the validation and the thermometer of my relationship with God.
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.160]   Thus, my relationship often feels like a roller coaster.
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.880]   I often feel discouraged and anxious when my heart isn't moved with emotion during my
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.800]   time with God.
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.640]   On the other hand, I am cautious to seek purely emotional highs because I know they can be
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.960]   misleading or even false.
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.600]   Pastor John, what would you say to me?"
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.440]   This question really matters to me because I'm a Christian hedonist.
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:14.600]   I tell people that the affections of the heart matter just as much, even more, than the thoughts
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.920]   of the mind.
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:25.640]   I make the case over and over again that Christian faith, saving faith, is not merely intellectual
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:33.360]   assent to doctrines, but the heart embrace of the truth, of the person who makes the
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.880]   truth true.
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:42.560]   I tell people to devote their lives to pursuing satisfaction in God because God is most glorified
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.480]   in them when they are most satisfied in Him.
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:54.660]   I utterly reject the notion that faith can be neatly separated from feelings like a caboose
[00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:00.040]   at the end of the train can be dropped off with no great loss.
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:08.320]   It's not the way the Bible talks about the Christian faith, as though this train could
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:14.360]   go on chugging down with no love for God burning in the engine.
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.000]   When Jesus Himself said, "Whoever loves mother or father more than me is not worthy of me,"
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.720]   Matthew 10:37.
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:31.600]   I think the effort to distinguish saving faith from feelings of glad dependence and thankful
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:41.480]   trust and heartfelt admiration and pleased submission and contented resting and earnest
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.320]   treasuring, I think that distinction is futile, hopeless.
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:57.120]   You cannot strip all those adjectives—glad, thankful, heartfelt, pleased, contented, earnest—you
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:06.120]   cannot strip all those adjectives from faith and have any saving faith left.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:17.920]   What you have left is what the devil can do, or mere oxymorons like unthankful saving trust.
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:28.000]   In fact, I think the effort to define faith as something devoid of feeling is driven by
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:35.760]   an ancient and very modern belief in the autonomy of the human will that must be in final control
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.380]   of its destiny.
[00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:43.280]   And since everyone knows we can't immediately control our feelings or emotions or affections,
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.620]   you can't make yourself feel thankful.
[00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.840]   You can say the word "thank you," but you can't make yourself feel thankful.
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.080]   It's either there or it's not.
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.160]   You can't make yourself feel pleased or glad.
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:00.560]   Therefore, that view of human nature that says we have to be able to control our own
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:08.320]   destiny, our own salvation, has to say saving faith cannot include things I can't control.
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.020]   I have to be in control.
[00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.920]   But that is simply not what the Bible teaches.
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:21.760]   The Bible requires many things of us which we cannot immediately produce because we are
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.080]   so corrupt and rebellious.
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.400]   And yet we are responsible to produce them because a sinful condition is no excuse for
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.680]   disobedience.
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:38.920]   All that to say that my response to this question is not to make it easy by defining faith separately
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:39.920]   from the emotions.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:45.080]   I mean, I think a lot of people would hear her question and say, "Not a problem.
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.200]   You don't need to let your discouragements go up and down with the rise and fall of your
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.840]   emotions because faith has nothing to do with emotions."
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.080]   That's the way they'd answer.
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:58.560]   Now that may sound now, my approach may sound now to our friend, she didn't give us her
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.800]   name, may sound to her like, "Well, okay, I'm simply stuck then, right?
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:04.800]   Come on, Piper.
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:05.800]   I asked the question for help.
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.120]   I didn't ask for an analysis."
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.440]   When her emotions go up, she says she has assurance, and when her emotions go down,
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:19.760]   she has doubts about her salvation and feels anxious because Piper and who knows what other
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:25.480]   Puritans have taught her that faith is more than mere scent.
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:33.120]   Now I would like to try to provide four ways of looking at our spiritual affections that
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.960]   I think will help her and me.
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:43.680]   They help me bring steadiness to her devotion to Christ and not such volatility or despair.
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:49.520]   Number one, the biblical realism that the saints have always experienced seasons when
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:54.320]   clarity and joy and spiritual sensitivity weaken.
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:06:01.360]   Otherwise, David would not have cried out in Psalm 51, 12, "Restore to me the joy of
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.880]   your salvation and uphold me with a willing spirit."
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:09.160]   Paul would not have come to the end of Romans 7 with the words, "Wretched man that I am,
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.800]   who will deliver me from this body of death?"
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:17.000]   And Jesus would not have taught us to pray every day, "Forgive us our sins."
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.720]   What is sin but the preference of the heart getting the upper hand over our delight in
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.600]   God and His ways?
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:32.760]   And so let's not measure the ups and downs of our affections for Christ as though there
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:36.920]   were a standard of perfection in the Bible.
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.240]   There's not.
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:47.320]   We all struggle with ups and downs, strong affections some day, weak affections the next
[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:48.320]   day.
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.400]   Here's number two.
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:56.520]   Let us make a distinction between the absence of intense joy for Christ or joy in Christ,
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:03.280]   the absence of intense joy in Christ on the one hand and the presence of intense joy in
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.080]   sin on the other.
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.080]   Let's make a distinction.
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:12.360]   It is possible for our spiritual affections to weaken without this being a sign that our
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.020]   carnal affections are triumphant.
[00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:21.480]   Of course, we should be concerned with becoming cool toward Christ because that could lead
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:27.240]   to the shipwreck of our lives where we fail to confirm our calling and election, as 2
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.640]   Peter 1.9 says.
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:36.400]   But we should not assume that the cooling of our affections on any given day is the
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:43.680]   same as the flaming up of insubordinate rebellion against God and His ways.
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:47.060]   It could lead to that, but it need not.
[00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:52.980]   And the very fact that it causes us grief when our affections flag is a good sign they
[00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:56.940]   will restore, they will be restored.
[00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:04.580]   Number three, consider this understanding of the tears of contrition and the tears of
[00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:07.620]   sorrow for joylessness.
[00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:12.940]   I bounced this off of Noel last night as we went out to dinner together, and she was leaving
[00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:20.180]   town today, and I wanted her to hear this because this is my calling up out of thoughts
[00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:22.380]   I had years ago when I wrote Desiring God.
[00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:28.220]   I said things like this, but they were fresh and new to me, and I wanted to see what she
[00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:29.220]   thought.
[00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:30.940]   So here they are now.
[00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:36.020]   Consider this understanding of the tears of contrition because I'm hearing in our friend's
[00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:39.860]   question that when her joys go down, she feels bad.
[00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:40.860]   She feels miserable.
[00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:41.860]   She wants to cry.
[00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:43.980]   She's just, "I want to have joy.
[00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:48.580]   I want to read my Bible with gladness and happiness and thankfulness and strength, and
[00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:50.100]   I don't."
[00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:52.300]   So that's what I'm talking about.
[00:08:52.300 --> 00:09:03.900]   Are not the tears of contrition the fruit of languishing joy in Christ, impeded by weariness
[00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:06.220]   or weakness or sin?
[00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:13.980]   In other words, when joy fades and you feel sorrowful and contrite, brokenhearted because
[00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:23.140]   of this fading joy that you should have in Christ, is not the feeling of sorrow and the
[00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:32.420]   feeling of regret and the feeling of contrition, are not those painful feelings evidence of
[00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:39.900]   the fact that your soul is the kind of soul that has a taste for the goodness of God,
[00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:43.660]   the sweetness of God in Jesus?
[00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:48.660]   And is not this taste a sign of your regeneration?
[00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:58.260]   Indeed, isn't this taste the very presence of what we might call the remaining aftertaste
[00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:02.860]   of joy in the absence of its full expression?
[00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:13.740]   If so, I would argue that the tears of contrition, the tears of sorrow for joylessness, are the
[00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:24.300]   tears of joy hindered by some physical condition or some weakness or some sin, hindered, and
[00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:30.780]   thus these tears are evidence that we are born of God.
[00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:40.940]   Our soul has been made into the kind of soul that will never be satisfied apart from God,
[00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:50.300]   and even when joy has gone away, there is an aftertaste of joy that is weeping, and
[00:10:50.300 --> 00:11:00.900]   the weeping is the aftertaste of joy, giving evidence that our soul is the kind of soul
[00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:02.860]   that will have joy forever.
[00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:06.660]   Here's the fourth and last thing briefly.
[00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:11.340]   I would simply point to Paul's teaching about the witness of the Holy Spirit.
[00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:16.460]   The Spirit bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God, and to be sure,
[00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:23.420]   the Holy Spirit uses evidence and means in His act of witnessing to our true adoption,
[00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:32.180]   but in the end, assurance that we are the children of God is a gift of God, God the
[00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:33.500]   Holy Spirit.
[00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:40.740]   So when all is said and done, and we have reflected on as many wonderful biblical realities
[00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:48.860]   as we can, and we have cried out with David for the restoration of our joy, our biblical
[00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:58.540]   lot is to wait for the Lord, not to despair, not to dictate to God how long He will be
[00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:06.100]   concealed, not to become angry, and not to take our eyes off Christ in His Word, but
[00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:13.900]   to wait, weeping may tarry for the night, but joy comes in the morning.
[00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:14.900]   Amen.
[00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:16.500]   Pastor John, thank you for that response.
[00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:18.900]   Thank you for the question that was sent in.
[00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:23.620]   We love getting questions about Christian hedonism, the idea that it's really at the
[00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:31.620]   core of what we do that God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him.
[00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:35.000]   And the profundity of that statement leads to a lot of questions that have to be answered
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.220]   and worked through, which is what we're here for.
