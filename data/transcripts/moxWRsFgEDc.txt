[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.480]   Hey guys, today I wanna talk to you about something
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.520]   that's kind of near and dear to my heart
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.560]   and that's the topic of struggle and failure.
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.560]   My struggle ranged from self-doubt, self-confidence issues.
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.860]   There was issues with the market,
[00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.280]   job market was just terrible.
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.920]   It was just kind of mirroring
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.440]   what we're experiencing now in 2023.
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.800]   I've had managers that were very demeaning
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.240]   and very combative and all these things broke me down.
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.680]   And I wanna talk about like,
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.260]   what was I thinking or dealing with at the time?
[00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.880]   And then on a flip side, if I had mentorship,
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.280]   what advice would have been helpful at the time?
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.120]   I wanna be just transparent with you today.
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.240]   I wanna walk you through everything I'm experiencing
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.960]   and hopefully some of this will be helpful for you.
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.720]   I got a job at a company called Design Reactor
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.120]   and I was a project manager.
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.840]   This is an example where I stepped into something
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.840]   that I had no idea, I had no experience
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.240]   around ad agencies or creative agencies,
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.840]   digital marketing, I knew none of that.
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.400]   Then I started realizing, oh, you know,
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.040]   like I had good communication skills,
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.020]   which I didn't know how to put on resumes in the past,
[00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.740]   but now it's actually turning into relationship building
[00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.640]   and I'm starting to build good rapport with clients
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.400]   and started to find a sweet spot.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.240]   You know, this, hey, this digital marketing thing,
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.540]   web marketing, hey, it's pretty, pretty cool.
[00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.400]   And then I decided to take a swing and bet on myself
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.440]   and I transitioned to another agency.
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.480]   That's where I really started to experience the struggle.
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.240]   Have you ever stepped into a situation before
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.200]   where you always feel like the outsider?
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.840]   Like you're not a part of the OG crew.
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.400]   And so people don't intend to treat you differently,
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.440]   but especially from the leadership team,
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.300]   I always felt like I was never fully welcomed in.
[00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.480]   I always struggled with wanting to belong
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.300]   and trying to earn my place and not,
[00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.920]   unable to break into some of the groups
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.600]   made it kind of difficult.
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.320]   And the nature of my job at the time
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.880]   was it was account management,
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.480]   meaning I was both creating new business
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.320]   as well as project managing my own work.
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.360]   And the cycle that started becoming difficult
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.880]   was the more successful I was at bringing more business,
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.800]   the more work I added to my own plate
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.120]   'cause I didn't manage that.
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.520]   You know, if I had a mentor at the time,
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.500]   they probably would advise me to raise my hand
[00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.160]   and articulate things more clearly
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.400]   around how to ask for resources
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.880]   like getting my own project manager, for example.
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:48.880]   But I didn't have that guidance.
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.680]   So I just struggled with internally
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.000]   and I worked crazy hours.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.960]   I think I was averaging like 60 hour weeks
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.640]   and then it started impacting my work.
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.520]   The general manager came back
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.000]   and I started feeling from that moment on
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.600]   that I was undermined at every corner.
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.760]   Now, some of that I will agree and admit
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.120]   that it was probably just between my ears.
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.240]   You know, but again, I didn't have a mentor
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.840]   to help me understand that I'm not necessarily
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.760]   just a victim of my situation,
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.200]   but some of it is self-created.
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.480]   However, the mentor could have also helped me understand
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.240]   which parts I was legitimately a victim
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.280]   and I didn't know how to deal with that.
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.560]   So I feel like my manager at the time was sabotaging me.
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.560]   And then my manager would pull me aside often
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.440]   with comments that were unfair in nature.
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.720]   It's not like your tough love kind of a thing.
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.760]   It was really the language and vocabulary she used
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.520]   was demeaning.
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.400]   It felt very unfair.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.400]   And she used words that made me question
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.280]   why I was even employed.
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.960]   And it got to the point where I was listening
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.960]   to self-help books, tapes at that time,
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.080]   on the way to work.
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.640]   And I would always have the anxiety that built up
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.840]   'cause like anxiety stepping into the office
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.160]   was it just triggered whenever I saw this individual.
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.480]   And I had to listen to these self-help tapes
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.840]   for about 15 minutes in the car
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.720]   before I walked out the office.
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.000]   I went in, did my 10, 12 hour day,
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.320]   came back broken.
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.720]   And I sat in the parking lot every day in the car,
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.960]   listening to the self-help tapes again before I went home
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.400]   because I didn't want to take that
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.760]   and unfairly project frustrations onto my then girlfriend.
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.480]   And it was just a really dark time.
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.840]   I really, really struggled.
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.600]   And she ended up letting me go.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.560]   The sin of mine, I was at that point,
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.400]   was I thought I was a good project manager.
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.640]   I'm not.
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.080]   I thought I was good at building relationships.
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.360]   I can't.
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.280]   I thought I knew web marketing.
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.520]   I don't.
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.560]   I thought I could manage a cross-functional team
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.000]   of designers and developers.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.840]   No, you can't.
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.840]   And so I, but that was like my living.
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.520]   Like digital marketing was a thing I chose to do.
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:26.600]   And I didn't know how to pivot.
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.200]   I didn't know if I should pivot.
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.640]   And so I went through a period of unemployment.
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.640]   I had the stress of needing to pay a mortgage.
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.800]   So I was trying to rent out my rooms,
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.200]   claiming unemployment and just doing all these odds and ends
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.520]   to just try to make it meet.
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.080]   And as a matter of fact, to this day,
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.280]   I can't eat oatmeal anymore
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.000]   because that's what I ate straight
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.600]   for like probably like five or six months.
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:55.600]   I just ate oatmeal with either salt or sugar
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.320]   because adding toppings costs money.
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.080]   And I didn't want to buy dried fruits
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.280]   'cause that could be $4.
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.360]   And that's $4 I might need for something else.
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.880]   And so I was living as bare minimum as I could,
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.240]   just barely scraping by.
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.280]   I then took a lot of contract work
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.480]   in the digital marketing space.
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.640]   And then I landed a contractor role at Logitech.
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.600]   And it was there that I started kind of rediscovering
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.800]   my love for digital again.
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.600]   But then I was converted to full-time.
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.440]   And it was great.
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.240]   And I was like, I love Logitech.
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.080]   I love the product.
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.760]   And this was fantastic.
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.160]   And that's where the nature of the relationship
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.240]   started to kind of rub a little strange.
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.520]   My manager brought on another manager to manage me.
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.160]   I thought my previous manager
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.720]   was the most difficult I've ever had.
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:47.320]   This one, she was probably the worst up to that point.
[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:52.320]   If I had a mentor, those discussions would have been around
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.960]   how do you understand my manager
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.120]   and how to manage my manager, all that kind of stuff.
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.640]   But I didn't have any of that.
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.440]   And so all I could deal with was what was in front of me.
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.840]   And the leadership style of this manager,
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.760]   and I was her only direct report.
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.240]   And I'm not sure if this is her first time
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.240]   managing or whatnot,
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.720]   but it was a very confrontational nature.
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:20.720]   And in an effort to maybe exert or exercise her authority,
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.600]   like my previous manager,
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:29.200]   she chose to use her vocabulary to do that.
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:34.200]   And there were times where we would have our one-on-one
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:38.600]   in the cafe and there's plenty of people around
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.200]   and she would raise her voice
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.360]   and yell at me and berate me in front of people.
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.440]   She would call me an idiot.
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.440]   She would say like, what the F are you doing?
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.120]   Like, this is unacceptable.
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:48.960]   And quite frankly,
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.720]   and some of the things that she's bringing up
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:54.000]   like has nothing to do with me.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.200]   And so I'm processing all of these things.
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.720]   And I'm like, I'm trying to help her understand that,
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.840]   hey, like what you're talking about isn't necessarily me
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:02.840]   or there are maybe some dependencies
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:05.400]   that cause things to maybe not line up
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.400]   that maybe you as a manager can help me off
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:08.240]   kind of figure out.
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:13.240]   But the response was always me being the failure.
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:17.160]   So again, if I had a mentor at the time
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:23.560]   helping my manager understand how to fix some things
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:27.400]   to set her up to manage the issues,
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:28.800]   well, probably would have been good,
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.280]   but I didn't have any of that.
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:34.520]   That was a brutal year where like the previous one,
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:36.760]   I just started questioning everything.
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:40.800]   And I broke down several times,
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:42.780]   those self-help tapes came back out.
[00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:47.480]   But that's when I decided to make a stand.
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.240]   I was like, you know what?
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.180]   I know I'm doing good work.
[00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:59.480]   Regardless of what my manager is saying to her manager,
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.040]   I know I'm delivering.
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:04.320]   And as a project manager, I'm building good schedules.
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.980]   I'm holding people to it.
[00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:09.760]   The political stuff I have no influence over,
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:13.160]   but I was doing a kick-ass job.
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.400]   As a matter of fact, the people around me
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:17.600]   knew I was doing good work.
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.000]   So I made a decision at that point.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:19.880]   I was like, you know what?
[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:24.880]   Okay, I can't control how my manager is gonna manage me.
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:30.760]   What I can control is my work.
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:34.160]   So I made a decision to just work hard.
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.760]   And I looked at all my work,
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:38.440]   figure out like, hey, how can I do something better?
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.220]   How can I do it more efficiently?
[00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:43.480]   And I decided to just let my work speak for itself.
[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.000]   There's gonna be an intersection
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.280]   where someone's gonna question the validity
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:49.340]   of everything that I do.
[00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:51.360]   And I want my proof to be there.
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.360]   So I did that.
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:57.520]   And eventually that won out.
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:59.280]   I don't know the politics or decisions
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:01.980]   around her departing the company,
[00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:06.980]   but I remained.
[00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:07.820]   Now this individual,
[00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:09.520]   now she has since reached out and apologized.
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:12.200]   So I'm very appreciative of that.
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:16.200]   And I think there's a lesson there around self-awareness.
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.520]   If you know that you've done something in the past
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:22.980]   to someone that may not have been the right thing,
[00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:26.120]   and you're wondering if you should go back
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:30.680]   and talk to them, you probably should.
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:33.200]   Because there is a door in their heart
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:36.120]   that they want to close and resolve.
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.880]   And you may be the only one who has the key
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:42.300]   to open that door or help them close it and lock it.
[00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:44.340]   She and I, we're not friends.
[00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:45.560]   I don't talk to her regularly,
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:50.040]   but when I think about her, I don't have anxiety.
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:53.760]   When I think about the two managers prior,
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:55.840]   when I think about her, I still have anxiety.
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:59.440]   And so that is always going to be there,
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.840]   regardless of how many therapists I talk to,
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:04.560]   until one day I somehow maybe reach out to her
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:05.880]   and talk about it.
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:12.120]   But from there on, the idea of taking control
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:17.120]   of what I have started laying the groundwork to success.
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.320]   There was interest to bring me over
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.000]   to the B2B side of the business.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.880]   And so I did that, and that's when I started to grow.
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:28.080]   I learned that, hey, I can own something
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:33.080]   from strategy to execution and own it soup to nuts
[00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:37.680]   and be my own GM of a web entity.
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:41.240]   And that was the first time where I discovered,
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:45.680]   hey, I can do this thing, like I have value.
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:49.840]   And it was a lean team, and it was a fun,
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.920]   fun time in my career at Logitech.
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.960]   And it was great, we built great relationships.
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:57.880]   I think that was the jumping off point
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:02.480]   where my career went from just absolute struggle
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:06.200]   and feeling like I'm a failure to myself constantly
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:09.820]   and shifting the dialogue to, hey, I've got value.
[00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:14.100]   From there, I went on to NetApp, to LinkedIn,
[00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:18.980]   and LinkedIn became the most transformative experience
[00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:20.580]   in my career.
[00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:22.020]   People talk about empathy.
[00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:24.260]   Up to that point, empathy, compassion,
[00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.180]   it felt like a loosey-goosey topic, you know?
[00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:30.500]   Like, it's like, how do you measure that?
[00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:33.700]   Well, LinkedIn operationalized that.
[00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:37.580]   And they took something like compassion,
[00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:40.580]   and they preached it 'til the sun went down.
[00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:44.020]   And from an ESG point of view where,
[00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:46.940]   not even just ESG, but like internal poll surveys
[00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:50.960]   where they looked at employee satisfaction
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:53.380]   and grading leadership, whatever,
[00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:54.700]   it was all very transparent.
[00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:57.380]   And compassion and relationship building
[00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:59.300]   was part of those scores.
[00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:02.360]   And it was the first time I saw a organization
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.300]   from the top all the way down.
[00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.020]   So it was Jeff Weiner at the time,
[00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:09.420]   preaching compassion and empathy constantly.
[00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:12.660]   Hold leadership accountable to that.
[00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:14.600]   That was very cool.
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.900]   Now, I will say, though,
[00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:20.460]   that my first year on the job was a struggle again,
[00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:23.020]   'cause it was a different kind of struggle.
[00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:27.660]   Imposter syndrome became the thing for me that first year.
[00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:30.340]   In my interview, the senior leadership
[00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:34.580]   would ask me questions that were very much in the weeds,
[00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:36.920]   meaning they understood it fundamentally.
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:39.140]   And I was like, wow.
[00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:43.140]   Like, I kind of feel like everyone can kind of do my job.
[00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:44.260]   (laughs)
[00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.780]   And then, I know, I got selected,
[00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:50.380]   and I was like so happy.
[00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:55.380]   And that first year, I was like surrounded by people
[00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:57.500]   that I was just amazed at how intelligent they were.
[00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:01.740]   It's like, this is the cream of the cream of the crop.
[00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:03.540]   And then I started feeling, it's like,
[00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:04.960]   oh man, do I belong here?
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:09.300]   And then, imposter syndrome crept in,
[00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:10.900]   because my manager at the time,
[00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:13.820]   who, his name was Blake.
[00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:16.140]   I love Blake, he's fantastic.
[00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:20.220]   He provided me one piece of really hard feedback
[00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:21.940]   that I really struggled with.
[00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:24.620]   And it was, not to use his words,
[00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:29.080]   but the idea was, we hired you
[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:33.100]   because you are supposed to be good at everything.
[00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:39.100]   Strategy, analytics, UX, design,
[00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:41.260]   knowing development.
[00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.160]   You're supposed to lead us from end to end.
[00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:47.860]   However, my ability to provide good analytics,
[00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:49.620]   I was falling far short.
[00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:53.900]   If I had a mentor, which I didn't yet at the point,
[00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:55.220]   they would have helped me realize
[00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:57.660]   that that was absolutely true.
[00:14:57.660 --> 00:14:59.540]   Like, up to that point in my career,
[00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:02.300]   I had always been the recipient of analytics.
[00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:03.660]   So someone who'd pull the data.
[00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:07.020]   Now, understanding the data and mining it for insights
[00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:08.500]   was something that I had experience with,
[00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:10.860]   but pulling my own data?
[00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:12.780]   I had never had to do that.
[00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:15.100]   But now I have to go through BA tools,
[00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:16.580]   I had to go through Google Analytics,
[00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:19.500]   I had to go through Tableau, I had to go through SFDC.
[00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:21.580]   I've never done any of those before.
[00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:26.580]   And my fear is always, if I pull the data wrong,
[00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:29.640]   or I'm looking at it the wrong way,
[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:32.140]   then all the conclusions I get out of that
[00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:33.700]   will be wrong.
[00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:36.460]   If I pull the information in a way that's different
[00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:39.000]   than how anyone else is pulling the data,
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.860]   and they're all pulling it the same way, let's say,
[00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:43.660]   they're gonna say my data is biased.
[00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:47.140]   And there were a lot of presentations where I did
[00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:49.820]   where I would show so much data,
[00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:52.460]   and maybe I would share an insight or takeaway on,
[00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:53.700]   let's say, slide two.
[00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:55.340]   And I would go all the way to slide 10,
[00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:56.780]   and then someone would be like,
[00:15:56.780 --> 00:16:01.300]   "Hey, you said something seven slides ago,
[00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:02.980]   "or however many."
[00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:05.440]   And these conclusions kind of conflict with each other,
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:06.500]   don't they?
[00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:08.540]   And I'd be like, "How did you see that?"
[00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:10.580]   'Cause those weren't even maybe,
[00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:12.420]   maybe some of them were like tertiary points,
[00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:13.260]   and they're just seeing these stuff.
[00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.520]   So again, I'm like, "Oh my God,
[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:18.280]   "I don't think I should be here anymore.
[00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:19.340]   "I don't feel qualified."
[00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:23.900]   And that imposter syndrome started creeping
[00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:26.180]   into all the areas of my work.
[00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:28.280]   And so it started with analytics,
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:30.780]   then it went to web strategy,
[00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:31.620]   it went to everything.
[00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:33.340]   Now I feel like, "Oh my gosh."
[00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:34.540]   I started having anxiety attacks.
[00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:37.700]   It's like, "I don't know if I even deserve to be here."
[00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:40.740]   And I was at my lowest point,
[00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:43.680]   I would say, emotionally at LinkedIn,
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:45.620]   when I had a change of managers.
[00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:49.160]   And this is when the game changed for me.
[00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:54.460]   Because now he was an individual
[00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:57.900]   who was a lot more empathetic and understanding.
[00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:00.300]   He was actually experiencing some of this
[00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:01.140]   for the first time.
[00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:04.820]   He came from product marketing,
[00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:09.260]   and now he is doing digital and growth marketing.
[00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:10.820]   Now it's all new to him.
[00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:15.060]   And so we were kind of figuring this out,
[00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:16.820]   and his name, by the way, is RJ Fox.
[00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:20.100]   And RJ is probably one of the best managers
[00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:22.180]   I've ever had in my entire career.
[00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:24.180]   And I owe a lot of things to him.
[00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:26.300]   Because his approach was,
[00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:28.540]   "We're all figuring this thing out together."
[00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:30.660]   And at that point, his team was really small.
[00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:35.340]   It was just me and two others in the band, Jen.
[00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:37.940]   And he's like, "Look, help me get smart.
[00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:39.100]   "Help me figure this thing out."
[00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:42.820]   And it allowed me to reopen my box of expertise
[00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:45.420]   and say, "Hey, look, here's how I'm looking at things."
[00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:47.500]   And I took a leap of faith there.
[00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:49.100]   And this is kind of a lesson to learn
[00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:50.900]   for all of you guys around being transparent
[00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:51.800]   with your manager.
[00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:56.580]   I said, "Hey, look, here's what I believe
[00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:58.700]   "the strategy should be for the website.
[00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:02.900]   "Here is what I am doing really well."
[00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:06.020]   And to be transparent, here are things I'm struggling with.
[00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:08.260]   And I had a really open dialogue,
[00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.740]   and it kind of helped me understand,
[00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:13.460]   I'm struggling with it, but here's my approach.
[00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:15.900]   'Cause again, when you're managing your manager,
[00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:18.060]   one of the most important things for them to understand
[00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:20.540]   is how you arrive at a conclusion,
[00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:23.940]   or your thought process, or how you work things out.
[00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:26.220]   'Cause that is shapeable.
[00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:29.220]   It's more about the process and not the outcome.
[00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:30.780]   And so I talked to him and said,
[00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:33.260]   "Hey, look, I'm really struggling
[00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:36.020]   "with building data together in a way that makes sense.
[00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:39.820]   "And my dashboards have fallen flat with Blake,
[00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:42.580]   "and I'm trying to figure out how do I do this."
[00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:44.660]   And then I asked the one question
[00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:47.660]   that changed the game for me,
[00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:52.300]   which is, "RJ, what is it that you're looking for?"
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:57.920]   And it's an important question 'cause it changes the lens
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:59.960]   where now I'm trying to understand
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:03.060]   what my manager is trying to solve for,
[00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:07.320]   and then I'll do my work in a way that can build into that.
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:08.580]   I ask a lot of questions on like,
[00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:10.820]   "Hey, what's important to you?"
[00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:13.280]   He'll say something like, "Well, what does that mean?"
[00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:16.680]   He'll answer that, "Okay, well, then what does that mean?"
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:17.720]   He'll explain that.
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:18.720]   So, "Okay, cool, if we did that,
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:21.200]   "then what does success then look like?"
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.200]   And we'll talk about that.
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:25.400]   And then say, "Okay, cool, then here are the top 10 things
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:27.700]   "I'm working on that I believe support that.
[00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:29.400]   "Do you agree that the priorities
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:30.620]   "are aligned to achieve that?
[00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:33.240]   "And here's my own personal assessment."
[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:35.000]   And we'll kind of work through that.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.160]   At the end, I walk away with a plan
[00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:41.840]   that I know supports his strategy and his objective.
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:42.820]   It was around that time
[00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:45.080]   that I started having RJ as my mentor.
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:47.160]   And I remember early on,
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:50.480]   he gave me the first great piece of advice
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:53.560]   when he knew I was wrestling with imposter syndrome.
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:58.560]   "You were hired because we saw value
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:00.000]   "in what's between your ears.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.800]   "We hired you because you knew how to do your job
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:05.900]   "and we can't.
[00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:08.380]   "The only person who's telling you
[00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:11.280]   "that you can't do your job is you."
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:17.760]   Oh, that was so impactful.
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:21.880]   'Cause it changed my perception of everything.
[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:24.780]   And if the problem is coming from me,
[00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:26.320]   I can control that.
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:29.000]   I can fix that, you know?
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.020]   And if I can separate my emotions
[00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:34.580]   from objectively what is going on,
[00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:37.660]   I can impact that and improve my emotions.
[00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:41.480]   And so that feedback changed everything.
[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:44.120]   Now, I will say imposter syndrome
[00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:46.460]   is something that always exists.
[00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:50.720]   Doesn't matter if it's in your personal life or at work,
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:52.160]   there's always gonna be something
[00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:54.440]   that you feel like you see someone else doing
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:55.800]   that you feel like, oh man,
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:58.600]   they're doing so much better,
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.480]   or maybe I should do differently.
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:03.040]   But coming back and reminding yourself
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:05.880]   that, hey, you have value.
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:08.280]   It's important.
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:09.800]   If I were to go back in my career,
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:11.960]   what I would have told myself was,
[00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:16.800]   "Hey, don't worry that you don't have the experience
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:19.100]   "right now to qualify for this job.
[00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:25.820]   "Dig deep, don't be afraid to take any job you can.
[00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:31.760]   "Take those jobs and know what you wanna learn from it
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:33.720]   "so no job is ever beneath you."
[00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:38.280]   Doesn't matter if you're a content entry, barista,
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:41.840]   lead strategist, VP, doesn't matter.
[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:45.400]   Go into that job knowing what you wanna get out of it.
[00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:49.040]   And that experience will always be valuable.
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:52.160]   Your experience that you need for these jobs,
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:53.400]   it will catch up to you.
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:57.200]   And it'll catch up to you at the right point
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:00.280]   where you're able to package it in a way
[00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:04.200]   to describe the context of why you're relevant
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:07.520]   for a job position, and that'll separate you.
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:09.980]   These days when I do interviews,
[00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:14.120]   my conversation looks a lot different now.
[00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:15.880]   I used to go in and say, "Hey, look,
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:18.320]   "here's your checklist of things that you're looking for.
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:20.680]   "Here's my checklist of things that I can do.
[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:22.960]   "Let me tell you about how they kinda get together."
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:24.160]   It's like, no.
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:28.200]   My conversations now look something like this.
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:31.380]   We can absolutely talk about how the dots connect,
[00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:33.680]   and we probably should, and I'll come equipped
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:37.360]   with examples of things I've had to overcome,
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:38.960]   whether it's a success or a failure.
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:40.860]   Talking about failures is totally fine.
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:44.760]   But let me tell you a little more about how I'm wired
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:46.480]   and how I process these things
[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:49.920]   as I'm going through success or failures,
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:55.920]   how I'm thinking about the journey and how I'm solving it.
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:57.640]   Let me tell you about that.
[00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:00.520]   And let me tell you about why things like compassion
[00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:03.680]   are so important to me and how that influences
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:06.560]   how I relate to my coworkers,
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:09.120]   to my direct reports, to my peers.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.580]   If that's something that you want in your organization,
[00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:13.420]   let's go.
[00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:17.480]   If it's not, then you might have given me some insight
[00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:19.440]   about a company that I don't want to work for.
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:24.440]   'Cause if transparency, honesty, being genuine,
[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:27.960]   and having compassion and empathy,
[00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:30.400]   if you're not able to show me that the company
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:33.480]   actually values those things based on what I'm sharing,
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:36.160]   maybe that's not the right company for me.
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:38.660]   And now the interview becomes truly two-way
[00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:40.680]   where you're interviewing them
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:42.920]   as much as they're interviewing you.
[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:45.280]   So it just kind of leads me to where I am today.
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:48.080]   After all these years,
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:51.720]   I no longer kind of question what I bring to the table.
[00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:54.560]   If someone gives me a critique,
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:57.720]   there's always a nugget of truth behind a critique,
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:00.080]   even if the package is terrible.
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:03.640]   And so I'm at a point now where I try to figure out
[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:05.840]   the truth in every single piece of feedback,
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:08.060]   both positive and negative.
[00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:11.940]   And that's my baseline for how I improve.
[00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:13.820]   I no longer let that drag me down.
[00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:16.580]   Now, that's not to say I'm not human
[00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:17.580]   and I don't get emotional.
[00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:19.420]   Absolutely, when you receive tough feedback,
[00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:21.140]   it's, you gotta deal with that.
[00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:22.920]   And sometimes you need to go for a run
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:24.900]   or maybe sometimes you just need to talk to somebody.
[00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:28.660]   But I think the way I process these things now,
[00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:31.780]   thanks to mentors I have in my life now
[00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:34.220]   or close people that I use as a sounding board,
[00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:35.960]   that has been really, really helpful.
[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:40.520]   And if I can provide one piece of advice to you
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:41.760]   watching this,
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:46.760]   don't find your mentor solely based on job title.
[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:49.100]   Find one based on life experience,
[00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:51.160]   meaning your mentor doesn't have to be
[00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:53.320]   in your line of business or work.
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:55.180]   It could be someone whose life experience
[00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:56.400]   took them somewhere
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:00.560]   and how they solve something is what gives you value.
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:03.680]   Cool, so I hope this was helpful for you guys.
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:06.420]   I just wanna leave you with a thought.
[00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:10.120]   You are valuable, you are.
[00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:16.040]   And you have experience regardless of how old you are.
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.560]   You have life experience.
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:20.500]   And all of that will build you
[00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:24.040]   and continue to build you into the person who you are now
[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:26.160]   and who you're going to be.
[00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:29.400]   You're valuable, you bring something to the table.
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:30.840]   You're amazing.
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:32.860]   Don't be afraid to take risks.
[00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:35.600]   Don't be afraid to bet on yourself.
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:37.800]   'Cause when you know what, you're awesome.
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:40.600]   And if you don't know it already, you'll discover that.
[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:43.180]   (upbeat music)
[00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:53.180]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
