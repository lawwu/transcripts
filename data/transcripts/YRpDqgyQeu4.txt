[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.860]   You don't need to be a millionaire to live a rich life, at least not according to my guest today,
[00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.260]   Ramit Sethi. In this episode, we'll go way beyond budgeting tips and tackle the deeper
[00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.040]   mindset shifts needed to spend with purpose. Whether it's flying business class, buying a
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.040]   sweater you love, or saying yes to a vacation without overthinking it, this conversation is
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:24.720]   about using your money to create joy. As Ramit says, just spending more money is not always the
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:31.160]   best option. Spending money meaningfully for your rich life is really what we're talking about here.
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.780]   So today we're going to lay out a tactical four-number framework, explain how to ditch frugality
[00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.960]   guilt, and show you how to start spending meaningfully. So whether you're in debt or you
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.980]   have money to spare, this conversation will help you design a life you actually want to live with
[00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.260]   intention. I'm Chris Hutchins. If you enjoy this episode, please share it with a friend or leave a

[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.400]   Ramit, how much money do you think someone actually needs to start living a rich life?
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.240]   How much weight do you need to be able to push in order to be healthy? It's kind of a similar
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:11.840]   question. You can live a rich life if you have $150,000 of student loans. You can live a rich life
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:19.120]   if you have $25,000 of credit card debt. You can live a rich life if you make $40,000 a year
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:26.940]   or $450,000 a year. The income matters, of course. It's much easier to live a rich life if you're
[00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:37.180]   making a lot of money. But just having a number alone does not do it. I know a lot of millionaires,
[00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.680]   I speak to them on my podcast sometimes, and they are wracked with anxiety and guilt and worry. So it's
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:49.480]   not just a number. It's really about a worldview, a way of looking at the world and realizing money is
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:54.300]   supposed to be joyful, not just guilt inducing. So then I guess let's rephrase that. How would you
[00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.580]   define living a rich life? Well, a rich life can be picking your kids up from school every afternoon.
[00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:06.940]   It can be taking a six month vacation or traveling two months a year. It can be buying a beautiful sweater
[00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.780]   because you just love it. But your rich life is yours. So each person listening to this is probably
[00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.960]   going to have something very different. I'll just give you some specifics from my own rich life.
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.040]   Every time I eat out, I have created a rule for myself. I want to be able to order appetizers
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.560]   because as a kid, I couldn't, we couldn't afford it. And if I'm eating out with coworkers or something
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.780]   like that, I'm always saying, whatever you see on the menu, order it. Don't even think twice. You see
[00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.820]   three things you like, get them all because that was totally abundant to me as a kid. We never could
[00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:43.040]   do it. So that's like a smaller part of my rich life is like the 10 or $15 appetizer. And then
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.620]   there's the big stuff. It's being able to work with people I like and respect. It's flying business class
[00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:54.340]   on any flight over four hours. It's those kinds of things that are meaningful to me, which might be
[00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.860]   very different for somebody else. For someone who hasn't gone through any exercise to even think about
[00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.320]   that, how do you encourage them to figure out what their rich life would look like?
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.760]   I always like to ask people what they love to spend money on. I just love it because like,
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.260]   look at your face right now. Everybody lights up. They always have an immediate answer. The most common
[00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.040]   answer is travel. And that's what I call a money dial. It's something you can turn up or turn down.
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:25.360]   We have eating out or food is a big one. Mine happens to be convenience. I love to spend money on
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.740]   things that make my life convenient. And then there's a whole other list of money dials. So
[00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:36.260]   you can just see people's eyes light up. And then I ask them, what if you could quadruple your spending
[00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.600]   on it? People get kind of uncomfortable. They get stuck. They go, oh, I would eat out at Chipotle four
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.760]   times a week, blah, blah, blah. I go, are you sure you'd still eat at Chipotle? You wouldn't maybe invite
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.360]   somebody out and pay for their bill? And they're like, oh yeah, actually I would love to do that.
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.980]   So I start to show them how money can be multidimensional. It's not just doing more of
[00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:01.060]   the same thing. The whole point of this is to get people to realize that money is not something you
[00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:07.640]   just worry about. It's also not something that you try to minimize as much as possible. The hyper
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:14.100]   frugality world loves to look at cost only. How much does it cost? How much does it cost? That cost too
[00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:19.340]   much. I could get a 20% cheaper. I'm like, get a life. There's more to life than just saving money on $3
[00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:25.760]   expenses. There's also sometimes where you spend a lot of money because you just want to,
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.120]   because you want to create a magical experience for your kids, because you know that you're going
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.500]   to go to a restaurant where it's quiet enough that you can talk to your wife or your husband or your
[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.040]   parents. And you know that there's not going to be people partying next to you doing tequila shots.
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:44.120]   There's so many different reasons to spend more money. And of course, sometimes there are reasons to
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.880]   spend less. Now, I imagine you're talking to a random couple, random person, and they're like,
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.880]   oh, great. That's what it would look like if I really spent all this money. But not everyone should
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.760]   just go and spend a lot more money. So how does someone start to implement that rich life without
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.940]   throwing their finances into shambles?
[00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:07.320]   It's an interesting question you ask because first of all, in the frugality world, there's this very
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:14.120]   pervasive concept of, I don't need to spend a lot of money on fancy stuff. I don't need fancy wine.
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:20.720]   I don't need fancy trips. I'm perfectly content here. And at the heart of that belief, which is
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:28.920]   almost always said in a sort of vaguely superior way, is fear. The fear that if I eat out at a nice
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:34.940]   restaurant once, that I'm going to trip and fall and eat there every single day for the rest of my
[00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.880]   life. That if I go on a nice trip once, that now I have to only stay at a Four Seasons resort every
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:45.640]   single time I travel. No, you don't. I trust myself enough to spend good money on say an anniversary
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:52.760]   dinner once a year. And then most of the time I'm eating normal stuff. So I want people to know that
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:59.440]   you can begin to trust yourself to spend extravagantly on a few key things and cut costs
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:04.460]   mercilessly elsewhere. How do you do it? You got to know your four numbers. You got to know your fixed
[00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:09.180]   costs, your savings rate, your investment rate, and your guilt-free spending number. Those four key numbers,
[00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:12.920]   you need to know them like the back of your hand. You don't need to know how much yams cost at the
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.720]   grocery store. It's a complete waste of time. You don't need to track every single entry you make in
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:22.080]   some thing, some app. You don't even need apps on your phone. That's a waste of time as well. I have
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.680]   no financial apps on my phone. It's a waste. I have four key numbers. I know them like the back of my
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:33.040]   hand, and I am always confident about those numbers. In other words, you need to focus on the big wins in
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:39.500]   life. And if you get those right, then the price of a Topo Chico does not affect you in any way.
[00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.820]   Okay. So fixed costs seems maybe the most straightforward. Is that fair? You could look
[00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.620]   at the things you spend money on, and they're probably big ticket things.
[00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:50.540]   I'll go through them quickly. So the first category, fixed costs, that number ideally should
[00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:57.440]   be 50 to 60% of your take-home pay. That's after tax. So in fixed costs would be your rent or mortgage,
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:03.900]   your utilities, groceries, car payment, debt payments, all the stuff you need to keep the
[00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:09.080]   lights on every month. The stuff that even if one of you got laid off, you would still pay it. Childcare.
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:16.500]   Those are all fixed costs. The next one is savings. This is like money for an emergency fund,
[00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:22.600]   or even a trip you're going to take two years from now. 5 to 10% is a good range. Obviously,
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:27.600]   the more the better. Great. Once you hit your emergency fund, you could probably cut that number
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:33.360]   down a bit. Investments. This is where the real wealth is created. 5 to 10% of take-home pay,
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:37.760]   although the more the better, and I really mean that. It's a little ironic that we spend our entire
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:42.280]   life trying to find a discount at Taco Bell. Meanwhile, we don't spend any time talking about
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:48.620]   this one number, which literally can be worth millions of dollars. Changing that number by
[00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:54.180]   1% can be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars over your lifetime. So this category is really,
[00:07:54.180 --> 00:08:00.300]   really important. And then finally, guilt-free spending. This is like eating out, drinks, travel,
[00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:07.260]   nice bag, whatever you want. 20 to 35% of take-home pay. That's kind of a lot of money. When you think
[00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:13.680]   about it, you go, wait a second, I can spend 20 to 35% on clothes, eating out, hair, friends, all that.
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:20.300]   Yeah. If you have your other key numbers dialed in automatically, then you have a lot of money
[00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:25.820]   left over to actually spend on the things you love. So once it's like Tetris, you just got to make
[00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:30.460]   everything fit. However you want to do it. If you want to spend extra over here, but less over there,
[00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:32.980]   that's your rich life. You can do it.
[00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:38.900]   So I think probably where I kind of fell off the wagon was just dialed down the guilt-free spending
[00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:44.280]   and dialed up the investing, trying to save more for the future. I can't go back in time,
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:48.380]   but would your advice have been stop saving that much, save less?
[00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:52.980]   Wait, are you saying that you saved too much and you didn't spend enough?
[00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:59.100]   I would say that was probably the first 10 years out of college was certainly my MO and
[00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:01.120]   that shouldn't be surprising.
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:05.860]   I'm not surprised. How much of this pod, the rest of this podcast is going to be me making fun of you
[00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:10.940]   for being hyper frugal? Hopefully less than the last time we spoke. I feel like I'm getting better.
[00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:19.780]   I love it. I love it. Okay. Yes, there are some people like you who are what I call optimizers.
[00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:25.180]   The four money types, optimizers, one of them. And I actually was an optimizer too. Optimizers love
[00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:29.860]   spreadsheets. You know, we're always planning for like 40 years from now. We calculate all these
[00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:34.220]   different withdrawal rates and stuff. The problem with being an optimizer is that it can actually serve
[00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:39.340]   you really well. Like you, you over save, you set yourself up amazingly well, you've done great.
[00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:43.700]   And every day you look and you're like, oh, the number's going up. Like I'm so cool. Let me keep
[00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:48.720]   doing it. The problem is that if you take it to its logical extreme, optimizers become unbearably
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:55.400]   boring and unbearably cheap. Like they literally only live for the future. They look at cost, the price
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:10:01.020]   of a lunch, they go, oh, that taco, we could get it today. But if we actually take the money and invest
[00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:08.340]   it for the next 45 years, that $12 will actually turn into a $1,664. And they just end up doing nothing.
[00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:14.160]   They're unbearable to be around. So I like, I love optimizers because I get them. And it's kind of
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:19.920]   funny, but also it's not funny. I want them to realize there's a certain point where you won,
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:26.800]   you won the game. And you actually now, the point is not to look at another model or another fire
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:32.420]   subreddit. It's actually to have gratitude, give yourself a big pat on the back, celebrate,
[00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:39.820]   and then turn the page and start focusing on the next chapter, which often is learning the skill
[00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:44.540]   of spending money meaningfully. Do we get to talk about that today?
[00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:51.300]   Absolutely. Like you've done it. That's a skill I think I've, I have not mastered, but I've been an
[00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:55.640]   apprentice of for the last, I don't know, five years. And there are things that I used to spend a lot of
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:11:00.400]   time trying to dial in that I'm not. Can you just tell us so that we can laugh for a few?
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:04.960]   I really like dram. It's like an, it's like your Topo Chico example. It's like an expensive
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:09.040]   sparkling water. Yes. The Kirkland water is cheaper, but like, I just really like it and it tastes better.
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:14.760]   And if I go and spend $300 ordering a bunch of cans that last months, I don't care. Like,
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:20.380]   and that's a small example that I'm sure you'll make fun of, but I think old me would be like,
[00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:25.420]   why would I spend this much? Like there's an alternative that's cheaper. And I don't think
[00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:32.160]   like that as much on many things. I actually love that example. Um, it is a little ironic that you're
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:37.280]   drinking that expensive sparkling water and I have tap water in front of me. That's quite funny. Okay.
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:41.700]   Well, that's, that's well done. I think we should talk about how to build that skill.
[00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:47.180]   Also remembering you don't have to be a multimillionaire to build the skill of spending
[00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:51.860]   money meaningfully. Okay. I certainly didn't grow up as one. And you know, my parents are both
[00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:57.320]   immigrants from India, big family, dad worked, mom stayed home with us. We ate out very rarely.
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:02.820]   Our trips, we, I don't think we've ever been on a plane, all of us together. We just couldn't
[00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:08.600]   afford it. But we also learned about spending money meaningfully in a way that was relevant for us. Us
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:16.640]   going to like, you know, six of us to a movie, never going to happen too much money. However, if it was
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:22.000]   some type of sports thing for, you know, club event or whatever for our school, there was money for
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.840]   that. If it was buying a book because we needed it for school, there was money for that. And I think
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:29.800]   that really taught me that you can sharpen the edge on what's important for you. You can actually be
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:34.900]   incredibly resourceful if you need money or you want to spend money on certain things.
[00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:40.500]   But then for other things, like I think about all the things we did not do as a kid for financial
[00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:46.840]   reasons. And it actually taught me a lot. I remember walking past restaurants that our family would
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:52.180]   never go into. They were simply too expensive. I was not resentful. I was like, you know what,
[00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:56.500]   that's that's not for us. But one day I'll be able to go in there and eat whatever I want. And I am
[00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:03.240]   today. And I feel incredibly grateful. So I think that part of it is like, if you achieve this,
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:07.160]   if you save, if you're fortunate enough to have a good job and work hard and you accumulate,
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:12.300]   what's it all for? You better learn how to spend that money meaningfully. Otherwise,
[00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:15.420]   it just accumulates. And then what's the point of it all?
[00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:20.340]   Yeah, I think the conversation I had with Bill Perkins wrote Die With Zero really reframed a lot of
[00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:25.140]   things, thinking more about seasons, thinking about when is the time to spend your wealth?
[00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:30.660]   Because a lot of people are like, I'm going to save for this future thing. But I started realizing,
[00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:35.580]   well, maybe the best time to spend the money for the future thing is now. This is probably not the
[00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:41.100]   best advice for how to learn to spend money. But when you have children, somehow it just becomes easy
[00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:46.300]   to spend money on things that seem wildly expensive before. I think it's like a parental instinct where
[00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:50.520]   you're like, well, do I want my kid to be safer in the swimming pool? So private swim lessons sounds
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:56.920]   like a really good idea. That would have seemed crazy before, but it's like, oh, the best thing
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:02.220]   for the kids. Like, we got to do that. And that's helped. Like, let's allocate more money to this.
[00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:07.820]   This episode is brought to you by Element. Now, I love Element and I use it all the time because it

[00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:30.740]   missed customers. So I've learned a little bit of that skill to spend more, but you've said you were an
[00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:36.980]   optimizer. You've jumped way past that. What are some of the things that made it easy to not fall back into
[00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:43.300]   that habit, right? Sometimes I still see things that I know this is a little cheaper over there. Like I still
[00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:48.500]   want the deal. Even if I know it's not that meaningful to my financial picture, it's hard to break that
[00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:55.220]   habit. I have a few ways that have helped me reframe looking at cost alone. Some of them were
[00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:59.940]   these pivotal moments that happened to me. Right when I graduated from college, I wanted to dress
[00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:05.780]   better. And I asked one of my friends who dressed very well, if she could go shopping with me and help
[00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:11.860]   me understand how to do this. So she went shopping with me and I started picking out clothes and then
[00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:16.100]   she started getting really excited. She's like, Oh my God, that looks so awesome. And she was getting
[00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:21.620]   enthusiastic. So I was getting enthusiastic. That was the first lesson learned is when it comes to
[00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:28.740]   spending money, it's actually okay to get enthusiastic. Most of us actually approach money as if spending
[00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:34.980]   money is losing. I don't lose when I spend money. I win. I trust myself. I know I'm not tripping and
[00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:40.660]   falling and getting tricked by some salesperson. If I buy something, whether it's a shirt or a car,
[00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:46.500]   I did it with my eyes wide open. And so I get excited. We have to reframe the entire way we
[00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:50.740]   think about spending money. It's not painful. It's actually joyful. The second thing is I started
[00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:55.620]   looking at the prices. She goes, put that away. I said, what? Because in my family, we look at the
[00:17:55.620 --> 00:18:01.460]   price first. She goes, first decide if you love it, then go try it on. And then we'll look at the price.
[00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:09.300]   It blew my mind. And I realized leading with cost makes you lead with cost.
[00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:16.180]   Leading with experience or joy or delight or just I like to wear the pair of pants looks that changes
[00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:20.980]   your entire dynamic. So it's basically putting a guardrail around yourself that says maybe I shouldn't
[00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:26.340]   be looking at price first. And that applies to restaurants. It applies to flights. It applies
[00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:31.540]   to anything. Same thing with vacations. It's kind of startling to me how, when I ask people like,
[00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:35.140]   how do you plan a trip? It's quite remarkable. Everybody says the same number. They don't even
[00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:38.900]   have a budget. They have no number for it. It's the same number they use when they were 22 years old.
[00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:43.300]   It's $5,000. It doesn't matter if they have three kids. It doesn't matter if they are single. It doesn't
[00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:47.140]   matter if they're going international or going to Texas. It's always the same number. That really shows
[00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:52.260]   you that people don't really actually think about money in the way you think that they're not rational.
[00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:56.260]   They just pick a number that they used to use 20 years ago. And so what they'll do is they'll go to
[00:18:56.260 --> 00:19:00.260]   look at different hotels and this is how they pick it. They'll be like, that's the most expensive one.
[00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:02.980]   We're obviously not going to go there. That one's cheap. I don't know if we want to stay there.
[00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:06.740]   Let's go to something in the middle, maybe a little bit better than just the middle. That's how they pick it.
[00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:11.780]   And I'm like, what is happening right now? You take one vacation a year and this is how you plan
[00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:18.020]   the experience. A different way to do it is to think of it almost like a wedding. What is the experience we want?
[00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:24.100]   When we land, what do we want to have happen? Do we want to take the bus? Do we want to take a train?
[00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:28.100]   Do we have somebody waiting with a placard for us? Let's just put it down. We're not even going to look
[00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:32.260]   at cost right now. It's the same as I didn't look at pants when I was 22 years old. When we travel,
[00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:35.780]   we're going to go for how long? Eight days? Are we out and about every single day? Are we going to take
[00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:41.380]   one day that's just in the hotel? Oh, I would have never dreamed of doing that when I was a kid,
[00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:46.660]   because we only have a limited amount of time. We better go. We don't want to waste it. But we're
[00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:51.540]   not wasting. We're reframing it. Maybe we're recharging. And then finally, after we've crafted
[00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:57.700]   this entire experience, then we start to look at cost. Ooh, we're a bit over how much we put aside.
[00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:05.860]   Let's cut that one excursion or maybe we can stay for one day fewer or a cheaper hotel, etc. In other words,
[00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:10.820]   I would rather you start with the experience you want to create rather than a dollar value. It
[00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:16.020]   totally flips the entire calculus on its head. It's interesting. As you were saying this example,
[00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:21.060]   I was thinking about how some purchases are really easy. Like if I go to a restaurant,
[00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:27.220]   I don't have to think, "Oh, you know, there's four entrees. Why would I buy the $40 one instead of the
[00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:32.740]   $20 one?" Whatever it is. That doesn't seem to have an impact on me at all. And I think part of the
[00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:38.260]   reason is it's very hard to compare. And you didn't say this strategy, but I pulled it out,
[00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:43.620]   which is trying to just highlight the difference between two things. So if I'm at a grocery store
[00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:47.140]   and I'm like trying to buy something, I'm like, "Gosh, I know this thing is a lot cheaper somewhere
[00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:52.660]   else." And I'm using a small example because it's probably both relatable to some people and something
[00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:58.740]   that still gets me at times. It's like, "Well, this thing is not just more expensive, but it's here.
[00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:03.380]   It's in front of me now. It's not a drive away. It's convenient. I've already got things in my bag
[00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:08.180]   and just trying to process all the things that are kind of like bonuses you get, even if it's more
[00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:12.100]   expensive." Now, I know that's probably a little cost first, but it's looking at a thing and thinking
[00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:17.060]   about everything around it actually might help me a little bit in some of these scenarios.
[00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:23.220]   But we've recently gotten better on vacations and taken, "Okay, well, we really want to go to this
[00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:27.540]   thing. We want to have this experience. And the only way to have it is at the Four Seasons. So
[00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:31.460]   we're just going to pay for it." Let's go through this because I want to understand it. First, can you
[00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:35.860]   just describe what you used to do? And then let's talk about what you do now. I'm curious.
[00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:40.420]   We used to go say, "Okay, well, what kind of a trip do we want?" And I think we would start with the high
[00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:45.860]   level of, "We want to go to a beach." And then it might be, "Okay, is there a place that we can go
[00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:52.180]   using points to make the trip a decent amount lower that would meet those criteria? Is there
[00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:58.820]   something that matches it?" And hopefully there is. In this particular case, it was, "Gosh, I want this
[00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:04.020]   trip." And for anyone who doesn't know the Four Seasons, there's no points option. There's no special
[00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:08.740]   deal. Like there might be some promotions. And I did an episode about why I actually thought it wasn't as
[00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:13.220]   expensive as I thought, but I only found that out after the fact. And we were like, "This is just a thing
[00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:17.300]   we're going to make happen. We're going to spend what it takes to do this trip that we want."
[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:21.940]   Because we decided that that's the thing we wanted to do. Now, would we have been able to do it if it
[00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:28.500]   were five times as expensive? Probably not. But it was certainly two or three times the price of other
[00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:35.140]   hotels in Hawaii. I know you're not a big budgeting fan, but one of the things that really helped, and in
[00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:42.900]   a way it's kind of the same as the four numbers you have, is I know that currently our income allows us to
[00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:47.780]   save enough money that we are saving enough. I probably don't know the numbers as well as you
[00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:52.500]   do. I know my spending amount and I know my take home amount and my saving amount. I haven't really
[00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:56.740]   thought about the rest, but I just knew that if we spent this money, it's not going to derail anything.
[00:22:56.740 --> 00:23:00.900]   We've done a pretty good job of running through. Here's where we spend money. If we were going to
[00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:05.380]   spend a little more, where would we want to spend it? And in this case, that was how we wanted to do it.
[00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:11.460]   And it wasn't hard. Like it was weird that it was easier to spend thousands of dollars more on a vacation
[00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:15.700]   than we normally would. Yet it's probably still difficult to spend
[00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:22.020]   40 extra dollars to rent an SUV on a trip we're taking right now. Like I'm actually booking a rental
[00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:27.860]   car. And for some reason that I can't explain, I'm like, "God, do I really want to spend the $40 to have
[00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:32.820]   the four-wheel drive car?" We're going to Costa Rica during the rainy season. Like it seems like a smart
[00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:39.220]   decision. But that decision is actually harder for me than spending thousands of dollars on a vacation. I think
[00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:45.460]   part of it is it's one of those things that usually doesn't always matter. It's like insurance. The
[00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:49.140]   other day I bought insurance to ship a package and then guess what? The package got there. You could
[00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:53.380]   say it was a waste of money, but I had the peace of mind going into it. In this case, I'm like, "Do we
[00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:57.540]   really need that?" It's like every time we go visit family in Colorado, it's like, "Well, we probably should
[00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:02.100]   get the four-wheel drive car and 99% of the time it's not snowing and icing and we didn't need it."
[00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:08.900]   I mean, there's a lot of things we don't need. I think that when I talk to people who are optimizers,
[00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:13.940]   reformed optimizers, there's always a sense of control that's trying to be exerted. And I think
[00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:22.020]   that sometimes we can find more control in playing small than in playing big. So for example, I spoke to
[00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:29.380]   a couple on my podcast. They were in severe debt. They presented it as having $313,000 of debt. I ran
[00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:33.940]   their numbers. They actually have $350,000, $3,000 of debt. So they were under by like 40 grand. They
[00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:40.740]   didn't even know. And she spends three hours a day. That's not an exaggeration. Three hours a day
[00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:46.180]   on a spreadsheet looking through their numbers. And I looked at the spreadsheet and it was incredibly
[00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:53.220]   confusing. All red. Everything was red and just depressing to look at. I said, "Do you like this?"
[00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:59.540]   She goes, "No, I don't like it." Well, she spent her time there every day, over 20 hours a week,
[00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:03.940]   because it gives her a sense of control. Once in a while, I find myself looking for a purchase,
[00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:09.380]   like a $20 item on Amazon. And I've got five tabs open. I'm reading the freaking Wirecutter reviews.
[00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:15.300]   And I'm like, "Oh my God, I got pulled into this." A couple of reasons. One, the world makes it easy for
[00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:20.820]   us to cross compare information. But two, if you're an optimizer, if you're especially good
[00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:27.540]   at crunching numbers and comparing things, you're just drawn to that. The solution is not to beat
[00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:32.740]   yourself up. It's actually just to create a rule. That's it. It's just to say a worry-free number.
[00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:38.180]   And you say in your family, "Any number below this, we're just not going to worry about it. I'm just going
[00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:42.500]   to buy the best, or I'm going to buy the middle." Whatever the rule is for you. For a lot of people,
[00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:48.500]   the easiest place to start is just $20. Anything below $20, we're just not going to worry about it.
[00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:52.580]   Okay? And it could be, "Should we get this thing of fruit? Should we get this? Should we get that?"
[00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:57.460]   20 bucks, not going to think twice, going to get it. Now, the first question people come back to me with
[00:25:57.460 --> 00:26:02.420]   is, "Oh, Ramit, so you're saying I can spend 20 bucks 10 times a day, times 30? It's going to bankrupt
[00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:08.820]   us." Funny, again, that that's what people immediately jump to, as if they're going to go from frugalistas to
[00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:14.740]   suddenly spending $6,000 a month on fruit. It's never going to happen. What they really are saying
[00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:21.940]   is, "I don't trust myself to give myself that freedom of a $20 worry-free number." Trust me,
[00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:27.540]   if you spend too much, you would catch it, and you would dial it back. We're going to do a worry-free
[00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:31.540]   number. We're going to feel good about money. You might have your own core values in your family,
[00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:36.900]   like personal safety. That's number one for my family. And for a lot of parents, I think that's a
[00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:40.820]   great value. That means if we're booking two hotels, and one looks to be safer, and the other's in
[00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:44.260]   maybe a dangerous part of the state, we're not going to do that. If we're booking a certain car,
[00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:48.900]   and one is safer because there's muddy roads, we're going to get the thing, and that's it. And if it means
[00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:53.300]   that we have to stay one last day, that's what we're going to do, because that's our core value:
[00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:58.580]   family safety first, right? These are kinds of ways that you can actually become more fluid about it,
[00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:04.020]   versus finding yourself cost comparing on $20 or $40. I don't know if you would consider this a
[00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:09.460]   healthy habit or not, but we had a challenge that every time we looked at flights, and almost everyone
[00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:15.460]   probably can sympathize with this, the inconvenient flight is so cheap. It's like, "Oh, do you want to
[00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:20.660]   go to the airport at 5 a.m. and change planes in Dallas?" And it's like, "No, I want to fly direct,
[00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:26.340]   and I want to do it at 10 a.m." So I just filter it out. I am not convinced I have the perfect control
[00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:31.540]   where I'm like, "Wow, it's $400 cheaper to do this thing. Maybe I start to second guess." But I find
[00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:36.900]   that if I just remove it from the search results, like I set the filters on Google Flights to not even
[00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:42.580]   show it, I could basically lock the rule in the software. It's different if you're 21 years old and
[00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:48.500]   you have less money and more time, then you should be looking at those flights. Those are the flights I took,
[00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:54.740]   the cheap ones. I've done it where it was the train, the bus, you know? Yeah, I totally agree. We took the cheapest
[00:27:54.740 --> 00:28:00.100]   stuff when we were backpacking in Europe. I love that stuff. But as I got older and as I had more
[00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:04.820]   money, I turned the page. And I think this is so important for people to realize. I'm not talking
[00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:09.940]   about everyone going and spending $20 million on this and that. I'm saying look at the stage of life you
[00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:15.460]   are at and spend your money accordingly. If I'm 21 and I'm going backpacking in Europe with my high
[00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:21.380]   school buddies, then I don't have a lot of money. I don't even mind carrying a big backpack around and
[00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:25.860]   walking around. I don't mind. I actually love it. And I'm going to do that. I'm not even going to feel
[00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:32.420]   guilty about not being able to stay in the fancy thing. But now, 20 plus years later, if I have more
[00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:37.380]   money and I'm with my wife and I want to have a beautiful time and maybe I'm into hotels and this and
[00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:42.660]   that, then I'm going to spend money differently. And I'm actually going to appreciate it. I want to
[00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:48.820]   share this thing. I went to the train station in Paris. And it was either Paris or Rome. I had gone
[00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:53.220]   there backpacking. And I remember exactly what it looked like. In fact, I remember reading from a
[00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:56.660]   guidebook because we were actually we got there at like two or three a.m. We're just going to sleep
[00:28:56.660 --> 00:29:00.100]   there because we're like, ah, let's save some money. And we opened up our guidebook back then used to
[00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:04.420]   have guidebooks. And it was like, whatever you do, do not sleep in the Paris train station. You will
[00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:09.220]   definitely get robbed. I was like, oh man. So we went to find some cheap hotel, whatever.
[00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:14.820]   20 years later, I go back with my wife. We had a beautiful time. We came back to that very same
[00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:20.420]   train station. And this time we were taking the train and I guess we had like business class seats. So we
[00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:25.700]   went up to the second floor and there's some like informal lounge or something. I didn't even know that
[00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:30.580]   existed until just now. Because when I was a kid, how would I have? I didn't even know to look up.
[00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:36.900]   And I remember as we went upstairs to the elevator and I was like, oh my God, this is such a powerful
[00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:42.100]   moment for me because I'm sitting there looking at the exact view I had when I was there with my high
[00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:47.060]   school buddies backpacking and we had the time of our lives. And now I'm here with my wife having the time
[00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:54.500]   of our life, but differently. We are in a lounge. It's nice. And I feel so grateful to be able to spend,
[00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:59.220]   I don't know, 30 bucks more on a train ticket or whatever it costs and that I got to do that the
[00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:05.060]   way I did then. So what I want everybody to know is just spending more money is not always the best
[00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:11.620]   option. Spending money meaningfully for your rich life is really what we're talking about here.
[00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:18.020]   And sometimes it can be cheap and sometimes it can be lavish, but I want you to be able to toggle
[00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:24.020]   between all of those without feeling guilty and stricken. When do you start thinking about income?
[00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:27.780]   Because you talked about the four things you keep track of. And I know that you often talk about
[00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:32.820]   spending as playing defense, but is there a stage where it might actually be more advantageous to just
[00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:36.420]   focus on earning money and focus less on where you're spending?
[00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:42.500]   Yes. Keep in mind that all those four numbers are a percentage of your income. So if you have more
[00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:47.860]   income, you're going to have a lot more to play with in those four key numbers, 50 to 60%, etc.
[00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:54.500]   Yes. I think this is overlooked a lot by the personal finance world. It's easy to obsess over cutting costs
[00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:59.140]   on freaking bread. But at a certain point, there's a limit to how much you can cut and no limit to how
[00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:04.420]   much you can earn. I have found increasing my earnings to have been one of the most powerful levers in
[00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:08.500]   my entire financial system. So there's a few ways of thinking about it. One, if you have a job,
[00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:17.540]   learning the skill of raising your salary. That is a skill. That skill can be negotiating your salary.
[00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:22.340]   And I have all kinds of scripts on exactly what to say to your boss, when, what to write in the email,
[00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:27.860]   what to say in the negotiation. Also, if you can't negotiate your salary, switching jobs, learning how
[00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:33.300]   to switch jobs and actually increase your salary. This isn't pipe dream stuff. I feature people who got
[00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:40.020]   $5,000, $10,000, $25,000 raises. This happens all the time at companies all around the country.
[00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:44.580]   So it's really important for you to understand how this works and to be able to build that skill.
[00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:48.820]   Then of course, they're starting a side business. We talk about that in my earnable program all the time.
[00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:52.900]   Take the idea you already have. I know people who are professional dog walkers,
[00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:59.620]   who teach kids how to paint, teach a second language, are Excel analysts. There's all kinds of stuff.
[00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:04.580]   Taking that thing you're already good at, being a personal stylist, and turning it into a business
[00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:11.620]   where you can make $1,000 a month, $2,000 a month. At a certain point, you may even decide to go full time on that.
[00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:14.340]   That becomes incredibly powerful.
[00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:20.340]   Yeah. I think one of the things I learned is to try to divert that optimization energy
[00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:25.620]   on bigger and different problems. So it's like, look, I don't have to just worry about how do I get
[00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:30.580]   a deal on this, but maybe I'm going to try to divert it to, we're going to buy a car.
[00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:35.540]   What's the most optimal way to do that where it's a much bigger purchase than a dinner or some
[00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:41.860]   groceries or a house. And so I think in the first interview we did, you talked about solving the
[00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:46.180]   30,000 foot view or problem or- Focus on the $30,000 questions,
[00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:50.660]   not the $3 questions. Let me give you an example. $3 questions is optimizing the price of pomegranate.
[00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:57.700]   Who cares? $30,000 questions are things like, what's the exact month and year my debt's going to be paid
[00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:04.980]   off. Can I add 1% every December to my investment contribution rate? So instead of 5% next year,
[00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:12.100]   it's 6% then 7%. What is my asset allocation? Is that properly set up? Am I paying too much in
[00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:18.020]   investment fees? That matters a lot. These are 30,000, sometimes even $300,000 questions.
[00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:22.820]   So I would rather we take that energy exactly as you said, I think it's really smart and focus it on
[00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:26.500]   these big wins. Because if you do that, then you don't have to worry about, you know,
[00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:29.620]   how much your grand slam breakfast costs at Denny's. It's irrelevant.
[00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:35.460]   I've been fortunate to learn that if you have that joy of optimization, you can find other areas to
[00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:39.780]   tackle it and not like you mentioned, sometimes it's fun, right? Sometimes you get caught trying to save
[00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:46.980]   money on Amazon. If you can find a place to channel it, that's better. Or if it really is fun, right?
[00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:50.980]   If you're trying to buy something on Amazon for $20, and you're not saving the money because you're
[00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:55.140]   necessarily trying to save $3, but because you just want to get that itch of just playing the
[00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:59.780]   game of trying to find the right deal. And I assume that's just okay. Like it's okay to spend
[00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:06.020]   your time in the way you want. No, no, no, no. See, it's one thing if you do it because you have to,
[00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:11.540]   okay? If you really have a very limited income, maybe you have a big family, you have to,
[00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:16.980]   you're sitting there freaking looking at which place has the specials for tomatoes. Okay, great. When I ask
[00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:24.180]   people, what is their rich life? I have never, ever gotten someone saying, I want to sit around all
[00:34:24.180 --> 00:34:31.700]   week and optimize the price of printer paper. Not once, ever. And yet they spend literally hours per
[00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:36.900]   week doing it. When I ask them, what is your rich life? They will always say things like spending more
[00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:41.620]   time with my family, traveling, new experiences, just going out with my partner and going out for a date
[00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:47.860]   night, those kinds of things. Okay. One of the, I think core principles here is to really get honest
[00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:51.940]   about what your rich life is. Your rich life does not have to be what mine is. In fact, it never will
[00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:55.700]   be. Ours are going to be completely different. That's how it should be. But then once you know what
[00:34:55.700 --> 00:35:00.420]   your rich life is in crystal clear clarity, you ask yourself the questions, get your partner involved.
[00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:06.420]   Then you look at what you're actually spending your time and money on. You go, wait a second. Am I
[00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:12.100]   actually aligned with what my vision is? You know, we claim we want to travel, but the last time we
[00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:17.700]   traveled was like six years ago. What's going on here? We claim we want to be more in touch with our
[00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:25.460]   family, but when was the last time we actually spent money and time seeing them? So I get the urge to want
[00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:32.820]   to optimize and to look at, you know, it's fun. I get that. But I find it once you get past needing to
[00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:39.060]   do it. I find that almost every single person is doing it because that is what they've always done.
[00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:47.060]   That is what they know. And they have never dreamed bigger than that. And I simply will not watch people
[00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:50.980]   play small for their entire life. It's just not going to happen in the, I will teach you to be rich
[00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:57.060]   world. So you asked me, is it okay? I love it. Can I do what? No, you can't play bigger, turn the page,
[00:35:57.060 --> 00:36:01.460]   turn the chapter to the next meaningful part of your life and start spending and saving money in a way that
[00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:07.540]   is meaningful to you. Okay. This episode is brought to you by Notion. Now I'm always juggling everything

[00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:45.300]   decisions. I think sometimes the big decisions matter, right? Here's an example that I'll throw
[00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:50.420]   out. And I want to kind of hear your perspective on it. Someone's thinking, "I want to decide if we
[00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:54.820]   can take this trip," right? We listened to Ramit. We thought about this rich life. We said we want to
[00:38:54.820 --> 00:39:00.180]   travel. We're not. But we thought about how much of a safety net or emergency fund we want. And I think
[00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:05.940]   we're behind. How can we decide whether we take that trip now or we need to prioritize these other things?
[00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:12.260]   Great question. This is the type of questions I wish people asked more of. "Hey, we actually decided we
[00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:16.740]   want to do this, but like, can we afford it? How do we know if it fits?" These are great questions. So,
[00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:21.140]   you know, there's some simple guidelines that I will give, and then we'll get into a bit of the nuance.
[00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:26.420]   If you have high interest debt like credit card debt, you're not taking a vacation. It just makes
[00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:34.020]   no sense at all. Bar none. End of story. Boom. 26.99%. And I have people putting aside, you know,
[00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:38.740]   500 bucks a month for a vacation fund. I go, "Not in my world. I move that money right to their credit
[00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:46.100]   card debt. Pay that freaking thing off." And then we start to say things like, "Hey, we want a six-month
[00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:55.140]   emergency fund. We currently have four months. Should we fill that up before we go on vacation or should we
[00:39:55.140 --> 00:40:01.540]   go on vacation?" Now, this is where I think you can apply your own decision-making skills. Personally,
[00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:06.260]   if you have four months and you can afford to wait like six months, fill up your emergency fund, wait,
[00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:10.420]   then go. On the other hand, I recently saw a post just a couple of days ago. Somebody said,
[00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:21.860]   "My mom had cancer and she did a family vacation to Hawaii. We decided it wouldn't have blown our budget.
[00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:26.020]   It would have stretched us a little. We decided not to do it." And it was the last trip she ever took. And
[00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:32.740]   this person said it was a huge mistake. And we realized like we have been over focusing on money.
[00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:40.500]   To me, that is putting dollars in front of love. And this person said it themselves. They were not going
[00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:45.700]   to break the bank. They simply were playing a game that was playing too small. They were living in the
[00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:50.980]   spreadsheet. So that to me is an obvious, "No, don't do that." That is how I start to think about it.
[00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:56.340]   Then to get into some of the nuances, you want to make sure that, "Hey, do we have money set aside for
[00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:59.860]   this vacation? Or is it going to go on a credit card?" That determines it. Are we hitting all the
[00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:03.940]   rest of our numbers? If we're not, like if we don't have savings, if we don't have investments going
[00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:07.220]   automatically every single month, we're not going on vacation because we need to set that up first.
[00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:14.420]   That's just the way you think about it. It's less like lick your finger and put it up to the wind
[00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:20.340]   and decide like, "Oh, should we go on vacation?" No, it's actually quite methodical. And you can make
[00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:25.860]   decisions. It's not restrictive because all the systems that I have in I Will Teach You Be Rich,
[00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:29.700]   they're all set up for you to live a rich life. You want to go on vacation or you want to go out for
[00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:33.300]   drinks or you want to get food delivered three times a week? It doesn't matter to me. It's your money.
[00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:38.340]   You just have to know four key numbers. And as long as you fit in those numbers,
[00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:43.620]   you're good to go. I noticed the fixed cost number is relative to your income.
[00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:47.860]   Yeah. I feel like there's this counter story, which is as you raise your income,
[00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:52.580]   you don't need to necessarily increase your cost of living and have lifestyle creep go all the way up.
[00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:57.460]   On the fixed side, it sounds like maybe you should. I don't believe in lifestyle creep.
[00:41:57.460 --> 00:42:03.220]   Lifestyle creep is this idea that I'm going to make more money and I'm just going to blindly spend it
[00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:07.060]   on whatever comes in front of me. And I will grant that a lot of people do that.
[00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:12.100]   When I say I don't believe in lifestyle creep, I don't believe in it for me and for my readers.
[00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:15.540]   Because when I go and buy something really expensive, I'm not creeping anything.
[00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:21.700]   I'm not lifestyle creeping anything. I am running my numbers. I am always leaving a fat buffer
[00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:28.180]   because I don't ever want to get close to the red line. And I'm going to buy it. If I make more money,
[00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:33.460]   of course, I'm going to spend more money. That's the point. The point is not to save this money like
[00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:41.300]   freaking Scrooge McDuck. No, I'm actually going to be methodical. I even have a number for every bit of
[00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:46.900]   unexpected income that comes in. My wife and I have a plan. This percentage goes to investments. This
[00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:52.980]   percentage goes to travel. This percentage goes to permanent lifestyle increases, like going out for an
[00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:59.860]   extra date night, something like that. So again, it's planful. It's thoughtful. But you better believe
[00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:05.460]   if I work hard and if I make more money, my life is going to get better. That's the point.
[00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:09.780]   I love it. Okay. In the example, you talked about the family that didn't take the vacation.
[00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:16.260]   It kind of hit on the fact that sometimes money decisions aren't rational. They're not financial.
[00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:22.020]   They're emotional. Yes. So I want to come back to this decision that I got your advice on a few months
[00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:29.540]   ago. So we had bought this eighth of a vacation home and it was up in Napa. We'd gotten some great use
[00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:34.500]   out of it. And we found with our kids schedules, which for anyone who has young children that aren't yet in
[00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:40.260]   school, don't make the naive mistake I did, which was not realizing that your entire life will revolve
[00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:44.420]   around a school calendar as soon as they are in school. And so we had an eighth of a home. It was
[00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:50.100]   awesome. I'm so glad we bought it. Then we had six weeks a year that we had to spread over a school
[00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:54.900]   schedule and it meant we were going to take every vacation up there. But the fractional real estate
[00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:59.700]   market in Napa wasn't great. And we got an offer that was so-so and we were trying to figure out what to do.
[00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:05.220]   And I called you and I said, "How should we be thinking about this? Because it's not a slam dunk
[00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:10.020]   to sell. We're going to lose some money, but we're not necessarily getting the value out of it." Maybe
[00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:14.740]   share a little bit about the advice you gave me and then we could talk about what happened and how I'm
[00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:20.260]   feeling now. Okay. I'm very curious to hear what happened, but can you actually share what you heard
[00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:23.220]   me tell you? What was your experience? What'd you end up doing?
[00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:27.460]   Okay. So I did say, you know, I was worried like once you've bought this house, you kind of have
[00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:32.660]   this fixed cost. You're committed to it. Would we be able to spend that same amount on a vacation if
[00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:38.660]   we had to think about it every single time? And you said, "Don't keep an investment that you don't
[00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:43.540]   think is a great investment because you have an unhealthy relationship with spending money."
[00:44:43.540 --> 00:44:46.740]   That was the takeaway. And I remember I called my wife right after and she was like,
[00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:50.900]   "Oh, what did Ramit say?" And I said, "If you have trouble spending money on vacation and you have
[00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:56.740]   the money, you need to fix that. And don't keep a house you don't want because you can't fix this
[00:44:56.740 --> 00:45:03.060]   obvious problem." And at that moment we were like, "Yeah, that is true. We shouldn't keep doing that."
[00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:06.740]   And the other advice, and maybe you weren't the one that gave me this piece that I talked to friends,
[00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:11.540]   is they said, "Hey, every time you talk about this house, you're like, well, we're trying to sell it.
[00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:15.700]   You're never calling me to tell me how amazing the house is and how awesome it is.
[00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:19.220]   You're calling about some problem." That's every American homeowner. All they do is complain about
[00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:23.860]   their godforsaken houses. That doesn't sound fun, my friend. Anyway, yes, I agree.
[00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:28.740]   And so we did. We negotiated a little bit of the offer, right? I think everyone should negotiate as
[00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:32.900]   much as you can. And we sold it. You sold it. I love this.
[00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:38.500]   I love it for so many reasons. I love that you were decisive. That's amazing. You and Amy, like kudos.
[00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:44.820]   That's awesome. I love that you recognize like not every financial decision results in profit,
[00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:52.180]   not even investment decision, and that's okay. And I love that now you have the flexibility to not look
[00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:57.140]   backwards, but to actually look forward. I'm curious, what are you going to do now that you have
[00:45:57.140 --> 00:46:01.300]   more flexibility? Well, it was funny because this summer and next summer, one of the things that's
[00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:06.100]   not great about owning a fractional piece of a home is we had to kind of schedule it out.
[00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:10.900]   So we were like, well, we have this week in August. We had next summer booked out. And now we were like,
[00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:16.340]   oh, what should we do in August? Like we could do whatever we want. We are not constrained by
[00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:21.620]   anything in terms of where we go and what we do and what the schedule is. We don't really want to
[00:46:21.620 --> 00:46:27.620]   go on a big long trip because our daughter's having this surgery. And so we just found a place down in
[00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:31.300]   Carmel and we're like, we're just going to book a trip there. We're going to go do the things that
[00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:37.620]   we want to do and not be constrained by this house. The other thing that I think is really hard for a
[00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:43.780]   lot of people to process, especially when it comes to owning stock in a company or owning property,
[00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:48.980]   things that have value that you resell that I think this wasn't my problem, but I know a lot of
[00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:52.740]   people that have it is, oh, well, the house is down. We're going to lose money. And maybe in
[00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:57.860]   the future, it'll go up. My argument is like, there were two separate decisions we were making.
[00:46:57.860 --> 00:47:02.660]   One was, do we want to sell this house? And it has a market value, right? You could say you think it's
[00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:06.900]   worth more because you paid more, but it's only worth whatever someone else is going to pay you for it.
[00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:12.500]   And so holding onto the house so it appreciates is the same as buying another. Like if I think it's really
[00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:16.580]   going to appreciate, I should buy out all the other owners and own the whole thing. And then the other was,
[00:47:16.580 --> 00:47:21.140]   we want to pay the monthly operating costs of the house, which we could choose. That was in our
[00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:27.220]   control, what the price of the house wasn't. And so I don't actually feel like we lost money on the
[00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:34.100]   house in that we bought it. It's worth less. We didn't sell it for a loss. We sold it for the market
[00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:39.220]   rate now. Like it didn't feel like we were losing money in the moment. It just felt like we lost money
[00:47:39.220 --> 00:47:44.100]   in the long run, but we didn't accept a bad offer. In fact, we accepted a great offer. We negotiated it up.
[00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:48.900]   We didn't really lose on the price because we got a market price and we'd waited a year for
[00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:52.980]   an offer. So it would be hard to imagine that waiting a year for someone to buy something.
[00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:56.500]   And you're like, well, I think it was worth more. No, it's probably worth about what it was paid for.
[00:47:56.500 --> 00:48:04.980]   So it feels great. It feels freeing. It seemed so obvious talking to you and a few other people that
[00:48:04.980 --> 00:48:09.300]   what we should do. And I actually use this advice with a friend today. He was like,
[00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:13.220]   someone made an offer to buy this company I've been building. And it wasn't a huge offer,
[00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:17.140]   but he'd been building for a long time. And he's like, how are you thinking about it? And I was like,
[00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:20.820]   every time you talk about this company, you're talking about trying to sell the company. Like,
[00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:24.740]   what is the holdup? You've been asking for this thing for years. Now it's here and you're wondering
[00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:31.140]   whether you want it, you know, you want it. And he was like, you're right. I do know. So it was so hard
[00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:35.140]   for me to know I wanted it and for Amy and I, but then when we talked to other people, they were like,
[00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:37.380]   we've heard you talk about this thing. You want to move on.
[00:48:37.380 --> 00:48:44.020]   - It's actually a profound point you make of people will talk about something for years. They
[00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:50.660]   will want something for years. They want it deep in their soul. And then when presented with the
[00:48:50.660 --> 00:48:55.540]   opportunity to get the very thing they have talked about, dreamed about, agonized about,
[00:48:55.540 --> 00:49:01.620]   they will become skeptical. I see it all the time. I have people in my community. They talk about starting
[00:49:01.620 --> 00:49:06.420]   a business. They've wanted to start a business for six years. They followed 13 people on social,
[00:49:06.420 --> 00:49:11.460]   three on newsletter, two on podcast. And they'll say, I don't have an idea. I don't have this.
[00:49:11.460 --> 00:49:16.500]   I don't, we have a program that does exactly that. And they'll get to the sales page has literally every
[00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:21.300]   single question they could ever conceivably come up with. And then suddenly they start going, will it
[00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:26.820]   do this? Will it help a left-handed person who lives south of the equator, but only between September
[00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:32.660]   and October? And what's really going on there, whether it was your friend, with you, with people who are
[00:49:32.660 --> 00:49:39.220]   facing a decision. Even with me, when I first started like trying to get fit, I had thought
[00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:43.780]   about it, talked about it, played around with weights. I didn't know what I was doing. Finally,
[00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:47.380]   when faced with the opportunity to actually get a personal trainer and learn how this worked,
[00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:51.780]   I started debating it. Oh, should I do this? Will it be hard? What about injuries? Blah, blah, blah.
[00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:57.060]   It's just a human thing that we do. I love your example because it shows us it happens to everybody.
[00:49:57.060 --> 00:50:03.380]   It happens at every stage. It happens with big decisions, small ones, all of the above. I actually
[00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:08.740]   think that's why one of the most crippling traits of somebody is to be indecisive. I see it all the time.
[00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:16.580]   And to be decisive is like a superpower. Decisive does not mean erratic. It doesn't mean you just do
[00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:20.980]   things on a whim, but decisive. You have the information you have, you know what you want,
[00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:24.340]   what your core values are, and then you make a decision. One out of 10 times you get it wrong,
[00:50:24.340 --> 00:50:29.300]   but decisive people can catch that, correct it, and then get back on track.
[00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:34.500]   And what do you think holds people back? I am not, in some areas I'm decisive and in some I'm
[00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:39.460]   horribly indecisive. What advice do you have for people who know they want to be decisive but aren't?
[00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:44.420]   Practice. It's a skill. I'll get on Zoom and I'll be like, "All right, I have a clipboard. Take me
[00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:48.340]   around your apartment or your house." When you're in your own house, you have all kinds of stuff that's
[00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:53.060]   broken or there's a smudge or something. You just learn to live with it. All the light bulb is out.
[00:50:53.060 --> 00:50:57.620]   And go, "What are the things that annoy you?" Walk around with a clipboard and tell me what annoys you
[00:50:57.620 --> 00:51:02.260]   right now. And it's like, "Ah, there's freaking kids Legos all over the place. They're always throwing
[00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:07.860]   it here. I stub my foot every day I come home from work." You're okay. Let's pick three things you're going to do
[00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:14.820]   in the next 24 hours to make these problems vanish. And you'll discover going from problem orientation,
[00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:20.260]   where you constantly talking about problems, sharing problems, commiserating on problems versus
[00:51:20.260 --> 00:51:26.180]   solution oriented. Hey, you have to fix it. And then you really put a time constraint, 24 hours and it's
[00:51:26.180 --> 00:51:31.620]   going to be fixed. Suddenly it's like, "Oh, I don't have time to, you know, compare five different storage
[00:51:31.620 --> 00:51:35.860]   containers because I need one here in the next two hours. I need to go to the store right now and get one."
[00:51:35.860 --> 00:51:42.180]   Light a fire, pick something, and people will realize they've agonized over a freaking laundry
[00:51:42.180 --> 00:51:47.620]   basket for three years. And when you light a fire, you say, "Look, we're going to become decisive. Go
[00:51:47.620 --> 00:51:52.020]   get any laundry container right now and come back in 20 minutes." And they do it. And then they realize,
[00:51:52.020 --> 00:51:57.220]   "Oh my God, why was I playing so small? Why was I agonizing over this? If I can become decisive over a
[00:51:57.220 --> 00:52:01.620]   laundry hamper, then I can become decisive over what we're going to eat for dinner tonight. I can become
[00:52:01.620 --> 00:52:05.380]   decisive over my finances." So it's a skill that you can practice.
[00:52:05.380 --> 00:52:05.940]   I love it.
[00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:09.700]   One of the things that I've found when it comes to these things around the house
[00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:14.980]   that makes it easier for me to make a decision, because I probably had the same problem,
[00:52:14.980 --> 00:52:20.740]   is I always ask myself, "Before we sell this house, are we going to fix it?" And if the answer is yes,
[00:52:20.740 --> 00:52:24.660]   then I'm like, "We've already decided we're going to fix it. We had this window and it wouldn't actually
[00:52:24.660 --> 00:52:28.900]   like you could open it and it would just fall down. You know, it wouldn't stay up." And we're like, "Well,
[00:52:28.900 --> 00:52:32.500]   before we sell the house, we've got to fix this window." So we've already committed we're going to
[00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:38.100]   fix it. So let's fix it while we can enjoy it." I totally agree. If something is going to have to
[00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:45.460]   get done anyway, why not do it sooner? Now, if it were hundreds of thousands of dollars and you didn't
[00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:51.780]   have it, of course. But you know, I imagine most of the people listening have been in a situation like
[00:52:51.780 --> 00:52:56.500]   I was where it was not about that. It was dollars. In fact, so many of the things we're talking about
[00:52:56.500 --> 00:53:01.140]   today are not about the actual dollar value. You hear Chris talk about the four seasons or whatever.
[00:53:01.140 --> 00:53:06.420]   It's not about that. It can be a very modest hotel or a very modest trip. It doesn't have to be one
[00:53:06.420 --> 00:53:12.900]   eighth of a house. We're talking principles here. If there are things that you are indecisive about,
[00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:20.020]   you can fix that. If there are things that you spend time on that are not serving, you don't like it,
[00:53:20.020 --> 00:53:25.460]   then come up with a solution. Maybe it's doing it less frequently. Maybe it's delegating it to
[00:53:25.460 --> 00:53:31.780]   someone. Or maybe it's just accepting right now I have to do this until I get my savings rate up to
[00:53:31.780 --> 00:53:37.300]   seven percent. And then I will take one percent of that and put it towards having some help around the
[00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:41.380]   house or whatever it may be. In other words, apply the principle. Don't get hung up on the examples.
[00:53:41.380 --> 00:53:47.460]   Are there things as people climb up the wealth ladder you see pop up like common traps that come
[00:53:47.460 --> 00:53:53.060]   up as people solve some of these problems, new ones arise? Definitely. This is a great question.
[00:53:53.060 --> 00:53:59.220]   The biggest trap I see of people moving up the wealth ladder, they actually don't adjust their
[00:53:59.220 --> 00:54:05.540]   spending. So they keep doing things that they used to do, which they simply cannot afford to do. There's an
[00:54:05.540 --> 00:54:09.860]   old Jim Rohn quote, "The more successful I got, the less I could afford to do certain things." He's talking about
[00:54:09.860 --> 00:54:13.860]   like mowing his lawn on Saturdays. He got so successful he couldn't afford to do that because
[00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:19.060]   he had a limited amount of time he wanted to spend it with his family. So as you get more successful,
[00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:23.780]   you constantly have to be thinking, where am I turning the chapter? What am I doing more of? What
[00:54:23.780 --> 00:54:29.460]   am I doing less of? And less of is really hard for people. The next thing that people do is because
[00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:34.580]   their worldview for most people is I'm going to do it all myself. They are highly inexperienced at
[00:54:34.580 --> 00:54:40.580]   delegation. And so what happens is they're making good money, but they're still grocery shopping two times a week,
[00:54:40.580 --> 00:54:43.780]   they're cleaning their house, they're doing all this stuff. And they're just like overwhelmed.
[00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:50.820]   They're busy at work, taking care of kids, family, spouse. And like so much of this stuff is so easily
[00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:56.580]   outsourceable now, especially now, you know, whether it be Instacart, whether it be having somebody come to your house once a week.
[00:54:56.580 --> 00:55:03.780]   And their worldview is often I can't have somebody come and do that for me. That's for rich people.
[00:55:03.780 --> 00:55:07.940]   Two problems. Number one, the people I'm talking to sometimes are rich. They just don't think of
[00:55:07.940 --> 00:55:11.780]   themselves as so I shake them. I tell them point blank. You realize you're rich, right?
[00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:15.540]   They're like, no, I'm not. I'm not Jeff Bezos. That's not who we're comparing ourselves to.
[00:55:15.540 --> 00:55:20.420]   You're rich. I had this person who told me they thought that the average income in their neighborhood
[00:55:20.420 --> 00:55:26.580]   was like $150,000 or something. So I looked it up right on the spot. They were making two times the
[00:55:26.580 --> 00:55:33.940]   average income in their neighborhood. And they, they were like playing boo. Who is me? I will never
[00:55:33.940 --> 00:55:38.180]   let a rich person get away with telling me that they're, they don't have enough money because it's
[00:55:38.180 --> 00:55:42.180]   disrespectful to people who don't have that kind of money. The second problem is they don't know how
[00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:45.780]   to hire anyone to do this. So they have, have somebody come over. One person told me, oh,
[00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:51.620]   she doesn't fold my clothes the same way I do. I'm like, okay, why don't you take a video and video
[00:55:51.620 --> 00:55:56.580]   how you fold your clothes and then anyone will be able to follow it. In other words, be a good manager.
[00:55:56.580 --> 00:56:01.780]   If you want things done, remember my money is good money. I will find somebody who will take my money
[00:56:01.780 --> 00:56:05.780]   and they will do things the way that I want it done. And if the first person won't, that's okay.
[00:56:05.780 --> 00:56:10.980]   I'll pay them and I'll find somebody else. So these are the ways that I see people getting stuck in
[00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:16.260]   traps. They play small. They don't change the work that they're doing. That's the way they're
[00:56:16.260 --> 00:56:22.100]   spending their time. And I see it. I see it happening in lots of different areas of life,
[00:56:22.100 --> 00:56:26.900]   travel, household, all that stuff. This episode is brought to you by Thrive Market.
[00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:30.260]   You know, that feeling when you're standing in the grocery store, staring at labels,
[00:56:30.260 --> 00:56:34.660]   trying to figure out what's actually healthy, but that ingredient list is so confusing.
[00:56:34.660 --> 00:56:38.580]   With two young kids, we are constantly trying to make sure the whole family eats clean,
[00:56:38.580 --> 00:56:43.940]   healthy food, but it can be a lot of work to make that happen. And that's why I love Thrive Market.
[00:56:43.940 --> 00:56:49.220]   They're my go-to online grocery store for getting healthy essentials delivered straight to our door
[00:56:49.220 --> 00:56:53.780]   without ever having to leave the house. Unfortunately, there are over 10,000 food
[00:56:53.780 --> 00:56:58.660]   additives allowed in the US and it's hard to know what's actually safe. So I love that Thrive Market
[00:56:58.660 --> 00:57:03.940]   bans over a thousand harmful ingredients. Their team does all the hard work and makes sure every
[00:57:03.940 --> 00:57:08.980]   product meets high quality clean standards. For example, one product we love from Thrive is Simple
[00:57:08.980 --> 00:57:14.260]   Mills. We feel so good giving it to our kids. Their sea salt almond flour crackers are fantastic,
[00:57:14.260 --> 00:57:20.020]   but lately I just can't stop snacking on their sweet thins. Also, Thrive Market has tons of filters,
[00:57:20.020 --> 00:57:23.860]   so you can easily shop by whatever you need. Whether you want to find what's on sale,
[00:57:23.860 --> 00:57:28.500]   you're looking for gluten-free snacks, or you want some high protein meals. I especially love
[00:57:28.500 --> 00:57:34.180]   that last one because I find the more protein I get, the less likely I am to binge on those Simple
[00:57:34.180 --> 00:57:41.460]   Mills sweet thins. Ready to make the switch? Head to chrishutchins.com/thrivemarket to get 30%

[00:57:47.380 --> 00:57:51.460]   this episode. That was somewhat intentional. But the one thing that I found when it comes to making
[00:57:51.460 --> 00:57:59.140]   big decisions about travel that points has really helped me get better at in being decisive is that
[00:57:59.140 --> 00:58:05.460]   it's very reversible. And so we're thinking about taking this trip to Europe. Oh, we found some flights.
[00:58:05.460 --> 00:58:10.100]   We knew we could cancel it with no fee. So let's just do it. And in the case of the trip to Europe,
[00:58:10.100 --> 00:58:15.300]   we ended up canceling it. But in nine out of 10 times, we don't come back and think,
[00:58:15.300 --> 00:58:19.860]   oh, could we have changed this? Like we're able to be decisive because it's refundable,
[00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:23.860]   which I think is a big decision that people stress out about. And it's not only with points.
[00:58:23.860 --> 00:58:28.740]   A lot of airlines will give you credits now or hotels are refundable. Rental cars are refundable.
[00:58:28.740 --> 00:58:34.820]   So a challenge I'm going to give people around decisiveness with travel is if you find something
[00:58:34.820 --> 00:58:38.740]   that kind of works and it's refundable, just book it now. Like you don't have to
[00:58:38.740 --> 00:58:44.580]   wait until you finalize things. It's kind of out of sight, out of mind. And I think the
[00:58:44.580 --> 00:58:50.580]   thing I love about points aside from the deals is that it makes me more decisive because it makes
[00:58:50.580 --> 00:58:52.900]   things more refundable. Yeah.
[00:58:52.900 --> 00:58:58.100]   You wrote the book, I don't know, 10, 15 years ago, you came out with a new version
[00:58:58.100 --> 00:59:03.460]   in the last few years. Do you think AI or technology is going to make some of this
[00:59:03.460 --> 00:59:06.020]   financial decision-making process easier for people?
[00:59:06.020 --> 00:59:12.180]   I think AI is actually changing it in a really powerful way. So a lot of people, they don't want
[00:59:12.180 --> 00:59:19.860]   to have an entire system operating. I want them to. I love a good system. I know you do too. Some people,
[00:59:19.860 --> 00:59:24.020]   they just don't operate that way. And when it comes to questions like, can I afford to go on this trip?
[00:59:24.020 --> 00:59:30.580]   How much car can we afford? When are we going to be debt free? If I ask somebody who's a full,
[00:59:30.580 --> 00:59:34.820]   I will teach you to be rich reader, they know those answers like the back of their hand. They know the
[00:59:34.820 --> 00:59:38.500]   exact month and date they're going to be debt free. They know it 24 years in the future.
[00:59:38.500 --> 00:59:45.940]   But most people don't. And so to be able to go into an AI tool like one that we're developing and just
[00:59:45.940 --> 00:59:52.420]   be like, tell me the exact month and year that I'm going to be debt free. Whoa, that is pretty cool.
[00:59:52.420 --> 00:59:58.900]   It allows people to make ad hoc specific requests, get an answer. And then of course,
[00:59:59.700 --> 01:00:02.900]   be able to stitch it all together and see the big picture.
[01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:07.620]   I've been pretty amazed at the ability, even if it's not tied into your financial information,
[01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:11.220]   to just start asking questions. Like, you know, if you haven't had a financial planner,
[01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:15.700]   you haven't had a financial advisor, but you just want someone to talk to about your financial situation.
[01:00:15.700 --> 01:00:22.020]   Other than it, it's overly biased seeming to please you. I remember I was trying to come up with a good
[01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:26.660]   question to ask a guest once. And I was like, you know, give me a good couple ideas, gave me a couple
[01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:29.620]   ideas. I was like, I don't like these. What about this? And it's like, Oh, that's great. And I was like,
[01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:35.620]   maybe this sucks. Like, it's not good at pushing back, but it is good at kind of digging around and
[01:00:35.620 --> 01:00:40.820]   answering things and asking questions. I had a friend who told me that she asked it to be nice
[01:00:40.820 --> 01:00:47.620]   to her. And I was like, revolted. I'm like, nice. I told it to stop talking to me. Like, don't use extra
[01:00:47.620 --> 01:00:54.340]   words. Just be terse as possible. I don't need a new friend through my AI tool. Like, give it to me
[01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:58.740]   straight. And that's it. She was revolted. She was like, that's so mean. I'm like, wow,
[01:00:58.740 --> 01:01:03.140]   we are really two different people. Yeah. I mean, I probably just need to say like, Hey,
[01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:08.100]   be critical. Like I'm not, I'm thinking of it like an employee where I'm like, if you see me doing
[01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:11.620]   something wrong, an employee over time is gonna be like, Hey, maybe there's a better way. And
[01:01:11.620 --> 01:01:16.900]   wait, what if you had your AI be me? And you were like, I'm thinking of these purchase decisions.
[01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:20.980]   What would Ramit say? I mean, I think I told you this once. I was like, if you took all the
[01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:25.220]   transcripts of all your episodes and fed it in and say, Hey, here's Ramit. And maybe you could do this
[01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:30.660]   with Gemini with Notebook LM be like, take Ramit's channel and berate me like Ramit might berate me.
[01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:33.300]   Great. It's all love over here. It's all love.
[01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:38.820]   Awesome. So, so one thing I want to leave people with, is there a challenge you would give people,
[01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:45.860]   myself included, as a parting part of this conversation to go focus on and think about over the next week?
[01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:53.860]   I would challenge everybody to whether you are solo or you're with a partner is to sit down and say,
[01:01:53.860 --> 01:02:01.220]   what is one magical thing that we want to do this year and get specific? It's, this is not a dream.
[01:02:01.220 --> 01:02:08.180]   This is actually something you're going to make happen. So it could be as small as we want to both
[01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:14.580]   take a half day off work three months from now. And we're just going to go see a movie in the middle
[01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:18.740]   of the day and go have lunch outside. It could be as small as that could be as big as we want to take
[01:02:18.740 --> 01:02:25.780]   an international trip for a month, whatever you want. I want you to pick something that you can achieve.
[01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:32.260]   It can have no dependencies like, Oh, we need to have this happen. And that happened. Nope.
[01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:36.740]   If that's what you've picked, go smaller so that you could guaranteed make it happen.
[01:02:36.740 --> 01:02:42.660]   I want you to put on the calendar and I want you to make sure that you have some money assigned to it.
[01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:48.340]   Again, it could be as small as $10 to go see a movie, or it could be as big as tens of thousands for a trip.
[01:02:48.340 --> 01:02:53.700]   And when you do that, the time between now and then I want you to start using it to get excited about it.
[01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:58.740]   So if you're going to take a trip, you or you and your partner are sending each other articles,
[01:02:58.740 --> 01:03:02.740]   oh my gosh, we can go on this hike, or I think we should eat at this restaurant. If you're going to
[01:03:02.740 --> 01:03:09.220]   see a movie, you're sending like, which theater are we going to? This might seem theatrical. Why do
[01:03:09.220 --> 01:03:14.100]   we have to talk about movie theaters? We always go to one of the two ones. The point is, you have now
[01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:20.660]   created a vision of what you're going to do. You are now getting excited before you ever get there.
[01:03:20.660 --> 01:03:26.180]   And finally, when you do it, you're going to experience another moment of joy. Whenever I do
[01:03:26.180 --> 01:03:32.340]   something in my rich life, I get three moments of joy. One of them is planning it. One of them is
[01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:38.260]   being there. And then the third one is actually sharing it afterwards, whether it's with friends,
[01:03:38.260 --> 01:03:44.900]   family, just looking at my own photos. This is how we really start to appreciate these moments of awe
[01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:48.740]   that we are engineering for ourselves. That is my challenge.
[01:03:48.740 --> 01:03:53.780]   I love that. I will take that challenge as well. This has been great. Where can people who want to
[01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:57.860]   go deeper on all the things you talk about, all the things you're working on, find it all?
[01:03:57.860 --> 01:04:03.380]   I have a new book out called Money for Couples. You can get that book anywhere. I also have a podcast,
[01:04:03.380 --> 01:04:10.660]   Money for Couples, where every week I go behind closed doors. I have real couples on YouTube and audio.
[01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:16.420]   They show real numbers, how much they make, how much debt they have, where they are spending money.
[01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:20.100]   Sometimes we have people in $500,000 of debt. Sometimes we have people who have millions and
[01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:25.620]   millions of dollars and the stakes are high. So you can find that and any of my other material on any
[01:04:25.620 --> 01:04:30.260]   social media channel. Awesome. Ramit, thank you so much for being here. Thanks a lot.
