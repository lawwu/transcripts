[00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:19.900]   Hi everyone, my name is Tomas, I'm one of the co-founders of Graphite.
[00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.800]   Graphite is an AI code review company.
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.560]   So, to give some context on sort of where we see the industry right now and where we
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.460]   see it going, software development currently and has always had two loops.
[00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.540]   The inner loop, which is focused on development, and the outer loop that's focused on review.
[00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.120]   Developers spend time in the inner loop, they get their code working, they get the feature
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.440]   the way they want it, and then they go ahead and they move it to the outer loop where it's
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.820]   tested, reviewed, merged, deployed.
[00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.160]   We're seeing the inner loop change right now more than we've ever seen it.
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.400]   More developers are using AI than ever, I think right here we have some statistics from the
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.080]   GitHub developer survey.
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:03.860]   Nearly every developer surveyed used AI tools both inside and outside of work, and 46% of
[00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.960]   code on GitHub is being written by Copilot.
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.300]   We're seeing more and more code being written by AI.
[00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.640]   Here, we have some statistics around how code has changed over time and how some people predict
[00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.800]   it will change.
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.620]   And even if we take a more pessimistic view of that, we still see the way the world's going
[00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:26.940]   is just more and more and more code being written by AI.
[00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.080]   The inner loop is changing.
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.080]   You know?
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.360]   AI is making developers more productive.
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.920]   Developers are now producing higher volumes of code.
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.540]   But that code still needs to be reviewed.
[00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.360]   When we first started looking at this, when we first started building Diamond, our AI code
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.580]   reviewer about a year ago now, what we found was that we had a lot of articles that scared
[00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:48.580]   us a lot.
[00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.400]   We were seeing within our own organization a lot of developers adopting AI tools, but we
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.820]   were also seeing a problem.
[00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:00.900]   AI can hallucinate, it can make mistakes, and almost more scarily, it can make security vulnerabilities.
[00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.360]   For us, what we saw was that while the inner loop was getting sped up by AI, the outer loop
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.900]   was rapidly becoming the bottleneck.
[00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:14.200]   We were seeing tools like Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, V0, Bolt, all of those, producing larger
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.500]   volumes of code than we were used to, than we had ever seen before.
[00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.620]   But we were also seeing our developers suddenly have to review higher volumes of code, test higher
[00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.640]   volumes of code, merge higher volumes of code, and deploy higher volumes of code.
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.740]   That's what brought us to say, there has to be a new outer loop here.
[00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.700]   The way that things are going, this isn't going to work, we're going to break down, we're watching
[00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.540]   the problems that used to only ail large companies start to ail all companies, where we were seeing
[00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.700]   companies deal with higher and higher and higher volumes of code.
[00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.740]   The requirements for the new outer loop then look a lot like the problems that larger companies
[00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.380]   have always had to deal with.
[00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.260]   You need tools to better prioritize, track, and get notified about pull requests.
[00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.700]   You need driver assist features to help reviewers focus and streamline the code review process.
[00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.100]   You need optimized CI pipelines and merge queues to be able to handle the sheer volume of
[00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.660]   code changes that are now happening.
[00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.040]   And you need better deployment tools.
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.380]   When we first started looking at this through sort of an AI-first lens, we started to see
[00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.220]   that, well, the problems are being created by AI, they can also probably be solved by AI.
[00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.600]   We can probably start to streamline a lot of these processes which have previously had been manual.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.100]   Previously were parts of the process that developers did not enjoy, did not want to do.
[00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.180]   We wanted to see self-driving code review solutions where we no longer had to do those very manual
[00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.860]   and painful parts of review, but we could actually start to really focus on what matters most
[00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.540]   to the developers, making sure that your product can get out to users and that the features work
[00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.440]   as expected.
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.400]   We were seeing that AI-generated feedback wasn't perfect.
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.800]   And because of that, we were starting to think that bots weren't enough.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.880]   I think an early vision of ours was, well, can we solve this by just adding AI teammates?
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.880]   Right?
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:53.560]   Maybe it's background agents.
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.560]   Maybe it's reviewers.
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.560]   Maybe it's a whole lot of teammates to the workflow.
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.640]   And while we think that's part of the story, we don't think that's enough.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.880]   We think that, as we built with Diamond, that your entire tool chain has to be AI-native,
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.380]   not just your IDE.
[00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.440]   If you really are going to embrace AI in the age of development, if you're going to accept
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.540]   the fact that developers are going to be orders of magnitude more productive than they ever
[00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.120]   have before, you need tooling that reflects that.
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.580]   We started by building Diamond, so the winning AI code review platform, with high signal, low
[00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.340]   noise, as a deep understanding of the code base and change history.
[00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.500]   We summarize, prioritize, and review each change, and we integrate with your CI and your testing
[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:36.400]   infrastructure to summarize errors and correct failures.
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.740]   Our hope with it, and what we've started to see as we've rolled it out to larger and larger
[00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:46.540]   customers and enterprises, too, is we reduce code review cycles, we enforce quality and consistency,
[00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.680]   and we keep your code private and secure.
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.460]   It's high signal, it's zero setup, it's actionable with one-click suggestions, and it's customizable.
[00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.180]   It's already being used by some of the fastest-moving companies in the world, it's expanding a lot
[00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:04.460]   more than we can even say publicly, and I hope that you all will embrace the idea that AI can
[00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.920]   change your entire developer workflow, not just your IDE.
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:14.780]   By the numbers, we see comments that our AI bot leaves to be downloaded at less than a 4% rate,
[00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.820]   and to be accepted, meaning integrated into the pull request that they were left on, at a
[00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.680]   higher rate than human comments are.
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.760]   Human comments are integrated about somewhere between 45 and 50%.
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.080]   We're watching our Diamond comments be accepted about 52%, and we've spent a lot of time tuning
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.080]   that.
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.680]   That number is actually new as of March for us.
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.380]   That's what I have to tell you around Graphite, what I have to tell you around Diamond.
[00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.480]   I hope you give it a shot, and thanks for having me.
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.960]   We'll see you next time.
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.960]   We'll see you next time.
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:44.960]   Bye.
