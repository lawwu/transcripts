[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   [music]
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   Welcome everyone to Bogle Heads-On Investing episode number 67.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   Today our topic is taxes.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   And our special guest is Kay Thomas.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   Kay is a long-time tax attorney who has written several books,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   including the book we'll focus on today,
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   "Capital Gains, Minimal Taxes."
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   [music]
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   Hi everyone, my name is Rick Ferry,
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   and I am the host of Bogle Heads-On Investing.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   This episode, as with all episodes,
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   is brought to you by the John C. Bogle Center for Financial Literacy,
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   a non-profit organization that is building a world of well-informed,
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   capable, and empowered investors.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   Visit the Bogle Center at boglecenter.net,
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   where you will find a treasure trove of information,

[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   Today's episode is about taxes.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   And I have a saying.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   If you hate paying taxes,
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   then you should love learning about taxes,
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   because that's the way you reduce your taxes.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   My guest today is Kay A. Thomas,
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   and he knows a lot about taxes.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Kay's law degree is from Harvard University,
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   where he served on the Harvard Law Review
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   and graduated cum laude in 1980.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   He spent his career as a tax attorney,
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   dealing with complex matters relating to business transactions,
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   finance, and compensation.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   Kay now spends his time as a writer, publisher, public speaker,
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   and consultant on topics relating to taxation and investments.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   He has written several books, including Capital Gains, Minimum Taxes.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   The book we'll be focusing on today.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   His other books include Go Roth!
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   A Guide to the Roth IRA and Other Roth Accounts,
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   and Consider Your Options!
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   A Plain Language Guide to Company Stock and Stock Option Compensation Plans.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Kay also maintains a website, Fairmark.com,
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   where he provides free plain language guidance
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   on the taxation of investments, taxes in retirement,
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   kids in taxes, taxes on stock option compensation, and much more.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   So with no further ado, let me welcome Kay Thomas.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Thank you so much for having me. It's an honor to be here.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   You've done a fantastic job writing about taxes in plain English.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   It's really difficult to find good investment tax books.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   So I want to thank you for being on the show today.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Can you tell our listeners a little bit more about you and your books?
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   First of all, I got into taxes.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   That's a little bit of a nerdy area among lawyers.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   In the tax area, I tended to gravitate toward investment side of things.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   And so I found myself doing quite a lot of that,
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   both for partnerships and individual investors
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   and people who had stock options.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   So that created a locus of interesting topics for me to write about.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   And I became interested in the Internet at a fairly early time in the 1990s.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   So I was trying to figure out how I could start a website
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   and just doing it as a hobby.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   I was still a full-time lawyer at that time.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   And I started thinking about what are things that I'm knowledgeable about
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   that people do not have very good guidance about them.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   And so I started writing it.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   And at that time, there was very little competition for this kind of thing.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   So the website became fairly successful.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   As I had written a number of topics on the website,
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   I started to think about putting out my first book.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   And one of the things I had written about quite a bit was employee stock options.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   And that's what I chose for my first book,
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   which was called Consider Your Options.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   And that came out in the year 2000.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Those of us who are old enough will remember that the year 2000
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   was a heyday for the Internet boom.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   And at that time, there was so much interest in stock options
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   that this book just took off like crazy.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   And it also happened to be the time when Amazon was just really becoming very popular.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   And early adopters of Amazon tended to be people who had stock options.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   And so the book was one of the best sellers on Amazon for a time.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   And honestly, I thought publishing was very easy.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   I couldn't understand why people thought,
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   "Oh, it's hard to make money writing books."
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   I'd heard that many times, and I couldn't understand it
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   because it just seemed like printing money.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   All you do, you write the book, you put it out there, and it sells like crazy.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   So then I learned it was a little bit harder.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   My second book was the Capital Gains book.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   And that was successful, but nothing like the Stock Options book.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   And I learned that I had to work for a living.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   It is a lot of work to explain taxes in non-technical language,
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   make it readable, not just understandable, but readable,
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   so that people don't have to slog through it in order to get to the main points.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   So that was a challenge, but I thought I was fairly good at it,
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   and the book has done reasonably well over the years.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   The edition that I read was 2023 with all of the new tax information in it.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Yes, I try to update all of my books.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   My books are tax-related, and people don't really trust a tax book
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   that's been written many years earlier.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   And when did you write the Roth book, Go Roth?
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   What enticed you to write that, and why did you write about it?
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   The Roth originated about the time when I was really trying to get my website going.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   And initially, there was not a tremendous amount of information about the Roth.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   I thought that a book about Roth would be helpful.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   Initially, I had another book, a more limited book about Roth IRAs.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   I called it the Fairmark Guide to Roth IRAs.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   But then I wrote this book, Go Roth, to go right through the lifespan of a Roth,
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   from creation of it to making contributions to managing while it's in place
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   and then taking distributions from it.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   Well, we're going to get to some of this later on,
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   but the focus today is going to be on capital gains, minimal taxes.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   The updated edition, 2023.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   And just to make sure we're all on the same sheet of music,
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   we do have to begin with the basics of taxation.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   And so I am the government.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   I love to collect taxes.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   And I, the government, have come up with many, many ways to collect taxes--
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   minimum tax, capital gains tax, net investment income tax,
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   turn of the minimum tax.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   So I want to go through them very quickly.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   Let's say we start with just income tax.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   All right, we have, since 2017, tax brackets that go from 10% up to 37%.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   Those are the basic federal income tax brackets--
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   10% for people with very modest income,
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   but 12% gets you into a more substantial amount.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   Then it's 24%, 32%, 35%, and 37%.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   And the break points that are most interesting there,
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   you go from 12% to 22%.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   That's a huge difference in tax rate.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   If you happen to be at the border between those two tax rates,
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   you've got a 10% difference, and you need to be really paying attention
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   to anything that you can do to avoid going up into the 22% bracket
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   or keeping yourself down as much as possible into the 12% bracket.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   We also have a break between the 24% and 32% brackets.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   So that's 8 percentage points, another really big one.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   And that's an area where, once again,
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   you want to be paying very close attention
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   to whether you can manage your income.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   Can you make an additional 401(k) contribution
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   to avoid paying that 32% rate
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   as opposed to having all of your income taxed at 24% or less?
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   So those are the two important ones.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   The other ones are much smaller, obviously 22% to 24%.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   It's not completely negligible,
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   but it's not anywhere near as important.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   And similarly for the other differences in tax brackets.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   If we have capital gains,
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   or we have dividends that are treated as capital gains,
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   that's a completely different set of brackets.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   Yes, it is.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   And we have the 0, 15%, and 20% brackets for capital gains.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   0% roughly corresponds, it used to exactly correspond,
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   and now it very closely corresponds
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   to the 10 and 12% brackets for ordinary income.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   The 15% bracket takes you up into a fairly high level of income
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   and doesn't correspond exactly to a tax bracket,
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   but in a pretty high income level
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   is where you start paying the 20% rate.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   And then there's another tax on top of that.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   Well, if you're single and you make more than $200,000 a year,
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   or if you're married, filing jointly, and you make more than $250,000,
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   and this is kind of a stealthy tax,
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   it's called a net investment income tax.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   What is that?
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   Net investment income tax was put in
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   as part of the way to pay for the Affordable Care Act,
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   what some of us call Obamacare.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   It really kind of matches up with Medicare tax
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   that you would otherwise pay on other kinds of income,
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   and so it's trying to make sure
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   almost all kinds of income are going to contribute
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   in one way or another toward health care.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   And this tax at 3.8% can hit capital gains,
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   it can hit dividends, it can hit interest income,
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   short-term capital gains and long-term capital gains.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   This is why people will say that capital gain taxes
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   go up to 23.8% instead of just up to 20%.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   One point about this is that $200,000 break point
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   that you mentioned where the net investment income tax
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   clicks in for single investors
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   and $250,000 for married filing jointly,
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   those are not indexed for inflation.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   And so that's something that wears away every year a little bit
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   and brings more people into paying it.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   And let's get into another tax,
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   and this is called the alternative minimum tax,
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   and this can hit people who have very large capital gains
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   or perhaps had stock option compensation.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   So what is this tax?
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   This tax originally came into existence
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   out of a notion that there were people with very high incomes
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   who pay either nothing or very little in the way of taxes.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   It seemed unfair to some in Congress
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   that there would be this disparity
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   where people with very modest incomes
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   would be paying a substantial portion of that income
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   in the form of taxes,
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   and yet people with much higher incomes
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   would pay little or nothing.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   And so this tax was instituted
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   as a way to require that everyone will pay
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   at least some minimum amount of tax.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   That's where the word "minimum" comes from in here,
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   and the word "alternative" has to do with the notion
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   that we figure out how much tax you should have to pay
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   under how much your minimum amount of tax would be
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   by using an alternative calculation.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   And so we step aside into a not entirely different
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   but quite different set of rules
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   for determining what your tax is.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   The tax rates here are 26% and 28%.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   You have a special deduction
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   called the minimum tax exemption,
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   but at the same time you are denied
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   many of the tax deductions and tax benefits
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   that you would otherwise get under the regular income tax.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   And the notion being,
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   those are the deductions and credits
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   that are allowing people who are very wealthy
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   to avoid paying alternative minimum tax.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   Now this used to be a very big problem
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   for a large number of people
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   because the alternative minimum tax
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   did away with certain items that were claimed by many people,
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   such as personal exemptions,
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   the state and local income tax deduction,
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   and so people who have a lot of those kinds of deductions
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   would be paying alternative minimum tax
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   even though they were not necessarily very wealthy.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   This was substantially changed in the 2017 tax law
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   where the minimum tax exemption amount became much larger
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   and the place where that starts to phase out
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   happens at a much higher income tax level.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   Now the alternative minimum tax
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   affects a much smaller number of people.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   It tends to be mainly people who exercise
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   a kind of stock option called incentive stock option.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   If you have that type of option
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   and exercise it for a very large profit,
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   then you do need to deal with the alternative minimum tax
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   and my book Consider Your Options
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   talks about how to plan for that.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   Other types of people generally don't have to
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   concern themselves with alternative minimum tax
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   for the most part,
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   although it's still possible with certain types of tax benefits
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   and particularly a large capital gain
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   can bring someone into paying alternative minimum tax
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   and the reason for that is that it causes
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   a phasing out of this minimum tax exemption.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   I know all this is kind of abstract,
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   it's kind of hard to talk about and understand,
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   but that's the picture.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   All these different taxes, the income tax, capital gain tax,
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   net investment income tax, alternative minimum tax,
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   there's a lot of different ways the government can tax us directly,
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   but there's also back doorways and that is phase-outs.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   As you make more money,
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   your tax credits that you may get get phased out,
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   the tax deductions that you may have get phased out,
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   you're a business owner
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   and you're getting the qualified business income deduction
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   that gets phased out.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   Also, if you make more money and you're retired,
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   more of your Social Security becomes taxable
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   and you end up paying more in Medicare costs through IRMA.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   So could you kind of talk about these back doorways
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   of which you can end up paying taxes?
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   Right.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   The IRMA, of course, is not exactly a tax,
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   but it's something that plays off
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   of actually your adjusted gross income
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   and causes you to pay a potentially significant amount
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   of additional premium.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   So your Medicare premium can be substantially larger
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   as a result of this.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   I mean, if your income is just very large every year,
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   there's nothing you can do about paying this additional amount.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   But if you have a very large amount of additional income
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   in a particular year,
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   for example, you decided to do a Roth conversion.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   A Roth conversion can be a wonderful planning device,
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   but it can cause you to run into the additional premium
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   that you pay under Medicare as a result of IRMA.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   Now, you can deal with that by going to the Medicare website,
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   obtaining the forms that you need to file,
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   and say, "Look, my income for this one year was higher,
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   but now my income has gone back and it's a normal income
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   and I shouldn't be paying this higher premium
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   because it doesn't reflect the income that I have right now."
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   There's this two-year lag in IRMA,
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   and the reason for that is that they need to have
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   your tax information before they figure that out.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   The only tax information they have for you right now in 2024
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   is your tax return from 2022.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   So it's two years ago that they have your tax information.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   So there is this two-year lag.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   You can deal with the situation
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   if your income was very high for one year
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   and it has gone down by the time the higher IRMA Medicare premium
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   has clicked into effect,
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   but very often you simply want to try to do planning
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   to avoid having that happen in the first place.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   That form is SSA-44.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   Just type SSA-44 into an Internet search engine
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   and a form will come up.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   You fill it out, you send it to the Social Security office,
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   and within a few months,
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   hopefully they will revert back to the lower premium amount.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   Yes, thank you for that.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   As to the other phase-outs,
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   there are really too many of them to comprehensively cover here,
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   but the thing that I would mention
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   is that most of them play off
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   against what's called modified adjusted gross income.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   And there are different modifications for different rules,
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   but almost all of them involve foreign income.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   If you have foreign income that has been excluded
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   for one reason or another,
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   then you have to include that back in
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   for purposes of that phase-out.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   A few of them, like the Social Security taxation,
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   will also include tax-exempt income.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   But for the most part,
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   we're talking about adjusted gross income,
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   which is your income before itemized deductions.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   And you can think about,
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   if you're running into one of these phase-outs,
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   whether there's something you can do
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   to your adjusted gross income.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   And, of course, retirement savings.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   Boosting your retirement savings
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   is one of the ways to do that.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   Obviously, that would have to be
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   in a traditional retirement account and not a Roth,
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   because the Roth provides no deduction.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   But let's go ahead and get into that.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   The different types of ways you could save
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   where you do get a tax benefit
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   either now or ongoing or in the future.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   And what I'm talking about is
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   there are different types of retirement accounts.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   One that you can invest in pre-tax
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   and you get tax deferral.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   And then when you take the money out, you are taxed.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   The others are putting money in pre-tax
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   and getting tax-free gain.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   And then when you take the money out later on, tax-free.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   I'm speaking about an HSA account.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   And then there are after-tax accounts
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   you could put money into
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   where it's either tax-deferred or tax-free.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   And at the end, when you take the money out,
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   it's either non-taxable
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   or only the interest portion is taxable.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   So just go over quickly the different types of accounts
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   that people can put money into
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   to either reduce their current taxes
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   or reduce taxes ongoing,
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   on investment gains,
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   or reduce taxes at the end
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   when they take the money out.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   Five different potential models
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   for taxation of investment accounts.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   The simplest ones to understand,
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   first of all, the fully taxable account.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   Your income that you have in there,
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   income and capital gains,
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   are going to be currently taxable.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   The Roth account,
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   you get no deduction for the money going in,
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   but it's entirely tax-free
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   if you follow the rules.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   All your investment gains will be tax-free.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   We have the traditional retirement account
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   that we're used to.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   That's the one where you get a deduction
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   when the money comes in.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   It grows tax-deferred,
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   but it's going to be taxable
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   when the money comes out.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   And we have the HSA,
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   which, as you mentioned,
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   that's the gold standard,
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   but it has somewhat limited reach right now.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   But anyone who has it available
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   should really give some thought
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   to studying up on it
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   and whether they want to be in it,
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   because it provides that unique situation
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   where you get a deduction for the money going in,
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   tax-deferred growth,
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   and then the opportunity to take that money out,
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   tax-free at the end as well.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   Again, all subject to limitations,
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   but that is the one type of account for that.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   I've mentioned four,
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   and the fifth model is
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   when you make a non-deductible contribution
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   to a traditional retirement account,
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   that produces its own set of results.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   I think one of the key things to understand here
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   is that the taxable account
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   isn't as bad as it might seem
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   compared to the tax-favored accounts,
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   because you can actually get a lower tax rate
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   with a buy-and-hold strategy,
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   which I know is what many Bogleheads are looking for.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   That long-term deferral of capital gains
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   as you grow your capital gains
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   over a period of many years
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   in a taxable account
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   in effect lowers the tax rate
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   that you're going to pay
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   on those capital gains in the end.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   You may pay the same actual rate,
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   that 20% rate, let's say,
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   if you're at the top bracket,
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   but deferring that tax
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   over a period of many years
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   can have the effect of lowering that
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   as an effective rate to 18% or 16% or lower,
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   depending on how long you held that stock
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   or other investment
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   and how well that investment performed
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   over that period of time.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   One of the investments that we often highlight
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   to go into a taxable account
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   is a simple total stock market index fund,
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   which, if it's in an ETF format,
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   what I'm thinking of
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   is the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   The ticker is VTI.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   If this goes into a taxable account,
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   there are no capital gain distributions
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   in the fund.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   The dividends on it are only about 1.5%.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   Most of that dividend is a qualified dividend,
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   which, as we'll talk about in a minute,
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   is treated as a long-term capital gain.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   This is a very tax-efficient,
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   broadly diversified index fund
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   for a taxable account.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   Usually, when we're talking about investing
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   on the Bogleheads Forum
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   and we're talking about taxable accounts,
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   this fund often comes up.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   I have to admit,
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   because I got into investing
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   at a time when ETFs were really just coming out,
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   so I don't have ETFs
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   as part of my own main investments,
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   but I do understand the advantage here
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   because of the way they operate.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   When people cash out of ETFs,
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   the ETF does not have to sell its own investments
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   and create gains for its investors,
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   whereas an index fund,
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   and especially a managed fund,
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   would have to incur in capital gains
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   that have to be distributed to investors
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   whenever their investors start cashing out.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   Unfortunately for Vanguard investors,
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   the ETF and the mutual fund are the same.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   They are just share classes of the one fund,
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   so the tax benefits
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   extend to the opened-end index funds as well,
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   and that's not true for almost all other fund companies.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   They have a separation
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   between their index mutual funds
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   and their index ETFs,
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   and theoretically, the index mutual fund
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   could actually create a capital gain tax,
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   whereas that same company, same fund company,
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   had an ETF following the same index.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   It typically wouldn't happen,
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   but with Vanguard, it just happens to be
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   that both the ETF and the fund,
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   it's a unique structure.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   They're all taxed the same,
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   and so the opened-end index fund
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   gets the tax benefit of the ETF.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   And if you bought funds that had low dividend yield,
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   that works even better.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   And of course, in the end, too,
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   if you own these funds when you passed away,
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   right now we get a stepped-up basis on death,
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   so all of that capital gain
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   goes on to the next generation
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   or whomever's going to inherit the stock
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   or the ETFs at no tax.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   So let's just talk about that for a second,
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   the step-up on death.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   That is a huge benefit
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   for people who do hold assets
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   that are going to pass to the next generation
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   that are highly appreciated.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   This has been in place for many years.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   There was one attempt to do away with it,
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   and for one year, they did away with it.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   I think it was the year 1979,
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   and it was such a disaster
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   that Congress immediately did an about-face
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   and went back to having this stepped-up basis at death.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   For many years afterward, we had to say,
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   "Well, did this person die in '79?"
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   and deal with whatever problems came up
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   as a result of that one-year repeal.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   And there's still some talk about trying to do something
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   that would rein in this tax benefit
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   because it is such a huge benefit.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   So this is one of the ways
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   of completely avoiding capital gain tax.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   Another is donating appreciated assets to charity.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   And those two are really major ways
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   of benefiting from special treatment
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   of long-term capital gains.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   We mentioned doing Roth conversions.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   I want to talk about why it's more beneficial
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   to do Roth conversions before taking Social Security
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   and before hitting required minimum distribution age
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   on your pre-tax retirement funds.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   So can you talk first about what Roth conversions are
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   and then when you should do them
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   and when maybe you should not do them?
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   Roth conversion is the transfer of money or assets
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   from a traditional retirement account into a Roth account.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   Now, in the traditional account,
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   you received a deduction when the money went in.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   So when that money goes to a Roth,
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   you need to pay tax on those dollars.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   And the general rule is you don't want to pay tax
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   any sooner than necessary.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   And so some people are immediately skeptical
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   of even considering the idea of a Roth conversion.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   We've just talked about the benefit
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   of avoiding paying tax earlier than necessary
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   on a capital gain for all the benefits
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   that you get from deferring that capital gain.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   So why would you do a Roth conversion?
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   This kind of starts from what I call the parity principle,
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   which is that a Roth can produce exactly the same results
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   as a traditional retirement account
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   if certain things are true.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   And those things are that the tax rate
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   remains the same at all times.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   The dollar amount that goes into the Roth
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   is the same dollar amount that was in the traditional account
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   reduced by the amount of tax
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   that is imposed on that conversion.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   The amount of time invested remains the same.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   And the fourth thing that has to be the same
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   is the investment results are the same.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   If you do all those four things together,
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   you get exact parity between those two.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   And the tendency has been to focus on the tax rates
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   and saying, well, the tax rate that is imposed
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   on the Roth conversion should not be higher
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   than the tax rate that you would have
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   on withdrawal of those assets during retirement.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   And that's generally true.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   It's a pretty good rule of thumb,
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   but it's not the whole story.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   The second one that I mentioned
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   was that the dollars going into the Roth
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   in order to achieve this exact parity
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   have to be the same number of dollars
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   reduced by the amount of tax,
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   and yet you're not required to reduce those dollars
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   by the amount of tax.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   So to make this simple,
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   if you have $100,000 in a traditional retirement account
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   and $100,000 in a Roth retirement account,
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   that $100,000 in the Roth is worth more.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   You're going to take that out tax-free
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   during retirement, or your heirs will.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   That $100,000 in the traditional retirement account
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   is going to bear some tax when it comes out,
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   and so it's worth less.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   And so the Roth account is actually larger.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   It may have the same dollar amount in it,
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   but in terms of usable assets,
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   it's larger than the traditional retirement account.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   And that's where we start thinking
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   about all the benefits of a Roth conversion.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   But we would want to do these
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   before we start taking RMDs
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   because RMDs, you cannot put that into a Roth.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   And maybe before you start taking Social Security
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   because that closes the window a little bit
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   because Social Security becomes taxable
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   and anything that you take out of a retirement account
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   just increases your ordinary income,
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   which could make more of your Social Security taxable.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   So could you talk about, say you retired early,
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   should you start then?
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   Yeah, it's one of these very forward-looking planning ideas
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   of making the Roth conversion, as you said,
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   before Social Security.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   I do want to mention, though,
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   that there are circumstances
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   where you can do a Roth conversion,
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   even in retirement, and it can be beneficial.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   Even after you've started RMDs
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   and you're into that whole later years of your retirement,
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   you can still potentially benefit from a Roth conversion.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   You do have to be careful.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   The first dollars that come out of your traditional account
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   are going to be treated as your RMD.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   And so if you make a mistake
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   and convert the first dollars that you take out,
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   do the conversion before taking your RMD,
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   that's a mistake I've seen fairly often,
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   then you've got a bad conversion
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   because you have converted dollars
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   that you're not allowed to convert
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   because you cannot convert RMD dollars.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   However, after you get beyond that,
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   you've taken your RMD,
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   now you take your Roth conversion.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   What you're doing, if you can pay tax on that conversion
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   with dollars that you have
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   otherwise sitting in a taxable account,
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   now, in effect, you've moved dollars
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   out of your taxable account and into a Roth IRA.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   And that, of course, is a very beneficial thing to be doing.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   The impact may not be huge,
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   but again, it's one of those little tax planning scenarios
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   that people tend to overlook
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   because they're getting into those years
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   where they think, "Oh, Roth conversion is no longer for me."
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   I want to take a moment here
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   to talk about qualified charitable distributions.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   And this is where, if you're 70 1/2,
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   you can take up to $100,000 per year per person
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   from your IRA and donate it directly to a charity.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   It can't go to a donor advised fund.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   It has to go directly to a charity.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   And you're not taxed on this money.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   Now, when you hit RMD age at either 73 to 75,
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   then the amount that you gave to charity
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   as a qualified charitable distribution
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   is deducted from your RMD amount.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   So if you gave $25,000 to a charity
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   directly from your IRA and your RMD was $35,000,
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   you would only have to take a $10,000 RMD.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   Now, the trick here, though,
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   is you have to make the contribution to the charity first,
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   and then you make the RMD second.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   You can't do it the other way around.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   You can't do the RMD first
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   and then the charitable contribution second.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   Which is, by the way, the exact opposite
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   of what we just talked about,
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   which is if you're going to do a Roth conversion from your IRA,
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   you have to do that after doing your RMD, not before.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   So remember, QCDs must be done before you do your RMD,
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   whereas Roth conversions are done after you do your RMD.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   Clear as mud, as we used to say in the Marine Corps.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   I've got one other K.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   So let's say that you are past required minimum distribution age,
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   but you're still working for a company.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   This is a company that you do not own more than 5% of.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   It could be a nonprofit and it's a 403(b).
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   They could have a 401(k).
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   But you are working for this company
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   and you're participating in their 401(k) or their 403(b).
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   You do not have to take required minimum distributions
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   from that 401(k) or 403(b) for as long as you work there.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   So if you work there until you're 85,
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   you don't have to do RMDs from that account.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   Now, the IRS also allows you to take IRA money
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   and old 401(k) or 403(b) money
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   and roll it into your current employer's 401(k).
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   So technically, any money that you roll into that 401(k),
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   also you wouldn't have to take an RMD from.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   That's right, Rick.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   And you're making it sound attractive for me
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   to go back to work in a law firm.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   But the prospect of doing all those billable hours
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   just makes that hard.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   And I have to mention here that anything we talk about
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   on this podcast is strictly informational.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   You need to check with your tax advisor
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   to see if these strategies work for you.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   All right, let's get into the title of your book,
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   "Capital Gains."
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   And here it can get complicated.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   We have long-term capital gains, short-term capital gains.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   How do the taxes work?
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   So short- and long-term capital gains
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   are basically the differences between
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   whether you've held your investment
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   for more than a year.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   And we have to be specific about saying
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   it is more than a year and not just one year.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   You have to sell no sooner than the anniversary
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   of the day after you acquired your asset
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   in order to have a long-term capital gain.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   There are various circumstances that can cause
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   an adjustment in your holding period,
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   but that's the basic rule.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   Now, generally speaking, a long-term capital gain
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   is going to be more favorable than a short-term capital gain
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   because of the favorable tax rates
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   that we spoke about earlier for long-term capital gains.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   Short-term capital gains are going to be taxed
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   at the same rates as ordinary income.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   But there are various rules that cause these to interact.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   If you have a combination of short-term
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   and long-term capital gains and capital losses,
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   then you're going to net the long-term capital gains
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   against your long-term capital losses.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   And this is why a capital loss is actually more favorable
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   if it's short-term, whereas a capital gain
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   is more favorable if it's long-term.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   Now, once you've done all that netting out,
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   if you have a net long-term capital gain,
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   that's when you get the favorable tax result.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   And if you have a capital loss,
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   it's going to be deductible,
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   but only to the extent of $3,000.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   And this, by the way, is one of those strange items
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   that is not indexed for inflation.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   Almost all of the dollar amounts that are in the tax law
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   are indexed for inflation, but this one is not.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   So we've had this $3,000 going back to the Reagan administration,
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   and if you adjusted this for inflation since then,
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   I don't know what the dollar amount is now,
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   it's probably $15,000 or more,
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   but we're still stuck with only $3,000
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   as a potential deduction for capital loss.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   That's an important fact for people who have variation
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   in their capital gains and losses
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   that they recognize each year.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   Because if you have a large capital gain one year
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   and a large capital loss the next year,
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   there's no carryback.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   You've already paid tax on your capital gain,
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   and this capital loss,
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   you're only going to deduct $3,000 of it,
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   and so this is what we call a capital loss whipsaw.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   And it's a very unfavorable situation.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   The opposite is not as much of a problem.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   If you have a large capital loss one year,
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   you do carry it forward,
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   and you can use that against capital gain in the next year.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   So it's very important if you have these kind of variations
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   in your capital gains and capital losses
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   to keep this in mind,
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   that you can only deduct $3,000 of your loss.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   Now a lot of people think, and incorrectly,
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   that the dividends you get from stock,
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   which are treated as long-term capital gains,
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   some of them the qualified dividends that you get,
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   are treated as long-term capital gain for tax purposes,
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   but they don't get offset by capital losses, correct?
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   Yes, that's absolutely right.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   Long-term capital gains do get offset by capital losses,
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   including even short-term capital losses,
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   if they exceed your short-term capital gains.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   But none of that will offset a qualified dividend.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   Qualified dividend benefits from the long-term capital gain rates,
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   but not the full capital loss treatment.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   So I want to get into something that would help
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   if you had capital gain,
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   and that is to have done tax loss harvesting,
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   which is basically if something goes down in value
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   and you've got a capital loss,
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   sell it and replace it with something that is close,
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   but not substantially identical.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   So could you cover tax loss harvesting
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   and what substantially identical actually means?
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   Well, the concept of tax loss harvesting is,
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   as you described, something has gone down in value,
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   you're going to sell it.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   And a lot of people think about doing this
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   just at the end of the year.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   They're reviewing their investments.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   Should I sell something before the end of the year
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   in order to get a deduction?
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   But the reality is that tax loss harvesting
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   that is done throughout the year can be more beneficial.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   I've seen some research on this where they did projections
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   and worked out that a portfolio
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   in which tax loss harvesting is done at reasonable intervals,
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   you don't want to be doing it every day,
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   can outperform a simple buy and hold portfolio
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   for a number of years by up to one percentage point,
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   100 basis points.
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   That gradually wears away over a number of years.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   And that's for the simple reason that the stock market
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   over many years will go up in value
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   and most of what you have in your portfolio
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   will be stocks that have gone up.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   And so your opportunity to be benefiting
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   from tax loss harvesting does kind of wear away
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   over a period of time.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   But on a brand new portfolio,
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   tax loss harvesting can produce a very substantial benefit
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   and Bogleheads certainly know that one percentage point
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   or 100 basis points is a really big deal.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   And to be able to do that over several years
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   can be highly beneficial to your long-term financial health.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   So that's basically the idea.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   Now what constrains this primarily
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   is something called the wash/sale rule.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   And in simple terms, the wash/sale rule says
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   that if you sell a security at a loss
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   and buy a substantially identical security
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   within 30 days before or after,
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   then you don't get to claim that loss.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   The loss gets added to the basis
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   of whatever you bought as a replacement,
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   but you don't get to claim that loss on your tax return.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   So this creates something of a stumbling block
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   for the people who are into tax loss harvesting.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   We have a 61-day period.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   It's the day of the sale, 30 days before, and 30 days after.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   So you have to be very careful about measuring that
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   if what you're looking to do is sell
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   and then go back to the same exact investment
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   or something that is substantially identical.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   In your book, you gave March 31st as a good example.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   If you sold it on March 31st,
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   it means you couldn't have bought it in March
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   or you couldn't have bought it in April,
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   which is only 30 days, and I thought it was a great example.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   Right. Well, thank you for that.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   So substantially identical.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   Yes, substantially identical is something
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   that has not been fully defined ever.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   And there is one ruling out there
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   where the IRS talks about a situation
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   where a takeover is pending,
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   and it has not yet closed.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   And the two stocks that are involved in the takeover
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   are going to trade exactly in tandem.
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   They say that even though these are different stocks,
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   they are going to be treated as substantially identical,
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   and that makes a lot of sense,
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   that you shouldn't be able to sell one at a loss
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   and buy the other one when you are really
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   trading into the same situation that you traded out of.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   The place where questions come up a lot
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   is mutual funds, in particular index funds.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   Can I sell one total market index fund
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   and buy a different one from a different company,
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   and will those be considered substantially identical?
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   And the IRS has never ruled on this.
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   And of course there are related questions
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   about overlapping index funds,
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   or you take a total market fund
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   and replace it with a small cap and a large cap index fund
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   that together add up to that total market fund.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   There are no rulings on this.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   What I say in my book is that
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   unless you want to be a wise guy
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   and play loose with the rules,
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   you are going to treat it as substantially identical
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   if the two investments,
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   once you lay one on top of the other,
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   they are going to perform exactly the same.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   If you know the investments are going to perform the same,
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   that was the basis for that one ruling
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   that I mentioned by the IRS,
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   and so those are what are going to be
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   or should be treated as a wash sales situation.
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   The IRS doesn't have a way of tracking this realistically,
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   but if your return gets audited for some other reason
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   and they see that you were kind of a wise guy about this,
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   they may decide to go after you.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   Okay.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   Well, I'm a wise guy.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   If I sell the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund,
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   which is run by Vanguard
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   and tracks the CRISP Total Stock Market Index,
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   which is the Center for Research and Security Prices,
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   an affiliate of the University of Chicago,
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   and I take a loss and I buy
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   the Fidelity Total Stock Market Index Fund,
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   which tracks the Dow Jones Total Stock Market Index,
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   which is owned by Standard & Poor's,
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   neither the index provider nor the index fund provider
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   are similar or affiliated.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   And to me, that means they are not substantially identical.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   But again, I'm a wise guy.
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   Yeah, and I have no problem with that.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   Perhaps using the wise guy,
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   that's sort of characterization.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   Forget about it.
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   I don't mean to imply that that means you're cheating.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   You're playing in an area
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   where the IRS probably wouldn't like it.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   I'll put it that way, if they took a close look at it.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   As you said, the IRS has never said anything
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   about mutual funds or particularly index funds,
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   which have been around now for 45 years.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   I wish they would say something and just get it over with,
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   but so far we've heard nothing.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   So it's up to each person to make their own decision,
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   with the help of their tax advisor, of course.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   In the last few minutes we have left,
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   I want to talk about dividends.
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   There's different types of dividends.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   We're all getting our 1099s and we already got them.
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   1099-DIV or 1099-INT, which is for interest,
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   and there's ordinary dividends,
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   there's capital gain distributions,
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   non-qualified dividends, qualified dividends,
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   exempt dividends.
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   I mean, all kinds of different dividends.
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   Could you give us a kind of litany of what is this all about?
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   For the most part, individual stocks are going to pay
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   ordinary dividends, which will be qualified
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   if you hold the stock for 61 days.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   You don't have to hold it for 61 days before the dividend,
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   but you have to hold it for a total of 61 days
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   in order to get that qualified dividend treatment.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   Mutual funds, their dividends can include a variety of items.
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   If the mutual fund has interest income,
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   that will come out as an ordinary non-qualified dividend.
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   So technically it's not interest,
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   but it is treated essentially the same as interest.
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   It's ordinary income and it's going to be taxed
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   at ordinary rates.
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   If the mutual fund has received qualified dividend,
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   then that qualified dividend can be passed through
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   to the shareholders of that mutual fund.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   Those shareholders, again, have to hold for 61 days
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   in order to get the qualified treatment.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   We get into more interesting aspects with, for example,
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   if you have a mutual fund that pays out tax-exempt income.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   If the mutual fund invests in municipals,
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   then it's going to have tax-exempt interest.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   It can pass that through as tax-exempt interest,
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   and that interest can be tax-exempt federal,
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   it can be tax-exempt on your state income tax,
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   if that's applicable depending on the rules of your state
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   and what state's municipals that the mutual fund invests in.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   So those are other possibilities.
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   There's a special rule for mutual funds
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   that says that if you have invested in that mutual fund
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   for a period of less than six months
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   and you receive a capital gain distribution from that fund,
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   you can treat that capital gain distribution
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   as capital gain on your tax return,
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   but if you sell that mutual fund within six months
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   and you sell it for a loss,
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   then that part of that dividend is going to be converted
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   into a short-term capital gain instead of a long-term capital gain.
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   Now the reason for this is,
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   imagine that if you have a clever, a wise guy, let's say,
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   who is investing in mutual funds and selling
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   and trying to get a tax advantage.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   You buy the mutual fund immediately before it pays out a capital gain dividend.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   You treat that as long-term capital gain
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   and then you immediately sell that mutual fund for a loss.
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   And it would be a loss immediately after the dividend pays out
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:13.000]   because that dividend payout reduces the net asset value of the mutual fund.
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   So you sell it for a loss and you claim a short-term capital loss
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   because you held it for less than a year.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   Well, that would create an artificial advantage for someone who did that.
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:27.000]   They're getting a long-term capital gain
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   and immediately turning around and getting a corresponding short-term capital loss.
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   So now we have a rule that says you don't have to wait a year,
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   but if you wait less than six months before selling that mutual fund at a loss,
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:45.000]   you're going to get this corresponding treatment
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:48.000]   that wipes out the benefit you would get from that.
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   And the same thing happens to a tax-exempt payout from a mutual fund.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   If you sell at a loss within six months after receiving one of those,
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:02.000]   then you're going to get a treatment that wipes out that loss
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   up to the extent of the tax-exempt dividend that you received.
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   Well, the very last thing I'd like to talk about is gifting.
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   Gifting of appreciated stock, gifting it to charity, or gifting it to, say, your children.
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:24.000]   The benefits of that or the disadvantages of gifting of appreciated assets.
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   Well, when you gift long-term appreciated assets to a charity,
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   then you can, subject to limitations, treat the value of that gift
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:43.000]   as a charitable contribution deduction without having recognized any gain.
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   So you're getting the same deduction that you would get
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   as if you sold the stock or other investment and then gifted the proceeds,
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:59.000]   but you're getting that benefit in terms of charitable contribution deduction
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   without having to report gain on a sale.
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   So that's a very beneficial way of dealing with substantial charitable contributions.
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   And I say substantial because nowadays small ones don't produce benefit for most people
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.000]   because most of us are not itemizing anymore.
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:21.000]   That's a really important point because a lot of people,
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:27.000]   they might only have their state and local taxes as a deduction and that's limited to $10,000.
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   And then maybe their house is paid off so they don't have any interest,
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:34.000]   mortgage expense on their house and maybe they don't have high medical expenses.
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   So the only other thing is a charitable contribution.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   And so if you're married, filing jointly, your standard deduction this year is almost $30,000.
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:49.000]   And so the first $20,000 that you would donate to charity wouldn't be a tax deduction
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.000]   because you're not going to be itemizing.
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   You have to get over that amount.
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   Yeah, that's correct.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:53:02.000]   The massive increase in the standard deduction, again, this goes back to the 2017 tax law,
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   a huge reduction in the number of people who itemize.
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:10.000]   And it is, in a sense, a great benefit for those people who,
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   you'd rather take a $30,000 standard deduction than a $20,000 itemized deduction.
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   But it also means that deductions of this kind, like charitable deductions,
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:28.000]   are of no benefit to a large number of people.
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:33.000]   What we do talk about a lot with the mogul heads is bunching of these charitable deductions
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   and putting them into a donor advised fund.
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:38.000]   And I know we don't have a lot of time to get into what donor advised fund is,
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:42.000]   but if you're going to be giving $20,000 to charity every year
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:44.000]   and you're going to be giving appreciated stock,
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:49.000]   that it's better to give $100,000 in one year and put it in a donor advised fund.
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:55.000]   You get a $100,000 tax deduction on that because now you're above the standard deduction,
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   plus your state and local taxes, so call it $110,000.
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:05.000]   And so you'd be able to take all of the amount of the deduction above the original $20,000
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:08.000]   that you donated can be given tax deductions.
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:13.000]   This is if you're in a high tax bracket because only 30% of your AGI would qualify for this.
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:16.000]   And then you put it in a donor advised fund and then over the next five years,
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:22.000]   you just dole out the money from the donor advised fund $20,000 a year to the charity that you want to give to.
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:25.000]   Now, you don't get a deduction in the following years,
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   but you do get to deduct a large portion of that $100,000
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   rather than every single year putting $20,000 to the charity
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   and not getting any deduction for that $100,000.
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:42.000]   Yeah, the donor advised fund has been a huge benefit for people who want to do
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:48.000]   bunching or simply just want to be putting money in it into a charitable vehicle,
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:54.000]   but without having chosen those charities yet and paid that money out yet.
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:55:00.000]   It is, in a sense, kind of a workaround from the private foundation rules.
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:06.000]   The private foundation is another way of doing a similar thing, but at a far more expensive level,
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   but with greater control by the individual who is setting it up.
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   This is all great for charity, giving appreciated property to charity,
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:18.000]   but it's not something you may want to give to your children, correct?
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:24.000]   Well, they will still have to pay tax on the gain, so you're not avoiding that gain.
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:32.000]   It's property that you otherwise would be able to pass to your children at death if you hold on to it.
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:34.000]   I've seen people make this mistake.
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:36.000]   They're in their leader years and they think,
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:42.000]   "Oh, I should benefit my children by giving them this appreciated property."
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:46.000]   Of course, then they lose that step-up in basis.
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:50.000]   It can be one of the classic mistakes that people make.
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:53.000]   We could be talking about this for hours, if not days,
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:57.000]   all of the different things that we could do to lower our taxes.
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:00.000]   I do have a saying that if you hate paying taxes,
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:07.000]   then you should love to learn about taxes because that's how you can reduce your taxes.
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:13.000]   With that in mind, I want to thank you so much for being with us today.
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:16.000]   I learned a lot, and hopefully our listeners did also.
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:19.000]   It's been a great pleasure being here. Thank you for having me.
