[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.680]   - Pastor John, in a couple of places,
[00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.200]   I've recently heard you talk about visualizing Christ
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.400]   in the battle against lustful thoughts.
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.040]   Lust is so often a visible battle,
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.240]   so it makes sense that this battle
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.160]   is fought in the imagination.
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.760]   And this point surfaced in your parable
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.860]   on the power of sin in a sermon clip
[00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.640]   that I posted as episode number 291 of this podcast.
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.320]   And all the way back in episode 18,
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.000]   you explained the anacronym ANTHEM to fight lust.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.080]   And there you described H as quote,
[00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.760]   "Hold a beautiful vision of Jesus in your mind
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.660]   "until it triumphs over the other sensual vision," end quote.
[00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.040]   In the fight against lust,
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.640]   how important is it to have this beautiful vision of Jesus?
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.640]   And how does this work for you in the moment of temptation?
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.160]   What's happening in your imagination?
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.340]   - Well, Tony, I've had history with really bad ways
[00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.200]   of using visualization in prayer.
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.960]   So even though the question isn't exactly that,
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.200]   let me start there.
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.360]   Pictures can begin to displace the word of Scripture
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.640]   as the center of God's saving communication.
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.640]   And that's really dangerous.
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.720]   We can edge right up to and transgress
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.680]   the intention of the second commandment.
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.780]   Don't make any graven images for worship.
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.840]   There's an approach that I've run into,
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.400]   it's pretty widespread, at least it was,
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.520]   to healing prayer, where people are instructed
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.200]   to go back into their painful past
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.480]   and visualize a scene of, say, abuse, sexual abuse.
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.640]   And for example, imagine Jesus,
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.680]   picture Jesus walking into the room
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.800]   and picking you up and hugging you and caring for you.
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.880]   And there are problems with that kind of counseling,
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.840]   it seems to me, because it's foreign to Scripture.
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.280]   You don't find any pattern quite like that in Scripture.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.260]   And it's usually slanted away from some of the aspects
[00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.160]   of the role that Jesus plays, namely in Providence,
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.880]   portraying Him only as a comforter
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.760]   and not as a sovereign and not as a judge
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.960]   and not as the one who's gonna handle that perpetrator
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.200]   with violence someday.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.400]   It tends to be just soft and gentle and warm
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.080]   and therefore slanted.
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.880]   It tends to oversimplify and over-psychologize
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.360]   what's really needed.
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.640]   The healing of the soul
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.660]   involves a profound spiritual perception,
[00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.720]   not only of a tender affectionate Jesus,
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.000]   but of the full meaning of the cross
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.560]   and the reality of the Holy Spirit
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.400]   and God's ways in justice and judgment.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.800]   So there are real dangers that I've encountered
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.800]   in this whole area of visualization in prayer.
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.040]   But let me get back to the positive side.
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:58.040]   Jesus is the eternal Word and He became flesh, John 1:14.
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.140]   So we know He had a body.
[00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.120]   People looked at Him.
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.080]   They could see Him with their physical eyes,
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.840]   unlike God the Father, who can't be visualized in that way.
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.480]   I don't think we should picture God the Father
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.280]   as a grandfather with a white beard.
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.880]   I think that's a big mistake.
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.600]   But Jesus had flesh and bones.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.840]   And here's another point.
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.840]   Some words do not invoke visual realities
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.520]   like love, hate, right, wrong, kind.
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.760]   Those are general, principal kinds of words.
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.760]   But other words do evoke necessarily images in our minds,
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.360]   cross, blood, nails, spear, side of body,
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.640]   hands, feet, thorns, beard, spit, rod,
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.280]   sun darkened, hill.
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.320]   You can't say those words without seeing something
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.880]   because those words are names of sites.
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.280]   They're names of sites.
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.200]   You see a hand, you put a word on a hand,
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.280]   you expect people to process that word
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.200]   and have a kind of hand visualized in their mind.
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.360]   No specific hand, but the idea of hand
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.200]   is being visualized in their mind.
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.000]   So when you read about the ninth hour,
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Jesus cried out with a loud voice.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.360]   Now you've got sounds as well.
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:22.480]   There are words that designate sounds like loud voice.
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.600]   That word is supposed to conjure something in your mind
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.600]   concerning Eli, Eli, Lama, Sebaothenoi.
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.720]   And it was loud.
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.640]   The word loud is used to make you feel and think loud.
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.600]   And then Jesus calls out with a loud voice,
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.560]   "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit."
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.440]   The point of those very words
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.660]   is to get our minds hearing something
[00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.440]   and the words like beard and spit
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.880]   are supposed to get our minds seeing something.
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.560]   And then here's one pointer from the apostle
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.560]   that inclines me to go ahead and form this image in my mind.
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:05.040]   Galatians 3,1, "Oh foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you?
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.680]   It was before your very eyes
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.360]   that Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified."
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.600]   Now, what does that mean?
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.860]   I don't think it means Paul got out a piece of chalk
[00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.840]   and drew Jesus.
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.740]   But it means evidently that he portrayed with words
[00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.220]   the gospel, the cross so vividly.
[00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.700]   He says, "It was like I was doing it before your very eyes."
[00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.540]   He used the words eyes here.
[00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.000]   It was before your eyes
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.300]   that Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed.
[00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.420]   So maybe he means I'm embodying this with my sufferings.
[00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.400]   I'm speaking it in such a way
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.660]   that you can see it.
[00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.940]   And so one of my strategies, Tony,
[00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.100]   back to Anthem and the whole battle with lust.
[00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.300]   One of my strategies in trying to obey Jesus,
[00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.820]   tearing out my eyes and putting sin to death
[00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.820]   and counting myself dead is to fight nudity.
[00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.780]   Let's just take that as a concrete example.
[00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:06.780]   Fight nudity in my mind with Christ's misery on the cross.
[00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.140]   So nudity is a picture in my mind.
[00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:13.540]   Now I've argued that Christ's misery on the cross
[00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.420]   is a picture in my mind.
[00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.380]   Christ died to make me pure.
[00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.080]   This lustful thought is not pure.
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.220]   Therefore, if I willingly hold this image in my mind,
[00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:31.220]   I'm taking a spear and thrusting it into the side of Jesus.
[00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.880]   I picture myself about to do that.
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.500]   I picture him saying, "I love you.
[00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.460]   "I love you.
[00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:43.460]   "I am dying to free you from that bondage to lust."
[00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.980]   And I picture a battered body.
[00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.740]   And maybe I should qualify.
[00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.140]   It's not a photographic.
[00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:53.300]   I don't have a particular face in view.
[00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.940]   I don't know what Jesus looked like.
[00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:56.500]   I don't pick a movie star
[00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.420]   from the Passion of the Christ or whatever.
[00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:02.380]   I don't have a particular face before me.
[00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.160]   He doesn't look like any actor.
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.180]   I don't get that specific.
[00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:07.780]   It's a word-created picture,
[00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:11.060]   not a photo-created picture.
[00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:14.380]   So it's what I think Paul did
[00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:15.880]   when he said in Galatians 2:20,
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.900]   "The life I now live in the flesh,
[00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:22.180]   "I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me."
[00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:24.140]   Now, he could have stopped right there, couldn't he?
[00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:28.820]   "Who loved me," and he added, "And gave himself for me."
[00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:33.340]   In Paul's mind, the faith to kill sin every day in his life
[00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:37.020]   was strengthened by remembering the love of Christ for him
[00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:41.580]   and the love of Christ is emblazoned in Paul's mind
[00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:45.100]   as he thought of him as crucified.
[00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:46.580]   He gave himself for me.
[00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:50.100]   And Paul saw crucified people.
[00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:51.300]   They were on the hills.
[00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:52.740]   It was horrible.
[00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:55.120]   And when he said, "Christ gave himself for me,"
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:59.180]   I can't believe that he didn't have some picture,
[00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:01.400]   if not photographic, in his mind
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:05.680]   of Christ suffering profoundly for his purity
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:10.680]   and thus his faith was empowered to defeat lust.
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:11.580]   - That's interesting.
[00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:12.400]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.780]   And for more on the anacronym ANTHEM,
[00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:15.980]   see Pastor John's article titled
[00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:18.300]   "ANTHEM, Strategies for Fighting Lust,"
[00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:20.260]   which was published online in 2001.
[00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.020]   It's available online at desiringgod.org right now.
[00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:24.460]   Go to the website and search for the title
[00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:27.140]   "ANTHEM, Strategies for Fighting Lust."
[00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:29.100]   Tomorrow, we'll address a tricky pastoral question
[00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:30.780]   with big ramifications.
[00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:33.760]   For those in our churches with severe cognitive impairment,
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.900]   what's the threshold that Credo Baptist Church
[00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:37.600]   would hold to in deciding whether or not
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.560]   to baptize such an individual?
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:41.620]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:42.720]   We'll see you tomorrow.
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:45.300]   (upbeat music)
