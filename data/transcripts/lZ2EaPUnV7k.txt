[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.520]   Today we're going to look at how we can actually publish the component that we've been building for a streamlet
[00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:13.840]   So what that means is we can actually pip install the component and then use it
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.840]   You know or any stream that app
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.480]   Just as we would a normal
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.320]   Python
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.520]   Framework so we pip install it and then we just
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.000]   Import and you should use it. So
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.280]   This is a article been putting together and that kind of covers this so we're basically just going to be going through
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.000]   this
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.200]   And what you're going to see at the end is we can actually do this. So you see here we have this
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:52.280]   From st card component import card component and then we just do card component titles the title body link
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.680]   And this and that will create our
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.680]   card
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.680]   Okay, so it's it's really
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.760]   There's not that much to go through. It's pretty straightforward. I think so
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.440]   Let's let's jump into it
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.020]   so a little bit of
[00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.320]   Background on how PIP is actually working here
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.800]   when you PIP install something you're actually installing it from this here the
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:28.120]   Python package index. Okay, so put all piping. Yeah, I think that's how you pronounce it and
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.700]   Like I can go in here and I can search for like pandas
[00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:40.660]   And it's gonna show us pandas or it's gonna show us a lot of different pandas, I think it's this one
[00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.920]   Okay. Yeah pip install pandas at the top there now
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.720]   we can also find the
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.280]   St. Card component. I've already built
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.760]   beforehand
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.560]   So if we open this
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.900]   So I think it's this one. Yeah, it's like version
[00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.120]   0.10 at the moment
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.160]   So this is the current component look there's me
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.080]   and
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.560]   you can
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.320]   install that but that's it's slightly different to the component that we have been putting together and
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.360]   not as
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.080]   generic I
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.000]   Built it for a particular use case, which you'll probably see pretty soon
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.880]   So what we're going to do is create another
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:36.780]   St. Card component to or something. I don't know you have to give it a unique name. So we can't use the same name again
[00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.160]   So we'll go ahead and start with that
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.560]   So we'll go to our project
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.580]   Template st card component now
[00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.640]   There's a few things we need to do
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.520]   for this, so the first one is create a
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:00.560]   Build distribution for the react component or reacts part of our component
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.800]   so we'll
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.760]   Come into I think here and we'll do that at the moment. There's no build
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.840]   Directory, we're going to make one
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.040]   so
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.920]   We need to open a terminal window for that. So I'm just pulling one up now
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:26.560]   Okay, and I'll just navigate to this directory so documents
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.640]   Projects
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.640]   So component component template
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.640]   Template
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.520]   And then in there we want to go st card component
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:51.680]   We might need to we might need to change the name of this by the way, I'm not sure
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.920]   and front-end
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:04.320]   Okay, so from within here we need to use note package manager to create the build distribution
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.600]   So if we come to the article
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.920]   Oh
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.040]   That is something we also need to do so let's not forget that
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.320]   so
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.720]   Before we before we do that. We also need to
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.640]   Go to init.py and
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:31.000]   Up here. We need to make sure we set release to true
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   now
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.640]   Release is false whilst we're putting everything together
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:41.880]   But as soon as we want to actually distribute it or publish it. We need to say it's true. So
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.200]   Beforehand this is this was being
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:53.560]   Run, okay, so it was saying you need to load st card component from localhost
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:05:01.520]   3001 obviously when people using this component in the future, they're not going to be running the component on the localhost
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.760]   Instead what they are going to do is they're going to download our package
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.520]   which is going to contain this front-end build distribution the directory and
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:20.980]   From there, they'll they'll get the the component it will be built from there. Okay
[00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:28.360]   So, I think I don't know. Is there anything else? Oh and also this this will not be run anymore
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.600]   So this is like the demo app that we're putting together before that will no longer be run
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.800]   so
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.520]   Yeah, that's fine. We just need to change that nothing else needs to be changed
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:49.400]   Then we're now our front-end directory we just write this npm run build
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.040]   Let's do that
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.640]   Let me open this so we can see what's going on here
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.640]   Okay
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:03.820]   So hopefully this will go well and
[00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:10.520]   We'll see build directory up here in the front end on the left
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.520]   Might take a moment as well
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:22.520]   Okay, so the build folder is ready to be deployed and we can come over here and we see we have build and it has
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.520]   all of these so
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.960]   This is our this is our
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.920]   component in JavaScript, okay
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.400]   now
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.320]   with that we can
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.520]   We have the build distribution for the actual react component
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:44.520]   And now we need to create the distribution for the Python distribution. Okay, so
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.400]   Let's go ahead and do that
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.320]   Scroll down a little bit
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:57.080]   So this is one thing. I think we need might need to change so changing the name parameter and set up the pie
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.960]   Because at the moment it's see card component. I
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.280]   Don't think it needs to be that anymore
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:09.120]   Yeah, I think I'm going to need to change this
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:13.960]   To ST card component -
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.000]   So let's go ahead and do that
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:22.160]   Okay, so we have in it pie here we're going to go to set up the pie
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.640]   so here
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.640]   we have the name of
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:32.920]   Component and I think we'll also need to change this template name
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:39.080]   So this will be ST card component -
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.960]   Okay now
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:48.080]   Now we should be able to go ahead and create the component or create the
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:51.160]   Python component
[00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.760]   Okay, first we need to Python
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:08:02.720]   Set up pie we need to write s dist and be dist wheel like that
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:12.440]   Okay, we run now and we should find a so we need to go one more
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.160]   I'll fold it up
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.960]   And then run it again
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:19.560]   so from this we'll find that we get a
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.160]   this folder here so dist
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.680]   So in here, we should find we have this
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:30.120]   list tar file and this wheel file and
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:38.160]   It's those two that we're going to upload to the Python package index and
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:42.000]   To do that. We're going to need something called twines
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.520]   so
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:49.940]   We first install out pip install twine. I already have a download. So when I run it again and
[00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:52.880]   Then we run Python
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.240]   M twine
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.120]   upload and
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.760]   Then we need to specify that we're going to upload it to
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:08.160]   The Python package index and the only other I think option you have here is a test Python package index
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:13.880]   Which can be quite I would recommend you look into that and like if you're putting a package out there
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:17.720]   That's quite good to test that the package is going to work
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.760]   I
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.400]   Have a video and article I think on
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.880]   Python packages, so maybe
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:32.880]   I'll put a link to that in the description so you can take a look if you're interested in figuring this out a bit more
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.800]   so we're just going to go with the
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:40.400]   Python package index rather than the test Python package index and
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:45.680]   We want to specify that we're going to be pulling everything from the distribution
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.800]   Folder, okay, so
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:56.720]   Let's run that it will ask us to log in so my user name
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:04.400]   Well, this is another thing so you will need to sign up on the same website I mentioned before it's I think
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.360]   Pi PI dot org
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:13.240]   So you need to sign up, and then you can go ahead and do this
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:20.320]   File already is this okay, so this is because I already have
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:26.080]   You see here is using st. Card component, so I need to make this
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:33.480]   St. Card component - so we'll go through everything in here, so this actually I didn't need to
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:36.960]   Rename that all so we can ignore that so
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:43.020]   Let's rename all this to - it's also in in it PI
[00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:47.920]   This one don't really need to change, but we'll do anyway
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:57.080]   - anything else in there, I don't think so so delete this
[00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:07.200]   I'll delete the distribution folder and the build folder. I don't know okay delete that as well
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:14.400]   And then in here we need to change this because the directories change
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.880]   So the manifest and also in set of PI
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:20.480]   Changes to - as well
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:25.440]   Okay, now let's rerun this again
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:34.400]   So we come to this Python. Yeah run that credit distribution folder and
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:41.360]   Then we're going to use twine again, so hopefully this time it'll work
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:49.440]   Okay, so now we have st. Card component number two we can go ahead and actually
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:52.720]   Have a look at that website, so
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.600]   Come over here
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:58.040]   You
[00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:05.080]   Okay, so we can pip install, and this is a version number. We don't actually need that so let me
[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:13.000]   Okay here, we just pip install st. Card component number two. Let's copy that across
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:20.720]   I'm going to do that in my stream lit environment
[00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.720]   Okay
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:34.760]   Now while that's downloading. I'm going to come over here. I'm going to open or create a new directory actually so
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:39.320]   Do from here, okay?
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:46.400]   So make directory
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.480]   We'll call it
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:51.760]   st. Demo
[00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:58.800]   I'll open that in vs. Code. Okay, and then in here. I'm just going to create a new file app pie
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:02.160]   in here
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.420]   Let let me copy it across from from the article
[00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:09.200]   Quicker
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:13.680]   So where are we here?
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:18.120]   It's actually just okay, so copy this
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:25.280]   Pull into here st. Card component number two
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:31.040]   Okay, save that and now let's run it from here
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:35.720]   So see the st. Demo and run stream lit
[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:38.760]   run
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:45.560]   Up top pie okay localhost and here we go, so this is our
[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:49.200]   Package or distributed
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:52.640]   St. Card component
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:56.920]   Click here make sure it's working. Oh, yeah perfect
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:59.120]   so
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:04.200]   Yeah, that's does everything for this kind of short series on
[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:07.480]   custom components in stream lit I
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:11.680]   Hope it's been useful and
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:17.240]   Yeah, that's it. Thank you very much for watching now. See you in the next one
