[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Oppenheimer was a man with a very divided self
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.880]   and an insecure self.
[00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.920]   He never quite pulled himself together as a human being.
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.920]   And as is true with many people
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.120]   with that kind of personality structure,
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.160]   he was a superb actor.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.840]   He could play lots of different roles and he did.
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.040]   Women adored him.
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.220]   He was one of the most lavish quarters of women.
[00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.080]   He would bring a bouquet of flowers to their first date,
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.880]   which was apparently shocking to people in those days.
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.840]   He was just a lovely courtly man.
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.840]   But in the classroom, if somebody made a stupid mistake,
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.300]   he would just chew them out.
[00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.140]   And he was nasty to people all the time
[00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.440]   in a way that bothered a lot of people.
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.240]   Louis Alvarez, who was someone I got to know pretty well
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.560]   because I helped him write his memoirs,
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.960]   and one of the important scientists at Los Alamos
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.040]   really didn't get along with Oppenheimer at all
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.960]   because Oppenheimer was so condescending to everyone.
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.880]   And Louis was kind of a hothead in him,
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.040]   like people condescending to him.
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.680]   Oppenheimer never won a Nobel, Louis did, and so forth.
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.640]   So there was this layer of Oppenheimer
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.200]   being waspish all the time, which was his insecurity.
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.600]   And his insecurity extended to physics
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.320]   in that rather than dig deep into one problem,
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.560]   Robbie said later, he just, he didn't have the zits flash.
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.160]   He couldn't sit down and focus on one problem
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.420]   because he always wanted to be someone
[00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.200]   who always knew everything that was going on in physics.
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.840]   Well, you could call that someone
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.880]   who was a very sophisticated, knowledgeable scientist,
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.120]   or you call him someone who was superficial,
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.640]   and he was superficial.
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.080]   He knew broadly rather than deeply, if you will.
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.320]   And for the period of the war, Hans Bethe told me this.
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.080]   He said, "Before the war, Robert really could be cruel.
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.200]   He would pounce on a mistake you made."
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.360]   And Bethe, Nobel Laureate of,
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.440]   Bethe discovered what makes the sun work.
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.460]   That's how important Bethe's work was and how significant.
[00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.720]   Bethe told me, and of course, everyone makes mistakes.
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:20.640]   I made mistakes.
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.540]   Oppenheimer would charge me with a mistake if I spoke wrong.
[00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.320]   But he said, "Before the war, after the war,
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.000]   but not during the war."
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   During the war, he was the superb kind of wise lab director
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.400]   because unlike most scientists,
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.240]   he was not only a physicist of high class,
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.400]   but he really was psychologically astute as a human being,
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.560]   as I think insecure people often are
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.200]   because got to scope out what's going on.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.240]   When the war was over,
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.880]   these were mostly graduate students or new PhDs
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.240]   who had been recruited for this program.
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.680]   The average age at Los Alamos was 27.
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.160]   Oppenheimer was an old guy.
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.640]   He was 39, right?
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.440]   So these were young guys
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.240]   who'd been pulled out of their lives,
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.880]   pulled out of their careers.
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.680]   They wanted to get back to the university
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.160]   and do the work they had started out to do.
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.800]   And by and large, they did and Los Alamos just emptied out.
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.040]   Teller was horrified.
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.760]   Teller wanted the bomb program to continue
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.400]   because he wanted to build his hydrogen bomb.
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.880]   It was going to be his bid for history,
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.840]   just as Oppenheimer's bid for history
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.320]   was the fission bomb, if you will.
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.360]   Teller's was going to be the hydrogen bomb.
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.280]   - You talked to Teller in writing the book, is that right?
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.120]   - I did.
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.480]   - What was his feelings when you talked to him about this?
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.680]   - I made the mistake of going to see Teller
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.600]   at his house on the grounds of Stanford University
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.320]   early on in my research
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.080]   when I really didn't have as clear a grasp
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.720]   of who everyone was and what I should ask and so forth.
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.640]   And I sent him a copy of a essay I'd written
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.600]   about Robert Oppenheimer for a magazine
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.800]   and that set him off.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.800]   He had reached the point where he was telling TV interviewers
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.520]   asking them how much time he would actually be on the air.
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.400]   And if they said three minutes or whatever,
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.520]   he would say, all right,
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.280]   then I will answer three questions, no more.
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.600]   Trying to control because he was convinced
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.520]   that everyone was cutting the story to make him look bad.
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.960]   He really had quite a lot of paranoia
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.480]   at that point in his life.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.800]   So when he read my essay on Oppenheimer,
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.720]   he used that as the basis for basically shouting at me,
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.120]   waving my big, heavy book,
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.520]   one of my big, heavy books at him.
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.080]   I remember thinking, oh my God,
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.000]   he's going to hit me with my book.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.440]   Then I thought, wait a minute,
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.920]   this guy's 80 years old, I can take him.
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.520]   So, but he finally said, all right,
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.880]   I will answer three questions.
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.920]   And we sat down and I asked him one
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.040]   and he didn't give me an interesting answer.
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.800]   Asked him the second question
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.720]   and it was worth the whole interview.
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.640]   I said, was Robert Oppenheimer a good lab director?
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.480]   And I thought, well, here's a chance where he'll slash him.
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.400]   But his worst, Oppenheimer's worst enemy said to me,
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.400]   Robert Oppenheimer was the best lab director I ever knew.
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.000]   And I thought, bingo.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.960]   And then he chased me out of the house.
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.760]   You know, Eisenhower in one of his memoirs says,
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.720]   I always liked Hannibal best of all the classical figures
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.040]   in the military of the Roman empire,
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.400]   because he comes down to us only
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.520]   in the written memoirs of his enemies.
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.440]   And if they thought he was such a good leader,
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.200]   he must've been a hell of a leader.
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:06.200]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
