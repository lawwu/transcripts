[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - So planes in these multi-dimensional spaces,
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.220]   how difficult of an idea is that to come to, do you think?
[00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:15.220]   If you look back in time, I think mathematically
[00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.060]   it makes sense, but I don't know if it's intuitive
[00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.220]   for us to imagine, just as we were talking about.
[00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.900]   Feels like calculus is easier to intuit.
[00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.500]   - Well, I have to admit, calculus came earlier,
[00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.420]   earlier than linear algebra, so Newton and Leibniz
[00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.920]   were the great men to understand the key ideas of calculus.
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.200]   But linear algebra to me is like, okay,
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.280]   it's the starting point, 'cause it's all about flat things.
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.260]   Calculus has got, all the complications of calculus
[00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.260]   come from the curves, the bending, the curved surfaces.
[00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.000]   Linear algebra, the surfaces are all flat.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.140]   Nothing bends in linear algebra.
[00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.760]   So it should have come first, but it didn't.
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.760]   And calculus also comes first in high school classes,
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.960]   in college class, it'll be freshman math,
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.440]   it'll be calculus, and then I say, enough of it.
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.620]   Like, okay, get to the good stuff.
[00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.000]   - Do you think linear algebra should come first?
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.800]   - Well, it really, I'm okay with it not coming first,
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.200]   but it should, yeah, it should.
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.140]   It's simpler.
[00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.280]   - 'Cause everything's flat.
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.760]   - Yeah, everything's flat.
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.680]   Well, of course, for that reason,
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.720]   calculus sort of sticks to one dimension,
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.600]   or eventually you do multivariate,
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.360]   but that basically means two dimensions.
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.720]   Linear algebra, you take off into 10 dimensions,
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:45.640]   no problem.
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.720]   - It just feels scary and dangerous
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.920]   to go beyond two dimensions, that's all.
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.560]   - If everything's flat, you can't go wrong.
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.640]   (laughs)
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.220]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.800]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.380]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.960]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.540]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.180]   you
