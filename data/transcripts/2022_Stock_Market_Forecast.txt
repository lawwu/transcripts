[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.800]   Happy New Year, everybody. It's Sam from Financial Samurai. 2022 predictions in the stock market.
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:13.200]   We went out raging hard until 4am. No, I'm just kidding. As we do every single New Year,
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.200]   we stay back, we reflect and we think about the future as mid 40s parents now. So in this episode,
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.240]   I want to talk about my stock market forecast. I shared with you my housing market forecast.
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.160]   And the bottom line for 2022 in stocks is that I think the gains will be quite muted,
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:38.080]   very uninspiring. I have a target price of 5,008 on the S&P 500, which provides for about 5%
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:44.880]   upside. And to put 5% upside into perspective, that's about 3.3 times greater than the current
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:51.760]   10-year bond yield of about 1.5, 1.6%. And that is about 2% lower than what you can get
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:01:02.160]   from an I-bond guaranteed 7.12%. And that is also about 3% to 5% lower than what I think the median
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:10.400]   US home price will increase by in 2022. But a 5% increase is still a decent 5% nominal increase.
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.000]   It's about 5% below the historical return average of the S&P 500. But it doesn't give you much
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.200]   wiggle room just in case there is a correction or a bear market. I don't think there's going to be
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:28.000]   a bear market of a 20% decline in 2022. But I think with 70% probability, there's going to be
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.360]   at least a 5% correction in the stock market. So at times, I think we could be just treading water
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.080]   or losing money. And in case you're curious, the reason why I do these stock market and housing
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.760]   market forecasts is because currently equities, stocks, account for about 35% of my overall net
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:51.280]   worth. And real estate accounts for about 50% of my overall net worth. So 85% of my net worth,
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.680]   excluding the online business, is in risk assets. So if I have a bear market, we experienced that,
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.800]   I'm going to get crushed. And obviously, if things continue to go up, then our net worth
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.800]   will continue to go up and things will be fine. So I have got skin in the game. And that's why I
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.080]   really had to think long and hard in the hot tub, what could happen with the stock market and real
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.920]   estate market in 2022. So first, let's talk about the positives for the stock market. Interest rates
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.440]   will likely remain low, despite the Fed implying it may hike rates up to three times this year.
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:33.600]   Two, inflation may subside, it'll probably subside, I think, to 4% or so from 6.8%. And this
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:40.720]   will still create negative real interest rate loans. So that will still propel people to buy
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.600]   and borrow because there's no other alternative, right? Three, corporate earnings are likely to
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:52.480]   continue to grow by maybe 8% to 10%. That's not really inspiring, folks, compared to a 40% 45%
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.400]   plus earnings growth in 2021. Consumers will likely spend more aggressively due to a bull
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.040]   market in stocks, real estate and alternatives. Five, more government spending to boost the
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:09.440]   economy. Six, a less potent COVID variant that is quickly transmitting and creating immunity
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:15.520]   throughout the system. Seven, new vaccines and pills to combat various COVID variants. Eight,
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:21.440]   expanding corporate margins as prices go up and input costs decline. And then nine,
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:27.120]   easing supply chain woes. Those are all the positives. The negatives include historically
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.960]   high valuations. We're in the top 10% in terms of valuation ranges. Rising Fed funds rates,
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.760]   that makes credit card debt, student loan debt, automobile debt, basically consumer debt more
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.920]   expensive. Three, three consecutive years of returns much greater than the historical average.
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:50.480]   Four, decelerating economic and corporate profit growth. Five, COVID is still here,
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:57.680]   still here in the third year, and there are likely more unknown variants to come. Six,
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.360]   rising real yields, even though they're still going to be negative as inflation slows and rates
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:09.600]   inch higher. Seven, deteriorating foreign relations with Russia and China. There's a lot of
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:15.520]   just saber rattling going on. And then finally, markets have historically fallen before midterm
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:21.360]   elections with a Democratic president, House and Senate. So when you add up all the positives and
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:27.440]   negatives, it's hard to see a raging bull market. There is, I believe, less than a 5% chance we're
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:33.440]   going to see the returns that we saw in 2021 or in 2020. If you look at valuations, let's say the
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:42.800]   S&P 500 earnings grow by 10% to $228 a share. That would mean at 5,008 on the S&P 500, the PE would
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:49.760]   be around 22 times versus a mean of about 16 times and a median of about 15 times. So that's still
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:55.120]   much higher than historical average. If you look at the Shiller PE valuation, the Shiller PE uses
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.360]   inflation adjusted 10-year earnings data to minimize the impact of short-term changes.
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:05.040]   It's supposed to smooth things out. But the all-time high for the Shiller PE ratio was
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:12.400]   December 1999 when the figure reached 44 times. Now, currently, we're at about 40 times. And I
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:19.600]   remember back then during the 1999-2000 dot-com bubble. I was working at Goldman Sachs, first-year
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:24.880]   analyst on the trading floor. It was crazy then. And it probably seemed amplified because I was on
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.760]   the trading floor and people were yelling back and forth. And I still vividly remember a couple
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:36.880]   of my traders screaming at tech support to get over here and fix their computer because something
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.600]   was broken. There was like some kind of glitch. It was really an interesting time. But today,
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:48.880]   in 2022, with cryptocurrency, NFTs, I think things are much crazier. It definitely seems
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.760]   much crazier. You can make even bigger money, bigger multiples if you put in the risk. And
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:59.520]   obviously, you can lose a lot more and a lot more quickly as well. So even if earnings grow by,
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:07.920]   let's say, 10% in 2022 and the Shiller PE declines by 10% to 36 times, that's still way above average
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:13.200]   because the mean Shiller PE is about 17 times and the median Shiller PE is about 16 times.
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:19.680]   So the bottom line is, I think we should all expect a 5% to 10% correction in the stock market
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:26.320]   at some point. And we should not panic. We should just accept it as what happens when valuations are
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:33.200]   so high. Things are kind of priced to perfection. And so any earnings whiff, even just by 1% or 2%,
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:40.080]   can really, really drag down stocks. When making stock market forecasts, there are no guarantees.
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:45.280]   Therefore, let me share with you my confidence levels at various price increases for the S&P
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:53.120]   500 in 2022. So negative appreciation, I think with 35% confidence, the S&P 500 will be down in
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:07:02.000]   2022. That means I have a 65% confidence we will see positive returns in 2022. 65% so happens to
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.920]   be the lowest confidence level I've had in years. I have 60% confidence, this is the base case,
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:14.880]   that we will see a 5% appreciation. I have a 50% confidence we'll see an 8% plus appreciation.
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:22.000]   And only a 40% confidence we'll see 10% plus appreciation. Now this compares really differently
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:30.320]   to my 90% plus confidence real estate will see a positive year in 2022, which is why I'm allocating
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:36.480]   most of my cash flow to private real estate funds. And I'm also looking at private investments such
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:44.320]   as venture debt and venture capital to decouple from the S&P 500, which has had three phenomenal,
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:49.520]   awesome, awesome years. If you click over to the post, I put together a chart showing the historical
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:55.600]   annual data for the S&P 500 index. And you'll notice every two to five years, there's some
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:05.600]   kind of correction. In 2018, the S&P 500 closed down 6.24%. In 2015, down 0.73%. In 2011, it was
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:12.000]   flat. And then of course, in 2008, it was down 38.5%. I don't think we're going to see more than
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:19.200]   a 10% decline in 2022. So I'm fine to keep my existing positions. If we get to my target price
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:24.880]   of 5008 on the S&P 500, I'm probably going to be trimming positions because I like to have my
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:31.360]   equity position range from around 25 to 30% of net worth. And right now it's about 35% because I've
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:37.440]   let the equity positions ride. If there is a dip of five to 10%, I'm probably going to be buying
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:44.400]   the dip so long as the S&P 500 is below my 5000 target. So in other words, if there's a 10% dip
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:49.280]   early on, well, my target is probably going to still be the same. And I'll see more upside.
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:55.280]   Therefore, I'll probably allocate more capital. In other words, raising cash in 2022 is not that
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:02.000]   bad of an idea. Because the opportunity cost of not investing that cash in stocks is not that great
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:09.120]   if my predictions come true at up 5%. At the same time, you can obviously invest in other risk assets
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:13.280]   and you've got to deal with inflation, which hopefully should be declining. One interesting
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:21.520]   study I think is worth noting is the S&P 500 performance after a year of 25% plus gains.
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:28.400]   Now that's what we had in 2021. We saw about 27, 28% in gains depending on dividend reinvested.
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:35.920]   And so the data shows the average return for the S&P 500 is 14% after returns more than 25% the
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:43.840]   previous year. Only three years out of 17 years did the S&P 500 return negative. And the negative
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:54.480]   amounts, not that negative. In 1962, minus 9%. In 1981, minus 5%. In 1990, minus 3%. I mean,
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:10:00.400]   that's nothing. If we lose 5% to 10% in 2022, which I think there's like a 10% chance of happening,
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:06.560]   will we really be in trouble or get that bent out of shape given returns have been so great
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:11.760]   for so long? I don't think so. I think we'll be bummed out, that feeling of, ah, the good times
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:18.240]   are over, the easy money is no longer that easy. We'll feel a little demoralizing. But I think
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:23.840]   we'll get on with it because we're still going to hopefully save, earn, and invest more money
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:30.160]   to buffer those potential losses. Finally, I want to conclude by sharing some of Wall Street's S&P
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:37.040]   500 targets for 2022. It's really interesting. I came up with my 5,008 target before looking at
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:43.840]   what everybody else is doing. And so here's a range. BMO, 5,300. Credit Suisse, 5,200. Goldman
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:53.120]   Sachs, 5,100. JP Morgan, 5,050. RBC, 5,050. Deutsche Bank, 5,000. Citigroup, 4,900. Barclays,
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:11:00.880]   4,800. Bank of America, 4,600. Morgan Stanley, pretty bearish at 4,400. These S&P 500 Wall
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:06.640]   Street target prices are as bifurcated as I've ever seen. I don't know if anybody knows exactly
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:12.000]   what's going to happen. And that's the reality, folks. Even if you've heard my target price,
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.200]   and you've heard everybody else's, nobody really knows the future. We can only really operate
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:22.560]   in an expected environment. I don't think things are going to change that drastically for me to
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:26.880]   drastically change my risk exposure. Could be wrong, could be right. That's the fun thing.
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:30.960]   We can revisit this a year from now. But in reality, I'm probably going to provide an update
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:36.240]   in a quarter or mid-year and see where things are going. But the bottom line is, I don't think any
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:43.120]   of us should expect double-digit returns in the S&P 500. And I think we should all expect to be
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:48.720]   flat, to actually lose money. And if we can temper our expectations, I think we're going to do things
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:54.640]   to help boost our net worth more this year. So I'd love to hear your thoughts on where you think the
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:12:01.280]   S&P 500 is going and why. Leave a comment, shoot an email. It's always good to see what other
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:07.360]   people are thinking so we can formulate our own thoughts. And if you enjoyed this podcast episode,
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:11.040]   I'd love a positive review. It's what keeps me going. Thanks, everyone.
