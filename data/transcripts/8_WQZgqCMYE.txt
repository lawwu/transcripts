[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.300]   We are here with another episode of Curious Mike out here in San Diego with my guy Ben
[00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.300]   Newman.
[00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.180]   Appreciate you pulling up on me, my guy.
[00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.180]   Appreciate you, man.
[00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.520]   So, you know, obviously we've known each other for a while.
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.440]   I remember meeting you back in Mizzou while I was there for that year.
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.780]   But I play basketball and you obviously are in a different field.
[00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.260]   You work with some hoopers, but kind of tell us a little bit about what you do.
[00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.620]   Well for me, it's all the mental side, right?
[00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:37.180]   So in business and in sports, it's working with individuals on what it takes to embrace
[00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.180]   the mental side.
[00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.980]   And I know this is supposed to be about me, but you talk about the mental side.
[00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.420]   I'm just so proud of everything you've accomplished and how you've embraced the challenge and
[00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.420]   adversity.
[00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:47.420]   Yeah.
[00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.420]   That's really what I do every day.
[00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.940]   It's helping people embrace challenge and adversity to write their ultimate story.
[00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:52.940]   Right.
[00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.340]   And you've had some pretty awesome chapters that have come after adversity.
[00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.420]   And so that's what I work every day with, is just helping people embrace that to write
[00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.380]   those next chapters and ultimately their story.
[00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.380]   Yeah.
[00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.380]   It's unbelievable, man.
[00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.700]   I mean, coming through all that adversity.
[00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.140]   Do you have any stories from kind of when we met or any stories during our time in Mizzou
[00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.380]   of me that you like would remember?
[00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.380]   Because you were always around, but I didn't always, obviously you saw everything.
[00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.380]   Do you have any stories?
[00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.380]   Oh, yeah.
[00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.580]   So first one is, so I was a hooper back in the day, as you know, however, I can shoot
[00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.580]   a little bit.
[00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:25.580]   I was slow.
[00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.820]   So I had a couple D3 opportunities, but ended up going to Michigan State to watch them win
[00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.820]   a title.
[00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.900]   But being a shooter, I was always impressed with shooters.
[00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.220]   So one of the first things was I thought when I came to the first practice, my first day,
[00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.580]   you were at the top of the key and you hit 19 straight three pointers.
[00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.700]   And what went through my mind, it wasn't necessarily the 19.
[00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.760]   It was the number of shots that this young man must have taken in order to put yourself
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.140]   in position to hit 19 straight three pointers.
[00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.140]   Right.
[00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.980]   So I always look at work ethic, like what allows somebody to achieve what they achieve?
[00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.980]   And so number one was the work ethic.
[00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.040]   And then the second story, which is, you know, painful, but, you know, the pain is what leads
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.660]   us to our growth was I remember the first game.
[00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.660]   Yeah.
[00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:11.660]   I remember Iowa State.
[00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:12.660]   Right.
[00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.700]   I mean, everybody's excited.
[00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.700]   Everybody's energized.
[00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.340]   And I remember you came up to me in the locker room and you're like, bro, I don't I don't
[00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.340]   know if I can go.
[00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.340]   Yeah.
[00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.500]   And I mean, the emotion was in your face.
[00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.620]   Your back was killing you.
[00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.620]   And I just admired the fact that you put it on the line for the team that night.
[00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.420]   You made it about the team.
[00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.420]   Yeah.
[00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.780]   And you attempted to go out there knowing the pain that you were in and we know what
[00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:35.780]   happened afterwards.
[00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.020]   But then to come back into battle to, you know, when we were playing Tennessee in the
[00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.260]   NCAA tournament that year.
[00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.260]   Yeah.
[00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.260]   I think about that.
[00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.660]   And, you know, it's one of those things like you got heart, you got guts, you got fight
[00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:48.660]   in you.
[00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.660]   Yeah.
[00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:50.660]   That's why you're achieving what you're achieving.
[00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:51.660]   But those are the things that I remember.
[00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.960]   You know, it's the hard work, but then it's the mindset that you have.
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.880]   That's crazy, because I remember that vividly to that that game.
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.400]   And I remember coming up to you because I was like, huh, he's such a good speaker.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.220]   What if he could just speak it into me?
[00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.320]   What if he could say something, make the pain go away?
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.160]   Because I knew like you were you had that.
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.160]   So.
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.160]   So, yeah, I remember that.
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.160]   And then.
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.160]   But now it was just too much.
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.300]   Like the few days leading up to that game, it was getting worse and worse.
[00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.080]   So by that time, it was it was it was impossible to play.
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.560]   But I mean, you were in my corner the entire time through the rehab process, you know,
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.040]   then going into the draft.
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.760]   And then, you know, our relationship kind of changed because I reached out to you one
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.440]   one day and I was like, man, I'm going through this.
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:40.440]   I forget what it was, but I was like, could you could you just send me messages daily?
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.360]   This was many years ago, bro.
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.160]   I was like, can you send me messages to encourage me daily?
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.440]   And ever since then, every single morning I wake up to a text from you.
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.640]   I don't think even as one morning saying something motivational, something for the day.
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.120]   And that's unbelievable, because I mentioned it one time.
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.520]   And I know a lot of people, they will like you talk about it all the time.
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.460]   They'll talk the talk or they'll say, yeah, I'll do this for you, whatever.
[00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.820]   But then they never follow through or they might feel like a week.
[00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.560]   It's been every single day.
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.680]   Like how did you get that consistency about you or just that routine?
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.280]   I mean, like those texts are coming in at two or three a.m..
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.280]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.600]   Like, how did you my favorite text to the ones where you say things to me like, bro,
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.560]   what time did you go to bed last night, bro?
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.880]   What time did you wake up?
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:24.880]   It's unbelievable.
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:30.740]   Well, you know, it's one of those things I'm driven by embracing your everyday opportunity.
[00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:31.740]   And you know my story.
[00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.080]   I mean, I shared it with you guys the first time that I spoke at Mizzou and Konzo brought
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.000]   me in, which was such a blessing being able to, you know, work with you guys that year.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.060]   And my mom passed away 11 days before my eighth birthday.
[00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.460]   My parents were divorced when I was six months old.
[00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.600]   So all I've ever known is challenge and adversity.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.480]   I'm a 42 year old man.
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.440]   My mother passed away at 38 from a rare muscle disease.
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.020]   There's still no cure for.
[00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:59.000]   So every day past 38 has been a gift that God has given me.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.080]   So if I have a blessing of having a relationship with somebody like you and you ask me to help
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.200]   you with something, I'm going to be there to help you.
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.200]   And that's all.
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.200]   That's all I know.
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.240]   And I think the world, unfortunately, there are too many people, as you just referenced,
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.240]   they like to talk, but the action tells the real story.
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.240]   And so our real relationship comes from, can you call me in a bind and I'm going to be
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.240]   there for you?
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.800]   Oh, well, Mike, I'll call you in a few days.
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:23.800]   I'm busy.
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.400]   No, no, I'm going to be there for you because that's the relationship that we have.
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.600]   And I think that's what life is all about.
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.920]   And I think there's too many people who talk rather than driving action and building relationships
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.440]   because that's what life's about.
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:35.440]   No doubt.
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.680]   And you do a great job of helping us.
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.760]   I mean, those Mizzou days, me now, I know you talked to a lot of teams still, but like
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:46.140]   you personally, as your own individual, how did you get to the point where you were making
[00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:50.920]   these life habits of, like, I remember not too long ago there was a fight.
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.640]   I think it ended at like 12 a.m.
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.440]   I still get my text from you at 3 a.m.
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.840]   Like, I'm like, bro, did you sleep?
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.400]   I just saw you on TV at the fight.
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:04.920]   How did you get that in you where you were just, that one in full disclosure, I'm going
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:10.680]   to tell the people I sent the text before I went to bed that night because I was still
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:11.680]   up.
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.400]   And I'm like, I was thinking to myself, I mean, am I going to wake up in an hour and
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.400]   send my messages?
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.600]   And I'm like, no, no, I'm sending them before I go to bed.
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.720]   So that was one night where I had to do that because I do have to get some sleep.
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.380]   But a lot of the discipline is it's wanting to maximize every single day, right?
[00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:30.400]   So for you, you have a choice, right?
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.360]   You have earned everything that you've had.
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.000]   You fought through all the adversity because you made a choice.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   Here's how I'm going to work.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.600]   And oftentimes it's not the work that the nuggets ask you to do.
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.840]   It's the unrequired work.
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:41.840]   It's the extra work.
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:46.000]   You know, my guy, Messer, I mean, I remember speaking to his team at SIUE when he played
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   back in the day years ago, they would bring me in to speak and you know, it's the work
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.640]   that you guys put in, in the gym.
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:52.680]   That's what gets it done.
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:57.580]   And so for me, it's the little things that I've been blessed to have coaches and mentors
[00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:01.000]   in my life who have helped me understand if you do the little things every day and you
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.200]   keep stacking those habits every day, day after day after day, from my nutrition to
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.720]   my health, to how I show up for my family and my kids, to how I work.
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:15.000]   If we just take it one day at a time and choose to win one day at a time, you will have success.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.840]   And I think a lot of people, they get so caught up in, I want the result, give me the result
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:20.840]   right now.
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.680]   Oh, just give it to me right now.
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:26.120]   As opposed to, are you willing to do what it takes every day in order to achieve that
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.120]   result?
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:30.240]   And most people, they don't have that consistency.
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:34.240]   And I believe one more thing, we have to be the example.
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.880]   We have to be the example.
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.560]   You can't talk about it if you're not doing it.
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.880]   I mean, there would be a different level of respect, or maybe we wouldn't be sitting here
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.140]   if I didn't show up in my life and have discipline.
[00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:49.880]   Because how could you and I have a conversation about discipline if I was completely undisciplined?
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:53.480]   There would just be a different level of respect, and so I feel like you have to be an example
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.520]   of showing up and doing the things.
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:59.000]   How could I have a conversation with you about discipline if I'm undisciplined?
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   Exactly.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.960]   So man, I know a lot of people, they want to make these life habits, these new changes,
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.620]   but then you know everyone, we're human.
[00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:13.080]   So I don't know if you ever have off days, but when people have a bad day or they feel
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:19.540]   like they lost the day, how do you, when you're so driven by a standard and you're putting
[00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:23.660]   these streaks together, whatever it is, and you have a bad day, how do you kind of bounce
[00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:27.460]   back from that guilt and not let one bad day turn into, "Oh, I'm going to just give it
[00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:28.460]   all up"?
[00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:29.460]   Because a lot of people do that.
[00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:31.340]   They make these New Year's resolutions.
[00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:35.100]   They might do good for like a week, and then they fall off for a day, and now it's kind
[00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:37.340]   of hard to get back on the right path.
[00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:39.100]   What do you say to people like that?
[00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:42.100]   For me, it's about the shifting of perspective, right?
[00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:46.340]   As tough as it is on the ears, I go back to my mother coming to the dining room table
[00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:51.660]   with an IV stand while we had 24-hour nursing care in our house, her last year living, to
[00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:54.820]   ask my older brother Drew and I how our days were at school.
[00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:58.700]   So if my mother was able to do that, what's really a bad day for me?
[00:08:58.700 --> 00:08:59.860]   So I just shift the perspective.
[00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:01.660]   I call that the power to reframe, right?
[00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:06.100]   It's our ability to focus on the solution rather than the problem, and I think that's
[00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:07.100]   the opportunity.
[00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:08.100]   It doesn't mean I don't have bad days.
[00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:09.620]   I still have two coaches.
[00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:11.020]   I read books every day.
[00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:13.500]   I have mentors, so I'm high maintenance, right?
[00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:14.500]   I have issues.
[00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:15.500]   I have problems.
[00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.900]   I have struggles, but I have people there to help me.
[00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:21.660]   So number one, I think it's acknowledging it's okay to have challenge and adversity.
[00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:26.220]   I have it all the time, but I have those confidants and individuals that I reach out to who help
[00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:27.220]   me get through it.
[00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:30.460]   I think anytime we try to manage it alone, that's where we get in trouble.
[00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:33.340]   That's why I admire when you'll pick up the phone and call me, "Hey, let's talk through
[00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:34.340]   something."
[00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:35.340]   Right?
[00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:36.900]   If you try to do it by yourself, you take it on to the court.
[00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:40.460]   So my goal in a conversation like that is I want to provide peace of mind for you.
[00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:44.140]   Let's leave it off the court so you can step onto the court, have intentional focus, lock
[00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:46.980]   in, and play your game.
[00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:52.140]   I think, like you said, the ability to reframe is so much more easier said than done, but
[00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:53.740]   it really is a choice.
[00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:57.980]   I think a lot of people, especially in today's age, I don't know if it's the social media
[00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:03.420]   or what it is, but they have a hard time with anxiety, like choosing their thoughts.
[00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:06.820]   Is that kind of like a muscle, like you have to just do it over and over and then you get
[00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:12.300]   better at kind of choosing to think positive, or is it just getting off your phone?
[00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:13.300]   I think this is it for me.
[00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:17.340]   Kind of getting off my phone, going into quiet space, and just sitting, and then kind of
[00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:18.340]   changing perspectives.
[00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:19.340]   Because it's hard.
[00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:20.340]   Like you say it all the time.
[00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:21.640]   Eliminate distractions.
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:23.700]   Is that the only way you can really do it, you think?
[00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:24.700]   Yeah.
[00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:25.700]   I mean, you just said it.
[00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:29.420]   You've identified, "I have to put my phone away if I'm actually going to free my mind."
[00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:30.420]   Right.
[00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:32.340]   So most people know, "You should probably put your phone away."
[00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:33.340]   Yeah.
[00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:34.340]   Then what do most people do?
[00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:35.340]   They don't put their phone away.
[00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:38.740]   So you've identified, "Okay, here's the shift I have to make in my environment if I'm actually
[00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:40.340]   going to clear my mind."
[00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:44.960]   I think that's common for any ... We all know what we need to do, but do we actually choose
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.820]   to do the things we know we need to do to have a clear mind to perform, or to give ourself
[00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:51.060]   that peace, or to be able to push away?
[00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:52.620]   Isn't that funny, though?
[00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:57.460]   We always say, for a lot of people that struggle with social media use or whatever, "When I
[00:10:57.460 --> 00:10:59.780]   get off social media, I feel the best I've ever felt."
[00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:04.580]   But then we always end up going back to some of the destructive things in our life.
[00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:06.060]   I don't know where that comes from.
[00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:11.980]   I know there's a quote that says, "A lot of times we are more afraid of our true light
[00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:14.380]   and potential than we are of our darkness.
[00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:19.580]   We feel more comfortable in our old bad habits and the things we used to do."
[00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:21.940]   Which is kind of a crazy thought, you know what I mean?
[00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:25.500]   Some people are so ... It's actually hard for them to evolve and become their better
[00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:26.980]   self because it's just uncomfortable.
[00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:27.980]   You talk about that.
[00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:30.700]   People don't like being uncomfortable.
[00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.160]   It's easier to be comfortable.
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:33.700]   It's easier to just live in comfort.
[00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:34.700]   It's hard to be uncomfortable.
[00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:39.660]   It's hard to do something repeatedly over and over and over again.
[00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:43.900]   There's a point when you train, you're going to reach a wall.
[00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:47.220]   People's greatest growth comes when you push through that wall.
[00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:51.140]   Then when that uncomfortable becomes comfortable, then it's the choice, "Can I get to uncomfortable
[00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:52.140]   again?"
[00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:54.060]   That's where greatness really comes through.
[00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:56.340]   It's that constant pursuit of being uncomfortable.
[00:11:56.340 --> 00:12:01.500]   When most people just want to stay comfortable, they reach a point of being content.
[00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:04.140]   I know these types of conversations, it's hard for people sometimes.
[00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:08.700]   They're like, "Oh my goodness, this is kind of freaking me out a little bit."
[00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:13.200]   But we all have it in us in order to get to that place, but you have to choose to go there.
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:17.780]   Once you test yourself, you realize what you have, you realize you perform at a higher
[00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:18.780]   level.
[00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:19.780]   More confidence comes.
[00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:21.940]   That confidence shows up in all areas of your life.
[00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:22.940]   It just feels good.
[00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:27.860]   If you're not doing what you know you need to do to feel good, that doesn't feel good.
[00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:28.860]   People seek that sometimes.
[00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:29.860]   Yeah.
[00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:33.620]   You said on the way here, you woke up at one o'clock to get your workout in because you
[00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:36.540]   knew you're going to perform your best.
[00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:37.540]   You got to get your workout in.
[00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:41.580]   When you went to go speak in Orlando.
[00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:43.980]   I think you brought that up one time about being uncomfortable.
[00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:46.220]   I actually took that and I tried to apply it.
[00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:48.340]   I hate cold tubs.
[00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:53.700]   You sent me a text one time and you were like, "Uncomfortability," or whatever the word is,
[00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:56.340]   "speeds up the process of mental toughness."
[00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:59.980]   I took that and I was like, "I'm going to try to make myself as uncomfortable as I can
[00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:05.820]   be in my workouts or my recovery," whatever it is.
[00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:06.820]   It really is true.
[00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:13.300]   When you push yourself, even in the weight room, if you throw on to where you can barely
[00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:16.580]   lift it when it's uncomfortable, that's how you really get stronger.
[00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:17.940]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:20.140]   That's a fact.
[00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:21.140]   That's another moment.
[00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:25.900]   I remember when you were coming back from your rehab, I remember when I would come for
[00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:30.860]   lifts and Nick is pushing everybody as he always does, keeping everybody uncomfortable.
[00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:35.260]   I remember you had the iPad tracking everybody, but you were still getting a little bit in.
[00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:39.140]   I knew there was something special about your ability to stay uncomfortable when you'd grab
[00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:40.140]   some weights.
[00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:42.300]   Even though you probably weren't supposed to be doing it, you're like, "I'm going to
[00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:43.300]   push a little bit.
[00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:44.300]   I'm going to push a little bit."
[00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:45.300]   See, that's a choice.
[00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:47.140]   It was a choice for you to push yourself there.
[00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:49.740]   It was a choice for you to get inside the cold tub.
[00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:52.840]   What a lot of people don't realize is those little decisions and choices.
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:56.460]   My mother taught me the greatest life lesson I've ever learned before she passed away.
[00:13:56.460 --> 00:14:00.380]   It's not how long you live, it's how you choose to live your life.
[00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:04.900]   Most people don't realize when you choose to get in the cold tub, you're manufacturing
[00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:07.700]   a 35-point game.
[00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:11.260]   When you eat right, and I know how important nutrition is to you because I used to make
[00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:16.980]   smoothies for you in the weight room too, so I know the nutrition, you're manufacturing
[00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:24.020]   by eating right a 32-point game, a 17-rebound night, a new contract that you signed.
[00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:28.340]   All those little things manufacture, but most people aren't willing to consistently show
[00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:29.580]   up and do those things.
[00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:33.820]   It's gotten to the point, like you said, I don't even feel ... I don't feel comfortable
[00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:35.260]   now unless I'm uncomfortable.
[00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:36.700]   I mean, you're probably the same way.
[00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:41.420]   Unless you see the growth every day, you're not going to feel like yourself.
[00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:46.220]   You have a good saying, you text it to me every Friday, "Champions create distance on
[00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:47.220]   Fridays."
[00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:48.700]   Where does that come from?
[00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:52.020]   That came from ... All my work actually started corporately.
[00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:54.700]   My speaking, I've been doing this for 15 years.
[00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:59.100]   Everything was corporate from '06 until 2011, until my old high school basketball coach
[00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:05.020]   in 2011 called me, his name was Todd Basler, and he said, "Benny Boy," he still calls me
[00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:08.740]   Benny Boy to this day, "Benny Boy, these guys are underperforming.
[00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:09.740]   Come and talk to them.
[00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:10.740]   Will you come talk to these guys for me?"
[00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:15.780]   They were playing Parkway Central, Central was ranked 10th, Ledoux was unranked, and
[00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:19.660]   I came and I fired these guys up, and they knock off Parkway Central, and I'm hooked.
[00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:21.220]   That's when all my work in sports started.
[00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:25.660]   Then it became the sports analogies and business kind of blending it together, and then it
[00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:26.660]   just hit me.
[00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:29.980]   I've been saying it for eight or nine years now, it's every Friday, "Champions create
[00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:32.060]   distance on Fridays."
[00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:33.060]   Most people, what do they do?
[00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:37.020]   If we're talking about an eight to five, they show up, I can't wait to clock out, they're
[00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:41.420]   already thinking about the weekend, and then they get to Saturday, and they're so disappointed
[00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:46.260]   in themselves that they didn't work on Friday, which then creates stress for Monday.
[00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.860]   Yet the highest performers say, "If today's a work day, I'm going to attack that work
[00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:50.860]   day.
[00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:52.160]   I'm going to create distance from the people."
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:53.400]   Maybe that's creating a promotion.
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:56.100]   It's a manufacturing ... It's manufacturing.
[00:15:56.100 --> 00:16:01.580]   Their next opportunity, and so champions tend to do the little bit extra when other individuals
[00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:03.940]   stay content, and they hold back from doing what's needed.
[00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:04.940]   Yeah, no doubt.
[00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:08.460]   It's crazy, because people will take those days off, those Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays.
[00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:10.460]   Then they're stressed out come Monday.
[00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:13.860]   You come stressed out, or even in basketball, like I've noticed this.
[00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:18.300]   If I take two days off on the weekend, you come back and you lost a little bit of the
[00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:20.340]   ground you gained.
[00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:24.540]   Even if you go in for a little bit, touch shots, feel the ball, you're going to retain
[00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:27.620]   some of the stuff you worked on through the week, but if you just take the whole weekend
[00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:30.500]   off, at least for me, I can't.
[00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:35.100]   I don't come back the same come Monday, and then it takes Tuesday and Wednesday.
[00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:37.980]   By Wednesday, I'll feel back normal, and then ... You know what I mean?
[00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:42.900]   If you're just consistent every day, that's the way to do it.
[00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:46.500]   For this conversation, all I had to do was go through our text, and I got stuff I wanted
[00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:47.500]   to ask you about.
[00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:51.380]   Another one you talk about is no undue pressure.
[00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:56.620]   You text me this before games, you'll say, "Eliminate distractions and no undue pressure."
[00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:59.020]   What do you mean by that?
[00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:02.460]   When you step onto the court, the last thing I want you thinking about is I have to have
[00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:04.260]   a 35-point night.
[00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:08.340]   I have to hit six three-pointers tonight.
[00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:11.400]   That's thinking about the result that you cannot control.
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:15.380]   If you do your preparation, which we know how hard you work off the court in those unseen
[00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:20.380]   hours, as our guy Drew Hamlin likes to say, in those unseen hours, then you're prepared
[00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:22.180]   for the game.
[00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:23.220]   Why should there be pressure?
[00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:24.220]   Why should there be stress?
[00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:25.420]   Why should you worry about your point?
[00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:26.860]   You've already put in the work.
[00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:30.580]   You just need to play loose, attack those 48 minutes, give it everything that you've
[00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:32.540]   got, one possession at a time.
[00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:34.460]   Don't put any pressure on yourself.
[00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:36.780]   Don't put the pressure on yourself.
[00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:40.700]   Eliminate all distractions so that there's peace of mind when you get onto the court.
[00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:42.180]   We've had conversations, right?
[00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:45.420]   Times where things are challenging, your mind's racing a little bit.
[00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:49.220]   When we can quiet the mind, it allows you to attack at your highest level.
[00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:50.660]   It's crazy how that works.
[00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:55.660]   The freer you are, the higher you can perform, if you've put in the work beforehand.
[00:17:55.660 --> 00:18:00.820]   That's the key, though, if you've put in the work, because once the game starts, you can
[00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:05.380]   look the man across from you, and if you know he hasn't prepared, you can see it in his
[00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:07.460]   eyes, you will have 35 points.
[00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:10.340]   I will attack every possession, you're not going to stop me tonight, because I can see
[00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:14.180]   in your eyes you have not worked the way that I work, and that's a massive advantage that
[00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:15.180]   you can have as an athlete.
[00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:20.380]   Man, especially at this level, because it's all about -- at the NBA level, it's not about
[00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:21.380]   the skill.
[00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:22.380]   Everyone's skilled.
[00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:26.020]   There's more skilled players than others, but it's way more about who has the mental
[00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:29.940]   edge, and that only comes from the work you put in.
[00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:35.420]   I remember my rookie year, people were like, "Why is he shooting that shot?"
[00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:40.780]   I knew I shot that shot way more times than anyone else on the court was putting in the
[00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:41.780]   work, you know what I mean?
[00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:46.420]   You just feel more confident in yourself, and that's the way to do it.
[00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:49.980]   You just came out with a book, bro, On Common Leadership.
[00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:52.900]   You talk about the way the best leaders lead.
[00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:56.380]   Talk about that, because you're obviously a leader of leaders, you know what I'm saying?
[00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:59.180]   You talk to a lot of people, help a lot of people.
[00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:01.060]   What are your tips for being a good leader?
[00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:04.740]   Do you think it needs to be vocal, by example?
[00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:05.740]   What are your biggest things?
[00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:10.300]   >> So, there's -- I would say there's five common things, themes, so I wanted to honor
[00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:15.780]   11 leaders that have impacted my life, because the blessing in my work is, you know, you
[00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:17.860]   can say these things, I've helped you.
[00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:19.620]   You inspire me, right?
[00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:22.220]   Your work every day, you fighting through challenge and adversity.
[00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:25.700]   When I see pain in your eyes, but you fight through it, that inspires me, right?
[00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:30.380]   So, it's an iron sharpens iron, so I wanted to honor 11 people that have impacted my life,
[00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:34.300]   how I show up, and 11 amazing leaders that I've worked with, and there's five things
[00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:35.800]   that they had in common.
[00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:37.860]   Number one, they do what I call the unrequired.
[00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:40.980]   They're willing to do that little bit extra, like we talk about.
[00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:45.100]   Everybody knows what's required for you to win the day, to be your best, but the individuals
[00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:50.340]   who do that little bit extra, they're the ones -- a little bit extra every day, you
[00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:53.480]   keep stacking those days, makes a profound difference.
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:55.000]   Number two, they connect to the burn.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.620]   They understand what drives them, so for me, when I wake up, I think about my mother every
[00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:00.620]   single day.
[00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:05.020]   Literally, on my phone, my alarm on my phone, it says my mother's name, Jan Fishman Newman.
[00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:07.020]   I wear a bracelet that says legacy.
[00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:08.020]   I have a little journal.
[00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:12.540]   I write Jan Fishman Newman Lake every morning, and that's what the highest performers do.
[00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:14.420]   They connect to that burn.
[00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:16.380]   They also live to the standard.
[00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:20.960]   They don't allow their feelings to dictate how they show up, so if I were to text you
[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:23.780]   before a game, "Oh, you went for 35 last night.
[00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:24.780]   Go do it again."
[00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:29.940]   We're living in the past of your feelings, as opposed to, same thing, nothing changes,
[00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:33.860]   no undue pressure, eliminate distractions, one possession at a time, just go cut it loose
[00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:35.900]   and be you.
[00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:40.380]   So that's a standard that you've created for you to have the right mindset when you step
[00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:41.380]   on the court.
[00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:47.220]   - Yeah, I want to pause you right there, because Giannis, I think he is a professional at doing
[00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:48.220]   that.
[00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:49.660]   Nikola Jokic is another one.
[00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:52.980]   It doesn't matter if they play good, bad, whatever, they're not thinking about that
[00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:53.980]   once the game's over.
[00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:54.980]   They're their same self.
[00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:59.620]   If they have 50 points, they're not getting too high, because then it's going to affect
[00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:00.700]   how they play the next game.
[00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:05.020]   I know a lot of athletes, they'll have a good game, but then they'll be really high for
[00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:08.500]   a second, but then they're kind of scared for the next game, because I've got to outdo
[00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:13.060]   what I just did, or match it, and then they end up tripping, or not having a good game.
[00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:18.180]   But like you said, when you can move on from that previous performance, or maybe be happy,
[00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:22.140]   but then once you go home, you sleep, wake up the next day, it's all over again.
[00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:24.180]   You've got to do it again.
[00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:31.460]   That, I feel like, is a big key for athletes to be consistent in their performances.
[00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:34.380]   - And that goes to the fourth principle, which is to lock in.
[00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:35.780]   You've got to lock in consistently.
[00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:36.780]   It's not occasionally.
[00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:39.660]   So you now understand, you have to be happy for yourself.
[00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:45.100]   You had a great game, team wins a game, great team effort, great contribution, but the next
[00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:46.980]   day you've got to lock in again.
[00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:48.240]   That's what the greatest champions do.
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.240]   You just said it.
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:51.460]   You've got to go back to work the next day.
[00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:53.300]   And then the last thing, it's a transfer of belief.
[00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:57.500]   They believe in themselves, and they believe in the individuals around them.
[00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:03.460]   So there's a great belief you have in yourself, because for all of us, I always say, everything
[00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:06.940]   you need is already in you, meaning God gave it to you, but you've got to choose to go
[00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:07.940]   and take it.
[00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:10.660]   So that's a belief you have, I'm going to go take this every day.
[00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:12.780]   A lot of people don't choose to do that.
[00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:16.380]   But then you also have an opportunity through your example to lead other people on the team,
[00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:20.260]   to lead other people in your life, your brothers and sisters and your big, beautiful family,
[00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:21.260]   to be an example.
[00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:24.580]   Hey, go take yours too, because you would do it for them.
[00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:25.780]   I know how much you love your family.
[00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:27.500]   You would do it for the whole family.
[00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:30.220]   But the reality is, you've got to take care of yours, but be a great example for them
[00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:31.480]   to do it for themselves.
[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:32.740]   - No doubt.
[00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:36.840]   And obviously, this is the last question, everyone's not a leader.
[00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:40.720]   Not everyone can do, put in the work like we do, they just don't have it in them.
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:44.100]   But if you had, well, I mean, they might, but it's tough.
[00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:46.900]   But if you had three things you could tell the young people, or that you see the younger
[00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:52.060]   generation, three habits they could change to kind of improve themselves, you know, people
[00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:56.180]   that just want to get out of that rut, you know, that cycle of whatever it is, what would
[00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:57.300]   they be?
[00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:01.380]   I know one for me, at least, I started waking up early, you inspire me a little bit earlier
[00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:03.180]   than I have to.
[00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:05.740]   - Don't wake up as early as me, though, you need more sleep.
[00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:09.340]   - But just a little bit earlier, you know, 6.30 or 7 a.m., before I have to really do
[00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:13.360]   stuff to get that time to lock in and think.
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:14.360]   That's a big one for me.
[00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:15.980]   What would you say is three habits?
[00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:18.620]   - Well, I think a morning routine would be one.
[00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:21.380]   So we'll steal your answer, 'cause that is definitely one.
[00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:23.420]   Number two, I think, step into the fire.
[00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:27.020]   You know, too many people, they see the fire of life and they run.
[00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:30.700]   You know, so don't do it by yourself, but have great mentors, have great coaches.
[00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:36.940]   My basketball coach, who I mentioned earlier, that man has mentored me now for over 25 years.
[00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:39.900]   He's still one of the biggest blessings in my life.
[00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:43.500]   I mean, other books I've written, he's a character in books that I've written, I mean, this man
[00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:44.580]   has helped mold me.
[00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:47.540]   But I need him to get through challenge and adversity, right?
[00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:49.660]   So don't go into that fire alone.
[00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:51.760]   And then number three, have great habits.
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:56.860]   And understand that consistency is not couple days in a row here, and then I'm gonna stop,
[00:23:56.860 --> 00:24:00.140]   and then a couple good days, no, consistency's every day.
[00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:01.940]   You mentioned it earlier, it's every day.
[00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:02.940]   - Even on the weekends?
[00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:04.840]   Do you get a day off?
[00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:10.300]   - So for me, I have a crazy workout that I do, and today, this morning, was actually
[00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:13.140]   my 823rd straight day doing this workout.
[00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:19.020]   It's 45 minutes, it's 10 different exercises, it's 250 air squats unbroken, planking for
[00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:20.900]   almost 10 minutes, all these crazy things.
[00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:25.020]   But I do that 'cause I'm an old man, I gotta keep up with you and try to stay fresh with
[00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:26.580]   you young guys.
[00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:27.940]   But for me, it's every day.
[00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:31.740]   I don't necessarily recommend that to anybody, but for me, I will share with you, I feel
[00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:32.740]   great.
[00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:36.860]   I haven't had any, I'm a 42-year-old man, I haven't had any injuries in 823 straight
[00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:37.860]   days.
[00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:41.020]   So I'm not saying that's the answer for everybody, go consult your physician, but I think to
[00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:44.420]   get your body moving, it makes you feel good.
[00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:45.420]   It makes you confident.
[00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:49.260]   So all the habits, whether it's your working out, whether it's being present and focused
[00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:53.300]   with your family, whether it's getting your work in, we can all choose to focus on what's
[00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:57.140]   gonna make us win one day at a time, and that's a choice.
[00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:58.140]   >> That's true, man.
[00:24:58.140 --> 00:24:59.140]   You motivate me.
[00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:01.140]   I know a lot of people watching this, they got a lot of wisdom today.
[00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:03.140]   I appreciate you being on Curious Mike.
[00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:04.140]   >> Appreciate you.
[00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:05.140]   >> Yes, sir.
[00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:06.140]   >> Rap.
