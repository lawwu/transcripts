[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.300]   We are here with another episode of Curious Mike out here in San Diego with my guy Ben
[00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.300]   Newman.
[00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.180]   Appreciate you pulling up on me, my guy.
[00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.180]   Appreciate you, man.
[00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.520]   So, you know, obviously we've known each other for a while.
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.440]   I remember meeting you back in Mizzou while I was there for that year.
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.780]   But I play basketball and you obviously are in a different field.
[00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.000]   You work with some hoopers, but kind of tell us a little bit about what you do.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.640]   Well, for me, it's all the mental side, right?
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.180]   So in business and in sports, it's working with individuals on what it takes to embrace
[00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.180]   the mental side.
[00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.000]   And I know this is supposed to be about me, but you talk about the mental side.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.400]   I'm just so proud of everything you've accomplished and how you've embraced the challenge and
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.720]   adversity.
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:47.980]   That's really what I do every day.
[00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.620]   It's helping people embrace challenge and adversity to write their ultimate story.
[00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.360]   And you've had some pretty awesome chapters that have come after adversity.
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.440]   And so that's what I work every day with is just helping people embrace that to write
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.520]   those next chapters and ultimately their story.
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.840]   Yeah, it's unbelievable, man.
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.720]   I mean, coming through all that adversity.
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.160]   Do you have any stories from kind of when we met or any stories during our time in Mizzou
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.440]   of me that you like would remember?
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.440]   Because you were always around, but I didn't always, obviously you saw everything.
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.440]   Did you have any stories?
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.600]   So first one is, so I was a hooper back in the day, as you know, however, I can shoot
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.600]   a little bit.
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.600]   I was slow.
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.840]   So I had a couple D3 opportunities, but ended up going to Michigan State to watch them win
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:30.840]   a title.
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.920]   But at being a shooter, I was always impressed with shooters.
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.000]   So one of the first things was, I thought when I came to the first practice my first
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.580]   day, you were at the top of the key, and you hit 19 straight three pointers.
[00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:48.720]   And what went through my mind, it wasn't necessarily the 19, it was the number of shots that this
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.360]   young man must have taken in order to put yourself in position to hit 19 straight three
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.360]   pointers.
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.360]   Right.
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.940]   So I always look at work ethic, like what allows somebody to achieve what they achieve.
[00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.960]   And so number one was the work ethic.
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:08.240]   And then the second story, which is painful, but the pain is what leads us to our growth,
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.720]   was I remember the first game.
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.720]   Yeah.
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.720]   I remember Iowa State.
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.720]   Right.
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.720]   I mean, everybody's excited.
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:14.720]   Everybody's energized.
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.520]   And I remember you came up to me in the locker room, and you're like, bro, I don't know if
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.520]   I can go.
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.520]   Yeah.
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.480]   And I mean, the emotion was in your face.
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.600]   Your back was killing you.
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.600]   And I just admired the fact that you put it on the line for the team that night.
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.200]   You made it about the team.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.200]   Yeah.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.280]   And you attempted to go out there knowing the pain that you were in.
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.920]   And we know what happened afterwards.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.000]   But then to come back into battle to when we were playing Tennessee in the NCAA tournament
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   that year.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   I think about that.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.560]   And it's one of those things, like you got heart, you got guts, you got fight in you.
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.960]   That's why you're achieving what you're achieving.
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.440]   But those are the things that I remember.
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.960]   It's the hard work, but then it's the mindset that you have.
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.880]   That's crazy, because I remember that vividly, too, that game.
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.400]   And I remember coming up to you, because I was like, huh, he's such a good speaker.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.200]   What if he could just speak it into me?
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.320]   What if he could say something to make the pain go away?
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.120]   Because I knew you had that.
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.040]   So yeah, I remember that.
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.800]   And then, but no, bro, it was just too much.
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.280]   The few days leading up to that game, it was getting worse and worse.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.080]   So by that time, it was impossible to play.
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.820]   But I mean, you were in my corner the entire time through the rehab process, then going
[00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.080]   into the draft.
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.360]   And then our relationship kind of changed, because I reached out to you one day.
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.480]   And I was like, man, I'm going through this.
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.440]   I forget what it was, but I was like, could you just send me messages daily?
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.400]   This was, man, years ago, bro.
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.160]   I was like, can you send me messages to encourage me daily?
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.800]   And ever since then, every single morning, I wake up to a text from you-- I don't think
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.640]   even as one morning-- saying something motivational, something for the day.
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.140]   And that's unbelievable, because I mentioned it one time.
[00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.800]   And I know a lot of people, they will, like you talk about it all the time, they'll talk
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.460]   the talk, or they'll say, yeah, I'll do this for you, whatever.
[00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.820]   But then they never follow through, or they might feel like a week.
[00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.760]   It's been every single day.
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.640]   How did you get that consistency about you, or just that routine?
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.280]   I mean, those texts are coming in at 2 or 3 AM.
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.280]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.040]   My favorite texts are the ones where you say things to me like, bro, what time did you
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.040]   go to bed last night?
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.040]   Bro, what time did you wake up today?
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.040]   It's unbelievable.
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.640]   Well, it's one of those things.
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.720]   I'm driven by embracing your everyday opportunity.
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.720]   And you know my story.
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.080]   I mean, I shared it with you guys the first time that I spoke at Mizzou, when Konzo brought
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.960]   me in, which was such a blessing, being able to work with you guys that year.
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.040]   And my mom passed away 11 days before my eighth birthday.
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.440]   My parents were divorced when I was six months old.
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.600]   So all I've ever known is challenge and adversity.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.440]   I'm a 42-year-old man.
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.980]   My mother passed away at 38 from a rare muscle disease there's still no cure for.
[00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.960]   So every day past 38 has been a gift that God has given me.
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.800]   So if I have a blessing of having a relationship with somebody like you, and you ask me to
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.160]   help you with something, I'm going to be there to help you.
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.880]   And that's all I know.
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.200]   And I think the world, unfortunately, there are too many people, as you just referenced,
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.200]   they like to talk, but the action tells the real story.
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.200]   And so our real relationship comes from, can you call me in a bind, and I'm going to be
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.200]   there for you.
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.760]   Oh, Mike, I'll call you in a few days.
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:23.760]   I'm busy.
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.680]   No, no, no, I'm going to be there for you, because that's the relationship that we have.
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.560]   And I think that's what life is all about.
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.720]   And I think there's too many people who talk, rather than driving action and building relationships,
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.440]   because that's what life's about.
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:35.440]   No doubt.
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.640]   And you do a great job of helping us.
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.640]   I mean, those Mizzou days, me now, I know you talk to a lot of teams still.
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.800]   But you, personally, as your own individual, how did you get to the point where you were
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.920]   making these life habits of-- like, I remember not too long ago, there was a fight.
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.640]   I think it ended at, like, 12 AM.
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.680]   I still get my text from you at 3 AM.
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.840]   Like, I'm like, bro, did you sleep?
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.380]   I just saw you on TV at the fight.
[00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.480]   How did you get that in you, where you were just--
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.640]   Now, that one in full disclosure.
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.520]   I'm going to tell the people, I sent the text before I went to bed that night.
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:09.520]   Oh, you did?
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:10.520]   You did?
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:11.520]   Because I was still up.
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.520]   I was still up at the time.
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.440]   And I'm like, I was thinking to myself, I mean, am I going to wake up in an hour and
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.440]   send my messages?
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:17.440]   And I'm like, no, no.
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.440]   I'm sending them before I go to bed.
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.440]   That makes sense.
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.760]   So that was one night where I had to do that, because I do have to get some sleep.
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:28.400]   But a lot of the discipline is, it's wanting to maximize every single day, right?
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.440]   So for you, you have a choice, right?
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.400]   You have earned everything that you've had.
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.040]   You fought through all the adversity because you made a choice.
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.040]   Here's how I'm going to work.
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:39.640]   And oftentimes, it's not the work that the nuggets ask you to do.
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:40.880]   It's the unrequired work.
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:41.880]   It's the extra work.
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:46.040]   You know, my guy, Messer, I mean, I remember speaking to his team at SIUE when he played
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.960]   back in the day years ago.
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:48.960]   They would bring me in to speak.
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.680]   And, you know, it's the work that you guys put in in the gym.
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:52.720]   That's what gets it done.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:57.620]   And so for me, it's the little things that I've been blessed to have coaches and mentors
[00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:01.040]   in my life who have helped me understand if you do the little things every day and you
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:05.240]   keep stacking those habits every day, day after day after day, from my nutrition to
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:09.760]   my health, to how I show up for my family and my kids, to how I work.
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:15.040]   If we just take it one day at a time and choose to win one day at a time, you will have success.
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:19.160]   And I think a lot of people, they get so caught up in, "I want the result.
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.160]   Give me the result right now.
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.720]   Oh, just give it to me right now."
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:26.240]   As opposed to, "Are you willing to do what it takes every day in order to achieve that
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.240]   result?"
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.280]   And most people, they don't have that consistency.
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.980]   And I believe one more thing.
[00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:34.280]   We have to be the example.
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:35.920]   We have to be the example.
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.600]   You can't talk about it if you're not doing it.
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:42.920]   I mean, there would be a different level of respect, or maybe we wouldn't be sitting here
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.200]   if I didn't show up in my life and have discipline.
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.920]   Because how could you and I have a conversation about discipline if I was completely undisciplined?
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.640]   There would just be a different level of respect.
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:55.560]   And so I feel like you have to be an example of showing up and doing the things.
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:58.960]   How could I have a conversation with you about discipline if I'm undisciplined?
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:07:59.960]   Exactly.
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:05.000]   So man, I know a lot of people, they want to make these life habits, these new changes,
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.660]   but then you know everyone, we're human.
[00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:13.120]   So I don't know if you ever have off days, but when people have a bad day or they feel
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:19.600]   like they lost the day, how do you, when you're so driven by a standard and you're putting
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:23.720]   these streaks together, whatever it is, and you have a bad day, how do you kind of bounce
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:27.520]   back from that guilt and not let one bad day turn into, "Oh, I'm going to just give it
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:28.520]   all up."
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:29.520]   Because a lot of people do that.
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.400]   They make these New Year's resolutions.
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:35.460]   They might do good for a week, and then they fall off for a day, and now it's kind of hard
[00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:37.360]   to get back on the right path.
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.120]   What do you say to people like that?
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:42.140]   For me, it's about the shifting of perspective.
[00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:46.360]   As tough as it is on the ears, I go back to my mother coming to the dining room table
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:51.680]   with an IV stand while we had 24-hour nursing care in our house, her last year living, to
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.820]   ask my older brother Drew and I how our days were at school.
[00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:58.720]   So if my mother was able to do that, what's really a bad day for me?
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:08:59.880]   So I just shift the perspective.
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.680]   I call that the power to reframe.
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:06.140]   It's our ability to focus on the solution rather than the problem, and I think that's
[00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:07.140]   the opportunity.
[00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:08.140]   It doesn't mean I don't have bad days.
[00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:09.660]   I still have two coaches.
[00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:11.060]   I read books every day.
[00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:13.540]   I have mentors, so I'm high maintenance, right?
[00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:14.540]   I have issues.
[00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:15.540]   I have problems.
[00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:17.940]   I have struggles, but I have people there to help me.
[00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:21.680]   So number one, I think it's acknowledging it's okay to have challenge and adversity.
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:26.260]   I have it all the time, but I have those confidants and individuals that I reach out to who help
[00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:27.260]   me get through it.
[00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.500]   I think anytime we try to manage it alone, that's where we get in trouble.
[00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:33.420]   That's why I admire when you'll pick up the phone and call me, "Hey, let's talk through
[00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:34.420]   something."
[00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:35.420]   Right?
[00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:36.900]   If you try to do it by yourself, you take it on to the court.
[00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:40.460]   So my goal in a conversation like that is I want to provide peace of mind for you.
[00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:44.140]   Let's leave it off the court so you can step on to the court, have intentional focus, lock
[00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:47.020]   in, and play your game.
[00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:52.180]   I think, like you said, the ability to reframe is so much more easier said than done, but
[00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:53.740]   it really is a choice.
[00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:58.180]   I think a lot of people, especially in today's age, I don't know if it's social media or
[00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:03.460]   what it is, but they have a hard time with anxiety, like choosing their thoughts.
[00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:06.740]   Is that kind of like a muscle, like you have to just do it over and over, and then you
[00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:12.340]   get better at kind of choosing to think positive, or is it just getting off your phone?
[00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:16.180]   I think this is it for me, kind of getting off my phone, going into quiet space, and
[00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:18.860]   just sitting, and then kind of changing perspectives, because it's hard.
[00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:21.700]   Like you say it all the time, eliminate distractions.
[00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:23.620]   Is that the only way you can really do it, you think?
[00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:24.620]   Yeah.
[00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:25.620]   I mean, you just said it.
[00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:29.860]   You've identified, "I have to put my phone away if I'm actually going to free my mind."
[00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:33.260]   So most people know, "You should probably put your phone away," and then what do most
[00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:34.260]   people do?
[00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:35.260]   They don't put their phone away.
[00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.740]   So you've identified, "Okay, here's the shift I have to make in my environment if I'm actually
[00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:41.440]   going to clear my mind," and I think that's common for anyone.
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:46.000]   We all know what we need to do, but do we actually choose to do the things we know we
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.940]   need to do to have a clear mind to perform, or to give ourself that peace, or to be able
[00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:51.300]   to push away?
[00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:52.620]   Isn't that funny, though?
[00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:57.460]   We always say, for a lot of people that struggle with social media use or whatever, "When I
[00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:01.020]   get off social media, I feel the best I've ever felt," but then we always kind of end
[00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:04.580]   up going back to some of the destructive things in our life.
[00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:06.020]   I don't know where that comes from.
[00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:11.940]   I know there's a quote that says, "A lot of times we are more afraid of our true light
[00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:14.340]   and potential than we are of our darkness.
[00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:19.540]   We feel more comfortable kind of in our old bad habits and the things we used to do,"
[00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:21.920]   which is kind of a crazy thought, you know what I mean?
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:25.460]   Some people are so ... It's actually hard for them to evolve and become their better
[00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:26.460]   self because it's just uncomfortable.
[00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:27.460]   Can you talk about that?
[00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:30.660]   Well, people don't like being uncomfortable.
[00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:32.140]   It's easier to be comfortable.
[00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:33.660]   It's easier to just live in comfort.
[00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:34.660]   It's hard to be uncomfortable.
[00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:39.660]   It's hard to do something repeatedly over and over and over again.
[00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:44.780]   There's a point when you train, you're going to reach a wall, and people's greatest growth
[00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:49.220]   comes when you push through that wall, and then when that uncomfortable becomes comfortable,
[00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:51.900]   then it's the choice, "Can I get to uncomfortable again?"
[00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:54.060]   That's where greatness really comes through.
[00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:56.340]   It's that constant pursuit of being uncomfortable.
[00:11:56.340 --> 00:12:01.500]   When most people just want to stay comfortable, they reach a point of being content.
[00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:04.140]   I know these types of conversations, it's hard for people sometimes.
[00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:09.060]   They're like, "Oh my goodness, this is kind of freaking me out a little bit," but we all
[00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:13.220]   have it in us in order to get to that place, but you have to choose to go there.
[00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:16.260]   Once you test yourself, you realize what you have.
[00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.220]   You realize you perform at a higher level.
[00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:19.280]   More confidence comes.
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:22.980]   That confidence shows up in all areas of your life, and it just feels good.
[00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:27.580]   If you're not doing what you know you need to do to feel good, that doesn't feel good,
[00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:28.580]   but people seek that sometimes.
[00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:33.460]   Yeah, so you said on the way here, you woke up at 1 o'clock to get your workout in because
[00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:36.500]   you knew you're going to perform your best.
[00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:37.500]   You got to get your workout in.
[00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:42.600]   When you went to go speak in Orlando, so I actually ... I think you brought that up one
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:46.220]   time about being uncomfortable, and I actually took that and I tried to apply it to my ... I
[00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:52.620]   hate cold tubs, so I was like ... You sent me a text one time and you were like, "Uncomfortability,"
[00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:56.940]   or whatever the word is, "Speeds up the process of mental toughness," and so I took that and
[00:12:56.940 --> 00:13:01.900]   I was like, "I'm going to try to make myself as uncomfortable as I can be in my workouts
[00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:06.820]   or my recovery," whatever it is, and it really is true.
[00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:13.320]   When you push yourself, even in the weight room, if you throw on to where you can barely
[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:17.620]   lift it when it's uncomfortable, that's how you really get stronger, you know what I'm
[00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:18.620]   saying?
[00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:20.140]   So that's a fact.
[00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:22.180]   That's another moment I remember.
[00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:27.260]   When you were coming back from your rehab, I remember when I would come for lifts and
[00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:31.180]   Nick is pushing everybody, as he always does, keeping everybody uncomfortable, and I remember
[00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:35.420]   you had the iPad tracking everybody, but you were still getting a little bit in, and I
[00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:39.180]   knew there was something special about your ability to stay uncomfortable when you'd grab
[00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:42.020]   some weights, and even though you probably weren't supposed to be doing it, you're like,
[00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:43.020]   "I'm going to push a little bit.
[00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:44.020]   I'm going to push a little bit."
[00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:45.020]   See, that's a choice.
[00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:47.180]   It was a choice for you to push yourself there.
[00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:49.340]   It was a choice for you to get inside the cold tub.
[00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:52.860]   What a lot of people don't realize is those little decisions and choices.
[00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:56.480]   My mother taught me the greatest life lesson I've ever learned before she passed away.
[00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:57.620]   It's not how long you live.
[00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:01.700]   It's how you choose to live your life, and most people don't realize when you choose
[00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:07.700]   to get in the cold tub, you're manufacturing a 35-point game, right?
[00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:11.240]   When you eat right, and I know how important nutrition is to you because I used to make
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:13.380]   smoothies for you in the weight room, too, right?
[00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:15.480]   I know the nutrition.
[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:16.480]   That's one of those.
[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:22.780]   You're manufacturing, by eating right, a 32-point game, a 17-rebound night, a new contract that
[00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:23.780]   you signed, right?
[00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:28.140]   So all those little things manufacture, but most people aren't willing to consistently
[00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:29.540]   show up and do those things.
[00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:33.820]   It's gotten to the point, like you said, I don't even feel ... I don't feel comfortable
[00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:36.700]   now unless I'm uncomfortable, and you're probably the same way.
[00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:41.400]   Unless you see the growth every day, you're not going to feel like yourself.
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:42.820]   You have a good saying.
[00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:46.940]   You text it to me every Friday, "Champions create distance on Fridays."
[00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:48.440]   Where does that come from?
[00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:51.900]   So that came from ... All my work actually started corporately.
[00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:54.320]   So my speaking, I've been doing this for 15 years.
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:58.700]   So everything was corporate from '06 until 2011, until my old high school basketball
[00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:01.220]   coach in 2011 called me.
[00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:05.780]   His name is Todd Basler, and he said, "Benny boy," he still calls me Benny boy to this
[00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:08.740]   day, "Benny boy, these guys are underperforming.
[00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:09.740]   Come and talk to them.
[00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:10.740]   Will you come talk to these guys for me?"
[00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:15.820]   And they were playing Parkway Central, Central was ranked 10th, Ledoux was unranked, and
[00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:19.660]   I came and I fired these guys up, and they knock off Parkway Central, and I'm hooked.
[00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:21.620]   That's when all my work in sports started.
[00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:25.500]   So then it became the sports analogies and business kind of blending it together.
[00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:28.180]   And then it just hit me, I think I've been saying it for eight or nine years now, it's
[00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:31.660]   every Friday, "Champions create distance on Fridays."
[00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:33.220]   Because most people, what do they do, right?
[00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:36.980]   If we're talking about an eight to five, they show up, I can't wait to clock out, they're
[00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:41.380]   already thinking about the weekend, and then they get to Saturday, and they're so disappointed
[00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:46.220]   in themselves that they didn't work on Friday, which then creates stress for Monday.
[00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:49.800]   Yet the highest performers say, "If today's a work day, I'm going to attack that work
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:53.340]   day, I'm going to create distance from the people, maybe that's creating a promotion."
[00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:55.220]   It's a manufacturing, right?
[00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:58.020]   It's manufacturing their next opportunity.
[00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:02.340]   And so champions tend to do the little bit extra when other individuals stay content
[00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:03.980]   and they hold back from doing what's needed.
[00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:05.100]   Yeah, no doubt.
[00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:09.060]   It's crazy because people will take those days off, those Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays.
[00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:10.420]   And then they're stressed out come Monday.
[00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:11.420]   You come stressed out.
[00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:13.820]   Or even in basketball, like I've noticed this.
[00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:18.260]   If I take two days off on the weekend, you come back and you lost a little bit of the
[00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.100]   ground you gained.
[00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:24.540]   So even if you go in for a little bit, touch shots, feel the ball, you're going to retain
[00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:26.020]   some of the stuff you worked on through the week.
[00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:31.540]   But if you just take the whole weekend off, at least for me, I can't, I don't come back
[00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:33.420]   the same come Monday.
[00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:35.100]   And then it takes Tuesday and Wednesday.
[00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:36.980]   By Wednesday, I'll feel back normal.
[00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:37.980]   And then, you know what I mean?
[00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:42.900]   So if you're just consistent every day, that's the way to do it.
[00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:46.500]   For this conversation, all I had to do was go through our text and I got stuff I wanted
[00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:47.500]   to ask you about.
[00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:51.020]   So another one you talk about is no undue pressure.
[00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:55.260]   And you text me this before games, you'll say, "Eliminate distractions and no undue
[00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:56.260]   pressure."
[00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.980]   What do you mean by that?
[00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:02.420]   When you step onto the court, the last thing I want you thinking about is, "I have to
[00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:04.220]   have a 35-point night.
[00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:08.300]   I have to hit six three-pointers tonight."
[00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:11.360]   That's thinking about the result that you cannot control.
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:15.340]   If you do your preparation, which we know how hard you work off the court in those unseen
[00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:20.340]   hours as our guy Drew Hamlin likes to say, in those unseen hours, then you're prepared
[00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:21.900]   for the game.
[00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:23.220]   So why should there be pressure?
[00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:24.220]   Why should there be stress?
[00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:25.420]   Why should you worry about your point?
[00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:26.860]   You've already put in the work.
[00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:30.580]   You just need to play loose, attack those 48 minutes, give it everything that you've
[00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:32.340]   got one possession at a time.
[00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:34.420]   So don't put any pressure on yourself.
[00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:36.740]   Don't put the pressure on yourself.
[00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:40.580]   Eliminate all distractions so there's peace of mind when you get onto the court.
[00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:42.180]   And we've had conversations, right?
[00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:45.340]   Times where things are challenging, your mind's racing a little bit.
[00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:49.460]   When we can quiet the mind, it allows you to attack at your highest level.
[00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:50.620]   It's crazy how that works.
[00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:56.100]   The freer you are, the higher you can perform if you've put in the work beforehand.
[00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:58.740]   That's the key, though, if you've put in the work.
[00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:03.300]   Because once the game starts, you can look the man across from you, and if you know he
[00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:07.940]   hasn't prepared, you can see it in his eyes, you will have 35 points because I will attack
[00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:10.780]   every possession, you're not going to stop me tonight because I can see in your eyes
[00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:12.420]   you have not worked the way that I work.
[00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:13.420]   No doubt.
[00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:15.220]   And that's a massive advantage that you can have as an athlete.
[00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:20.420]   Man, especially at this level because it's all about, at the NBA level, it's not about
[00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:21.420]   the skill.
[00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:22.420]   Everyone's skilled.
[00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:26.020]   There's more skilled players than others, but it's way more about who has the mental
[00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:27.660]   edge.
[00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:29.900]   And that only comes from the work you put in.
[00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:34.660]   I remember my rookie year, people were like, "Yo, why is he shooting that shot, this, that?"
[00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:40.660]   It's because I knew I shot that shot way more times than anyone else on the court was putting
[00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:41.660]   in the work, you know what I mean?
[00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:46.420]   So you just feel more confident in yourself, and that's the way to do it.
[00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:49.980]   You just came out with a book, bro, Oncoming Leadership.
[00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:52.900]   You talk about the way the best leaders lead.
[00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:56.380]   Talk about that, because you're obviously a leader of leaders, you know what I'm saying?
[00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:59.180]   You talk to a lot of people, help a lot of people.
[00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:00.940]   What are your tips for being a good leader?
[00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:05.840]   Do you think it needs to be vocal, by example, what are your biggest things?
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:09.220]   So I would say there's five common themes.
[00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:13.460]   So I wanted to honor 11 leaders that have impacted my life, because the blessing in
[00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:19.660]   my work is you can say these things, I've helped you, you inspire me, right?
[00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:22.900]   Your work every day, you fighting through challenge and adversity, when I see pain in
[00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:25.860]   your eyes, but you fight through it, that inspires me, right?
[00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:27.300]   So it's an iron sharpens iron.
[00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:32.300]   So I wanted to honor 11 people that have impacted my life, how I show up, and 11 amazing leaders
[00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:33.580]   that I've worked with.
[00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:35.820]   And there's five things that they had in common.
[00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:37.860]   Number one, they do what I call the unrequired.
[00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:40.980]   They're willing to do that little bit extra, like we talk about.
[00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:45.100]   Everybody knows what's required for you to win the day, to be your best, but the individuals
[00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:50.500]   who do that little bit extra, they're the ones, a little bit extra every day, you keep
[00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:53.460]   stacking those days, makes a profound difference.
[00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:54.980]   Number two, they connect to the burn.
[00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:57.480]   They understand what drives them.
[00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:01.540]   So for me, when I wake up, I think about my mother every single day, literally on my phone,
[00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:05.020]   my alarm on my phone, it says my mother's name, Jan Fishman Newman.
[00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:07.020]   I wear a bracelet that says legacy.
[00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:11.180]   I have a little journal, I write Jan Fishman Newman like every morning, right?
[00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:14.420]   And that's what the highest performers do, they connect to that burn.
[00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:18.420]   They also live to the standard, they don't allow their feelings to dictate how they show
[00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:19.420]   up.
[00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:20.420]   Right?
[00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:24.700]   So if I were to text you before a game, oh, you went for 35 last night, go do it again.
[00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:29.940]   We're living in the past of your feelings, as opposed to, same thing, nothing changes,
[00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:33.860]   no undue pressure, eliminate distractions, one possession at a time, just go cut loose
[00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:34.860]   and be you.
[00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:35.860]   Right?
[00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:40.340]   So that's a standard that you've created for you to have the right mindset when you step
[00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:41.340]   on the court.
[00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:47.220]   - Yeah, I wanna pause you right there, 'cause Giannis, I think he is a professional at doing
[00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:48.220]   that.
[00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:49.660]   Nikola Jokic is another one.
[00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:52.980]   It doesn't matter if they play good, bad, whatever, they're not thinking about that
[00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:53.980]   once the game's over.
[00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:54.980]   They're their same self.
[00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:59.740]   If they have 50 points, they're not getting too high, 'cause then it's gonna affect how
[00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:00.740]   they play the next game.
[00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:05.020]   I know a lot of athletes, they'll have a good game, but then they'll be really high for
[00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:08.540]   a second, but then they're kinda scared for the next game, because like, I gotta outdo
[00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:13.060]   what I just did, or match it, and then they end up tripping or not having a good game.
[00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:17.660]   But like you said, when you can move on from that previous performance, or maybe, you know,
[00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:22.180]   be happy, but then once you go home, you sleep, wake up the next day, it's all over again,
[00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:23.180]   you know what I mean?
[00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:24.180]   You gotta do it again.
[00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:31.460]   That, I feel like, is a big key for athletes to be consistent in their performances.
[00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:34.400]   - And that goes to the fourth principle, which is to lock in.
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:36.660]   You gotta lock in consistently, it's not occasionally.
[00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:40.900]   So you now understand, you have to be happy for yourself, right, I mean, you had a great
[00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:45.500]   game, team wins a game, great team effort, great contribution, but the next day you gotta
[00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:46.500]   lock in again.
[00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:50.060]   And that's what the greatest champions do, you just said it, you gotta go back to work
[00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:51.060]   the next day.
[00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:52.060]   - Right.
[00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:53.300]   - And then the last thing, it's a transfer of belief.
[00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:57.540]   They believe in themselves, and they believe in the individuals around them, right?
[00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:02.620]   So there's a great belief you have in yourself, right, 'cause for all of us, I always say,
[00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:06.500]   you know, everything you need is already in you, meaning God gave it to you, but you gotta
[00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:08.060]   choose to go and take it, right?
[00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:11.480]   So that's a belief you have, I'm gonna go take this every day, a lot of people don't
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:12.480]   choose to do that.
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:16.380]   But then you also have an opportunity through your example to lead other people on the team,
[00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:19.940]   to lead other people in your life, your brothers and sisters and your big, beautiful family,
[00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:22.380]   right, to be an example, and go take yours too.
[00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:23.380]   - Yeah.
[00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:26.060]   - 'Cause you would do it for 'em, I know how much you love your family, you would do it
[00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:27.060]   for the whole family.
[00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:28.060]   - Yeah.
[00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:30.220]   - But the reality is, you gotta take care of yours, but be a great example for them
[00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:31.460]   to do it for themselves.
[00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:32.740]   - No doubt.
[00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:37.420]   And obviously, this is the last question, everyone's not a leader, not everyone can
[00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:40.700]   do, put in the work like we do, they just don't have it in 'em.
[00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:44.820]   But if you had, well, I mean, they might, but it's tough, but if you had three things
[00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:48.300]   you could tell the young people, or that you see the younger generation, three habits they
[00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:53.220]   could change to kinda improve themselves, you know, people that just wanna get out of
[00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:57.260]   that rut, you know, that cycle of whatever it is, what would they be?
[00:22:57.260 --> 00:23:01.380]   I know one for me, at least, I started waking up early, you inspire me, a little bit earlier
[00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:03.160]   than I have to.
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:05.740]   - Don't wake up as early as me, though, you need more sleep.
[00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:09.340]   - But just a little bit earlier, you know, 6.30 or 7 a.m., before I have to really do
[00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:14.980]   stuff to get that time to lock in and think, that's a big one for me, what would you say
[00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:15.980]   is three habits?
[00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:20.180]   - Well, I think morning routine would be one, so we'll steal your answer, 'cause that is
[00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:21.180]   definitely one.
[00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:23.420]   Number two, I think, step into the fire.
[00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:27.020]   You know, too many people, they see the fire of life and they run.
[00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:30.700]   You know, so don't do it by yourself, but have great mentors, have great coaches.
[00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:36.940]   My basketball coach, who I mentioned earlier, that man has mentored me now for over 25 years,
[00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:41.060]   he's still one of the biggest blessings in my life, I mean, other books I've written,
[00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:44.620]   he's a character in books that I've written, I mean, this man has helped mold me, but I
[00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:49.660]   need him to get through challenge and adversity, right, so don't go into that fire alone.
[00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:54.420]   And then number three, have great habits, and understand that consistency is not couple
[00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:58.820]   days in a row here, and then I'm gonna stop, and then a couple good days, no, consistency's
[00:23:58.820 --> 00:23:59.820]   every day.
[00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:00.820]   - Every day.
[00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:01.820]   - You mentioned it earlier, it's every day.
[00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:04.820]   - Even on the weekends, or do you get a day off?
[00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:10.300]   - So for me, I have a crazy workout that I do, and today, this morning, was actually
[00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:15.660]   my 823rd straight day doing this workout, it's 45 minutes, it's 10 different exercises,
[00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:21.500]   it's 250 air squats unbroken, planking for almost 10 minutes, all these crazy things,
[00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:25.020]   but I do that 'cause I'm an old man, I gotta keep up with you and try to stay fresh with
[00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:27.940]   you young guys, but for me, it's every day.
[00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:31.740]   I don't necessarily recommend that to anybody, but for me, I will share with you, I feel
[00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:37.500]   great, I'm a 42-year-old man, I haven't had any injuries in 823 straight days, so I'm
[00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:40.980]   not saying that's the answer for everybody, go consult your physician, but I think to
[00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:46.300]   get your body moving, it makes you feel good, it makes you confident, so all the habits,
[00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:50.380]   whether it's your working out, whether it's being present and focused with your family,
[00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:53.820]   whether it's getting your work in, we can all choose to focus on what's gonna make us
[00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:57.140]   win one day at a time, and that's a choice.
[00:24:57.140 --> 00:25:02.800]   You motivate me. I know a lot of people watching this. They got a lot of wisdom today. I appreciate you being on Curious Mike
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:05.580]   Appreciate you. Yes, sir
[00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:21.340]  , I'm gonna swing it back control
[00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:25.340]   Yeah, come on head up
[00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:38.620]   No five three come on give me two more go last one
[00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:39.620]   - All right.
[00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:41.620]   (sighs)
[00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:51.620]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
