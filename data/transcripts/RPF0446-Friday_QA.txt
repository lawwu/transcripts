[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.760]   It's Friday. That means live Q&A. I've got an open phone line with one, two, three, four,
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.840]   five, six, seven callers on the line. So today's going to be busy and fast paced. Let's see
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:27.920]   what happens.
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.480]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.120]   skills, insight and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.760]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. My name is Joshua Sheets and
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.920]   I am your host on Fridays. I do my very best to do a weekly live Q&A. Got a live phone
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.840]   line with callers. It's kind of like radio and just recorded a day in advance before
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:01:00.160]   you hear it. And we've got a diverse array of questions today. I think you'll really
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.040]   like it. These Friday Q&A shows for the last few weeks, they were a really good opportunity.
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.000]   If you wanted to ask me a question, if you wanted to ask me a question directly, you've
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.560]   heard shows in the past where one caller or two callers got the entire hour with me. So
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:23.040]   this was about the cheapest access to me that you were going to get. So however, with that,
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.480]   today we've got a busy full phone lines. In fact, I've got them locked and rejected about
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.960]   four or five of you. If you'd like to get on a call like this, the primary way to do
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:37.320]   that is to join as a patron of the show. These shows have always been open to patrons, radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron.
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.080]   However, the last few times I didn't have a ton of participation from the patrons. So
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.440]   then I extended this invitation to the email list. So if you'd like to be basically guaranteed
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.160]   to be on a show like this in the future, sign up to become a patron and/or consider joining
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.800]   the email list as well, which you can find at radicalpersonalfinance.com. A few of you
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.600]   have said it's not as obvious as you wish it were. Don't worry. We are going to take
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.440]   care of that and make it more obvious in the future. So lots of improvements around here.
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.480]   So if you'd like to join a call like this, again, go to radicalpersonalfinance.com. Let's
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:15.640]   get right to it. I've got one, two, three, four, five, six men and one lady. So in my
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.600]   world, ladies come first. So Ruha in Alabama, go ahead and let us know your question or
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.160]   comment please and let's see how I can serve you today.
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:30.800]   Great. Thanks, Joshua. So we are actually moving into a tiny home. So we're moving
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:38.280]   from Alabama to Louisiana and currently we live in one big home and we also bought some
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.640]   land in Alabama to park the tiny home on before deciding we were going to move down to be
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:52.160]   closer to family. So my question is, what should we do with the house and the land?
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.400]   The house is currently, if we sell it, it'll be worth about $20,000 less than what we paid
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.720]   for it. And that was four years ago when we bought it. And the land, I mean, we can probably
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.160]   get exactly what we bought it for, but I'm worried about closing costs and also I don't
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.400]   know how the tax situation works out.
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.960]   So the land that you own is in Tennessee or Alabama? Which one? I got confused on the
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:17.960]   states.
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.480]   They're both Alabama.
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.440]   Okay. But you're moving from the land and the house to other land?
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.440]   Louisiana.
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.440]   Okay.
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.640]   In Louisiana.
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.280]   Why would you not sell it? What reasons would you have for keeping it?
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:40.640]   Well, the land, I don't really have a reason for keeping it. I do definitely want to sell
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.240]   the land. I guess my question on that is more along the lines of what are the implications?
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:50.480]   Because I wouldn't sell it if it turns out that buying and selling something back to
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.880]   back is detrimental to our taxes for the year.
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.520]   Do you think that you have a profit in the land?
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.520]   In renting the land?
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.920]   No. Meaning that you said it's worth about what you paid for it, right? So you don't
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.840]   have a lot of profit here.
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.360]   Right.
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.640]   And so let's deal with them one at a time with the land. If you say you have no reason
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.360]   for keeping it and you want to sell it, then you should just simply sell it. And as far
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:23.560]   as the financial implications of it, the financial implications is just simply going to be how
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:29.440]   much gain or loss will you have from the sale. And it sounds like you're not going to have
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.400]   any gain. If it's worth about what you're going to sell it for, you're not going to
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.680]   have any gain. And your only potential loss would be any sales costs with the transaction
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.440]   costs of actually selling it, commissions and things like that.
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.480]   If you don't see any reason to own it, if the land is not particularly valuable to you,
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.920]   you don't think that it's going to appreciate measurably in price, then I think the simplest
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.800]   and easiest thing to do is just to go ahead and sell it and be free of the hassle, be
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.360]   free of the constraint, be free of the lack of minimalism dealing with a property that
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.960]   you don't really want to own, and just be free of the headache of it. Even if it loses,
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.400]   even if you lose a little bit of money, a negligible amount of money, I would see value
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:14.520]   in just simply having it gone so that my life is more streamlined and more simple, unless
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.520]   you have a compelling reason to own it.
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.200]   That approach is relatively simple. And because it's basically a wash, you're not going to
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:28.480]   have any gain or loss in the sale, then there are really almost no tax implications. It's
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.800]   just a matter of mentally getting over it. So that one seems simple. Now, the house,
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.880]   why would you choose to keep the house? What would be your argument there?
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:43.480]   Well, there's a lot of developments coming closer and closer to where the house is located.
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:48.840]   And my hope is that in a year or two, it's actually going to be worth at least what we
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:56.320]   paid for, if not a little bit more. So my hope there is, I believe we can rent it for
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:04.800]   definitely the cost of the mortgage and some extra to cover any maintenance repairs and
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.400]   things like that. So I think we can break even on renting it through a property manager
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.880]   so that covers her fees as well.
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:18.800]   And so I just don't have a really strong motivation to sell it because I don't need the capital
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.800]   at all.
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:26.040]   If you sold the property today, what do you think it would sell for?
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:33.560]   About $20,000 less than what we paid for it originally four years ago.
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.120]   And you've been living in the house for the last four years, right?
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.120]   Mm-hmm.
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.720]   Ballpark, what's the value of the property?
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.160]   So if we sold it today, it'd be about $285,000.
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.880]   And how much equity do you have in the property?
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:52.480]   The outstanding mortgage is $225,000.
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:59.440]   Okay. So the way to answer the question, so the scenario that you're describing here is
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:05.080]   I don't want to sell it for less than what I paid for it, which is an appropriate consideration.
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.680]   I don't want to sell it for less than I paid for it because you've put investment capital
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:12.660]   into it and you've lost some of that money.
[00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:19.180]   The way to answer the question is to calculate what your potential return is from this investment
[00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:23.300]   and compare it to your potential return from another investment.
[00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:28.180]   And so if you sold it today, you think it would sell for about $285,000.
[00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:31.660]   That means you paid $305,000 for it.
[00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:32.660]   Is that accurate?
[00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:33.660]   Yeah.
[00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:34.660]   Okay.
[00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:40.140]   And for the sake of simple radio math, I'm going to use just simply, I'm going to ignore
[00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:44.820]   the sales costs right now, but you need to redo this analysis later with what you think
[00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:48.380]   would be the actual transaction costs of the deal.
[00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:56.140]   But if you sold it today for $285,000 and you paid off the mortgage of $225,000, that
[00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:59.020]   means that you would clear $60,000 of equity.
[00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:03.660]   Again, you need to factor in transaction costs, but for radio math, I'm going to just use
[00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:05.420]   $60,000 of equity.
[00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:12.460]   The question is this, the $60,000 of equity that you have in this property, if your estimate
[00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:16.900]   is accurate, if you think that in the next year, because of the local development costs
[00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:22.860]   and because of the local changes in the market, if you think that property would increase
[00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:32.660]   in value by $20,000 such that your $60,000 of capital would increase to $80,000 of capital,
[00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:36.820]   if you think that's a good investment, then you should consider keeping it.
[00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:41.540]   If you think you can do better elsewhere, if you think you can redeploy that $60,000
[00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:46.540]   of capital into something else that's going to do better, then you should consider selling
[00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:47.900]   it.
[00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:53.260]   Because it's immaterial what you paid for the property versus what it's worth now.
[00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.020]   That's a sunk cost and you can't do anything about it.
[00:08:56.020 --> 00:09:00.020]   So you've got to clear that from your mind and you've got to think, "Would I rather have
[00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:06.980]   $60,000 invested in this property in Alabama, in this particular house, or would I rather
[00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:12.700]   have the $60,000 invested into something else or under some other conditions?"
[00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:14.860]   That's the question that you have to ask yourself.
[00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:19.620]   And then as you look at that, you need to also consider what the rental cost would be.
[00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:24.100]   So if you are just simply renting it out for enough to cover the mortgage and you're not
[00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:28.980]   going to be gaining any profit, then you're not getting any return on that $60,000.
[00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:31.340]   You're just covering your financing costs.
[00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:35.220]   But the way to do it is just simply to look exclusively at the equity that you have in
[00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:36.820]   the property.
[00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:41.540]   Consider what you think will happen with that house and then compare it to anything else
[00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.220]   that you would do with the money.
[00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:46.460]   And then out of that analysis, you should be able to make a decision properly.
[00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:48.220]   Is that helpful?
[00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:49.940]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:50.940]   Cool.
[00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:51.940]   Thanks.
[00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:53.500]   Thank you for calling in.
[00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:57.100]   Next we are going to go to Guy in Pennsylvania.
[00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:59.860]   Guy, it's a little bit noisy, so try to be quiet here.
[00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:01.140]   And go ahead and introduce yourself.
[00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:02.140]   Ask your question.
[00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:03.140]   Let's see how I can serve you today, please.
[00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:04.140]   Good morning, Joshua.
[00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:05.140]   I appreciate you taking my call.
[00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:12.580]   I've been a listener since you interviewed on the Money Plan SOS podcast a few years
[00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:13.580]   ago.
[00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:16.500]   So I've enjoyed you ever since.
[00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:22.620]   My question today is in regards to switching to a local advisor.
[00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:28.620]   This question comes up for me because my younger brother is working with a local advisor
[00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:36.420]   who frequently contacts him and keeps him updated, asks him questions just to make sure
[00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:39.540]   that everything is going well.
[00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:41.620]   So it's clear that he's monitoring the account.
[00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:48.860]   The guy that I set mine up with when I was 27 years old right around in 2012 was a Dave
[00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:49.860]   Ramsey ELP.
[00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:51.620]   A wonderful guy.
[00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:57.860]   He came, we sat down, spent a lot of time together, and he set me up a couple of different
[00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:03.020]   accounts through Fidelity with the same, in the Dave Ramsey structure.
[00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:07.060]   So I've got five different A-share funds.
[00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:13.340]   One set of five is in a Roth IRA that is set up for long-term investing and one that's
[00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:19.220]   in an individual that is set up for short-term that I essentially use for a long-term car
[00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:24.740]   fund but I'm pulling out of it frequently when we need new vehicles.
[00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:28.940]   And then he also set me up with a C-share that I used to save up for a down payment
[00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:35.460]   on my house over a four-year span which worked out, everything has worked out really well.
[00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:41.860]   The challenge that I have is from my understanding, if I try to contact him, it takes a while,
[00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:46.540]   a long while to get any word back from him.
[00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:54.060]   So I know he's very busy driving all over the region.
[00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:58.460]   So I don't think that he's monitoring my account at all.
[00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:05.580]   To me, I feel as if he, because of being so busy, he became one of those guys that sets
[00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:11.500]   you up and then moves on and collects the commission which I find to, which I think
[00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:13.620]   is at the industry maximum.
[00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:19.300]   I think it's 5.75% for those A-shares.
[00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:23.860]   So my question to you is, and it's set up, it's an individual Fidelity account so I can
[00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:25.540]   pull it out anytime I want.
[00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:27.280]   I have complete control.
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:33.100]   It's not something that I have to contact him with to get the money from it or to make
[00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:34.980]   changes.
[00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:40.500]   So I don't need him other than unless I want to make structured changes.
[00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:46.380]   So my question to you is, how do I know if I should switch?
[00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:51.000]   Is there value in having a guy like my brother has that will contact him that I can go sit
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:58.180]   down with at his office to switch to something where I know that it's being monitored and
[00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:06.540]   I'm going to get updates on even law changes and just suggestions based on stage of life
[00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:14.820]   or can I just trust what I have and just keep putting in the money and I watch it in personal
[00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:18.740]   capital and I know what's there and what's happening for the most part.
[00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:20.460]   So I got your question.
[00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:24.740]   How much money do you have invested with this particular advisor?
[00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:28.540]   It would be right around $34,000.
[00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:33.900]   $26,000 of that is in the Roth and $8,000 is in what I call the car fund, the individual
[00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:34.900]   investments.
[00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:42.820]   Okay, so this is the most important consideration here in terms of how much money you have because
[00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:48.180]   this is what's going to drive how much service you get with a financial advisor.
[00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:52.020]   And you need to think like a business person and think about the business of giving financial
[00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:53.020]   advice.
[00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:56.460]   If you think about the business of giving financial advice, you have to recognize that
[00:13:56.460 --> 00:14:04.240]   your financial advisor is being paid based upon the revenue to their practice.
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:10.100]   And for the sake of simplicity, let's start with pretending that this is a fee-based account
[00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:15.980]   where the financial advisor is earning a flat fee and let's use a flat fee of about 1% which
[00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:18.140]   would be the industry standard.
[00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:24.500]   If you have a $34,000 account, then that means that on a flat fee basis of 1%, your financial
[00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:28.140]   advisor is earning $340 per year.
[00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:33.900]   Now on a $34,000 account, your fee would actually be far higher than 1% because there's no
[00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:38.700]   way for the advisor to cover the cost, to cover the cost of technology, the platforms,
[00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:41.180]   et cetera, and to do it in any measure profitably.
[00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:46.460]   Your fee with a standard personal financial advisor who works with individuals would be
[00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:50.860]   probably closer to 2% on this amount of money, 1.5%, 1.75%.
[00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:55.820]   So total revenue to that advisor's practice would be about $340 per year.
[00:14:55.820 --> 00:15:03.780]   Now in your case, because you don't have this set up in the context of a fee-based account
[00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:10.180]   but rather your account is based on commissions, the advisor received a large upfront commission
[00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:11.580]   from the sale of these mutual funds.
[00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:15.380]   As you said, let's say it was 5.75%.
[00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:21.620]   So on $34,000, pretend you invested that much money, then that would be about $1,900 of
[00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:25.860]   commissions and then they're receiving a small trail commission, what are called in the business
[00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:31.100]   of trail commissions, which is a very small amount of money on an ongoing basis.
[00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:34.420]   So they've received most of their compensation upfront.
[00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:40.220]   So here's the incentive that the advisor has and here's how I would approach the problem
[00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:41.740]   if I were you.
[00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:45.820]   Because the advisor earned an upfront commission, let's assume the best.
[00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:46.940]   It's probably a good guy.
[00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:48.940]   You said you've got good feelings from him.
[00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:49.940]   He worked hard.
[00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:51.260]   He helped you, et cetera.
[00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.700]   Because he earned an upfront commission, he knows that he earned that money upfront for
[00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:56.180]   not very much work.
[00:15:56.180 --> 00:16:00.980]   And so when you call, he's going to want to do a good job for you to help service your
[00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:03.260]   clients, to help you with the questions that you have.
[00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.340]   He's going to want to do the best for you.
[00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:10.340]   But when he's earning a small trail commission of – I can't – I mean, what, 25 basis
[00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:14.540]   points, something like that, he's only earning revenue to his practice from your accounts
[00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:17.640]   under $100 a year.
[00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:22.420]   So in terms of his actual incentive to meet with you, if he's got incentive to meet with
[00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:28.180]   you of under $100 a year versus other prospective clients that are million-dollar accounts where
[00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:34.420]   he has the potential revenue of say $10,000 a year of revenue or potentially much larger
[00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:39.060]   commissions if he's working on a commission basis, he doesn't have a lot of incentive
[00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:40.460]   to meet with you.
[00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:42.580]   So the problem is this.
[00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:47.200]   He knows that he wants to help you and he knows that he wants to do a good job for you
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:49.160]   because you're a client.
[00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:52.220]   But he also knows that you're not an A client.
[00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:56.060]   And so if I were coaching a financial advisor like him, the first thing that we would do
[00:16:56.060 --> 00:17:01.820]   is we would do client segmentation and you'd segment your clients into A clients, B clients,
[00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:02.980]   and C clients.
[00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:07.560]   And each advisor will have their own criteria for how they would segment their clients.
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:14.180]   But the criteria would involve, number one, financial considerations, how large is the
[00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:21.460]   account or how much financial potential does the advisor have, and it would also involve
[00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:23.820]   the strength of the relationship.
[00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:25.860]   I worked with clients when I was an advisor.
[00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:30.260]   I worked with clients that probably I shouldn't have spent as much time with, but I liked
[00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.820]   them and I like spending time with them.
[00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:36.460]   And most advisors, one of the biggest things, once you have your feet under you and you're
[00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:41.020]   confident in what you're doing, one of the great things you try to do every year is fire
[00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:46.300]   a client that you don't like because working with people who drain your energy is really,
[00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:47.300]   really exhausting.
[00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:51.100]   And so one of the good pieces of consulting and coaching advice for financial advisors
[00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:53.460]   is go through your practice at least once a year.
[00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:57.740]   And I always love Nick Murray always recommended doing it on your birthday as a birthday present
[00:17:57.740 --> 00:17:58.740]   to yourself.
[00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:01.860]   You go through your practice and you fire your most obstreperous client.
[00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:06.620]   And whoever you don't like, whoever's the biggest problem, you go ahead and send them
[00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:07.620]   away.
[00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:11.980]   So what advisors do is they segment their clients into A clients, B clients, and C clients,
[00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:16.420]   done based upon strength of relationship, current financial position, and financial
[00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:17.900]   capacity.
[00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:22.420]   Many advisors, if you are, let's say that you earn a little bit of money, but they can
[00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:26.420]   tell that you're working in a business that's going to result in a lot of income in the
[00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:31.300]   future, then they'll say, "Well, this client, they're a B plus because they don't have a
[00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:32.300]   lot of money now.
[00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:35.520]   They're not earning a lot, but they have a lot of financial capacity."
[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:42.020]   So the problem with you is, and let's ignore the prospect of financial capacity, the problem
[00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:47.580]   that you face with this advisor is the fact that with a $34,000 of account, you're not
[00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:49.220]   an A client.
[00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:53.280]   And unless you're going to become an A client, this is probably going to continue.
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:54.280]   So what do you do?
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:58.020]   Well, if you like this guy and if he helps you with some of the information that you
[00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:02.020]   need, then you can continue to work with him, but you're going to have to be the one who
[00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:04.960]   bugs him, who reaches out to you.
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:10.880]   Because when an advisor segments their client base into A, B, and C, an experienced advisor
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:14.200]   also goes ahead and puts in place a contact plan.
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:18.860]   And so you reach out and you contact your best clients a certain number of times per
[00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:24.260]   year based upon whether they're in your A tranche, your B tranche, or your C tranche.
[00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:28.140]   And so your C clients will receive, let's say, your monthly newsletter.
[00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:32.380]   You sign up your C clients for your monthly newsletter, and then you have your staff go
[00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:37.100]   ahead and once a year reach out to you and see how everything's going.
[00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:42.340]   Your B clients get a monthly newsletter and they get a call from you once a year or twice
[00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:43.340]   a year.
[00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:47.660]   And your A clients get a call from you every quarter or more, and you send them and you
[00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:50.720]   set up a spreadsheet in your office and you say, "Okay, they're getting to..." and you
[00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:54.760]   plan out the number of client contacts that they're going to get per year.
[00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:58.280]   So the A clients get invited to a client appreciation event.
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:19:59.700]   They get birthday phone calls.
[00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:00.800]   They get personal notes.
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:02.280]   They get personal emails.
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:06.200]   They get personal things, and it's based upon their financial capacity.
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:08.460]   So that's what the advisor is doing.
[00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:09.680]   That's what they're thinking.
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:12.440]   Now when they're very busy, it's not that he means bad.
[00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:17.080]   He wants to do the best for you, but there's no way for it to work financially to be a
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:19.080]   really good thing.
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:21.440]   So here's what I would do if I were you.
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:26.020]   In order for you to get more advice, you're going to have to pay more money.
[00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:30.340]   So if you're not getting advice from this guy, then you should look at your account
[00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:34.600]   and you should look around and see is there a place that you can get a better deal.
[00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:40.600]   Thankfully in today's world, there are tons of really great independent investing options.
[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:44.360]   And you can look at your accounts and you can say, "What are my fees?
[00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:45.560]   What are my costs?"
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:49.580]   And you can go and you can look at other places and try to figure out, "Can I get a better
[00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:51.120]   deal somewhere else?"
[00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:53.160]   If you're not getting the...
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:57.680]   What I would do is I would try, if you like this guy, I would try to ask him your questions,
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:00.360]   reach out to him, schedule a phone call.
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:03.560]   The best way to do that is probably to reach out to his staff and schedule a time with
[00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:08.760]   his staff to schedule an appointment with him because he's going to have...
[00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:14.040]   He knows he owes you a loyalty because you're a client of his and he feels bad.
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:18.040]   He feels bad that he hasn't served you as much as he would like to, but you're in his
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:19.320]   C client base.
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.320]   So you've got...
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:24.800]   If you're the squeaky wheel, you can get time with him and that's how I would approach it.
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:28.360]   If you need more financial advice, you're going to have to find some way to pay for
[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:29.360]   it.
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:35.000]   With $34,000 of assets, the only way that you're going to get more focused, clear, comprehensive
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.940]   financial advice is to pay for it on an hourly basis with somebody who works with somebody
[00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:45.460]   on an hourly or package deal because you don't have enough money pulled together yet to where
[00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:50.440]   you're really going to be able to get the services of a good financial advisor.
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:52.440]   Does that make sense?
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:54.180]   Yeah, it does.
[00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:56.840]   That brings it into perspective, absolutely.
[00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:57.840]   Thank you very much.
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:58.840]   You're welcome.
[00:21:58.840 --> 00:21:59.840]   I'm going to give you the answer.
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:04.920]   It's really hard because that's the type of thing that the financial advisors face commonly
[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:13.800]   is just this desire to do the best for everybody, but also this constraint with the numbers.
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:14.800]   Advisors go...
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:18.000]   Businesses go through this life cycle where in the beginning, they'll work with kind of
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:27.560]   almost anybody, but then they create this massive client base of clients that really
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:30.400]   they probably shouldn't be spending a lot of time with.
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:34.240]   One more idea that I forgot, Guy, that you can do is reach out to this advisor and see
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:40.200]   if he'll refer you or refer your account to a younger, more junior advisor, somebody who
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:47.400]   can work with you on your account who may not be as big or as busy as this other person.
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:51.680]   A lot of times, if you don't have a lot of money pulled together, you may be able to
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:58.000]   find a young and less experienced star who will give you time, give you effort, give
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.600]   you focus and energy while they're still building and developing things.
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:08.000]   So go ahead and see if you can find, maybe get a referral to somebody within their practice
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.160]   or reach out to one of their junior associates for help.
[00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:11.160]   I hope that helps.
[00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:12.160]   All right.
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:13.160]   Chuck in Atlanta.
[00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:14.520]   Let's go ahead and hear your question.
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:16.920]   Let's see how I can serve you today, please.
[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:17.920]   Hello, Joshua.
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:21.440]   Good morning and thanks for taking my call.
[00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:28.520]   Usually I have where people come to me for financial help and I like helping like non-custodial
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:30.880]   parents and that kind of thing.
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:36.600]   And lately I've been coming across a lot of non-custodial parents who they have one bad
[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:42.320]   relationship, have a child and that breaks up and then they have the follow-up, another
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:47.600]   relationship that breaks up and then they got two custody or two child support payments.
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:51.880]   Now usually in most states, well every state is different because it's state by state.
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:54.760]   It's about a third of your income for each bad relationship.
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:59.440]   So they have a third of their income towards the first child and then a third of the income
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:02.920]   might be towards the second child and then another third of their income goes towards
[00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:03.920]   taxes.
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:10.960]   So basically no matter how hard they work, it seems to go in a negative manner because
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:14.040]   child support is usually based upon a percentage of the income.
[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:15.040]   Right?
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:16.040]   So they get a raise.
[00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:17.040]   It doesn't matter.
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.120]   They get a raise and so forth.
[00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:22.600]   And I've been giving them some advice what I could think of but I just wanted to bounce
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:27.000]   those ideas off of you as well as if you can come up with anything else like to tell them
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.240]   because the divorce rate is high, whatever it is.
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:36.200]   I don't know what the actual statistic is but it does seem to affect a lot of people.
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:41.920]   And it's a negative cycle and I want to see if I can help some of these guys change their
[00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:46.040]   finances and change their financial momentum so they could be actually a better parent
[00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:48.360]   to their kids.
[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:52.840]   So if you're working overtime and crazy time and all that kind of stuff, then you have
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:54.040]   no time to spend with the kids.
[00:24:54.040 --> 00:25:01.040]   And a lot of times I've come across guys that are living in containers, living in people's
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:08.320]   basements and my main advice that I can give them is it's a financial game.
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:11.000]   They can only take child support on money you earn.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:18.760]   So I say, "Okay, well, where can you go and use your social capital and say, 'Hey,
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:21.840]   friends and family, where you can ask for help?'"
[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:29.160]   And some of them have been able to be living with relatives for free and some of them have
[00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:31.440]   houses and a lot of them don't.
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:35.440]   But the ones that have houses, I tell them, "Hey, maybe you could take on roommates and
[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:40.320]   then defer the cost of the mortgage payments or something like that."
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:43.480]   And a lot of it depends upon what kind of situation they're coming in.
[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:48.080]   Some are in their court case and some are after the court case, which after the court
[00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:51.760]   case, of course, is harder because prevention is...
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:55.360]   An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:26:01.880]   And the court sometimes take in the factors such as the distance between the non-custodian
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:08.680]   custodial parent and that into the child support and so forth and the cost of that.
[00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:14.600]   The only other advice I've been giving them is maybe start a business on the side and
[00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:19.860]   live in the business, place of business for a little while until you can figure out something.
[00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:30.160]   And then if they get a second job, that's even harder, reduces their time with their
[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:33.160]   children, which is kind of counterproductive.
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:38.200]   With 90% of the people in jail have no father involvement, that's kind of a bad thing.
[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:43.840]   And they got the big sticker over them of if they don't pay child support, they get
[00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:44.840]   jail time.
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:45.840]   If they could lose their...
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:52.640]   I had a truck driver that was in danger of losing his license, which is his livelihood.
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:56.320]   And people with passports, all that kind of crazy stuff.
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:58.440]   So that's kind of...
[00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:01.160]   What would you tell them to kind of...
[00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:05.160]   That would help to get them on a more positive thing?
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:11.320]   Because running on zero, the math, one third, one third, one third, you're left with zero.
[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:15.160]   So I don't know what else to tell them.
[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:17.400]   That's tough.
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:21.600]   My question, I'm glad you kind of shared what you tell them because that was going to be
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:22.600]   my next question.
[00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:23.600]   I've never really...
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:28.740]   I don't think I've ever given financial advice personally to someone in that situation.
[00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:30.840]   So it's a new kind of problem to me.
[00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:34.920]   And I recognize that it exists.
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:39.800]   It's funny, last night I was looking at a book by a lady named Helen Smith called Men
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:43.740]   on Strike, Why Men are Boycotting Marriage, Fatherhood and the American Dream and Why
[00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:45.040]   It Matters.
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:51.120]   And one of her major propositions that she puts forth is that in her opinion, men are
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:53.820]   mistreated in divorce courts.
[00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:57.740]   And the standards that are held on men are much higher than on women.
[00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:00.800]   And it leads to ruination for many of the men.
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:04.040]   And that's one of her arguments is that many men see this.
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:08.800]   And so they're avoiding marriage because of seeing how, in her opinion, they're unfairly
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:09.800]   treated by the courts.
[00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:13.560]   So I was just thinking about this just last night and wondering if that were true, wondering
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:19.720]   how I could learn whether I felt it were true or weren't true.
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:22.680]   Now this question comes this morning.
[00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:27.600]   I guess my first concern is not for the...
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:29.320]   Obviously the man is sitting there in front of you.
[00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:35.440]   My first concern is not for the financial well-being of the man.
[00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:44.360]   My first concern is for the financial well-being of his child or children and of his wife.
[00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:49.320]   All of this could have been avoided if he'd been able to stay there and to support his
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:53.580]   children in the relationship in which they were birthed.
[00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:57.180]   So I tend to be one of those who starts there.
[00:28:57.180 --> 00:29:01.000]   But I also do acknowledge that the situation is very, very difficult.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.240]   And if you're sitting there with a guy and he's saying, "Listen, I am doing this.
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:07.120]   I'm doing very well.
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:08.720]   My children are supported.
[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:16.280]   And what I'm trying to do here is I'm trying to figure out how to get free and how to be
[00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:19.560]   a better father because I'm not spending all my time working and all the money's not sucked
[00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:23.560]   up, then I am doing my best."
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:29.960]   So I guess the only advice that I could think of in that situation would be to study the
[00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:37.500]   rules of the game and figure out how it's played and then find the break in the rules.
[00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:39.440]   And I think it relates to income.
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:44.980]   First, it would be a very high-earning man who one-third of his income goes to taxes.
[00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:50.000]   That would be a very high-income earning person.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.200]   A truck driver, as you said, somebody who's earning, let's just say, $60,000, $70,000,
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:30:00.240]   $80,000 a year, a third of the income is not necessarily going to go to taxes.
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:04.200]   So we got to look at what exactly are we talking about.
[00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:07.360]   If the child support payments – so a couple of things.
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:15.480]   As you well know, if you were retained to give financial advice to the husband in a
[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:19.440]   divorce proceeding, one of the major things you want to do is you want to get as much
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:26.880]   of the money that – as much of the settlement that's split between alimony and child support,
[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:32.140]   you want to get as much of the money counted as alimony versus as child support in order
[00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:35.020]   to lower the overall taxable burden.
[00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:42.080]   If a man is going through divorce proceedings and if the judge rules that he owes $1,000
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:48.960]   a month of alimony and $1,000 a month of child support, the $1,000 a month of alimony, the
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:54.920]   tax burden of that will be removed from his return and it will be added to his wife's
[00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:55.920]   return.
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:57.600]   So that can help with the tax planning as well.
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:03.000]   Now I think most divorce attorneys, if the man has good counsel, most divorce attorneys
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.040]   are aware of that and will do that.
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:08.760]   It's not a matter – there's going to be – when the judge is working through the
[00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:14.440]   case, they're going to decide how much goes to alimony and child support based upon the
[00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:15.660]   proper split.
[00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:20.080]   But that is important and that can be a very significant financial planning consideration
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:26.280]   because if we can lower the taxable income by having more of the money shifted to alimony
[00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:31.680]   payments versus shifted to child support payments, then that will be helpful for the man that
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:34.800]   we're giving financial advice to.
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:39.120]   So that's – but by the time you come into the situation, that's a little bit too late.
[00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:43.960]   Next, I think it's important to look at the term of the payments.
[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:50.080]   So given the fact that we're talking about child support, child support is not judged
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:51.280]   as a lifelong commitment.
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:54.260]   It's generally until the child reaches the age of majority.
[00:31:54.260 --> 00:32:00.260]   So there's a difference if a man has a 15-year-old son or daughter versus if a man has a 2-year-old
[00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:01.260]   son or daughter.
[00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:03.440]   That will make a difference in the financial advice.
[00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:09.680]   So I think it's important to consider where the person is in their financial journey.
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:13.000]   Then if the game is played on income, I think you go to income.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   I think that instead of – if the man is going to be assessed higher child support
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:27.640]   payments by – based upon earning a higher income and I want to be very clear.
[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:30.560]   First I want to make sure that he's meeting his child support obligations and I think
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:32.360]   we – I would assume we would be agreed on that.
[00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:36.760]   I don't want a man playing games and his child going uncared for because that would
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:40.560]   be immoral for him to not take care of his own children.
[00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:45.800]   So as long as his children are being cared for adequately and their needs are being covered
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:49.920]   and we're just doing – we're just trying to figure out how can we fix the situation
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:50.920]   a little bit.
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:56.640]   I think you lower your income partly through to reducing needs, doing things like you said
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:33:02.000]   of reducing living expenses, taking advantage of some of the social capital that you have
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.600]   to be able to lower housing costs, to be able to lower transportation costs.
[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:10.360]   I think you approach your business and your career differently.
[00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:15.000]   Instead of pursuing earned income, you pursue equity.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:20.280]   So if I'm advising a man who is – for the sake of scenario analysis here, he's
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:26.600]   got 13-year-old children and he's got high child support payments which would adjust
[00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:34.040]   based upon him earning a higher income and he knows that and he is adequately caring
[00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:37.360]   for his children, their needs are met, they're not suffering.
[00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:39.600]   Then in that situation, I'm going to tell him, "Build something.
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:40.600]   Start a business.
[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:42.960]   Build something that's going to result in higher equity.
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:44.880]   Don't just pursue immediate income.
[00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:48.320]   If you need to make a career transition, transition into something that's going to
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:52.840]   be lower earning for the next few years and then when your child support obligations are
[00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:58.360]   going to be paid, then you'll be in a situation where your income is increasing because of
[00:33:58.360 --> 00:33:59.820]   the equity that you built."
[00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:02.920]   That can be done in building of a private business.
[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:08.160]   For example, maybe the trucker should pursue working as an owner-operator instead of working
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:09.980]   as an employee.
[00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:14.180]   It can also be done in some jobs that are commission-based and that are slow to get
[00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:18.720]   started such as real estate or something like I did, life insurance sales and financial
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:19.720]   advice.
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:25.120]   The first five years of a financial advisor's career are very expensive, very low-earning
[00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:26.120]   years.
[00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:29.220]   But the balance of the career would be much higher-earning years and there's really
[00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:32.680]   not much of a way around those first five years.
[00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:37.240]   So if I'm making a career decision and I know that if I take this job that's high-paying
[00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:41.920]   over here, I'm just going to lose all that money to higher taxation and child support
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:48.060]   payments or if I've got the other job opportunity where I'm going to build equity and deferred
[00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:53.040]   comp, then I'm going to move in the position of equity and deferred comp.
[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:54.920]   But Chuck, you've already said that.
[00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:58.640]   That was just me elaborating and explaining what you already said.
[00:34:58.640 --> 00:34:59.640]   I'll think about it.
[00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:03.920]   I've never really faced that situation in consultation so I've not thought a lot about
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:07.320]   it but I will invite any listeners who have additional ideas.
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:09.680]   This would be a great place for listeners to chime in.
[00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:16.200]   Come on by today's show and give us your suggestions of anything that Chuck and I are missing.
[00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:17.200]   Go ahead, Chuck.
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:23.280]   Well, I just really appreciate it and I really think you hit the nail on the head when I
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:26.160]   said start a business on the side.
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:32.880]   Maybe they could use the benefit of like one guy slept in his business and he wasn't realizing
[00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:38.560]   too much income from it but he had a normal job so his business was on the side and then
[00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:44.720]   he was able to defer it and then I think his kids are a majority age so then he's starting
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:50.040]   to reap the profit from it and then be able to do a career transition.
[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:55.280]   So it's a delayed gratification and long-term planning which is what I try to talk to people
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:59.720]   about rather than the short jab that gets you in trouble.
[00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:00.720]   Yeah.
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:01.720]   Well, keep it up.
[00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:06.560]   I mean the biggest challenge is that the men and women with the highest divorce rates are
[00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:11.520]   usually in the lower class and they're often the ones who struggle the most with financial
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:16.000]   planning, the ones who struggle with business and that's kind of really sad.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.840]   I don't know how relevant some of this is going to be but I applaud you for seeking
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:27.960]   to help these men and I would encourage – as again, I'm sure you'll agree.
[00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:32.600]   The primary interest here that we need to look – be careful for is to protect – we
[00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:37.120]   need to protect the innocent party and we need to protect the person who's most helpless
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:40.240]   and most defenseless which is the child.
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:44.920]   So I do appreciate your counsel to the man to say giving more money to your son or daughter
[00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:48.680]   is probably not going to materially change their life.
[00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:53.160]   But giving them the love and the care and the focus and the attention and the time and
[00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:59.040]   really seeking to care for them even though it's difficult when you're far away, that
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:00.520]   will make a big, big difference.
[00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:02.880]   A lot of times I agree with you.
[00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:07.400]   If I've got a 13-year-old, I'm not going to say how much more money can I – how much
[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:09.120]   more time can I put into business.
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:10.880]   I might just simply say, "You know what?
[00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:13.460]   For the next few years, things are going to be tight.
[00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:18.360]   But I'm really going to do everything I can to build into the life of my son or daughter
[00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:24.520]   during this very important transition period of childhood to adulthood and I'll pick
[00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:27.640]   up my own personal financial well-being in a few years."
[00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:30.160]   I think that's important to recognize.
[00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:31.160]   All right.
[00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:34.320]   Let's go on to Matt in North Carolina.
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:38.960]   Matt, go ahead and let us know your question or comment and let's see how I can serve
[00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:39.960]   you today, please.
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:41.320]   Matt Thurston, Chief Financial Officer, Alphabet and Google
[00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:42.320]   Hey, Joshua.
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:47.740]   Thank you very much for the chance to be speaking to you again.
[00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:52.260]   A lot of times when I'll listen to you talk to callers, you'll just have some very kind
[00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:56.100]   of quick and good consulting ideas from a business standpoint.
[00:37:56.100 --> 00:38:00.660]   One of the things that I've been working on is organizing a branch after FinCon.
[00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:05.620]   I'm looking forward to going to that for the first time in 2017, just for some of the folks
[00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:10.940]   who've been helpful to me in my own, I guess, personal finance blogging journey.
[00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:14.780]   Certainly, as you know, you're among that crowd.
[00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:19.100]   I wanted to ask, essentially, kind of besides the meal, which will be delicious, do you
[00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:22.660]   have any special ideas to make this more interesting and valuable to the folks that I hope will
[00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:23.660]   join me?
[00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:28.100]   For example, in the case of each of the invites that I've made, I've offered folks the chance
[00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:31.220]   to bring guests or things like that, but I'm wondering if you have ideas about ways to
[00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:32.700]   go beyond that.
[00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:38.820]   And then secondly, one of the things that I'm hoping to do with this is maybe use it
[00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:44.260]   as a chance to gain some additional visibility for my blogging work.
[00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:50.220]   And in addition to what I hope will be some of my, I guess, guests who can join me, will
[00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:54.420]   be to do some giveaways of spots at that event through my website.
[00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:59.660]   So I didn't know if you had any thoughts on adding value there as well as combining kind
[00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:05.660]   of the marketing element with that thank you brunch, which is sincere.
[00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:07.660]   Right, right.
[00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:08.660]   Interesting.
[00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:25.060]   I'm kind of feeling flat-footed at the moment.
[00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:28.420]   So I'll just tell you, yeah, yeah, it's an interesting question and I want to give you
[00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:33.580]   something helpful and I appreciate your heart and even your service.
[00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:40.620]   I think that probably just from my perspective, having – I'm kind of in this in-between
[00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:50.180]   world where I'm not unknown, but I'm also not a major celebrity.
[00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:53.020]   I guess my thought is this.
[00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:57.820]   So conferences for somebody like me, and I would use that as an example because obviously
[00:39:57.820 --> 00:40:04.180]   that's the question you're asking, or other people who are in the middle tiers of a profession.
[00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:09.460]   Something like a conference can be a very exhausting experience.
[00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:16.860]   It's really, really tiring because the primary reason that I go to a conference is – or
[00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:17.860]   let me rephrase.
[00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:23.060]   The primary reason why I go to a financial conference, something like a FinCon, is to
[00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:30.660]   be available to my audience, to be accessible to my audience because the most important
[00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:34.460]   people to me are my listeners, the people who tune in.
[00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:39.700]   And I want to make sure that I do everything I can to be as available as possible.
[00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:44.540]   And it's really hard to do that on a private basis, although I try really hard.
[00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:48.180]   Even last week I had dinner with a couple of listeners who came to town.
[00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:52.300]   But at some point in time, I always have to put borders around my schedule and make sure
[00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:54.500]   that my family comes first.
[00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:58.700]   And I just have to turn off the email, and I feel bad that I can't respond to everybody,
[00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:00.060]   and I feel bad that I can't do it.
[00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:02.260]   But it's just the way it goes.
[00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:11.420]   So conferences can be very tiring and very kind of emotionally draining because it's
[00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:12.420]   constant.
[00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:16.500]   It's from breakfast through the whole day and through the evening.
[00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:20.700]   And it's also challenging because somebody who's at a conference often has a lot of
[00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:24.180]   commitments and engagements.
[00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:33.340]   If someone has a – they're speaking, they're having a meetup with their audience, their
[00:41:33.340 --> 00:41:34.340]   listeners, I try to do that.
[00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:38.420]   I try to be very accessible to my audience, have meetups or breakfasts or things like
[00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:39.420]   that.
[00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:40.420]   And so it's just challenging.
[00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:42.660]   The scheduling is really hard.
[00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:47.700]   And if you're doing podcast interviews or TV or YouTube interviews or whatever, the
[00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:49.220]   scheduling is really hard.
[00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:54.700]   So I think anything you can do to provide a little bit of a respite from that that also
[00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:57.100]   brings value is really cool.
[00:41:57.100 --> 00:42:02.340]   And probably the biggest thing that I would say, the biggest thing that would be exciting
[00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:14.700]   to me is something unique that's small, that's intimate, but that's a unique activity.
[00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:16.980]   And when you go to these meetings, it's just as simple.
[00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:23.060]   When you go to a FinCon as someone like me, a podcast host, from morning till night, it
[00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:26.420]   is – from morning till night, it's events.
[00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:27.900]   It's a breakfast thing.
[00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:29.300]   It's a lunch thing.
[00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:33.460]   PT, the founder of FinCon, does a great job of providing lots of food.
[00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:34.960]   He does a great job with that.
[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:37.400]   So there's plenty of food available.
[00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:43.840]   In the evening, all of the companies and the vendors make offers to go to various parties
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:45.900]   and cocktail parties.
[00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:47.400]   There's plenty of free alcohol.
[00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:49.060]   There's plenty of all of that.
[00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:54.340]   What I look for is – and what I notice that nobody really does very well – is something
[00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:56.180]   unique.
[00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:58.620]   So get out of the cocktail circuit.
[00:42:58.620 --> 00:43:03.140]   I'm not a big drinker and I don't drink it when I'm in public and in situations like
[00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:04.140]   that.
[00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:05.940]   And it's just very exhausting.
[00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:11.780]   But if you told me, "Hey, let's go skeet shooting," or "Let's go and do this ATV
[00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:18.880]   ride," or something unique like that, to me, that would be something that would quickly
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:20.680]   go to the top of my list.
[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:25.440]   So obviously, you have to balance this financially with the invitation that you make.
[00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:32.680]   But if you told me and said, "Hey, Joshua, listen, there's a skeet club," or – where
[00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:33.680]   is FinCon this year?
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:34.680]   Is it in – it's Texas, right?
[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:35.680]   Dallas.
[00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:36.680]   Dallas.
[00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:44.360]   So you find some local gun dealer who has a class three license and says, "Hey, man,
[00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:50.680]   we can go shoot fully automatic rifles and they got a full auto Glock."
[00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:53.160]   I mean, there's no chance in the world I'm saying no to that.
[00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:56.560]   Now those are kind of guy things that really appeal to me.
[00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:57.560]   But that's what I would do.
[00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:01.000]   If I were in a situation like that, I would rent a room.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:05.280]   Instead of doing a dinner at a hotel where it's in conflict, I would set up – and
[00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:09.760]   I might do it in the middle of the day, like a lunch because oftentimes a lunchtime thing
[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:13.880]   – many times people like me – I used to go to all the sessions.
[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:18.600]   But at this point in time, I get so tired and I don't go to all the sessions.
[00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:23.520]   I go to a session where I have a friend who's speaking or somebody who's maybe – I go
[00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:24.800]   to the keynotes, things like that.
[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:28.760]   But if you look on the schedule and you pick a time that's not during a keynote and when
[00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:31.920]   there's not a lot of other presses, when there aren't a lot of other meetups, and
[00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:34.840]   you put together a small group of people who might like to know each other, which is the
[00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:38.560]   basis of connection, which you're already doing, but you try to figure out who would
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:43.000]   this person – who do I have in my network that I can introduce these few people?
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.320]   Then you put it on a fun activity.
[00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:47.400]   Man, that would be how I'd approach it.
[00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:57.440]   Texas, there's got to be some gun ranges or some ATV rides or something cool like that.
[00:44:57.440 --> 00:44:58.920]   To me, that would be the biggest thing.
[00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:04.440]   That would also be fun because when I go to a conference, I almost never do any kind of
[00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:05.440]   tourist things.
[00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:08.200]   I fly in and I go to the thing and I fly out.
[00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:11.040]   I just want to get home as quickly as possible.
[00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:14.400]   Scheduling a tourist event like that I think would be – that's the best I got for you.
[00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:15.400]   Yeah, cool.
[00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:18.240]   I very much appreciate the thought.
[00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:19.240]   Awesome.
[00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:22.040]   Let me know what you wind up with and we'll look forward to it.
[00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:23.840]   I think you emailed me at some point.
[00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:25.760]   I don't think I ever responded, right?
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:26.760]   Is that where we were?
[00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:31.200]   That's true, but I wasn't going to call you out on the air about that.
[00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:32.200]   Take a look.
[00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:37.360]   There's a second idea in there that might be of interest to you that I won't share on
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:38.360]   the call.
[00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:40.800]   I'll look for that.
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:43.000]   You got time for one more or are you two jammed up?
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:44.560]   Let me wait for next week.
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:49.200]   I want to take one more caller from another Matt in Tennessee and then call back in with
[00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:50.200]   you next week.
[00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:51.200]   All right.
[00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:52.200]   Cool.
[00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:53.200]   Thanks, Matt.
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:54.200]   All right.
[00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:55.200]   Let's go to another Matt or Matthew in Tennessee.
[00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:56.520]   He'll be our last caller for the day.
[00:45:56.520 --> 00:46:00.200]   Go ahead and let me know what's on your mind and let's see how I can serve you today, please.
[00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:02.320]   Hey, Joshua.
[00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:03.920]   Thanks for taking my call today.
[00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:08.280]   I actually might have to drop off after I ask the question because I've got to run to
[00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:13.480]   a meeting here, but I wanted to go ahead and ask it and I might actually have to get the
[00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:15.640]   answer on the podcast tomorrow.
[00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:21.640]   I just want to give you that heads up in case you tried to have some dialogue or something
[00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:25.200]   and you didn't get anything back.
[00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:30.960]   Just imagine that I am your financial planning client and we're having a discussion primarily
[00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:34.960]   around the investment management piece of financial planning.
[00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:41.400]   What would you say to educate me on why it's a good decision on going with DFA funds over
[00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:43.800]   like a Vanguard index fund?
[00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:48.760]   I know in previous podcasts you said that DFA does a good job of keeping hot money out
[00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:52.400]   of their funds, but what are the other advantages of going with DFA?
[00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:53.800]   Yeah, that's simple.
[00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:59.920]   DFA does a good job because DFA funds are only sold through financial advisors.
[00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:04.400]   They do a good job of keeping hot money out and that's big for them.
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:10.320]   They focus heavily on training financial advisors to train their clients and hot money means
[00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:14.600]   that the clients come in and go out.
[00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:20.080]   One of the major helps that a financial advisor can provide to a client is helping them to
[00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:24.760]   stay invested and that helps the fund manager to be able to do a better job when he doesn't
[00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:28.280]   have to go and sell investments all of a sudden and they can take advantage of some of the
[00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:34.160]   little things that DFA focuses on to take advantage to possibly improve their returns
[00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:35.520]   just a little bit.
[00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:41.600]   To me that's the biggest thing is that DFA does a brilliant job of bringing together
[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:48.720]   the basic ideology of passive investing, indexing, passive investing and marries that into a
[00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:53.320]   package that the financial advisor can use and really serve their client.
[00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:58.960]   The financial advisor is not in competition with the internet and that's really helpful.
[00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:04.440]   I think that just their focus on a financial advisor, their focus on keeping costs down,
[00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:08.640]   their focus on trying to tweak some of those little investment things that they do because
[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:12.680]   of the benefit of going through an advisor, to me that's the biggest benefit.
[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:14.080]   Is one better than another?
[00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:16.520]   You have to read their literature and judge that.
[00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:21.640]   I can't know that but when I was looking at them I really appreciated that they were focused
[00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:26.320]   on advisors, not going direct to the client and I felt like there was a lot of value there
[00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:29.440]   that I would be able to help my clients understand.
[00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:32.240]   Got it.
[00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:35.920]   Thank you for that explanation.
[00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:37.400]   Sure.
[00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:38.400]   Anything else?
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:44.040]   Yeah, just real quick.
[00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:50.800]   This is more about your personal finances so feel free to divulge whatever you feel
[00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:52.920]   comfortable with.
[00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:56.520]   I know that you've been trying to build a business over the past three years and I'm
[00:48:56.520 --> 00:49:02.800]   curious what personal planning have you done to capitalize on these early years of building
[00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:04.200]   a business?
[00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:09.960]   For example, have you completed any traditional IRA conversions to Roth during low income,
[00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:15.320]   low tax years with the business or any other planning opportunities that you went through?
[00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:33.200]   I've got to decide what I'm willing to talk about publicly.
[00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:36.760]   It's so hard because I've lost so much of my own personal privacy since starting this
[00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:37.760]   show.
[00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:43.400]   It's so hard to decide how much to talk about publicly and what to do because I really hate
[00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:47.440]   to lose much more privacy.
[00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:53.160]   Here are a few things that I have done.
[00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:58.360]   In a business transition, I took a massive cut to my income.
[00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:05.880]   Yes, I have focused on taking advantage of every opportunity that has presented itself
[00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:11.280]   to me because of the massive cut to my income.
[00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:21.040]   I've focused on – I actually took some of my – I closed some of my traditional
[00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:22.040]   IRA accounts.
[00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:23.040]   I didn't do conversions.
[00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:29.280]   I actually closed some of my – just a small – one or two small ones, previous accounts
[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:35.280]   because I have become increasingly convinced that I don't want to play the game with
[00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:40.080]   the IRS – with the US government in the IRA world.
[00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:43.720]   I haven't gone to the point of saying, "I'm never going to open one again."
[00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:50.040]   I haven't gone and said, "Oh, I'm never going to deal with this."
[00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:57.320]   But when I look more and more and more, the whole scheme of put all your money into mutual
[00:50:57.320 --> 00:51:05.280]   funds and retirement accounts, it just doesn't work well with the major benefits of investing
[00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:06.560]   for an individual.
[00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:14.120]   I think it's really wise to invest where you have an ability to compete really well.
[00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:15.640]   I'm a big guy.
[00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:18.280]   I'm 6'5" and over 300 pounds.
[00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:24.480]   I'm not going to go into a world where I'm investing with jockeys to try to ride horses.
[00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:28.880]   But I may go into a world where my size is a natural advantage.
[00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:32.300]   I see the same thing with regard to investing.
[00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:37.000]   It often feels very lonely for me because I feel like I got to take on the whole financial
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:40.120]   advice industry with this question.
[00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:47.960]   I often question myself of am I accurate in my understanding?
[00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:49.840]   Am I accurate in my discussion?
[00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:56.680]   It's really hard because taking some of the opinions that I've taken forces, puts me up
[00:51:56.680 --> 00:52:01.120]   against things that I previously said and talked to clients.
[00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:07.800]   But I just don't see people winning because of IRAs and mutual funds.
[00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:09.840]   I really don't.
[00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:11.840]   Not that you can't win.
[00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:14.140]   There are people in this audience who are winning.
[00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:15.140]   Not that you can't win.
[00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:26.880]   But we had the call earlier from the guy who had $34,000 in his various mutual fund accounts.
[00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:31.840]   If we were to go back, and I don't know anything more about Guy other than that fact, but my
[00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:34.040]   guess is that he's a man.
[00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:36.040]   He's got a family.
[00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:40.240]   That $34,000 is a big deal to him.
[00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:44.560]   If I were to go back and try to think what could we do with that $34,000 that would be
[00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:52.000]   more productive than buying growth stock mutual funds inside of IRAs and other accounts, I
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:55.560]   got to imagine at this point I could come up with a whole long list of things that I
[00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:57.880]   think would be better uses of the money.
[00:52:57.880 --> 00:53:00.700]   I really do.
[00:53:00.700 --> 00:53:08.260]   The big challenge that I face in trying to figure out how to do this is to look at it
[00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:14.640]   and say, "You got to know someone's background.
[00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:15.640]   You got to know their interests.
[00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:16.640]   Are they suited for business?
[00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:19.680]   Are they suited for entrepreneurship?"
[00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:21.280]   For me, I'm willing to say that.
[00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:25.440]   I cashed out some of my retirement accounts because I was able to get my tax burden low
[00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:31.080]   enough that the 10% penalty was lower in terms of a total effective tax rate.
[00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:35.960]   The 10% penalty was lower than what the tax rate would be in the future and I was able
[00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:41.720]   to transition some of that money from under somebody else's control to under my direct
[00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:42.920]   control.
[00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:46.280]   When I look at the business opportunities in front of me and the things that I'm concerned
[00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:52.120]   about and the things that I'm interested in, not so many of them can be done within an
[00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:53.120]   IRA.
[00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:59.080]   Not so many of them can be done within a retirement account.
[00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:02.280]   So that's a big deal to me.
[00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:06.880]   Given the fact that investing with retirement accounts, it's not the only tax break.
[00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:08.800]   It's not the only thing that you can do.
[00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:16.760]   When I look at the goals that I have, I'm finding more and more that I want the flexibility
[00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:18.120]   of business.
[00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:21.680]   The other thing that I have done is I have – I guess the other thing I'm willing to
[00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:28.240]   talk about is that I've become much more conservative as a person because of the unique
[00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:33.880]   risks and the unique risks that I face going forward that are different than some other
[00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:34.880]   people.
[00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:36.600]   I've become much more conservative.
[00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:42.520]   I think about the aggressiveness and here I'm not talking about asset allocation conservative.
[00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:46.980]   What I mean is when you look at the – how aggressive you want to be versus how conservative
[00:54:46.980 --> 00:54:53.240]   you want to be, it's really valuable to look at the whole situation.
[00:54:53.240 --> 00:55:00.000]   Because I have more business opportunities, which if I can figure out how to make them
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.800]   work, that's a big challenge.
[00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:08.800]   If I can figure out how to make them work, they have more – they have much more unbounded
[00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:10.120]   growth opportunity.
[00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:14.120]   That's caused me to be more aggressive with – sorry, more conservative with other
[00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:17.680]   areas of my life to offset that risk.
[00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:23.560]   It probably doesn't make a lot of sense if I don't give specifics but I don't
[00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:28.880]   think at this point in time that I'm willing to give any more specifics than that.
[00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:35.520]   Just to say that what you hear when I talk on the show, what you hear from me is I don't
[00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:36.520]   make anything up.
[00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:42.520]   It's all – you can hear and you can hear some of the challenges that I face and things.
[00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:48.240]   So I have sought to make intelligent financial moves all along the way based upon the unique
[00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:53.960]   situations – based upon the unique circumstances that I have, the unique advantages and benefits
[00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:54.960]   that I have.
[00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:58.600]   I have sought to do that all along the way and practice what I preach.
[00:55:58.600 --> 00:56:00.040]   Maybe in the future I'll talk more about them.
[00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:03.680]   But when you're in the middle of stuff, it's not a good time to talk about it.
[00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:05.880]   I'd rather keep my privacy.
[00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:08.080]   That all sounds very skullduggerish.
[00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:10.740]   That's it for today's show.
[00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:11.740]   Thank you all for calling in.
[00:56:11.740 --> 00:56:12.740]   Great number of callers.
[00:56:12.740 --> 00:56:14.440]   I know that I turned away about a half a dozen of you.
[00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:16.840]   Just you got to get on the line early.
[00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:21.560]   So if you'd like to participate in a call like this in the future, please join as a
[00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:26.560]   patron and also consider joining my email list at RadicalPersonalFinance.com.
[00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:32.920]   Don't forget about sending me a voicemail feedback of what you've done and the changes
[00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:37.080]   that you've made in your life based upon Radical Personal Finance over the last few
[00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:39.760]   years.
[00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:42.880]   Go ahead and send that to me at Joshua@RadicalPersonalFinance.com.
[00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:47.980]   What you do, take your phone, navigate to the voice memo function on your phone, go
[00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:58.660]   somewhere quiet and record just a quick about two or three minute discussion of what you've
[00:56:58.660 --> 00:57:00.820]   done differently because of Radical Personal Finance.
[00:57:00.820 --> 00:57:04.180]   Then email that to me, Joshua@RadicalPersonalFinance.com.
[00:57:04.180 --> 00:57:06.380]   Send me that over as an email for episode 500.
[00:57:06.380 --> 00:57:15.380]   I am going to sync all of those things together and publish it as a show just to hear other
[00:57:15.380 --> 00:57:16.380]   listeners.
[00:57:16.380 --> 00:57:17.380]   I'd love to hear that.
[00:57:17.380 --> 00:57:20.100]   Also while you're doing it, please send me a picture of you and your family if you're
[00:57:20.100 --> 00:57:21.100]   willing.
[00:57:21.100 --> 00:57:22.100]   I'd love that.
[00:57:22.100 --> 00:57:23.100]   It's not going to be published.
[00:57:23.100 --> 00:57:24.100]   It's just for me.
[00:57:24.100 --> 00:57:27.340]   I'm making just a little computer slideshow that I can look at and I look at it while
[00:57:27.340 --> 00:57:28.340]   I record my show sometimes.
[00:57:28.340 --> 00:57:33.500]   It helps me to visualize who I'm talking to so I make sure that my tone is appropriate
[00:57:33.500 --> 00:57:35.740]   and that I really can see who I'm speaking to.
[00:57:35.740 --> 00:57:36.740]   I'd love for you to do that.
[00:57:36.740 --> 00:57:40.220]   Thank you to those of you who have sent me that.
[00:57:40.220 --> 00:57:41.220]   Other announcements.
[00:57:41.220 --> 00:57:42.220]   I think that's it for today.
[00:57:42.220 --> 00:57:58.700]   Join the Patreon program, RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patreon and I'll be back with you on Monday.
[00:57:58.700 --> 00:58:12.100]   Bye.
