[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   This is where we have an open phone line
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   and callers call in and ask anything you want.

[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   I guess wildly useless is probably a little bit of an overstatement.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   It's hard to think of why anybody would call in
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   and talk about anything that's wildly useless.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   But these shows are open so much in the same way
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   that other shows may do an open line Friday

[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   I do not screen the calls other than to have a quick idea

[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   How can I serve you today, sir?
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   - Hey, Josh.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Thanks again for the show and everything that you do.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Today I have a question about frontloading the 401(k) account.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   I think it's a good question to consider at the start of the year.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   I want to know your views about it.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   What are the pros and cons of frontloading?
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   What factors one should consider
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   in deciding whether to frontload a 401(k) account or not?
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   - Have you ever done this in the past yourself
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   or is it just more of a thoughtful question
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   to understand a little bit more about it?
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   - I'm planning to do it this year.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   That's how I'm arriving at this question.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   - Right.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   So for those who aren't familiar with the nomenclature,
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   the idea of frontloading a 401(k) account is this.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Each year, you have a total maximum amount
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   that you can make in terms of contribution limits.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   And in 2018, that number for people who are under the age of 50
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   is $18,500.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   That is the total allowable contribution limit
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   for employees who are under the age of 50.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   Of course, if you're over 50 and available,
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   then the catch-up contribution limit will be $6,000.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   So that would be $6,000 in addition to the $18,500,
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   which would bring you up to a total of $24,500.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   So generally, what most of us would do,
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   especially if we're getting into the world of maxing out an account,
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   is we would sit down and we would figure out
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   how much per month we could contribute
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   if we're going to max it out at $18,500.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   So you would take $18,500 divided by 12,
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   and you would come up with a number of $1,541.67 per month.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   And then you would sit down with your pay
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   and you would try to figure out,
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   well, how much of my income does $1,541.67 per month count as?
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   So if I had $100,000,
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   what percentage of my income would I need to contribute
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   to equal $1,541.67?
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   So if we use a number like $100,000, it's relatively simple, of course.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   $18,500 out of a $100,000 salary is 18.5%.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   So you would figure it out, and I just figured the formula out.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   So if you take your--let's just stick with that $18,500 number.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Multiply 18,000--take $18,500 and divide it by your salary,
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   and that will give you the percentage.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   So if you have $18,500 and you divide--
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   let's say your annual salary is $75,000.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   You take $18,500, divide it by $75,000,
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   which gives you 24.7% of your income,
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   and then you need to take that and figure out what that would--
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   if you're doing it on a percentage basis,
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   it would be the same amount,
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   whether you're paid biweekly, monthly, or however it works.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   So to figure out how to take the total maximum contribution,
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   you just simply divide the maximum contribution by your salary,
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   and that gives you the percentage of your income.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   Now, most of the time, the normal way to contribute to a 401(k) account
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   would be to spread those contributions out.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   If you were earning $100,000,
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   you would just contribute 18.5% of your income each pay period.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   Whether you're paid monthly, biweekly, that won't matter.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   Each pay period into the account if you do it on a percentage basis.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   The idea of front-loading, however, is to say,
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   "How could I contribute and get all of the money into my account
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   as quickly as possible?"
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   If your annual income were $100,000,
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   but you were the kind of person that maintained $100,000
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   in your checking account,
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   you wouldn't necessarily need to have all of the money right now.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   And so you could front-load your contributions to the 401(k) account.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   If you're--for sake of simpler math--
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   if your monthly before-tax income were $10,000 per month,
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   then you could call up your HR department and say,
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   "In January, I want you to put all of my $10,000 income
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   into my 401(k) account."
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   And then in February, you could tell them,
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   "I want you to put $8,500 of my annual income
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   into my 401(k) account."
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   And during those two months,
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   you simply spend the money out of your checking account
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   on your expenses.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   And by the end of February, in my example,
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   your 401(k) account is fully funded.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   Now, what are the benefits of this?
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   Well, the first obvious benefit
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   is that your money is invested more quickly.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   So if, on the whole,
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   the value of your investments is going to increase--
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   and we generally assume that it is
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   because, of course, that's why we're investing
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   in the first place--
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   and then, on the whole,
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   the general trend for investments is positive--
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   by having your money invested earlier--
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   I'm going to rephrase--
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   on the whole, the general trend for investments,
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   such as the publicly traded equity markets
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   in the United States,
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   is generally positive.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   By having your money invested earlier,
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   you probably get a chance to take advantage of
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   a higher likelihood that your money will go up.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   If all of the money were invested in January every year,
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   instead of spread out through the year,
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   on the whole, mathematically,
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   we would expect there to be a higher rate of return.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   Could be wrong in some random years.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Could be that in January of 2018,
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   as we record this,
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   the markets are high,
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   and then in June, all of a sudden, they plummet.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   But, on the whole,
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   we would expect them to go up.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   So by investing your money more quickly,
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   you are having the opportunity
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   to have the accounts grow more quickly
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   and potentially be worth more.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   This could, of course, push your taxes back.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   Your income is all going in up front,
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   so you have lower expected taxes,
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   at least in the beginning.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   And this would be useful with regard to
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   if you knew that you might be fired
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   or you might leave your job,
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   you at least would be able to have access
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   and have the money there.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   This could also be a useful strategy.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   I don't know if it would hold up in bankruptcy court,
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   but if you were trying to get more money
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   into a 401(k) account,
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   to have an asset-protected strategy,
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   I don't know if that would ever be considered
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   to be structuring something
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   to avoid the claims of creditors,
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   but it's a useful strategy to know of
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   to get as much money into your 401(k) as possible.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   Downsides to it.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   The only downsides that I can think of
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   is the obvious ones of,
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   number one, you may need the money.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   That can be a problem.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   If you don't have the money in your checking account
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   to cover your expenses,
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   which most people don't,
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   then they need the money.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   But perhaps the more important one would be
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   to figure out how your employer
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   actually calculates their employer match.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   Some employers have a system wherein
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   they'll match your contributions
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   based upon the total amount
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   that you put into the account.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   In that case,
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   when you make your January contribution,
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   they may also make their employer contribution.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   On the flip side,
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   some employers have the system
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   where they match you on an ongoing basis.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   And so if they only match you
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   on a small percentage basis over time,
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   then, for example, 5%,
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   they match you the first 5% you put in,
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   they'll go ahead and match you 2.5%.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   Well, you're not putting 5% of your salary in in January.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   You're putting in 100% of your salary in January.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   They're still only going to match you 2.5%,
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   and you might run out of an employer match.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   But those would be the only major considerations
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   that I can think of
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   as far as things to be careful of.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   Shiv, did I miss anything that you're aware of?
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   I think that was it.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   I had the thought of employer match as well,
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   and that's how I asked you the question.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   I think now I need to get in touch with my HR
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   and understand how they do the contributions,
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   their part of contributions.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   Yeah, I need to--
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   that would be very important.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   It would be important if you were going to pursue this,
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   if I were going to do it,
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   I would physically talk to the director of human resources.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   I would explain to that person the actual plan,
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   the actual numbers,
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   and I would make sure that administratively
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   that they would be able to handle that.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   I would make sure and verify it
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   from just the details of getting the checks cut.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   You're going to have to submit multiple forms.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   You'd have to submit a form here in January to them,
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   and then you'll have to submit a new form in March,
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   and you would have to verify it
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   with regard to the employer match.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   But I would definitely make it a personal conversation,
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   explain what you're doing and why
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   so that they're aware of it
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   and so they can make sure there are no problems.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   I'm not aware of any problems with the strategy.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   How will it work out?
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   Depends on the markets.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   It's one of those things--
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   It's one of those things where in some ways
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   you'd almost think that you could do the same strategy
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   except backload it.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   If you had a way to predict the markets,
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   you could do the same strategy and say,
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   "Well, I'm just going to not take my income
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   in November and December."
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   Perhaps there would be someone who could--
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   there would be someone who could use this idea aggressively
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   and say, "I'm going to wait for a market correction,
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   and if it gets to June and I see that the markets are down,
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   that's the time I'm going to make 100% contributions."
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   To me, the whole thing's a little bit unwieldy.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   I think frontloading is probably the way to go
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   if you're going to pursue an aggressive strategy like this.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   Either that or just keep it straight and simple.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   I don't see any problem with it, though,
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   other than the simple scenario of the employee match.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   So those are my thoughts, Shiv.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   Good for you for being in the situation
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   with your personal finances that you can do that.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   You can be confident that given those considerations,
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   you are in the top few percent of the richest people in the world
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   who have the ability to forego their income for a few months
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   while they make 401(k) contributions.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   Anything else, Shiv, before I go on to the next call?
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   Nope, that's all. Thanks for the info.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   Thanks for calling.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   All right, we go to Tyson.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   Tyson, welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   How can I serve you today, please?
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   Yeah, I just had a general question
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   after moving from North Carolina out to Utah.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   For about 10 years, I had a financial advisor,
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   and they're based out of North Carolina.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   But throughout those years, I put money aside
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   into a money market account that they set up for me.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   And now it's about a quarter of a million dollars.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   And I'm not really utilizing their services much.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   It's just set aside in a kind of a target date fund,
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   80% equities, 20% bonds, not really exciting, which is fine.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   I don't really play in the market too much.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   But the asset center management fee takes away from that.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   When you look over the last 10 years,
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   the return probably is a little bit less than just a standard fund
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   that I could have bought myself through Vanguard or Fidelity.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   So my question is, is there either of those two,
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   Fidelity versus Vanguard, for a straightforward target date fund
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   that you prefer, would recommend,
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   over the other, the reasons for that, and the secondary question,
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   if I pull the money out of the account set up by my financial advisor,
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   is there a tax implication to transfer that over to Fidelity or Vanguard?
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   Let's answer number two first because it's easy.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   No, there's not.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   You can fire your financial advisor at any point in time,
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   and you can transfer the assets from one advisor to another advisor
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   without any tax implications.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   The mechanism for doing so is standard.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   It will either be your brokerage company will just send the check directly
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   to your next brokerage company, or they will send the check to you,
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   and you will just forward it on to the next brokerage company.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   But there are no tax implications as long as you're going from like account
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   to like account.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   If you're moving money from an IRA to an IRA, there are no tax implications.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   In terms of a secondary question, which you didn't ask,
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   but I want to answer in terms of fees, generally,
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   if you're dealing in the world of fee-based accounts where you're paying a fee
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   that's calculated on assets under management,
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   then there are no additional fees for that.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   If you have some accounts that are purchased on a commission basis,
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   then you would need to look to make sure to see if there are any fees
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   associated with transferring those, whether there is a surrender charge
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   of some kind.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   Surrender charges are common on things like annuities,
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   but on mutual funds you usually don't have surrender charges,
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   but you want to check the class of shares that you have
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   and just see if there are any costs associated with making those changes.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   But if you're paying money on a percentage basis,
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   there are basically going to be no fees for that change.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   Now, whether or not you should actually do it is a separate question.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   Of course, that's the more valuable approach.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   So what value, Tyson, do you believe that a financial advisor brings to your life
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   and to your finances?
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   Well, initially when I got with financial advisors about 10 years ago
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   and I finished out school and I needed some guidance as far as whole value life
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   insurance, cash value life insurance.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   I had quite a bit of money coming in at the time
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   and not a lot of places to put it necessarily.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   So at the time I did need some guidance with where to put the money
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   and how to be tax efficient with my money.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   So at the time it was a great help.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   Now we're 10 years down the road and all those things have been established,
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   I maybe talk with an advisor once every year to year and a half.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   It's kind of one of those kind of set it, forget it situations
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   where everything is now set.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   I don't foresee any big changes in the next 10 to 15 years of my life.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   So I'm just trying to think of that 1% per year, times that by 10 to 20 years.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   I don't know if I'm getting that value out of having the advisor anymore.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   So probably not.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   If this advisor is not doing a competent enough job of demonstrating their value
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   to you, they're probably not bringing the value.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   Now the way that I would approach it, I would talk to the advisor and tell them
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   I'm starting to question the value proposition here.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   And they may or may not respond to that.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   The value of your accounts may not be sufficient to where they actually want
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   to work with you or they would find it to be a valuable thing.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   Or the value of your accounts may be there and they just haven't realized
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   they're not doing a good job serving you.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   So the way that I answer the question is you have to look to see
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   is this advisor really giving me value.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   Now I don't believe that the argument is best stated either I'm the type of person
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   that uses a financial advisor or doesn't use a financial advisor.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   Some people believe that financial advisors bring no value.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   A couple years ago I went round and round on this with my friend Jim Collins,
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   who is a popular blogger at the website JL Collins NH.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   And he's published a book last year called The Simple Path to Wealth.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   And Jim is very well known in the personal finance writing space for being an advocate
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   that in essence everybody should have their investments managed with Vanguard.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   And a financial advisor brings essentially no value.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   And I love what he does.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   He does a great job of bringing people to a place of confidence in their decisions.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   He makes the investing process simple.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   He does a great job.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   But Jim and I used to argue because I come from the background of being a financial advisor.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   He would say, "Well, financial advisors don't bring value
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   and here's all the data that demonstrates that they don't bring value."
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   And I would say, "Well, I think the data is flawed."
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   And usually the way that this argument is based is to say,
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   "Does a financial advisor help you to choose investments that are going to make a higher rate of return
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   than the investments that you're choosing on your own?"
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   This used to be how the money management and the financial advice space would go.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   You would meet with somebody from Merrill Lynch and they would come and they would say to you,
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   "Look, I can pick better stocks than the other person can."
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   A lot of that has changed.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   Now, it's not fully changed.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   There are still individual money managers and advisors that work with big brokerage companies,
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   small brokerage companies who do still do portfolio management in that way.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   But the industry and the type of thing that you're describing has changed.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   And if your advisor has your money in target date retirement funds,
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   by definition that advisor is not bringing you additional, what's called alpha,
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   additional outperformance with your portfolio.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   Your target date retirement funds could be purchased with this advisor paying their 1% fee
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   or it could be purchased without this advisor not paying the 1% fee.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   So if you're going to continue paying costs and fees, the only reason for you to do that would be
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   if you're getting value that's in excess of those costs or fees.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   And this is going to depend not on the structure.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   This is going to depend on the advisor.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   So when I used to manage money, when I actually left the firm I was with,
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   I was in the process of establishing a new registered investment advisory firm.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   And one of the pieces that I came across was at that time was some of Vanguard's research on the subject.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   And I'm going to cite that to you here.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   If you go on and you do a website called – sorry, you do a web search for Vanguard,
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   the value of a financial advisor, you'll find a white paper that Vanguard published.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   And I'll just use their categories as an example because Vanguard, of course,
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   is famously known as the low-cost mutual fund provider.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   Jack Bogle, everything was about index funds exclusively.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   That's what they're known for is low-cost index fund advice.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   They researched this and they found that in their assessment that there were a number of different areas
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   where an advisor could bring value.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   So the first – and here were the different categories that they thought.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   Number one, a financial advisor could be able to bring help to the client by helping them to make a suitable asset allocation choice
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   using broadly diversified funds and exchange-traded funds.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   That's their first part of their strategy, so helping the client to come up with a suitable asset allocation strategy.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   And they believe that there is value there.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   It is significant, but it's hard to actually quantify this.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   Now, my example of this is as an advisor, I think that I frequently would be able to talk somebody into pursuing
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   a more aggressive form of portfolio design based upon my ability to allay some of their fears.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   And if I can move somebody from a portfolio that has an expected return of 5% to a portfolio that has an expected return of 7%,
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   and if I charge them – and this, again, is overly simplistic – but if I charge them 1% for that process, that could be helpful.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   But helping somebody to develop a suitable asset allocation could be really, really helpful to them.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   But they actually don't quantify that one exactly.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   They say it's something greater than zero in their analysis.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   In their little footnote in the paper, they say, "The value is significant, but it's too unique to each investor for us to quantify."
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   The second area that they believe that an advisor can bring value is to help the client do cost-effective implementation
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   of their investment strategy by choosing funds and investment products that have low expense ratios.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   And their analysis says that that typically adds about 40 basis points.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   So, again, 40 basis points is 0.40% return, 40 basis points of value for a client.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   The third area of help would be rebalancing.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   And so they believe that because an advisor may be more prone to help the client rebalance and rebalance consistently,
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   that could add about 35 basis points of help and additional alpha to the portfolio.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   The next area is what they call behavioral coaching.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   The idea is by helping a client to make different decisions on their investment choice,
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   by helping a client to make different decisions on their willingness to bear risk,
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   on helping a client to make different decisions in terms of how much money they save and contribute,
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   and most importantly, by helping a client to maintain, to stay invested, to stay in good investments
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   when everyone's saying, "Take all your money out of your 401(k) and put it all in Bitcoin because you're going to make millions,"
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   and by helping a client stay invested when the sky is falling and you need to take all your money and put it into gold,
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   by doing that, then a client could bring 150 basis points of value to --
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   excuse me, an advisor could bring about 150 basis points of value to a client.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   The next category of value is asset location.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   So can the advisor help the client to efficiently locate their assets in the place that makes the most sense to them?
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   The simplest example here would be that you want your capital gains investments.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   If you have a choice between some assets inside of a retirement account and some assets outside of a retirement account,
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   then financial advisor 101 is that you always put your capital gains investments outside of the retirement account
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   and you put your ordinary income investments inside the retirement account.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   So you put your bond portfolio in the retirement account because the retirement account is going to be paying ordinary income taxes,
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   and then you put your stock portfolio or other long-term capital gains property outside of the retirement account
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   because that's where you can pay taxes at capital gains rates versus ordinary income rates.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   So that being 101, as far as asset location strategy,
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   then an advisor can add somewhere between zero and 75 basis points of value.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   The last two categories of value that Vanguard identified was spending strategy,
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   helping a client to do an intelligent withdrawal plan from their portfolio.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   They said that that could be anywhere from zero to 110 basis points of value.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   And then in terms of thinking about investing from a total return strategy versus an income-only strategy,
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   the idea is many people look at their investment portfolio and they say, "I'm only going to spend the income,"
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   when in reality some of your best investments don't generate a lot of income.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   What they do generate is growth, capital gains, but that's spendable money.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   And so you should look at your portfolio in terms of total return, not just in terms of income.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   You wouldn't buy the property next door that has no future value.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   It would be better for you to buy a property that has some income and significant potential for appreciation
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   versus just buying a property that's just going to produce income for you but is not going to go up in value.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   And that's value, but it's value that's greater than zero, but that's so unique to each investor it's hard to quantify.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   But in terms of their total potential value that they calculated a good advisor can add,
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   it would come out to be about 3% in net returns, something like that, about 3% additional growth and additional returns.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   Now again, this is coming from Vanguard, so I think that gives an air of credibility to the research.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   It's well done academically, but that helps to articulate the value of a financial advisor.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   So the question is not does a financial advisor have value or not.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   I think the question is, number one, am I the kind of person who would gain that type of value from an advisor?
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   And number two, is my current advisor the type of advisor who's delivering that type of value?
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   And neither one of those are gimme's.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   So you could be the kind of person who would gain value from an advisor, or you could be the kind of person who just says,
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   "No, I can figure that out myself."
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   And number two is this advisor may or may not be the type of advisor that's helpful.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   So after that little speech, Tyson, how would you grade your current advisor?
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   I think right now probably not one that is in alignment with what I need to do.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   And from what you just spoke about, I don't believe I'm getting those kind of, oh, I guess returns on the advice I'm getting from them,
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   being that I'm really not getting any advice.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   So maybe instead of saying no advisor, maybe it's time to shop for a different advisor.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   That might be a better approach.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   So what I would do if I were you, given that you've moved, I would shop for an advisor,
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   and as I did that, I would interview them and let them do their job and see if they can take the job.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   I think you should view a financial advisor as somebody who serves you, somebody who works for you.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   And that means if you're going to hire somebody who works for you, there should be an interview process.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   And so you should interview them.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   Start, of course, with Paladin Registry, radicalpersonalfinance.com/paladin, P-A-L-A-D-I-N.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   Start with those advisors, but look around, ask for some recommendations from people that you know and respect,
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   and go and perform an interview process with the advisors.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   Tell them your situation. Tell them what you're looking for.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   Tell them your concerns and be clear with them on what your convictions are about your approach to finances and not.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   At the end of the day, you'll spend some 10, 20 hours of your life interviewing people.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   And then at the end of it, sit down and talk with your wife and say, "Well, do we get value from this person?"
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   You may find somebody who brings you value, and you may find that at the end of the day,
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   "No, I'm just going to go ahead and move my money, buy a target date retirement fund with another firm, do it cheap, do it myself, and be fine."
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   I don't carry water for the financial advice industry.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   I believe that financial advisors, it's our job to, one, bring value, and two, consistently demonstrate that value to our clients
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   in the same way that every other industry has to do.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   And so I believe that good advisors will embrace that challenge and will deliver on it.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   And 80% of the advisors won't and don't deserve their clients, don't deserve the business.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   And I'd be happy to see them all disappear out of the business and go find something else where they can actually bring people value
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   so that they can feel better about the work that they do.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   Josh, I appreciate your time and thank you. That brought a lot of clarity and gave me something to think about and to work on in the near future. I appreciate it.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   Thank you for calling in. And for the rest of us, I would just say that I – how do I reinforce the point without repeating it?
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   Make sure that you're gaining maximum value from everything that you do. That should be the point.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   That applies to me and Radical Personal Finance. If you're not getting value from my show right now, pause, delete, move on.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   Find something else that is gaining you value.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   Now, I'm going to work day and night to try to deliver on that for you, but there's nothing sacred about that.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   It's always funny. Frequently, I get reviews and emails from people who say, "Well, your show just doesn't do it for me anymore and I'm going to go on and listen to some other show."
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   I always just chuckle a little bit because I have subscribed and unsubscribed from so many podcasts over the years,
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   and yet I have never written to somebody to say, "I'm unsubscribing from you."
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   I've often think about that. I'm not worried – I hope this doesn't sound overly arrogant – but I am not worried at all about the people who write me a note
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   or who put a nasty review and say, "I used to listen to Joshua's show, but I'm done with it." I don't worry about them.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   What I worry about is the many, many people who just said, "Pause, delete, and move on."
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   My job is not to worry about the people who get all angry about something and just post a review.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   My job is to worry about if I see trends of many more people who don't say a thing that just move on.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   Now, to be clear, just like if I were a restaurant owner, it would behoove me as a restaurant owner to pay careful attention to my Yelp reviews
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   and to pay attention to the traffic coming in and out and to see if there's a correlation between those two things.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   That would be very, very important to me as a restaurant owner.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   But I shouldn't automatically assume that if I get a bad Yelp review but my dining room is full, I shouldn't automatically listen too deeply to that one particular Yelp review.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   In the same way as a podcast host, I look to see, "Is my dining room full and what are my Yelp reviews?" by way of analogy.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   But the point is, get value from things. If you're not getting value from your gym membership, if you're not getting value from your personal trainer,
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   if you're not getting value from your accountant, go and hire somebody else.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   I am a firm proponent and an advocate for capitalism. What is it that makes capitalism so valuable?
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   It's competition. The fact that if you do not compete effectively in the marketplace, over time, your competitors will take all your business away from you.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   What does this lead to? Winning for the consumers. Think about this.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   The car that you're driving right now today could very quickly and easily, without any major modifications and for the most part without any major work,
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   could easily go to 200,000 to 300,000 miles without many significant mechanical problems.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   Most vehicles can do that. 30 years ago, that was not the case. 30 years ago, the average car couldn't get much past 100,000 miles.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   What made the difference? Many things, but the basic of it was competition.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   Car manufacturers prior to, before the 1970s, they were developing their skills, but there was a revolution in the United States
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   where the American car manufacturers just sat on their laurels and stopped improving things,
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   and the Japanese car manufacturers ate their lunch and dramatically improved vehicles, vehicle longevity, etc.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   Now, since then, American car manufacturers have come fighting back and produced great products today that are well-served,
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   but the winner in that competition was not Ford or GM versus Honda or Toyota.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   The winner in that competition was the consumer, you and me, and it's the same in every other industry.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   So in the world of financial advice, what I am quite happy to see is the fact that financial advisors have been exposed to tremendous competition.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   Vanguard has eaten everybody else's lunch.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   If you look at the amount of assets that Vanguard owns and if you look at the success that Vanguard generally,
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   Jack Bogle specifically, all of his team has had in convincing the marketplace of the value of the Vanguard strategy,
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   he was the laughingstock of the industry when he started, and he has had the best revenge of all,
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   which is completely vanquishing basically your enemy.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   Now, what that's done is that's brought tremendous pressure. It's brought pressure.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   What's happened in the industry? Fees have gone down. Expenses have gone down.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   From every company, fees and expenses have gone down.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   Now, you'll find plenty of people that charge high fees, but now they have to justify those fees.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   It's not automatic. Gone are the days pictured in the pursuit of happiness where the broker would just call you up and say,
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   "Hey, listen, I've got some bunch of shares of such and such a stock," and you would believe it, and that would be your big thing.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   The world of modern money management has dramatically improved, and it will just continue to improve.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   Now we face a danger that too much money is passively managed. People aren't paying attention.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   Know what will happen? That will create new opportunities for new investors who say, "No, I can do better.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   I can find the inefficiencies," and the money will flow to them.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   The person who wins in competition is you, you, the customer.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   So you hold all the power. Act like it. Don't give in to old, outdated ideas. Don't give in to old approaches.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   Act like you've got the power because you really do.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   Only two callers on today's show. Plenty of room here, as you can see, if you would like to call into a future show.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   Sometimes I have a lot of calls, and sometimes I don't have a lot of calls with these shows,
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   but if you want to talk with me, if you want to talk about an area of financial planning or money management,
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   early retirement, financial independence, this is your best way to do it. I'd love to have many more of you call.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   Last year we did a few shows where I opened them up to the wide audience and took a half a dozen, a dozen calls in an hour,
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   and those were fun. So come on by RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron and sign up there, RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   Thank you to the several new of you who have done that so far this year.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   I will be here to continue earning your support and to continue earning your compensation.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   Thank you for those of you who do that. RadicalPersonalFinance.com/patron.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   Other announcements? I've got about a minute of music. Let me make sure to see if I have something useful to share with you in the next minute.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   I hope you've enjoyed the discussion I've had on expenses. I hope that's been useful to you.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   For many of us here in January, one of the best things that you can do with regard to your 2018 financial household returns is to cut expenses.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   If you look at them individually, the impact of any specific expense is probably pretty small.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   But if you look at them collectively, the expense is thousands of dollars for most of us.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   So don't fall prey to despising the small changes.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   Good money management is usually a result of a lot of little decisions repeated over time, a lot of wise little decisions.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   So take even the concepts I've shared here about competition, take them to your own personal budget,
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   and look with zero-based thinking and with a very critical eye, look at every expenditure in your budget,
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   and ask yourself, "Am I gaining value from this?"
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   If you're not, change it to where you are.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   And if you're a service provider and a financial advisor, this would be a good time of year to be calling your clients,
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   because if we don't consistently reinforce the value that we do bring, our clients will forget more quickly than anyone else.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   Have a great weekend, y'all. I'll be back with you next week.
