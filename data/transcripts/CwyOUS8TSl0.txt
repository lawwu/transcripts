[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720]   The following is a conversation with Dmitry Korkin.
[00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.560]   He's a professor of bioinformatics
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.280]   and computational biology at WPI,
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.320]   Worcester Polytechnic Institute,
[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.980]   where he specializes in bioinformatics of complex diseases,
[00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.000]   computational genomics, systems biology,
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.360]   and biomedical data analytics.
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.400]   I came across Dmitry's work when in February,
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.040]   his group used the viral genome of the COVID-19
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.040]   to reconstruct the 3D structure of its major viral proteins
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.360]   and their interaction with the human proteins,
[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.920]   in effect, creating a structural genomics map
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.560]   of the coronavirus and making this data open
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.180]   and available to researchers everywhere.
[00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.320]   We talked about the biology of COVID-19,
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.480]   SARS, and viruses in general,
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.740]   and how computational methods can help us understand
[00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.360]   their structure and function
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.840]   in order to develop antiviral drugs and vaccines.
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.360]   This conversation was recorded recently
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.680]   in the time of the coronavirus pandemic.
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.040]   For everyone feeling the medical, psychological,
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.000]   and financial burden of this crisis,
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.760]   I'm sending love your way.
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.800]   Stay strong, we're in this together, we'll beat this thing.
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.520]   This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.680]   If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.040]   review it with Five Stars and Apple Podcast,
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.400]   support it on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.480]   at Lex Friedman, spelled F-R-I-D-M-A-N.
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.560]   This show is presented by Cash App,
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.720]   the number one finance app in the App Store.
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.560]   When you get it, use code LEX, podcast.
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.680]   Cash App lets you send money to friends, buy Bitcoin,
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.680]   and invest in the stock market with as little as $1.
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.880]   Since Cash App allows you to buy Bitcoin,
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.840]   let me mention that cryptocurrency
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.000]   in the context of the history of money is fascinating.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.120]   I recommend "A Scent of Money"
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.200]   as a great book on this history.
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.840]   Debits and credits on ledgers
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.760]   started around 30,000 years ago.
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.680]   The US dollar created over 200 years ago.
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.440]   And Bitcoin, the first decentralized cryptocurrency,
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.600]   released just over 10 years ago.
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.120]   So given that history, cryptocurrency is still very much
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.000]   in its early days of development,
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.760]   but it's still aiming to, and just might,
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.820]   redefine the nature of money.
[00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.120]   So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store,
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.240]   Google Play, and use the code LEX, podcast,
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.160]   you get $10, and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST,
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.000]   an organization that is helping to advance robotics
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.480]   and STEM education for young people around the world.
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.260]   And now, here's my conversation with Dmitry Korkin.
[00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.920]   Do you find viruses terrifying or fascinating?
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.280]   - When I think about viruses, I think about them,
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.280]   I mean, I imagine them as those villains
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.640]   that do their work so perfectly well.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.600]   That is impossible not to be fascinated with them.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.040]   - So what do you imagine when you think about a virus?
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.840]   Do you imagine the individual,
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.280]   sort of these 100 nanometer particle things?
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.040]   Or do you imagine the whole pandemic, like society level,
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.200]   when you say the efficiency at which they do their work,
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.960]   do you think of viruses as the millions
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.560]   that occupy a human body or a living organism,
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.680]   society level, like spreading as a pandemic,
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.240]   or do you think of the individual little guy?
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:34.240]   - Yes, I think this is a unique concept
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.680]   that allows you to move from micro scale to the macro scale.
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.720]   All right, so the virus itself,
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.080]   I mean, it's not a living organism.
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.800]   It's a machine, to me, it's a machine.
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.360]   But it is perfected to the way that it essentially
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.000]   has a limited number of functions
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.560]   it needs to do, necessary functions.
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.560]   And it essentially has enough information
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.760]   just to do those functions,
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.640]   as well as the ability to modify itself.
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:18.280]   So it's a machine, it's an intelligent machine.
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.240]   - So yeah, look, maybe on that point,
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.320]   you're in danger of reducing the power of this thing
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.000]   by calling it a machine, right?
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.520]   But you now mentioned that it's also possibly intelligent.
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.360]   It seems that there's these elements of brilliance
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.520]   that a virus has, of intelligence,
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.520]   of maximizing so many things about its behavior
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.680]   and to ensure its survival and its success.
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.440]   So do you see it as intelligent?
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.880]   - So I think it's a different,
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.880]   I understand it differently than I think about intelligence
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:06.760]   of humankind or intelligence of the artificial intelligence
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:12.100]   mechanisms.
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.280]   I think the intelligence of a virus is in its simplicity,
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:26.120]   the ability to do so much
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:31.020]   with so little material and information.
[00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:36.520]   But also I think it's interesting.
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.360]   It keeps me thinking, it keeps me wondering
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.000]   whether or not it's also an example
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.020]   of the basic swarm intelligence,
[00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:56.200]   where essentially the viruses act as the whole
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.820]   and they're extremely efficient in that.
[00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:05.240]   - So what do you attribute the incredible simplicity
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.560]   and the efficiency to?
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.680]   Is it the evolutionary process?
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.040]   So maybe another way to ask that,
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.320]   if you look at the next 100 years,
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:18.320]   are you more worried about the natural pandemics
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.360]   or the engineered pandemics?
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.080]   So how hard is it to build a virus?
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.200]   - Yes, it's a very, very interesting question
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:30.640]   because obviously there's a lot of conversations
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:35.640]   about whether we are capable of engineering
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.800]   a, you know, an even worse virus.
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:47.640]   I personally expect and am mostly concerned
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:51.300]   with the naturally occurring viruses
[00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:55.140]   simply because we keep seeing that.
[00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:59.880]   We keep seeing new strains of influenza emerging,
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.200]   some of them becoming pandemic.
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.920]   We keep seeing new strains of coronaviruses emerging.
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.840]   This is a natural process
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:14.340]   and I think this is why it's so powerful.
[00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:20.960]   You know, if you ask me, you know,
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:25.960]   I've read papers about scientists trying to study
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:32.520]   the capacity of the modern, you know, biotechnology
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:36.600]   to alter the viruses.
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:42.000]   But I hope that, you know,
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   it won't be our main concern in the nearest future.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.520]   - What do you mean by hope?
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:57.080]   - Well, you know, if you look back
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:02.400]   and look at the history of the most dangerous viruses,
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.880]   right, so the first thing that comes into mind
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.580]   is smallpox.
[00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:14.520]   So right now there is perhaps a handful of places
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:21.080]   where this, you know, the strains of this virus are stored.
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:24.120]   Right, so this is essentially the effort
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:29.120]   of the whole society to limit the access to those viruses.
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:34.280]   - You mean in a lab in a controlled environment
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.680]   in order to study? - Correct.
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:37.680]   - And then smallpox is one of the viruses
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:42.680]   for which it should be stated there's a vaccine
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:44.360]   is developed. - Yes, yes.
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:48.040]   And that's, you know, it's until '70s,
[00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:53.400]   I mean, in my opinion, it was perhaps the most dangerous
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:56.640]   thing that was there.
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.200]   - Is that a very different virus
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:04.120]   than the influenza and the coronaviruses?
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:08.840]   - It is, it is different in several aspects.
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:13.840]   Biologically, it's a so-called double-stranded DNA virus,
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:21.040]   but also in the way that it is much more contagious.
[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:29.600]   So the R naught for, so this is the--
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.000]   - What's R naught?
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.320]   - R naught is essentially an average number
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:40.480]   as person infected by the virus can spread to other people.
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:45.200]   So then the average number of people
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:49.480]   that he or she can spread it to.
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:55.240]   And, you know, there is still some discussion
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:10:00.240]   about the estimates of the current virus.
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:03.480]   You know, the estimations vary between, you know,
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.500]   1.5 and three.
[00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:11.000]   In case of smallpox, it was five to seven.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:17.560]   And we're talking about the exponential growth, right?
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:21.120]   So that's a very big difference.
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:25.680]   It's not the most contagious one.
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.880]   Measles, for example, it's, I think,
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:33.040]   15 and up, so it's, you know,
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:38.040]   but it's definitely, definitely more contagious
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:43.560]   that the seasonal flu than the current coronavirus
[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:47.600]   or SARS, for that matter.
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:52.320]   - What makes the virus more contagious?
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.080]   Well, I'm sure there's a lot of variables
[00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:57.680]   that come into play, but is it that whole discussion
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:00.880]   of aerosol and, like, the size of droplets,
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.280]   if it's airborne, or is there some other stuff
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.080]   that's more biology-centered?
[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.640]   - I mean, there are a lot of components,
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:09.760]   and there are biological components
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:13.320]   that are also, you know, social components.
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:17.880]   The ability of the virus to, you know,
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:22.240]   so the ways in which the virus is spread is definitely one.
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:27.040]   The ability to virus to stay on the surfaces.
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.320]   To survive.
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:34.040]   The ability of the virus to replicate fast,
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:34.880]   or so, you know--
[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.520]   - Or once it's in the cell, or whatever.
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.960]   - Once it's inside the host.
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.680]   And, interestingly enough, something that
[00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:48.120]   I think we didn't pay that much attention to
[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:52.400]   is the incubation period, where, you know,
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.760]   hosts are symptomatic.
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:55.920]   And now it turns out that another thing
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:59.840]   that we, one really needs to take into account,
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:05.680]   the percentage of the symptomatic population.
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:09.920]   Because those people still shed this virus,
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:13.600]   and still are, you know, they still are contagious.
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.560]   - I saw there's an, the Iceland study,
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:18.480]   which I think is probably the most impressive size-wise,
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:23.480]   shows 50% asymptomatic, this virus.
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:27.720]   I also recently learned the swine flu
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:33.720]   is like, just the number of people who got infected
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:36.160]   was in the billions.
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:37.520]   It was some crazy number.
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:39.260]   It was like, it was like,
[00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:43.200]   like 20% of the, 30% of the population,
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.320]   something crazy like that.
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:48.820]   So the lucky thing there is the fatality rate is low.
[00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:52.320]   But the fact that a virus can just take over
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:56.920]   an entire population so quickly, it's terrifying.
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:00.100]   - I think, I mean, this is, you know,
[00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:03.620]   that's perhaps my favorite example of a butterfly effect.
[00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:05.840]   Because it's really, I mean,
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:09.540]   it's even tinier than a butterfly.
[00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:11.720]   And look at, you know, and with, you know,
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:13.120]   if you think about it, right,
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:18.120]   so it used to be in those bat species.
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:23.280]   And perhaps because of, you know,
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:28.280]   a couple of small changes in the viral genome,
[00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:32.600]   it first had, you know, become capable
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:34.840]   of jumping from bats to human.
[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:37.480]   And then it became capable of jumping
[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.440]   from human to human, right?
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:42.720]   So this is, I mean, it's not even the size of a virus.
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.580]   It's the size of several, you know,
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:50.640]   several atoms or a few atoms.
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:55.640]   And all of a sudden this change has such a major impact.
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:14:01.560]   - So is that a mutation like on a single virus?
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:04.640]   Is that like, so if we talk about those,
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:09.360]   the flap of a butterfly wing, like what's the first flap?
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.960]   - Well, I think this is the mutations
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:17.880]   that made this virus capable of jumping
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.400]   from bat species to human.
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.600]   Of course, there's, you know,
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:24.720]   the scientists are still trying to find,
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:27.080]   I mean, they're still even trying to find
[00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:29.680]   who was the first infected, right?
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:31.280]   The patient zero.
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:32.360]   - The first human.
[00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:34.960]   - The first human infected, right?
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:38.200]   I mean, the fact that there are coronaviruses,
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:40.520]   different strains of coronaviruses
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:43.520]   in various bat species, I mean, we know that.
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:47.400]   So we, you know, virologists observe them,
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:51.720]   they study them, they look at their genomic sequences.
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:54.360]   They're trying, of course, to understand
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:59.360]   what make this viruses to jump from bats to human.
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:04.160]   There was, you know, similar to that,
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:05.880]   and, you know, in influenza,
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.560]   there was, I think a few years ago,
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:12.560]   there was this, you know, interesting story
[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:17.360]   where several groups of scientists
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:21.840]   studying influenza virus, essentially, you know,
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:25.760]   made experiments to show that this virus
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:30.680]   can jump from one species to another, you know,
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:35.160]   by changing, I think, just a couple of residues.
[00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:39.000]   And, of course, it was very controversial.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.600]   I think there was a moratorium on this study for a while,
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.600]   but then the study was released, it was published.
[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:49.920]   - So why was there a moratorium?
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:53.000]   'Cause it shows through engineering it,
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.160]   through modifying it, you can make it jump.
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:58.560]   - Yes, yes.
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:02.720]   I personally think it is important to study this.
[00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:06.000]   I mean, we should be informed,
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.200]   we should try to understand as much as possible
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.440]   in order to prevent it.
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:15.100]   - But, so then, the engineering aspect there is,
[00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:18.440]   can't you then just start searching,
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:21.480]   because there's so many strands of viruses out there,
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:24.320]   can't you just search for the ones in bats
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:29.080]   that are the deadliest from the virologist's perspective,
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:32.160]   and then just try to engineer,
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:37.160]   try to see how to, but see, there's a nice aspect to it.
[00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:41.680]   The really nice thing about engineering viruses,
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:44.240]   it has the same problem as nuclear weapons,
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:49.240]   is it's hard for it to not lead to mutual self-destruction.
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.360]   So you can't control a virus,
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:53.800]   it can't be used as a weapon, right?
[00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:56.240]   - Yeah, that's why, you know, in the beginning I said,
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:17:01.240]   you know, I'm hopeful, because there definitely
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:05.840]   are regulations to be, needed to be introduced.
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:10.840]   And, I mean, as the scientific society is,
[00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:16.040]   we are in charge of, you know, making the right actions,
[00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:18.960]   making the right decisions.
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:24.200]   But I think we will benefit tremendously
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:27.000]   by understanding the mechanisms
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:31.520]   by which the virus can jump,
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:35.960]   by which the virus can become more, you know,
[00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:40.120]   more dangerous to humans,
[00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:45.520]   because all these answers would, you know,
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:48.120]   eventually lead to designing better vaccines,
[00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:50.560]   hopefully universal vaccines, right?
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:55.560]   And that would be a triumph of the, of science.
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:58.600]   - So what's the universal vaccine?
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:02.200]   So is that something that, how universal is universal?
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.920]   - Well, I mean, you know, so--
[00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:04.960]   - What's the dream, I guess,
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:07.040]   'cause you kind of mentioned the dream of this.
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:11.120]   - I would be extremely happy if, you know,
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:14.800]   we designed the vaccine that is able,
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:16.680]   I mean, I'll give you an example, right?
[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:21.520]   So every year we do a seasonal flu shot.
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:24.200]   The reason we do it is because, you know,
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.440]   we are in the arms race, you know,
[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.240]   our vaccines are in the arms race
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:32.400]   with constantly changing virus, right?
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:38.320]   Now, if the next pandemic, influenza pandemic will occur,
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:44.160]   most likely this vaccine would not save us, right?
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:48.320]   Although it's, you know, it's the same virus,
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:50.040]   might be different strain.
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:57.280]   So if we're able to essentially design a vaccine
[00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:01.000]   against, you know, influenza A virus,
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.360]   no matter what's the strain,
[00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:07.360]   no matter which species did it jump from,
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:10.840]   that would be, I think that would be a huge,
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:14.000]   huge progress and advancement.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.160]   - You mentioned smallpox until the '70s
[00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:19.240]   might've been something that you would be worried
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:20.680]   the most about.
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.600]   What about these days?
[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:27.600]   Well, we're sitting here in the middle of a COVID-19 pandemic
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:30.920]   but these days, nevertheless,
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.460]   what is your biggest worry virus-wise?
[00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:36.640]   What are you keeping your eye out on?
[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:40.880]   - It looks like, and you know,
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:43.800]   based on the past several years
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:48.240]   of the new viruses emerging,
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:53.240]   I think we're still dealing with
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:55.400]   different types of influenza.
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:20:00.400]   I mean, it's also the H7N9 avian flu
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:05.320]   that was, that emerged, I think,
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:07.380]   a couple of years ago in China.
[00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:13.360]   I think the mortality rate was incredible.
[00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:17.880]   I mean, it was, you know, I think above 30%,
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:20.400]   you know, so this is huge.
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:25.400]   I mean, luckily for us, this strain was not pandemic.
[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:30.460]   All right, so it was jumping from birds to human
[00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:33.640]   but I don't think it was actually transmittable
[00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:35.200]   between the humans.
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:38.680]   And, you know, this is actually a very interesting question
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:42.620]   which scientists try to understand, right?
[00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:44.620]   So the balance, the delicate balance
[00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:48.240]   between the virus being very contagious, right,
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:51.760]   so efficient in spreading,
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:55.020]   and virus to be very pathogenic,
[00:20:55.020 --> 00:21:01.400]   you know, causing, you know, harms, you know,
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:05.300]   and deaths to their hosts.
[00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:10.300]   So it looks like that the more pathogenic the virus is,
[00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:13.160]   the less contagious it is.
[00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:17.960]   - Is that a property of biology or what is--
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.580]   - I don't have an answer to that.
[00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:22.900]   And I think this is still an open question.
[00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:25.840]   But, you know, if you look at, you know,
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:28.500]   with the coronavirus, for example,
[00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:33.500]   if you look at, you know, the deadlier relative, MERS.
[00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:38.060]   MERS was never a pandemic virus.
[00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:42.280]   - Right. - But the, you know,
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:46.880]   again, the mortality rate from MERS is far above,
[00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:49.760]   you know, I think 20 or 30%, so.
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:55.320]   - So whatever is making this all happen
[00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:59.860]   doesn't want us dead, 'cause it's balancing out nicely.
[00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:03.520]   I mean, how do you explain that we're not dead yet?
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:08.800]   Like, 'cause there's so many viruses
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:11.440]   and they're so good at what they do.
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:13.400]   Why do they keep us alive?
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:18.760]   - I mean, we also have, you know, a lot of protection, right?
[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:21.160]   So we do the immune system.
[00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:26.160]   And so, I mean, we do have, you know,
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:31.680]   ways to fight against those viruses.
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:36.000]   And I think with the, now we're much better equipped, right?
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.880]   So with the discoveries of vaccines and, you know,
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:44.120]   there are vaccines against the viruses
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:49.120]   that maybe 200 years ago would wipe us out completely.
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:53.000]   But because of these vaccines, we are actually,
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.360]   we are capable of eradicating pretty much fully,
[00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:58.840]   as is the case with smallpox.
[00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:02.000]   - So if we could, can we go to the basics a little bit
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.960]   of the biology of the virus?
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:07.180]   How does a virus infect the body?
[00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:11.780]   - So I think there are some key steps
[00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:13.740]   that the virus needs to perform.
[00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:18.540]   And of course, the first one, the viral particle
[00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:22.340]   needs to get attached to the host cell.
[00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:26.300]   In the case of coronavirus, there is a lot of evidence
[00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:29.700]   that it actually interacts in the same way
[00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:34.300]   as the SARS coronavirus.
[00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:39.300]   So it gets attached to AC2 human receptor.
[00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:42.260]   And so there is, I mean, as we speak,
[00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:45.740]   there is a growing number of papers suggesting it.
[00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:51.140]   Moreover, most recent, I think most recent results
[00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:56.140]   suggest that this virus attaches more efficiently
[00:23:56.140 --> 00:24:00.660]   to this human receptor than SARS.
[00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:02.900]   - So just to sort of back off,
[00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:07.020]   so there is a family of viruses, the coronaviruses,
[00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:09.420]   and SARS, whatever the heck, forgot,
[00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:12.760]   this is, whatever that stands for.
[00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:17.260]   - So SARS actually stands for the disease that you get,
[00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:19.460]   is the syndrome of acute respiratory--
[00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:21.020]   - Respiratory syndrome.
[00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:25.180]   So SARS is the first strand, and then there's MERS.
[00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:27.340]   - MERS, and there is-- - Also that family.
[00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:31.380]   - And there is, yes, people, scientists actually know
[00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:32.520]   more than three strands.
[00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:36.300]   I mean, so there is the MHV strain,
[00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:43.540]   which is considered to be a canonical model,
[00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:46.200]   disease model in mice.
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:50.620]   And so there is a lot of work done on this virus
[00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:52.460]   because it's-- - Interesting.
[00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:53.980]   But it hasn't jumped to humans yet?
[00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:55.260]   - No, no, it's-- - Oh, interesting.
[00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:56.700]   - Yes. - That's fascinating.
[00:24:56.700 --> 00:25:01.220]   So, and then you mentioned AC2.
[00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:06.040]   So when you say attach, proteins are involved
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:07.180]   on both sides. - Yes, yes.
[00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:11.540]   So we have this infamous spike protein
[00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:15.260]   on the surface of the virion particle,
[00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:16.880]   and it does look like a spike,
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:20.860]   and I mean, that's essentially because of this protein,
[00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:22.780]   we call the coronavirus coronavirus,
[00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:27.180]   so what makes corona on top of the surface.
[00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:32.640]   So this protein, it actually, it acts,
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:35.940]   so it doesn't act alone, it actually,
[00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:40.940]   it makes three copies, and it makes so-called trimer.
[00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:45.700]   So this trimer is essentially a functional unit,
[00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:50.380]   a single functional unit that starts interacting
[00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:54.740]   with the AC2 receptor.
[00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:56.780]   So this is, again, another protein
[00:25:56.780 --> 00:26:01.100]   that now sits on the surface of a human cell,
[00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:03.100]   or a host cell, I would say,
[00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:08.540]   and that's essentially, in that way,
[00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:13.440]   the virus anchors itself to the host cell,
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:16.900]   because then it needs to actually,
[00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:19.420]   it needs to get inside, you know,
[00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:24.060]   it fuses its membrane with the host membrane,
[00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:27.740]   it releases the key components,
[00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:32.500]   it releases its, you know, RNA,
[00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:37.500]   and then essentially hijacks the machinery of the cell,
[00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:42.900]   because none of the viruses that we know of have ribosome,
[00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:50.860]   the machinery that allows us to print out proteins.
[00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:53.600]   So in order to print out proteins
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:55.940]   that are necessary for functioning of this virus,
[00:26:55.940 --> 00:27:00.340]   it actually needs to hijack the host ribosomes.
[00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:04.380]   - So a virus is an RNA wrapped in a bunch of proteins,
[00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:06.540]   one of which is this functional mechanism
[00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:08.740]   of a spike protein that does the attachment.
[00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:12.340]   - So yeah, so if you look at this virus,
[00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:15.340]   there are several basic components, right?
[00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:18.260]   So we start with the spike protein.
[00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:20.540]   This is not the only surface protein,
[00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:24.340]   the protein that lives on the surface of the viral particle.
[00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:27.340]   There is also perhaps the protein
[00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:33.820]   with the highest number of copies is the membrane protein.
[00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:38.300]   So it's essentially, it forms the capsid,
[00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:43.300]   sorry, the envelope of the protein of the viral particle,
[00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:48.260]   and essentially, you know,
[00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:52.260]   helps to maintain a certain curvature,
[00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:54.700]   helps to make a certain curvature.
[00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:59.660]   Then there is another protein called envelope protein
[00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:04.660]   or E protein, and it actually occurs in far less quantities.
[00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:09.380]   And still there is an ongoing research,
[00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:13.820]   what exactly does this protein do?
[00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:17.340]   So these are sort of the three major surface proteins
[00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:22.220]   that make the viral envelope.
[00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:24.780]   And when we go inside,
[00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:28.060]   then we have another structural protein
[00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:29.780]   called nuclear protein.
[00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:32.260]   And the purpose of this protein
[00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:34.860]   is to protect the viral RNA.
[00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:38.220]   So it actually binds to the viral RNA, creates a capsid.
[00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:43.580]   And so the rest of the viral information
[00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:47.060]   is inside of this RNA.
[00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:52.060]   And, you know, if you compare the amount of the genes
[00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:58.000]   or proteins that are made of these genes,
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.860]   it's significantly higher than of influenza virus,
[00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:05.020]   for example.
[00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:08.740]   Influenza virus has, I think, around eight or nine proteins
[00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:13.180]   where this one has at least 29.
[00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:16.820]   - Wow, that has to do with the length of the RNA strand.
[00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:17.660]   I mean, what--
[00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:21.220]   - So, I mean, so it affects the length of the RNA strand.
[00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:24.940]   Right, so because you essentially need to have
[00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:27.340]   sort of the minimum amount of information
[00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:29.460]   to encode those genes.
[00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:30.780]   - How many proteins did you say?
[00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:31.820]   Say again. - 29.
[00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:34.100]   - 29 proteins.
[00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:36.780]   - Yes, so this is, you know,
[00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:39.420]   something definitely interesting
[00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:42.140]   because, you know, believe it or not,
[00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:45.500]   we've been studying, you know, coronaviruses
[00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:47.340]   for over two decades.
[00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:52.340]   We've yet to uncover all functionalities of its proteins.
[00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:54.520]   - Could we maybe take a small tangent
[00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:59.520]   and can you say how one would try to figure out
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:02.140]   what a function of a particular protein is?
[00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:06.880]   So you've mentioned people are still trying to figure out
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:09.300]   what the function of the envelope protein might be
[00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:11.900]   or what's the process?
[00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:15.300]   - So this is where the research
[00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:19.340]   that computational scientists do might be of help
[00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:24.180]   because, you know, in the past several decades,
[00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:28.940]   we actually have collected pretty decent amount of knowledge
[00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:33.360]   about different proteins in different viruses.
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:37.820]   So what we can actually try to do,
[00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:42.820]   and this is sort of, could be sort of our first lead
[00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:46.960]   to a possible function, is to see whether those,
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:50.660]   you know, say we have this genome of the coronavirus,
[00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:52.900]   of the novel coronavirus,
[00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:57.340]   and we identify the potential proteins.
[00:30:57.340 --> 00:30:58.980]   Then in order to infer the function,
[00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:01.100]   what we can do, we can actually see
[00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:04.340]   whether those proteins are similar
[00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:06.920]   to those ones that we already know.
[00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:08.960]   Okay?
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:11.880]   In such a way, we can, you know, for example,
[00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:15.640]   clearly identify, you know, some critical components
[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:19.520]   that RNA polymerase or different types of proteases.
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:22.000]   These are the proteins that essentially
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.220]   clip the protein sequences.
[00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:31.640]   And so this works in many cases.
[00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:36.520]   However, in some cases, you have truly novel proteins,
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:41.040]   and this is a much more difficult task.
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:45.000]   - Now, as a small pause, when you say similar,
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.800]   like what if some parts are different
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:48.800]   and some parts are similar?
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:51.340]   Like how do you disentangle that?
[00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:53.960]   - You know, it's a big question.
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:57.500]   Of course, you know, what bioinformatics does,
[00:31:57.500 --> 00:32:00.020]   it does predictions, right?
[00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:01.760]   So those predictions,
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:05.560]   they have to be validated by experiments.
[00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:08.160]   - Functional or structural predictions?
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:09.000]   - Both.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.840]   I mean, we do structural predictions,
[00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:12.100]   we do functional predictions,
[00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:14.800]   we do interactions predictions.
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:15.640]   - Oh, so this is interesting.
[00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:18.660]   So you just generate a lot of predictions,
[00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:21.160]   like reasonable predictions based on structure
[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:23.600]   and function, interaction, like you said,
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:25.920]   and then here you go.
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:27.640]   That's the power of bioinformatics
[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:32.640]   is data grounded, good predictions of what should happen.
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:36.080]   - So in a way, I see it,
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:39.360]   we're helping experimental scientists
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:42.120]   to streamline their discovery process.
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:43.200]   - Yeah.
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:45.000]   And the experimental scientists,
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.360]   is that what a virologist is?
[00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:51.240]   - So yeah, virology is one of the experimental sciences
[00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:53.760]   that focus on viruses.
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:58.000]   They often work with other experimental scientists,
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.160]   for example, the molecular imaging scientists, right?
[00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:07.160]   So the viruses often can be viewed
[00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:12.240]   and reconstructed through electron microscopy techniques.
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:14.280]   So, but these are specialists
[00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:17.000]   that are not necessarily virologists.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   They work with small particles,
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:27.200]   whether it's viruses or it's an organelle
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:30.280]   of a human cell,
[00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:33.920]   whether it's a complex molecular machinery.
[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:37.880]   So the techniques that are used are very similar
[00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:42.360]   in sort of in their essence.
[00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:44.320]   And so yeah, so typically,
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:47.320]   and we see it now,
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:52.080]   the research on,
[00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:58.320]   that is emerging and that is needed
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:03.320]   often involves the collaborations between virologists,
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:06.960]   you know, biochemists,
[00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:14.160]   people from pharmaceutical sciences,
[00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:16.240]   computational sciences.
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:19.400]   So we have to work together.
[00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:21.440]   - So from my perspective, just to step back,
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:23.640]   sometimes I look at this stuff,
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:27.400]   just how much we understand about RNA and DNA,
[00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:28.680]   how much we understand about protein,
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:32.280]   like your work, the amount of proteins
[00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:33.800]   that you're exploring,
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:38.000]   is it surprising to you that we were able,
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.600]   we descendants of apes,
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:41.720]   were able to figure all of this out?
[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:46.520]   Like how, so you're a computer scientist.
[00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:49.520]   So for me, from a computer science perspective,
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:52.120]   I know how to write a Python program, things are clear,
[00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:54.480]   but biology is a giant mess,
[00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:58.600]   it feels like to me, from an outsider's perspective.
[00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:01.680]   Is how surprising is it, amazing is it,
[00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:04.600]   that we were able to figure this stuff out?
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:06.440]   - You know, if you look at the,
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:09.480]   you know, how computational science
[00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:12.680]   and computer science was evolving, right?
[00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:14.520]   I think it was just a matter of time
[00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:16.920]   that we would approach biology.
[00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:19.240]   So we started from, you know,
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:23.840]   applications to much more fundamental systems,
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:27.680]   physics, you know, and now we are,
[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:32.520]   or, you know, small chemical compounds, right?
[00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:36.200]   So now we are approaching
[00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:39.760]   the more complex biological systems.
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:43.880]   And I think it's a natural evolution
[00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:48.440]   of, you know, of the computer science, of mathematics.
[00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:50.120]   - So sure, that's the computer science side,
[00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:52.440]   I just meant even in higher levels.
[00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:54.040]   So that to me is surprising,
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:57.520]   that computer science can offer help in this messy world.
[00:35:57.520 --> 00:35:59.360]   But it just means it's incredible
[00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:01.920]   that the biologists and the chemists
[00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:03.120]   can figure all this out.
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:04.640]   Or does that just sound ridiculous to you,
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:07.720]   that of course they would.
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:10.280]   It just seems like a very complicated set of problems,
[00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:13.640]   like the variety of the kinds of things
[00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:16.120]   that could be produced in the body.
[00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:19.240]   Just like you said, 29 pro, I mean,
[00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:24.240]   just getting a hang of it so quickly,
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:27.160]   it just seems impossible to me.
[00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:29.640]   - I agree, I mean, and I have to say,
[00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:32.440]   we are, you know, in the very, very
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:33.760]   beginning of this journey.
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:38.080]   I mean, we've yet to, I mean,
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:39.880]   we've yet to comprehend,
[00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:44.880]   not even try to understand and figure out all the details,
[00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:48.480]   but we've yet to comprehend the complexity
[00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:51.160]   of the cell.
[00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:55.800]   - We know that neuroscience is not even
[00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:58.640]   at the beginning of understanding the human mind.
[00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:04.200]   So where's biology sit in terms of understanding
[00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:07.160]   the function, deeply understanding
[00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:10.280]   the function of viruses and cells?
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:12.800]   So sometimes it's easy to say,
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:14.360]   when you talk about function,
[00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:16.480]   what you really refer to is perhaps
[00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:18.520]   not a deep understanding,
[00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:21.600]   but more of a understanding sufficient
[00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:25.000]   to be able to mess with it using an antiviral,
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.880]   like mess with it chemically
[00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:29.680]   to prevent some of its function.
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:31.400]   Or do you understand the function?
[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:32.720]   - Well, I think-- - Deeply.
[00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:35.680]   - I think we are much farther in terms of understanding
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:40.680]   of the complex genetic disorders, such as cancer,
[00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:42.680]   where you have layers of complexity.
[00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:45.680]   And we, you know, as in my laboratory,
[00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:47.680]   we're trying to contribute to that research,
[00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:50.200]   but we're also, you know, we're overwhelmed
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:53.240]   with how many different layers of complexity,
[00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:56.560]   different layers of mechanisms
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:38:00.200]   that can be hijacked by cancer simultaneously.
[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:06.240]   And so, you know, I think biology in the past 20 years,
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:11.840]   again, from the perspective of the outsider,
[00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:13.560]   'cause I'm not a biologist,
[00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:18.560]   but I think it has advanced tremendously.
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:23.280]   And one thing that where computational scientists
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:28.280]   and data scientists are now becoming very,
[00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:33.920]   very helpful is in the fact,
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:37.280]   it's coming from the fact that we are now able
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:42.280]   to generate a lot of information about the cell.
[00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:48.200]   Whether it's next generation sequencing or transcriptomics,
[00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:51.480]   whether it's life imaging information,
[00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:56.480]   where it is, you know, complex interactions
[00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:59.080]   between proteins or between proteins
[00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:02.080]   and small molecules such as drugs.
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:05.520]   We are becoming very efficient
[00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:07.920]   in generating this information.
[00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:12.280]   And now the next step is to become equally efficient
[00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:16.440]   in processing this information
[00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:19.800]   and extracting the key knowledge from that.
[00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:23.320]   - That could then be validated with experiment.
[00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:24.160]   - Yes. - I'm back.
[00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:25.920]   - Yes. - So maybe then going
[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:27.160]   all the way back, we were talking,
[00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:30.600]   you said the first step is seeing
[00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:34.080]   if we can match the new proteins you found in the virus
[00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:35.480]   against something we've seen before
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:37.600]   to figure out its function.
[00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:39.400]   And then you also mentioned that,
[00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:42.640]   but there could be cases where it's a totally new protein.
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:45.320]   Is there something bioinformatics can offer
[00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:47.120]   when it's a totally new protein?
[00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:50.440]   - This is where many of the methods,
[00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:54.400]   and you're probably aware of the case of machine learning,
[00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:59.400]   many of these methods rely on the previous knowledge.
[00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:00.560]   - Right. - Right?
[00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:05.320]   So things that where we try to do from scratch
[00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:08.360]   are incredibly difficult.
[00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:10.480]   Something that we call ab initio.
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:12.920]   And this is, I mean, it's not just the function.
[00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:16.960]   I mean, we've yet to have a robust method
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:21.160]   to predict the structures of these proteins in ab initio
[00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:27.600]   by not using any templates
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:32.000]   of other related proteins.
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:36.160]   - So protein is a chain of amino acids.
[00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:37.640]   - It's residues.
[00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:39.120]   - Residues, yeah.
[00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:44.720]   And then somehow, magically, maybe you can tell me,
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:47.520]   they seem to fold in incredibly weird
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:49.280]   and complicated 3D shapes.
[00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:50.120]   - Yes.
[00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:57.080]   - And that's where actually the idea of protein folding,
[00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:59.640]   or just not the idea, but the problem of figuring out
[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:00.800]   how the-- - Yeah, the concept.
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:04.680]   - The concept, yeah, how they fold into those weird shapes
[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:05.520]   comes in.
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:09.240]   So that's another side of computational work.
[00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:11.720]   So can you describe what protein folding
[00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:13.680]   from the computational side is?
[00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:16.800]   And maybe your thoughts on the folding at home efforts
[00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:19.800]   that a lot of people know that you can use your machine
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:22.600]   to do protein folding?
[00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:26.800]   - So yeah, protein folding is one of those
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:30.680]   one million dollar price challenges, right?
[00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:35.360]   So the reason for that is we've yet to understand
[00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:40.360]   precisely how the protein gets folded so efficiently,
[00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:47.560]   to the point that in many cases where you try to unfold it
[00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:51.920]   due to the high temperature, it actually folds back
[00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:54.040]   into its original state.
[00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:59.040]   All right, so we know a lot about the mechanisms, right?
[00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:04.320]   But putting those mechanisms together and making sense,
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:11.280]   it's computationally a very expensive task.
[00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:14.240]   - In general, do proteins fold,
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:16.880]   can they fold in arbitrary large number of ways,
[00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:19.360]   or do they usually fold in a very small number of ways?
[00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:23.080]   - No, it's typically, I mean, we tend to think that
[00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:26.880]   there is a one sort of canonical fold for a protein,
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:30.640]   although there are many cases where the proteins,
[00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:32.400]   upon destabilization,
[00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:35.720]   it can be folded into a different conformation.
[00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:40.000]   And this is especially true when you look at
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.360]   sort of proteins that include
[00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:46.160]   more than one structural unit.
[00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:49.240]   So those structural units, we call them protein domains.
[00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:53.720]   Essentially, a protein domain is a single unit
[00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:56.960]   that typically is evolutionarily preserved,
[00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:59.640]   that typically carries out a single function,
[00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:04.640]   and typically has a very distinct fold, right?
[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:07.240]   The structure, 3D structure organization.
[00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:09.760]   But turns out that if you look at human,
[00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:12.640]   an average protein in a human cell
[00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:17.280]   would have a bit of two or three such subunits.
[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:24.360]   And how they are trying to fold into the sort of,
[00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:30.440]   next level fold, right?
[00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:32.680]   - So within subunit, there's folding,
[00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:38.880]   and then they fold into the larger 3D structure, right?
[00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:41.080]   And all of that, there's some understanding
[00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:42.440]   of the basic mechanisms,
[00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:44.960]   but not to put together to be able to fold it.
[00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:47.360]   - We're still, I mean, we're still struggling.
[00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:49.480]   I mean, we're getting pretty good
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:52.920]   about folding relatively small proteins
[00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:55.400]   up to 100 residues.
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:59.240]   I mean, but we're still far away
[00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:02.240]   from folding larger proteins.
[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:06.120]   And some of them are notoriously difficult.
[00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:07.920]   For example, transmembrane proteins,
[00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:12.920]   proteins that sit in the membranes of the cell.
[00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:16.360]   They're incredibly important,
[00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:19.640]   but they are incredibly difficult to solve.
[00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:22.960]   - And so basically, there's a lot of degrees of freedom,
[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:24.360]   how it folds.
[00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:26.120]   And so it's a combinatorial problem,
[00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:27.360]   or it just explodes.
[00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:28.960]   There's so many dimensions.
[00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:31.280]   - Well, it is a combinatorial problem,
[00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:34.240]   but it doesn't mean that we cannot approach it
[00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:39.240]   from the non-con, not from the brute force approach.
[00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:43.840]   And so the machine learning approaches,
[00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:47.440]   you know, have been emerged that try to tackle it.
[00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:49.800]   - So folding at home,
[00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:51.560]   I don't know how familiar you are with it,
[00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:54.000]   but is that using machine learning,
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.120]   or is it more brute force?
[00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:57.400]   - No, so folding at home, it was originally,
[00:44:57.400 --> 00:45:01.000]   and I remember, I was, I mean, it was long time ago.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:05.520]   I was a postdoc, and we learned about this,
[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:07.360]   you know, this game,
[00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:10.960]   'cause it was originally designed as the game.
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:15.200]   And we, you know, I took a look at it,
[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:18.960]   and it's interesting because it's really,
[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:22.520]   you know, it's very transparent, very intuitive.
[00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:25.280]   So, and from what I heard,
[00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:27.440]   I've yet to introduce it to my son,
[00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:30.440]   but, you know, kids are actually getting very good
[00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:33.120]   at folding the proteins.
[00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:38.120]   And it, you know, it came to me as the,
[00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:44.560]   not as a surprise, but actually as the sort of manifest
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:49.560]   of, you know, our capacity to do this kind of,
[00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:52.680]   to solve this kind of problems,
[00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:57.680]   when a paper was published in one of these top journals
[00:45:57.680 --> 00:46:06.680]   with the co-authors being the actual players of this game.
[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:12.480]   So, and what happened is, was that they managed
[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:17.080]   to get better structures than the scientists themselves.
[00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:23.660]   So, so that, you know, that was very, I mean,
[00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:28.680]   it was kind of profound, you know, revelation that problems
[00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:34.440]   that are so challenging for a computational science,
[00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:38.200]   maybe not that challenging for a human brain.
[00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:40.360]   - Well, that's a really good,
[00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:42.000]   that's a hopeful message always,
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   when there's the proof of existence,
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:51.360]   the existence proof that it's possible.
[00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:52.440]   That's really interesting.
[00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:56.000]   But it seems, what are the best ways
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.280]   to do protein folding now?
[00:46:58.280 --> 00:47:02.760]   So, if you look at what DeepMind does with AlphaFold.
[00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:03.960]   - AlphaFold, yes.
[00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:06.600]   - So, they kind of, that's a learning approach.
[00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:07.920]   What's your sense?
[00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:10.120]   I mean, your background is in machine learning,
[00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:13.040]   but is this a learnable problem?
[00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:14.440]   Is this still a brute force?
[00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:19.280]   Are we in the Garry Kasparov, Deep Blue days?
[00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:23.160]   Or are we in the AlphaGo playing the game of Go days
[00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:24.520]   of folding?
[00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:28.920]   - Well, I think we are advancing towards this direction.
[00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:32.480]   I mean, if you look, so there is sort of Olympic game
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:35.680]   for protein folders called CASP.
[00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:39.520]   And it's essentially, it's a competition
[00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:43.920]   where different teams are given exactly
[00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:47.400]   the same protein sequences,
[00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:49.800]   and they try to predict their structures.
[00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:55.640]   And of course, there is different sort of subtasks,
[00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:58.400]   but in the recent competition,
[00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:02.000]   AlphaFold was among the top performing teams,
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   if not the top performing team.
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   So, there is definitely a benefit from the data
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:15.520]   that have been generated in the past several decades,
[00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:17.240]   the structural data.
[00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:22.240]   And certainly, we are now at the capacity
[00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:28.280]   to summarize this data, to generalize this data,
[00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:30.160]   and to use those principles,
[00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:34.160]   in order to predict protein structures.
[00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:36.320]   - That's one of the really cool things here is,
[00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:38.600]   there's, maybe you can comment on it.
[00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:42.640]   There seems to be these open datasets of protein.
[00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:43.480]   How did that?
[00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:45.920]   - Protein data bank?
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:48.320]   - The protein data bank?
[00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:49.560]   I mean, that's crazy.
[00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:52.440]   Is this a recent thing for just the coronavirus?
[00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:53.360]   Or is this been a--
[00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:56.240]   - It's been for many, many years.
[00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:59.200]   I believe the first protein data bank
[00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:01.720]   was designed on flashcards.
[00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:07.840]   So, yes, it's this,
[00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:13.120]   I mean, this is a great example of the community efforts
[00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:16.520]   of everyone contributing.
[00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:20.400]   'Cause every time you solve a protein
[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:24.160]   or a protein complex, this is where you submit it.
[00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:30.400]   And the scientists get access to it,
[00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:33.920]   scientists get to test it.
[00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:38.920]   And we, bioinformaticians, use this information
[00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:42.720]   to make predictions.
[00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:47.720]   - So there's no culture of like hoarding discoveries here.
[00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:52.920]   So that's, I mean, you've released a few,
[00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:55.240]   or a bunch of proteins that were matching
[00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:57.360]   whatever, we'll talk about details a little bit.
[00:49:57.360 --> 00:50:02.000]   But it's kind of amazing that that's,
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:07.320]   it's kind of amazing how open the culture here is.
[00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:08.200]   - It is.
[00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:13.080]   And I think this pandemic actually demonstrated
[00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:17.880]   the ability of scientific community
[00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:23.840]   to solve this challenge collaboratively.
[00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:25.960]   And this is, I think, if anything,
[00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:30.960]   it actually moved us to a brand new level
[00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:34.900]   of collaborations of the efficiency
[00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:37.960]   in which people establish new collaborations,
[00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:42.760]   in which people offer their help to each other.
[00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:44.720]   Scientists offer their help to each other.
[00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:45.880]   - And publish results, too.
[00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:47.120]   It's very interesting. - Exactly.
[00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:49.040]   - We're now trying to figure out,
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:50.520]   there's a few journals that are trying
[00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:54.260]   to sort of do the very accelerated review cycle,
[00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:58.560]   but so many preprints, so just posting a paper, going out,
[00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:00.600]   I think it's fundamentally changing
[00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:04.040]   the way we think about papers.
[00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:05.040]   - Yes.
[00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:08.600]   I mean, the way we think about knowledge, I would say.
[00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:09.740]   - Knowledge. - Yes.
[00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:12.440]   Because, yes, I completely agree.
[00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:16.200]   I think now it's,
[00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:21.600]   the knowledge is becoming sort of the core value,
[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:24.800]   not the paper or the journal
[00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:27.480]   where this knowledge is published.
[00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:30.400]   And I think this is, again, we are living
[00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:35.400]   in the times where it becomes really crystallized,
[00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:41.640]   that the idea that the most important value
[00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:43.720]   is in the knowledge.
[00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:45.080]   - So maybe you can comment,
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:46.520]   what do you think the future
[00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:47.980]   of that knowledge sharing looks like?
[00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:49.840]   So you have this paper that we'll,
[00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:52.480]   I hope we get a chance to talk about a little bit,
[00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:54.560]   but it has a really nice abstract
[00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:56.440]   and introduction and related,
[00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:58.200]   it has all the usual, I mean,
[00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:00.600]   probably took a long time to put together.
[00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:02.880]   (laughs)
[00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:05.600]   But is that going to remain,
[00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:08.160]   you could have communicated a lot
[00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:11.420]   of fundamental ideas here in a much shorter amount
[00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:16.020]   that's less traditionally acceptable by the journal context?
[00:52:16.020 --> 00:52:21.940]   - So, well, so the first version that we posted,
[00:52:21.940 --> 00:52:25.180]   not even on the bio-archive,
[00:52:25.180 --> 00:52:27.580]   because bio-archive back then,
[00:52:27.580 --> 00:52:32.500]   it was essentially overwhelmed
[00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:34.260]   with the number of submissions.
[00:52:34.260 --> 00:52:38.820]   So our submission, I think it took five or six days
[00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:43.820]   just for it to be screened and put online.
[00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:49.020]   So we, essentially we put the first pre-print on our website
[00:52:49.020 --> 00:52:55.580]   and it started getting accessed right away.
[00:52:55.580 --> 00:53:02.300]   So, and this original pre-print was
[00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:05.780]   in a much rougher shape than this paper.
[00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:11.420]   But we tried, I mean, we honestly tried
[00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:13.940]   to be as compact as possible
[00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:20.060]   with introducing the information that is necessary
[00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:26.060]   to explain our results.
[00:53:26.060 --> 00:53:29.580]   - So maybe we can dive right in if it's okay.
[00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:30.420]   - Sure.
[00:53:30.420 --> 00:53:34.420]   - So this is a paper called Structural Genomics of SARS-CoV-2.
[00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:35.820]   How do you even pronounce?
[00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:37.020]   - SARS-CoV-2.
[00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:37.980]   - Co-vee-too?
[00:53:37.980 --> 00:53:39.140]   - Yeah.
[00:53:39.140 --> 00:53:42.580]   - By the way, COVID is such a terrible name, but it stuck.
[00:53:42.580 --> 00:53:43.580]   - Yes.
[00:53:43.580 --> 00:53:46.540]   - SARS-CoV-2 indicates evolutionary
[00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:50.380]   conserved functional regions of viral proteins.
[00:53:50.380 --> 00:53:53.380]   So this is looking at all kinds of proteins
[00:53:53.380 --> 00:53:57.700]   that are part of this novel coronavirus
[00:53:57.700 --> 00:54:00.540]   and how they match up against the previous
[00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:02.580]   other kinds of coronaviruses.
[00:54:02.580 --> 00:54:04.220]   I mean, there's a lot of beautiful figures.
[00:54:04.220 --> 00:54:06.060]   I was wondering if you could,
[00:54:06.060 --> 00:54:07.660]   I mean, there's so many questions I could ask here,
[00:54:07.660 --> 00:54:11.940]   but maybe at the, how do you get started doing this paper?
[00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:13.340]   So how do you start to figure out
[00:54:13.340 --> 00:54:16.340]   the 3D structure of a novel virus?
[00:54:16.340 --> 00:54:20.740]   - Yes, so there is actually a little story behind it.
[00:54:20.740 --> 00:54:25.740]   And so the story actually dated back in September of 2019.
[00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:31.060]   And you probably remember that back then
[00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:34.780]   we had another dangerous virus, triple E virus,
[00:54:35.820 --> 00:54:39.460]   Eastern equine encephalitis virus.
[00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:40.820]   And--
[00:54:40.820 --> 00:54:41.860]   - Can you maybe linger on it?
[00:54:41.860 --> 00:54:45.980]   I have to admit I was sadly completely unaware.
[00:54:45.980 --> 00:54:49.900]   - So that was actually a virus outbreak
[00:54:49.900 --> 00:54:52.820]   that happened in New England only.
[00:54:52.820 --> 00:54:56.180]   The danger in this virus was that it actually,
[00:54:56.180 --> 00:54:58.620]   it targeted your brain.
[00:54:58.620 --> 00:55:03.120]   So the word death from this virus,
[00:55:04.620 --> 00:55:09.620]   it was, the main vector was mosquitoes.
[00:55:09.620 --> 00:55:15.940]   And obviously fall time is the time
[00:55:15.940 --> 00:55:19.660]   where you have a lot of them in New England.
[00:55:19.660 --> 00:55:24.500]   And on one hand, people realize
[00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:27.060]   this is actually a very dangerous thing.
[00:55:27.060 --> 00:55:31.980]   So it had an impact on the local economy.
[00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:37.700]   The schools were closed past six o'clock.
[00:55:37.700 --> 00:55:39.620]   No activities outside for the kids
[00:55:39.620 --> 00:55:44.100]   because the kids were suffering quite tremendously
[00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:48.540]   from when infected from this virus.
[00:55:48.540 --> 00:55:50.100]   - How do I not know about this?
[00:55:50.100 --> 00:55:52.220]   Was the universities impacted?
[00:55:52.220 --> 00:55:53.500]   - It was in the news.
[00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:57.980]   I mean, it was not impacted to a high degree
[00:55:57.980 --> 00:56:02.820]   in Boston necessarily, but in the Metro West area.
[00:56:02.820 --> 00:56:05.260]   And actually spread around, I think,
[00:56:05.260 --> 00:56:09.340]   all the way to New Hampshire, Connecticut.
[00:56:09.340 --> 00:56:11.060]   - And you mentioned affecting the brain.
[00:56:11.060 --> 00:56:13.620]   That's one other comment we should make.
[00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:18.200]   So you mentioned AC2 for the coronavirus.
[00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:23.200]   So these viruses kind of attach to something in the body.
[00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:27.460]   - So it essentially attaches to these proteins
[00:56:27.460 --> 00:56:30.820]   in those cells in the body
[00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:32.420]   where those proteins are expressed,
[00:56:32.420 --> 00:56:35.820]   where they actually have them in abundance.
[00:56:35.820 --> 00:56:37.620]   - So sometimes that could be in the lungs,
[00:56:37.620 --> 00:56:39.540]   that could be in the brain, that could be--
[00:56:39.540 --> 00:56:43.780]   - So I think what they, right now,
[00:56:43.780 --> 00:56:48.780]   from what I read, they have the epithelial cells inside.
[00:56:48.780 --> 00:56:53.340]   So the cells essentially inside the,
[00:56:53.340 --> 00:56:58.300]   cells that are covering the surface.
[00:56:58.300 --> 00:57:03.300]   So inside the nasal surfaces, the throat,
[00:57:03.300 --> 00:57:08.820]   the lung cells, and I believe liver,
[00:57:08.820 --> 00:57:10.100]   a couple of other organs
[00:57:10.100 --> 00:57:13.660]   where they are actually expressed in abundance.
[00:57:13.660 --> 00:57:15.260]   - That's for the AC2, you said?
[00:57:15.260 --> 00:57:17.140]   - For the AC2 receptors.
[00:57:17.140 --> 00:57:19.060]   - So okay, so back to the story.
[00:57:19.060 --> 00:57:20.700]   - So yes. - In the fall.
[00:57:20.700 --> 00:57:24.860]   - So now the, these, you know,
[00:57:24.860 --> 00:57:29.540]   the impact of this virus is significant.
[00:57:29.540 --> 00:57:33.460]   However, it's a pre-local problem
[00:57:33.460 --> 00:57:35.460]   to the point that, you know,
[00:57:35.460 --> 00:57:39.340]   this is something that we would call a neglected disease
[00:57:39.340 --> 00:57:44.340]   because it's not big enough to make, you know,
[00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:49.820]   the drug design companies to design a new antiviral
[00:57:49.820 --> 00:57:53.100]   or a new vaccine.
[00:57:53.100 --> 00:57:58.100]   It's not big enough to generate a lot of grants
[00:57:58.100 --> 00:58:04.700]   from the national funding agencies.
[00:58:04.700 --> 00:58:09.500]   So does it mean we cannot do anything about it?
[00:58:09.500 --> 00:58:14.500]   And so what I did is I taught a bioinformatics class
[00:58:14.500 --> 00:58:19.100]   and in Worcester Polytechnic Institute,
[00:58:19.100 --> 00:58:24.100]   and we are very much a problem learning institution.
[00:58:24.100 --> 00:58:30.200]   So I thought that that would be a perfect, you know,
[00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:32.100]   perfect project for the class.
[00:58:32.100 --> 00:58:33.540]   - It's an ongoing case study.
[00:58:33.540 --> 00:58:37.460]   - So I asked, you know, so I,
[00:58:37.460 --> 00:58:40.100]   we essentially designed a study
[00:58:40.100 --> 00:58:42.100]   where we tried to use bioinformatics
[00:58:42.100 --> 00:58:47.100]   to understand as much as possible about this virus.
[00:58:47.980 --> 00:58:51.660]   And a very substantial portion of the study
[00:58:51.660 --> 00:58:55.740]   was to understand the structures of the proteins,
[00:58:55.740 --> 00:58:59.980]   to understand how they interact with each other
[00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:03.820]   and with the host proteins,
[00:59:03.820 --> 00:59:08.580]   try to understand the evolution of this virus.
[00:59:08.580 --> 00:59:11.460]   It's obviously, you know, a very important question,
[00:59:11.460 --> 00:59:14.680]   how, where it will evolve further,
[00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:19.680]   how, you know, how it happened here, you know.
[00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:25.360]   So we did all this, you know, projects,
[00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:28.360]   and now I'm trying to put them into a paper
[00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:31.260]   where all these undergraduate students will be co-authors.
[00:59:31.260 --> 00:59:36.320]   But essentially the projects were finished
[00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:38.240]   right about mid-December.
[00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:42.960]   And a couple of weeks later,
[00:59:42.960 --> 00:59:46.440]   I heard about this mysterious new virus
[00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:48.240]   that was discovered in, you know,
[00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:51.280]   was reported in Wuhan province.
[00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:55.880]   And immediately I thought that, well, we just did that.
[00:59:55.880 --> 01:00:00.880]   Can't we do the same thing with this virus?
[01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:04.640]   And so we started waiting for the genome to be released
[01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:07.680]   because that's essentially the first piece of information
[01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:09.220]   that is critical.
[01:00:09.220 --> 01:00:10.880]   Once you have the genome sequence,
[01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:13.880]   you can start doing a lot using bioinformatics.
[01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:15.200]   - When you say genome sequence,
[01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:18.640]   that's referring to the sequence of letters
[01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:20.760]   that make up the RNA?
[01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:23.760]   - So, well, the sequence that make up
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:28.760]   the entire information encoded in the protein, right?
[01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:33.140]   So that includes all 29 genes.
[01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:36.200]   - What are genes?
[01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:39.040]   What's the encoding of information?
[01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:42.520]   - So genes is essentially is a basic functional unit
[01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:47.120]   that we can consider.
[01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:52.120]   So each gene in the virus would correspond to a protein.
[01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:56.920]   So gene by itself doesn't do its function.
[01:00:56.920 --> 01:01:01.840]   It needs to be converted or translated into the protein
[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:07.440]   that will become the actual functional unit.
[01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:10.040]   - Yeah, like you said, the printer.
[01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:11.600]   - So we need the printer for that.
[01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:12.480]   - We need the printer, okay.
[01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:16.940]   So the first step is to figure out the genome,
[01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:20.320]   the sequence of things that will be then used
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:21.760]   for printing the protein.
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:23.360]   So, okay.
[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:27.440]   - So then the next step, so once we have this,
[01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:31.640]   and so we use the existing information about SARS
[01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:35.440]   'cause the SARS genomics has been done
[01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:38.200]   in abundance.
[01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:41.120]   So we have different strains of SARS
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:45.120]   and actually other related coronaviruses, MERS,
[01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:47.980]   the bat coronavirus.
[01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:54.520]   And we started by identifying the potential genes
[01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:57.000]   'cause right now it's just a sequence, right?
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.900]   So it's a sequence that is roughly,
[01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:04.900]   it's less than 30,000 nucleotide long.
[01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:06.680]   - Just a raw sequence.
[01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:07.520]   - It's a raw sequence.
[01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:09.160]   - No other information really.
[01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:14.160]   - And we now need to define the boundaries of the genes
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:20.800]   that would then be used to identify the proteins
[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:22.480]   and protein structures.
[01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:23.960]   - How hard is that problem?
[01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:27.760]   - It's not, I mean, it's pretty straightforward.
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:32.040]   So, 'cause we use the existing information
[01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:35.720]   about SARS proteins and SARS genes.
[01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:37.740]   - So once again, you kinda--
[01:02:37.740 --> 01:02:40.360]   - We are relying on the, yes.
[01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:45.360]   So, and then once we get there,
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:50.800]   this is where sort of the first more traditional
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:54.480]   bioinformatics steps, step begins.
[01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:57.000]   We're trying to use this protein sequences
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:02.000]   and get the 3D information about those proteins.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:08.000]   So this is where we are relying heavily
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.400]   on the structure information,
[01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:14.440]   specifically from the protein data bank
[01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:15.960]   that we were talking about.
[01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:18.640]   - And here you're looking for similar proteins.
[01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:23.160]   - Yes, so the concept that we are operating
[01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:25.200]   when we do this kind of modeling,
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:28.380]   it's called homology or template-based modeling.
[01:03:28.380 --> 01:03:31.620]   So essentially, using the concept that
[01:03:31.620 --> 01:03:37.160]   if you have two sequences that are similar
[01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:38.620]   in terms of the letters,
[01:03:38.620 --> 01:03:41.840]   the structures of the sequences
[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:43.780]   are expected to be similar as well.
[01:03:43.780 --> 01:03:48.540]   - And this is at the micro, at the very local scale and--
[01:03:48.540 --> 01:03:50.420]   - At the scale of the whole protein.
[01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:51.460]   - At the whole protein.
[01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:53.420]   - Right, so actually, so, you know,
[01:03:53.420 --> 01:03:58.060]   of course the devil is in the details
[01:03:58.060 --> 01:04:00.500]   and this is why we need actually
[01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:08.300]   pretty sophisticated modeling tools to do so.
[01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:16.620]   Once we get the structures of the individual proteins,
[01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:21.820]   we try to see whether or not these proteins act alone
[01:04:23.980 --> 01:04:28.940]   or they have to be forming protein complexes
[01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:31.580]   in order to perform this function.
[01:04:31.580 --> 01:04:34.980]   And again, so this is sort of the next level of the modeling
[01:04:34.980 --> 01:04:39.660]   because now you need to understand how proteins interact.
[01:04:39.660 --> 01:04:44.120]   And it could be the case that the protein interacts
[01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:49.120]   with itself and makes sort of a multimeric complex.
[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:54.360]   The same protein just repeated multiple times
[01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:59.360]   and we have quite a few such proteins in SARS-CoV-2,
[01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:07.880]   specifically spike protein needs three copies to function.
[01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:14.640]   Envelope protein needs five copies to function.
[01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:18.400]   And there are some other multimeric complexes.
[01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:20.640]   - That's what you mean by interacting with itself
[01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:22.200]   and you see multiple copies.
[01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:25.120]   So how do you make a good guess
[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:27.160]   whether something's going to interact?
[01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:29.460]   - Well, again, so there are two approaches, right?
[01:05:29.460 --> 01:05:34.460]   So one is look at the previously solved complexes.
[01:05:34.460 --> 01:05:36.920]   Now we're looking not at the individual structures
[01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:40.060]   but the structures of the whole complex.
[01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:43.480]   - Complex is a bunch, multiple proteins.
[01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:45.600]   - Yeah, so it's a bunch of proteins
[01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:47.280]   essentially glued together.
[01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:49.800]   - And when you say glued, that's the interaction.
[01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:51.160]   - That's the interaction.
[01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:53.160]   So there are different forces,
[01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:57.760]   different sort of physical forces behind this.
[01:05:57.760 --> 01:05:59.680]   - Sorry to keep asking dumb questions,
[01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:04.680]   but is it the interaction fundamentally structural
[01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:07.080]   or is it functional?
[01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:10.560]   Like in the way you're thinking about it.
[01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:14.600]   - That's actually a very good way to ask this question
[01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:19.560]   because it turns out that the interaction is structural
[01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:24.160]   but in the way it forms the structure,
[01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:26.360]   it actually also carries out the function.
[01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:30.680]   So interaction is often needed
[01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:34.540]   to carry out very specific function of a protein.
[01:06:34.540 --> 01:06:38.080]   - But in terms of on the rotor side,
[01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:41.760]   figuring out you're really starting at the structure
[01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:44.020]   before you figure out the function.
[01:06:44.020 --> 01:06:48.600]   So there's a beautiful figure two in the paper
[01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:51.000]   of all the different proteins that make up,
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.200]   that you're able to figure out that make up
[01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:58.920]   the new, the novel coronavirus.
[01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:02.080]   What are we looking at?
[01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:03.440]   So these are like,
[01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:08.560]   that's through the step two that you mentioned
[01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:12.200]   when you try to guess at the possible proteins,
[01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:16.660]   that's what you're going to get is these blue cyan blobs.
[01:07:16.660 --> 01:07:20.440]   - Yes, so those are the individual proteins
[01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:25.280]   for which we have at least some information
[01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:26.860]   from the previous studies.
[01:07:26.860 --> 01:07:30.760]   So there is advantage and disadvantage
[01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:31.880]   of using previous studies.
[01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:35.680]   The biggest, well, the disadvantage is that,
[01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:40.680]   we may not necessarily have the coverage of all 29 proteins.
[01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:45.280]   However, the biggest advantage is that the accuracy
[01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:48.480]   in which we can model these proteins is very high,
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:51.920]   much higher compared to ab initio methods
[01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:55.060]   that do not use any template information.
[01:07:55.060 --> 01:07:59.880]   - So, but nevertheless, this figure also has,
[01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:01.760]   I mean, it's such a beautiful,
[01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:04.060]   and I love these pictures so much.
[01:08:04.060 --> 01:08:07.400]   It has like the pink parts,
[01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:10.360]   which are the parts that are different.
[01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:12.040]   So you're highlighting,
[01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:15.400]   so the difference you find is on the 2D sequence,
[01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:17.480]   and then you try to infer what that will look like
[01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:18.520]   on the 3D.
[01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:23.000]   - Yeah, so the difference actually is on 1D sequence.
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:24.760]   - 1D, sorry, not 2D, right.
[01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:29.040]   - So, and so this is one of this first questions
[01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:32.760]   that we try to answer is that,
[01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:35.560]   well, if you take this new virus
[01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:39.160]   and you take the closest relatives,
[01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:44.160]   which are SARS and a couple of bad coronavirus strains,
[01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:49.740]   they are already the closest relatives
[01:08:49.740 --> 01:08:51.760]   that we are aware of.
[01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:56.000]   Now, what are the difference between this virus
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.360]   and its closest relatives, right?
[01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:03.160]   And if you look, typically when you take a sequence,
[01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:08.160]   those differences could be quite far away from each other.
[01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:13.240]   So what make, what 3D structure makes those difference
[01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:18.360]   to do, they very often, they tend to cluster together.
[01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:19.440]   - Interesting.
[01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:21.080]   - And over sudden, the differences
[01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:24.500]   that may look completely unrelated,
[01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:28.080]   actually relate to each other.
[01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:32.200]   And sometimes they are there because they correspond,
[01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:36.400]   they attack the functional side, right?
[01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:40.680]   So they are there because this is the functional side
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:43.720]   that is highly mutated.
[01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:47.480]   - So that's a computational approach
[01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:48.720]   to figuring something out.
[01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:51.220]   And when it comes together like that,
[01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:53.480]   that's kind of a nice clean indication
[01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:56.080]   that there's something, this could be actually indicative
[01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:58.720]   of what's happening.
[01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:01.360]   - Yes, I mean, so we need this information
[01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:06.360]   and the 3D structure gives us a lot of information
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:11.400]   and gives us just a very intuitive way
[01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:16.400]   to look at this information and then start to ask,
[01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:19.360]   start asking questions such as,
[01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:23.200]   so this place of this protein that is highly mutated,
[01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:29.400]   does it, is it the functional part of the protein?
[01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:36.960]   So does this part of the protein interact
[01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:41.080]   with some other proteins or maybe with some other ligands,
[01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:43.320]   small molecules, right?
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:47.400]   So we will try now to functionally inform
[01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:50.000]   this 3D structure.
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:55.240]   - So you have a bunch of these mutated parts,
[01:10:55.240 --> 01:11:00.240]   if like, I don't know, like how many are there
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:03.840]   in the new novel coronavirus when you compare it to SARS?
[01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:06.120]   We're talking about hundreds, thousands,
[01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:08.240]   like these pink regions.
[01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:10.880]   - No, no, much less than that.
[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:13.840]   And it's very interesting that if you look at that,
[01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:16.840]   so the first thing that you start seeing,
[01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:18.640]   you look at patterns, right?
[01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:22.960]   And the first pattern that becomes obvious
[01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:27.960]   is that some of the proteins in the new coronavirus
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:31.640]   are pretty much intact, right?
[01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:35.640]   So they're pretty much exactly the same as SARS,
[01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:38.560]   as the bat coronavirus,
[01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:43.360]   whereas some others are heavily mutated, right?
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:47.880]   So it looks like that the evolution
[01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:54.400]   is not occurring uniformly across the entire viral genome,
[01:11:57.800 --> 01:12:02.240]   but actually target very specific proteins.
[01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:03.560]   - And what do you do with that,
[01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:05.640]   like from the Sherlock Holmes perspective?
[01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:10.640]   - Well, you know, so one of the most interesting findings
[01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:18.280]   we had was the fact that the viral,
[01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:25.040]   so the binding sites on the viral surfaces
[01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:30.040]   that get targeted by the known small molecules,
[01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:34.840]   they were pretty much not affected at all.
[01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:39.840]   And so that means that the same small drugs
[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:45.400]   or small drug-like compounds can be efficient
[01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:51.000]   for the new coronavirus.
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:55.000]   - Ah, so this all actually maps to the drug compounds too,
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.960]   like so you're actually mapping out
[01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:02.600]   what old stuff is gonna work on this thing,
[01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:05.480]   and then possibilities for new stuff to work
[01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:07.840]   by mapping out the things that have mutated.
[01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:10.320]   - Yes, so we essentially know
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:13.560]   which parts behave differently
[01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:18.200]   and which parts are likely to behave similar.
[01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:22.240]   And again, of course, all our predictions
[01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:25.840]   need to be validated by experiments,
[01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:30.520]   but hopefully that sort of helps us to delineate
[01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:35.520]   the regions of this virus that can be promising
[01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:39.200]   in terms of the drug discovery.
[01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:41.440]   - You kind of mentioned this already,
[01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:43.140]   but maybe you can elaborate.
[01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:45.720]   So how different from the structural
[01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:49.680]   and functional perspective does the new coronavirus
[01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:51.620]   appear to be relative to SARS?
[01:13:52.300 --> 01:13:56.060]   - We now are trying to understand
[01:13:56.060 --> 01:13:59.940]   the overall structural characteristics of this virus,
[01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:02.340]   because that's our next step,
[01:14:02.340 --> 01:14:05.820]   trying to model the viral particle
[01:14:05.820 --> 01:14:09.220]   of a single viral particle of this virus.
[01:14:09.220 --> 01:14:12.740]   - So that means you have the individual proteins,
[01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:14.060]   like you said, you have to figure out
[01:14:14.060 --> 01:14:15.500]   what their interaction is.
[01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:20.020]   Is that where this graph kind of interactome--
[01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:25.020]   - So the interactome is essentially a,
[01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:29.060]   so our prediction on the potential interactions,
[01:14:29.060 --> 01:14:31.740]   some of them that we already deciphered
[01:14:31.740 --> 01:14:33.540]   from the structural knowledge,
[01:14:33.540 --> 01:14:35.500]   but some of them that are essentially
[01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:38.220]   are deciphered from the knowledge
[01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:40.460]   of the existing interactions
[01:14:40.460 --> 01:14:45.180]   that people previously obtained for SARS,
[01:14:45.180 --> 01:14:49.740]   for MERS, or other related viruses.
[01:14:49.740 --> 01:14:53.100]   - Is there kind of interactomes,
[01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:54.300]   am I pronouncing that correctly, by the way?
[01:14:54.300 --> 01:14:55.220]   - Yeah, interactome.
[01:14:55.220 --> 01:15:00.220]   - Yeah, are those already converged towards for SARS?
[01:15:00.220 --> 01:15:07.220]   - So I think there are a couple of papers
[01:15:07.220 --> 01:15:12.340]   that now investigate the sort of the large-scale
[01:15:14.940 --> 01:15:19.940]   set of interactions between the new SARS and its host.
[01:15:19.940 --> 01:15:26.140]   And so I think that's an ongoing study, I think--
[01:15:26.140 --> 01:15:27.300]   - And the success of that,
[01:15:27.300 --> 01:15:29.220]   the result would be an interactome.
[01:15:29.220 --> 01:15:30.700]   - Yes.
[01:15:30.700 --> 01:15:32.740]   - And so when you say,
[01:15:32.740 --> 01:15:36.980]   not trying to figure out the entire particle,
[01:15:36.980 --> 01:15:38.420]   the entire thing-- - The particle, right?
[01:15:38.420 --> 01:15:40.260]   So if you look, so structure, right?
[01:15:40.260 --> 01:15:43.900]   So what this viral particle looks like, right?
[01:15:43.900 --> 01:15:48.900]   So as I said, the surface of it is an envelope,
[01:15:48.900 --> 01:15:52.780]   which is essentially a so-called lipid bilayer
[01:15:52.780 --> 01:15:59.100]   with proteins integrated into the surface.
[01:15:59.100 --> 01:16:04.340]   So an average particle is around 80 nanometers, right?
[01:16:09.780 --> 01:16:14.780]   So this particle can have about 50 to 100 spike proteins.
[01:16:14.780 --> 01:16:22.980]   So at least we suspect it,
[01:16:22.980 --> 01:16:26.480]   and based on the micrographs images,
[01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:31.480]   it's very comparable to MHV virus in mice and SARS virus.
[01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:35.460]   - Micrographs are actual pictures of the actual--
[01:16:35.460 --> 01:16:36.300]   - Virus.
[01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:38.500]   - Okay, so these are models, this is actual--
[01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:40.620]   - This is the actual images, right?
[01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:42.340]   - What are they, sorry for the tangents,
[01:16:42.340 --> 01:16:43.900]   but what are these things?
[01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:46.120]   So when you look on the internet,
[01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:48.100]   the models and the pictures are,
[01:16:48.100 --> 01:16:50.220]   and the models you have here
[01:16:50.220 --> 01:16:52.460]   are just gorgeous and beautiful.
[01:16:52.460 --> 01:16:54.020]   When you actually take pictures of them
[01:16:54.020 --> 01:16:56.200]   with a micrograph, like what do we look?
[01:16:56.200 --> 01:17:00.100]   - Well, they typically are not perfect, right?
[01:17:00.100 --> 01:17:03.900]   So most of the images that you see now
[01:17:03.900 --> 01:17:08.900]   is the sphere with those spikes.
[01:17:08.900 --> 01:17:10.580]   - You actually see the spikes?
[01:17:10.580 --> 01:17:12.660]   - Yes, you do see the spikes.
[01:17:12.660 --> 01:17:17.660]   And now, our collaborators for Texas A&M University,
[01:17:17.660 --> 01:17:25.340]   Benjamin Newman, he actually,
[01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:27.800]   in the recent paper about SARS, he proposed,
[01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:32.080]   and there's some actually evidence behind it,
[01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:34.820]   that the particle is not a sphere,
[01:17:34.820 --> 01:17:39.820]   but is actually is an elongated ellipsoid-like particle.
[01:17:39.820 --> 01:17:47.260]   So that's what we are trying to incorporate into our model.
[01:17:47.260 --> 01:17:54.660]   And I mean, if you look at the actual micrographs,
[01:17:54.660 --> 01:18:01.460]   you see that those particles are not symmetric,
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:05.520]   so some of them, and of course,
[01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:10.360]   it could be due to the treatment of the material,
[01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:14.880]   it could be due to some noise in the imaging.
[01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:16.800]   - Right, so there's a lot of uncertainty in all this.
[01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:20.800]   So it's okay, so structurally figuring out the entire part.
[01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:22.860]   By the way, again, sorry for the tangents,
[01:18:22.860 --> 01:18:26.560]   but why the term particle?
[01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:27.400]   Or is it just--
[01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:31.440]   - It's a single, so we call it the vira,
[01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:35.700]   virion, so virion particle, it's essentially a single virus.
[01:18:35.700 --> 01:18:37.920]   - Single virus, but it just feels like,
[01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:41.620]   'cause particle to me, from the physics perspective,
[01:18:41.620 --> 01:18:44.500]   feels like the most basic unit,
[01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:49.600]   'cause there seems to be so much going on inside the virus.
[01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:51.000]   It doesn't feel like a particle to me.
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.500]   - Yeah, well, yeah, it's probably, I think it's,
[01:18:53.500 --> 01:18:58.160]   virion is a good way to call it.
[01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:01.360]   So, okay, so trying to figure out
[01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:05.440]   the entirety of the system.
[01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:10.440]   - Yes, so this is, so the virion has 50 to 100 spikes,
[01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:19.920]   primer spikes, it has roughly 200 to 400
[01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:26.800]   membrane protein dimers, and those are arranged
[01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:29.720]   in a very nice lattice, so you can actually see
[01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:34.720]   sort of the, it's like a, it's a carpet of--
[01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:36.480]   - On the surface again.
[01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:38.120]   - Exactly, on the surface.
[01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:43.120]   And occasionally you also see this envelope protein inside.
[01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:44.480]   And some--
[01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:46.080]   - Is that the one we don't know what it does?
[01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:48.880]   - Exactly, exactly, the one that forms the pentamer,
[01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:51.840]   this very nice pentameric ring.
[01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:55.440]   And so, you know, so this is what we're trying to,
[01:19:55.440 --> 01:20:00.440]   you know, we're trying to put now all our knowledge together
[01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:03.480]   and see whether we can actually generate
[01:20:03.480 --> 01:20:08.480]   this overall virion model with an idea to understand,
[01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:16.720]   you know, well, first of all, to understand how it looks like
[01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:21.320]   how far it is from those images that were generated.
[01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:23.760]   But I mean, the implications are, you know,
[01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:27.920]   there is a potential for the, you know,
[01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:33.960]   nanoparticle design that will mimic this virion particle.
[01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:38.680]   - Is the process of nanoparticle design,
[01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:40.680]   meaning artificially designing something
[01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:41.600]   that looks similar?
[01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:46.600]   - Yes, you know, so the one that can potentially compete
[01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:50.560]   with the actual virion particles,
[01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:54.700]   and therefore reduce the effect of the infection.
[01:20:55.460 --> 01:20:59.420]   - So is this the idea of, like, what is a vaccine?
[01:20:59.420 --> 01:21:02.500]   - So vaccine, vaccine, so, yeah,
[01:21:02.500 --> 01:21:06.420]   so there are two ways of essentially treating,
[01:21:06.420 --> 01:21:10.640]   and in the case of vaccine is preventing the infection.
[01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:15.640]   So vaccine is, you know, a way to train our immune system.
[01:21:15.640 --> 01:21:24.300]   So our immune system becomes aware of this new danger.
[01:21:25.300 --> 01:21:30.300]   And therefore is capable of generating the antibodies,
[01:21:30.300 --> 01:21:35.820]   then will essentially bind to the spike proteins,
[01:21:35.820 --> 01:21:40.020]   'cause that's the main target for the, you know,
[01:21:40.020 --> 01:21:45.020]   for the vaccine's design, and block its functioning.
[01:21:45.020 --> 01:21:51.820]   If you have the spike with the antibody on top,
[01:21:51.820 --> 01:21:55.200]   it can no longer interact with AC2 receptor.
[01:21:55.200 --> 01:22:00.780]   - So the process of designing a vaccine, then,
[01:22:00.780 --> 01:22:03.100]   is you have to understand enough about the structure
[01:22:03.100 --> 01:22:07.500]   of the virus itself to be able to create an artificial,
[01:22:07.500 --> 01:22:10.320]   an artificial particle?
[01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:12.180]   - Well, I mean, so, so, so,
[01:22:12.180 --> 01:22:16.940]   nanoparticle is a very exciting and new research.
[01:22:16.940 --> 01:22:21.020]   So there are already established ways to, you know,
[01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:25.460]   to make vaccines, and there are several different ones,
[01:22:25.460 --> 01:22:30.460]   right, so there is one where essentially the virus
[01:22:30.460 --> 01:22:34.620]   gets through the cell culture multiple times,
[01:22:34.620 --> 01:22:36.780]   so it becomes essentially, you know,
[01:22:36.780 --> 01:22:41.780]   adjusted to the specific embryonic cell,
[01:22:41.780 --> 01:22:47.100]   and as a result becomes less, you know,
[01:22:47.380 --> 01:22:52.380]   compatible with the, you know, host human cells.
[01:22:52.380 --> 01:22:57.560]   So, and therefore it's sort of the idea of the life vaccine,
[01:22:57.560 --> 01:23:01.700]   where the particles are there,
[01:23:01.700 --> 01:23:03.940]   but they are not so efficient, you know,
[01:23:03.940 --> 01:23:07.220]   so they cannot replicate, you know,
[01:23:07.220 --> 01:23:12.220]   as rapidly as, you know, before the vaccine.
[01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:16.020]   And they can be introduced to the immune system.
[01:23:16.020 --> 01:23:18.180]   The immune system will learn,
[01:23:18.180 --> 01:23:23.180]   and the person who gets this vaccine won't get, you know,
[01:23:23.180 --> 01:23:29.460]   sick or, you know, will have mild, you know, mild symptoms.
[01:23:29.460 --> 01:23:32.980]   So then there is sort of different types of the way
[01:23:32.980 --> 01:23:35.940]   to introduce the non-functional,
[01:23:35.940 --> 01:23:40.640]   non-functional parts of this virus,
[01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:45.680]   or the virus where some of the information is stripped down.
[01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:49.620]   For example, the virus with no genetic material,
[01:23:49.620 --> 01:23:52.740]   so with no RNA genome, exactly.
[01:23:52.740 --> 01:23:54.220]   So it cannot replicate.
[01:23:54.220 --> 01:23:58.500]   It cannot essentially perform most of its function.
[01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:00.140]   - This is fascinating.
[01:24:00.140 --> 01:24:04.580]   What is the biggest hurdle to design one of these,
[01:24:04.580 --> 01:24:05.740]   to arrive at one of these?
[01:24:05.740 --> 01:24:08.340]   Is it the work that you're doing
[01:24:08.340 --> 01:24:11.020]   in the fundamental understanding of this new virus,
[01:24:11.020 --> 01:24:14.140]   or is it in the, from our perspective,
[01:24:14.140 --> 01:24:18.460]   well, complicated world of experimental validation,
[01:24:18.460 --> 01:24:19.980]   and sort of showing that this,
[01:24:19.980 --> 01:24:21.740]   like going through the whole process of showing
[01:24:21.740 --> 01:24:23.860]   this is actually gonna work with FDA approval,
[01:24:23.860 --> 01:24:24.940]   all that kind of stuff?
[01:24:24.940 --> 01:24:26.060]   - I think it's both.
[01:24:26.060 --> 01:24:28.020]   I mean, you know, our understanding
[01:24:28.020 --> 01:24:32.380]   of the molecular mechanisms will allow us to, you know,
[01:24:32.380 --> 01:24:36.340]   to design, to have more efficient designs of the vaccines.
[01:24:36.340 --> 01:24:43.140]   However, once you design the vaccine, it needs to be tested.
[01:24:43.140 --> 01:24:44.980]   - But when you look at the 18 months
[01:24:44.980 --> 01:24:46.540]   and the different projections,
[01:24:46.540 --> 01:24:50.340]   it seems like an exceptionally, historically speaking,
[01:24:50.340 --> 01:24:52.060]   maybe you can correct me, but it's,
[01:24:52.060 --> 01:24:55.180]   even 18 months seems like a very accelerated timeline.
[01:24:55.180 --> 01:24:56.620]   - It is, it is.
[01:24:56.620 --> 01:25:00.140]   I mean, I remember reading about,
[01:25:00.140 --> 01:25:04.980]   in a book about some previous vaccines,
[01:25:04.980 --> 01:25:08.140]   that it could take up to 10 years to design
[01:25:08.140 --> 01:25:13.140]   and properly test a vaccine before its mass production.
[01:25:13.140 --> 01:25:16.100]   So yeah, we, you know,
[01:25:16.100 --> 01:25:18.140]   everything is accelerated these days.
[01:25:18.140 --> 01:25:20.980]   I mean, for better, for worse,
[01:25:20.980 --> 01:25:23.980]   but, you know, we definitely need that.
[01:25:23.980 --> 01:25:25.420]   - Well, especially with the coronavirus,
[01:25:25.420 --> 01:25:27.540]   I mean, the scientific community is really stepping up
[01:25:27.540 --> 01:25:28.440]   and working together.
[01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:30.700]   The collaborative aspect is really interesting.
[01:25:30.700 --> 01:25:33.020]   You mentioned, so the vaccine is one,
[01:25:33.020 --> 01:25:36.140]   and then there's antivirals, antiviral drugs.
[01:25:36.140 --> 01:25:37.320]   - So antiviral drugs.
[01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:38.420]   So where, you know,
[01:25:38.420 --> 01:25:42.260]   vaccines are typically needed to prevent the infection.
[01:25:42.260 --> 01:25:44.060]   Right, but once you have an infection,
[01:25:44.060 --> 01:25:47.300]   one, you know, so what we try to do,
[01:25:47.300 --> 01:25:48.300]   we try to stop it.
[01:25:48.300 --> 01:25:51.980]   So we try to stop a virus from functioning.
[01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:55.220]   And so the antiviral drugs are designed
[01:25:55.220 --> 01:25:58.940]   to block some critical functioning
[01:25:58.940 --> 01:26:03.500]   of the proteins
[01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:06.780]   from the virus.
[01:26:06.780 --> 01:26:11.280]   So there are a number of interesting candidates.
[01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:15.300]   And I think, you know, if you ask me,
[01:26:15.300 --> 01:26:22.340]   I, you know, I think Remdesivir
[01:26:22.340 --> 01:26:24.440]   is perhaps the most promising.
[01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:31.100]   It's, it has been shown to be, you know,
[01:26:31.100 --> 01:26:35.520]   an efficient and effective antiviral
[01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:37.680]   for SARS.
[01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:42.760]   Originally it was the antiviral drug
[01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:46.960]   developed for a completely different virus,
[01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:49.560]   I think for Ebola and Marburg.
[01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:52.000]   - At high levels, do you know how it works?
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.400]   - So it tries to mimic
[01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:59.160]   one of the nucleotides in RNA,
[01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:05.020]   and essentially that stops the replication.
[01:27:05.100 --> 01:27:07.480]   - So it messes, I guess that's what,
[01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:11.480]   so antiviral drugs mess with some aspect of this process.
[01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:13.080]   - So, you know, so essentially we try
[01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:17.700]   to stop certain functions of the virus.
[01:27:17.700 --> 01:27:20.660]   There are some other ones, you know,
[01:27:20.660 --> 01:27:26.940]   that are designed to inhibit the protease,
[01:27:26.940 --> 01:27:31.340]   the thing that clips protein sequences.
[01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:37.200]   There is one that was originally designed for malaria,
[01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:41.580]   which is a bacterial, you know, bacterial disease, so.
[01:27:41.580 --> 01:27:44.180]   - This is so cool, so but that's exactly
[01:27:44.180 --> 01:27:45.520]   where your work steps in,
[01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:47.480]   is you're figuring out the functional,
[01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:50.500]   and the structure of these different,
[01:27:50.500 --> 01:27:54.380]   so like providing candidates for where drugs can plug in.
[01:27:54.380 --> 01:27:57.260]   - Exactly, well yes, because, you know,
[01:27:57.260 --> 01:28:01.140]   one thing that we don't know is
[01:28:01.140 --> 01:28:03.380]   whether or not, so let's say we have
[01:28:03.380 --> 01:28:06.460]   a perfect drug candidate that is efficient
[01:28:06.460 --> 01:28:09.060]   against SARS and against MERS.
[01:28:09.060 --> 01:28:14.060]   Now, is it gonna be efficient against new SARS-CoV-2?
[01:28:14.060 --> 01:28:20.060]   We don't know that, and there are multiple aspects
[01:28:20.060 --> 01:28:22.500]   that can affect this efficiency.
[01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:26.820]   So for instance, if the binding site,
[01:28:26.820 --> 01:28:30.700]   so the part of the protein where this ligand
[01:28:30.700 --> 01:28:34.780]   gets attached, if this site is mutated,
[01:28:34.780 --> 01:28:38.020]   then the ligand may not be attachable
[01:28:38.020 --> 01:28:40.820]   to this part any longer.
[01:28:40.820 --> 01:28:44.260]   And, you know, our work and the work
[01:28:44.260 --> 01:28:47.660]   of other bioinformatics groups, you know,
[01:28:47.660 --> 01:28:51.500]   essentially are trying to understand
[01:28:51.500 --> 01:28:53.680]   whether or not that will be the case,
[01:28:53.680 --> 01:28:57.740]   or, and it looks like for the ligands
[01:28:57.740 --> 01:29:02.740]   that we looked at, the ligand binding sites
[01:29:02.740 --> 01:29:07.500]   are pretty much intact, which is very promising.
[01:29:07.500 --> 01:29:10.580]   - So if we could just like zoom out for a second,
[01:29:10.580 --> 01:29:17.140]   are you optimistic, so there's two,
[01:29:17.140 --> 01:29:18.780]   well, there's three possible ends
[01:29:18.780 --> 01:29:21.640]   to the coronavirus pandemic.
[01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:25.460]   So one is there's, or drugs or vaccines
[01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:30.600]   get figured out very quickly, probably drugs first.
[01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:35.600]   The other is the pandemic runs its course
[01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:37.560]   for this wave, at least.
[01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:40.800]   And then the third is, you know,
[01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:45.400]   things go much worse in some dark, bad,
[01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:47.240]   very bad direction.
[01:29:47.240 --> 01:29:49.560]   Do you see, let's focus on the first two.
[01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:54.520]   Do you see the anti-drugs or the work you're doing
[01:29:54.520 --> 01:29:59.480]   being relevant for us right now
[01:29:59.480 --> 01:30:04.200]   in stopping the pandemic, or do you hope
[01:30:04.200 --> 01:30:07.080]   that the pandemic will run its course?
[01:30:07.080 --> 01:30:12.080]   So the social distancing, things like wearing masks,
[01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:14.760]   all those discussions that we're having
[01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:19.760]   will be the method with which we fight coronavirus
[01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:22.880]   in the short term, or do you think
[01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:25.200]   that it'll have to be antiviral drugs?
[01:30:25.200 --> 01:30:30.520]   - I think antivirals would be,
[01:30:30.520 --> 01:30:37.320]   I would view that as the, at least the short-term solution.
[01:30:37.320 --> 01:30:41.860]   I see more and more cases in the news
[01:30:41.860 --> 01:30:46.860]   of those new drug candidates being administered
[01:30:46.860 --> 01:30:52.280]   in hospitals, and I mean, this is,
[01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:55.920]   this is right now the best what we have.
[01:30:55.920 --> 01:30:59.320]   - But do we need it in order to reopen the economy?
[01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:02.080]   - I mean, we definitely need it.
[01:31:02.080 --> 01:31:07.080]   I cannot sort of speculate on how that will affect
[01:31:07.080 --> 01:31:11.640]   reopening of the economy, because we are,
[01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:16.640]   you know, we are kind of deep into the pandemic,
[01:31:16.640 --> 01:31:20.280]   and it's not just the states, it's also, you know,
[01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:24.980]   worldwide, you know, of course,
[01:31:24.980 --> 01:31:28.640]   you know, there is also the possibility
[01:31:28.640 --> 01:31:33.640]   of the second wave, as we, you know, as you mentioned,
[01:31:33.640 --> 01:31:39.540]   and this is why, you know, we need to be super careful.
[01:31:39.540 --> 01:31:47.120]   We need to follow all the precautions
[01:31:47.120 --> 01:31:49.920]   that the doctors tell us to do.
[01:31:50.600 --> 01:31:54.760]   - Are you worried about the mutation of the virus?
[01:31:54.760 --> 01:31:58.960]   - It's, of course, a real possibility.
[01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:03.960]   Now, how, to what extent this virus can mutate,
[01:32:03.960 --> 01:32:07.160]   it's an open question.
[01:32:07.160 --> 01:32:11.180]   I mean, we know that it is able to mutate,
[01:32:11.180 --> 01:32:13.340]   to jump from one species to another,
[01:32:13.340 --> 01:32:18.340]   and to become transmittable between humans, right?
[01:32:19.340 --> 01:32:24.060]   So, will it, you know, so let's imagine
[01:32:24.060 --> 01:32:26.980]   that we have the new antiviral.
[01:32:26.980 --> 01:32:31.980]   Will this virus become eventually resistant
[01:32:31.980 --> 01:32:33.460]   to this antiviral?
[01:32:33.460 --> 01:32:34.300]   We don't know.
[01:32:34.300 --> 01:32:36.900]   I mean, this is what needs to be studied.
[01:32:36.900 --> 01:32:41.020]   - This is such a beautiful and terrifying process
[01:32:41.020 --> 01:32:45.500]   that a virus, some viruses may be able to mutate
[01:32:45.500 --> 01:32:48.860]   to respond to the, to mutate around
[01:32:48.860 --> 01:32:52.140]   the thing we've put before it.
[01:32:52.140 --> 01:32:53.640]   Can you explain that process?
[01:32:53.640 --> 01:32:55.100]   Like, how does that happen?
[01:32:55.100 --> 01:32:57.240]   Is that just the way of evolution?
[01:32:57.240 --> 01:32:59.660]   - I would say so, yes.
[01:32:59.660 --> 01:33:02.780]   I mean, it's the evolutionary mechanisms.
[01:33:02.780 --> 01:33:07.700]   There is nothing imprinted into this virus
[01:33:07.700 --> 01:33:12.700]   that makes it, you know, it just, the way it evolves,
[01:33:12.820 --> 01:33:17.120]   and actually, it's the way it co-evolves with its host.
[01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:22.260]   - It's just amazing, especially the evolutionary mechanisms,
[01:33:22.260 --> 01:33:27.260]   especially amazing given how simple the virus is.
[01:33:27.260 --> 01:33:32.700]   It's incredible that it's, I mean, it's beautiful.
[01:33:32.700 --> 01:33:36.500]   It's beautiful because it's one of the cleanest examples
[01:33:36.500 --> 01:33:37.920]   of evolution working.
[01:33:38.940 --> 01:33:42.620]   - Well, I think, I mean, the, one of the sort of,
[01:33:42.620 --> 01:33:47.180]   the reasons for its simplicity is because
[01:33:47.180 --> 01:33:52.180]   it does not require all the necessary functions
[01:33:52.180 --> 01:33:54.060]   to be stored, right?
[01:33:54.060 --> 01:33:58.460]   So it actually can hijack the majority
[01:33:58.460 --> 01:34:00.940]   of the necessary functions from the host cell.
[01:34:00.940 --> 01:34:05.380]   And so, so, so, so the ability to do so,
[01:34:05.380 --> 01:34:10.380]   in my view, reduces the complexity of this machine
[01:34:10.380 --> 01:34:14.540]   drastically, although if you look at the, you know,
[01:34:14.540 --> 01:34:16.140]   most recent discoveries, right?
[01:34:16.140 --> 01:34:19.300]   So the scientists discovered viruses
[01:34:19.300 --> 01:34:22.340]   that are as large as bacteria, right?
[01:34:22.340 --> 01:34:25.980]   So this mimi viruses and mama viruses,
[01:34:25.980 --> 01:34:31.700]   it actually, those discoveries made scientists
[01:34:31.700 --> 01:34:36.700]   to reconsider the origins of the virus, you know,
[01:34:36.700 --> 01:34:40.460]   and what are the mechanisms and how, you know,
[01:34:40.460 --> 01:34:43.940]   what are the mechanisms, the evolutionary mechanisms
[01:34:43.940 --> 01:34:46.900]   that leads to the appearance of the viruses?
[01:34:46.900 --> 01:34:50.460]   - By the way, I mean, you did mention that viruses are,
[01:34:50.460 --> 01:34:52.900]   I think you mentioned that they're not living.
[01:34:52.900 --> 01:34:54.740]   - Yes, they're not living organisms.
[01:34:54.740 --> 01:34:56.500]   - So let me ask that question again.
[01:34:56.500 --> 01:35:00.620]   Why do you think they're not living organisms?
[01:35:00.620 --> 01:35:04.340]   - Well, because they are dependent.
[01:35:04.340 --> 01:35:08.420]   The majority of the functions of the virus
[01:35:08.420 --> 01:35:13.020]   are dependent on the host.
[01:35:13.020 --> 01:35:15.420]   - So let me do the devil's advocate.
[01:35:15.420 --> 01:35:19.820]   Let me be the philosophical devil's advocate here and say,
[01:35:19.820 --> 01:35:23.380]   well, humans, which we would say are living,
[01:35:23.380 --> 01:35:27.940]   need our host planet to survive.
[01:35:27.940 --> 01:35:32.700]   So you can basically take every living organism
[01:35:32.700 --> 01:35:35.100]   that we think of as definitively living,
[01:35:35.100 --> 01:35:39.380]   it's always going to have some aspects of its host
[01:35:39.380 --> 01:35:42.540]   that it needs of its environment.
[01:35:42.540 --> 01:35:48.340]   So is that really the key aspect of why a virus,
[01:35:48.340 --> 01:35:49.820]   is that dependence?
[01:35:49.820 --> 01:35:54.820]   Because it seems to be very good at doing so many things
[01:35:55.460 --> 01:35:58.300]   that we consider to be intelligent.
[01:35:58.300 --> 01:36:00.980]   It's just that dependence part.
[01:36:00.980 --> 01:36:05.980]   - Well, I mean, it, yeah, it's difficult to answer
[01:36:05.980 --> 01:36:11.180]   in this way.
[01:36:11.180 --> 01:36:15.940]   I mean, the way I think about the virus is,
[01:36:15.940 --> 01:36:20.740]   in order for it to function,
[01:36:22.540 --> 01:36:26.700]   it needs to have the critical component,
[01:36:26.700 --> 01:36:31.380]   the critical tools that it doesn't have.
[01:36:31.380 --> 01:36:36.900]   So, I mean, that's, in my way,
[01:36:36.900 --> 01:36:42.380]   it's not autonomous.
[01:36:42.380 --> 01:36:47.380]   That's how I separate the idea of the living organism,
[01:36:47.380 --> 01:36:52.100]   on a very high level, between the living organism and--
[01:36:52.100 --> 01:36:54.100]   - And you have some, we have, I mean,
[01:36:54.100 --> 01:36:57.500]   these are just terms, and perhaps they don't mean much,
[01:36:57.500 --> 01:37:00.980]   but we have some kind of sense of what autonomous means,
[01:37:00.980 --> 01:37:02.800]   and that humans are autonomous.
[01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:08.660]   You've also done excellent work
[01:37:08.660 --> 01:37:13.660]   in the epidemiological modeling,
[01:37:13.660 --> 01:37:15.460]   the simulation of these things.
[01:37:15.460 --> 01:37:17.860]   So the zooming out outside of the body,
[01:37:17.860 --> 01:37:19.740]   doing the agent-based simulation.
[01:37:19.740 --> 01:37:22.140]   So that's where you actually simulate
[01:37:22.140 --> 01:37:24.580]   individual human beings,
[01:37:24.580 --> 01:37:27.220]   and then the spread of viruses from one to the other.
[01:37:27.220 --> 01:37:33.240]   How does, at a high level, agent-based simulation work?
[01:37:33.240 --> 01:37:39.100]   - All right, so it's also one of this irony of timing,
[01:37:39.100 --> 01:37:44.700]   'cause, I mean, we've worked on this project
[01:37:44.700 --> 01:37:46.860]   for the past five years,
[01:37:46.860 --> 01:37:51.580]   and the New Year's Eve, I got an email
[01:37:51.580 --> 01:37:56.580]   from my PhD student that the last experiments were completed.
[01:37:56.580 --> 01:38:00.300]   And three weeks after that,
[01:38:00.300 --> 01:38:03.300]   we get this Diamond Princess story,
[01:38:03.300 --> 01:38:07.940]   and emailing each other with the same,
[01:38:07.940 --> 01:38:10.100]   the same news saying like--
[01:38:10.100 --> 01:38:12.860]   - So the Diamond Princess is a cruise ship,
[01:38:12.860 --> 01:38:14.900]   and what was the project that you worked on?
[01:38:14.900 --> 01:38:16.880]   - So the project, I mean, it's,
[01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:22.360]   the code name, it started with a bunch of undergraduates.
[01:38:22.360 --> 01:38:26.180]   The code name was Zombies on a Cruise Ship.
[01:38:26.180 --> 01:38:29.660]   So they wanted to essentially model
[01:38:29.660 --> 01:38:34.660]   the zombie apocalypses on a cruise ship.
[01:38:34.660 --> 01:38:39.020]   And after having some fun,
[01:38:39.020 --> 01:38:41.860]   we then thought about the fact that
[01:38:41.860 --> 01:38:44.140]   if you look at the cruise ships,
[01:38:44.140 --> 01:38:48.260]   I mean, the infectious outbreak has been
[01:38:48.260 --> 01:38:53.260]   one of the biggest threats to the cruise ship economy.
[01:38:53.260 --> 01:38:58.940]   So perhaps the most frequently occurring
[01:38:58.940 --> 01:39:00.560]   is the Norwalk virus.
[01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:06.820]   And this is essentially one of this stomach flus
[01:39:06.820 --> 01:39:08.380]   that you have.
[01:39:08.380 --> 01:39:12.940]   And it can be quite devastating.
[01:39:12.940 --> 01:39:17.940]   So there are, occasionally there are cruise ships get,
[01:39:17.940 --> 01:39:20.300]   you know, they get canceled,
[01:39:20.300 --> 01:39:24.460]   they get returned to the, back to the origin.
[01:39:24.460 --> 01:39:28.020]   And so we wanted to study,
[01:39:28.020 --> 01:39:29.140]   and this is very different
[01:39:29.140 --> 01:39:31.780]   from the traditional epidemiological studies
[01:39:31.780 --> 01:39:34.300]   where the scale is much larger.
[01:39:34.300 --> 01:39:39.060]   So we wanted to study this in a confined environment,
[01:39:39.060 --> 01:39:40.220]   which is a cruise ship.
[01:39:40.220 --> 01:39:41.500]   It could be a school.
[01:39:41.500 --> 01:39:46.500]   It could be other, you know, other places such as,
[01:39:46.500 --> 01:39:50.660]   you know, the large company
[01:39:50.660 --> 01:39:54.260]   where people are in interaction.
[01:39:54.260 --> 01:39:58.460]   And the benefit of this model is
[01:39:58.460 --> 01:40:01.960]   we can actually track that in the real time.
[01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:05.660]   So we can actually see the whole course of the evolution,
[01:40:05.660 --> 01:40:10.260]   the whole course of the interaction
[01:40:10.260 --> 01:40:15.260]   between the infected horse
[01:40:15.260 --> 01:40:21.260]   and, you know, the host and the pathogen, et cetera.
[01:40:21.260 --> 01:40:26.260]   So agent-based system or multi-agent system
[01:40:26.260 --> 01:40:29.500]   to be precisely,
[01:40:29.500 --> 01:40:36.700]   is a good way to approach this problem
[01:40:37.820 --> 01:40:42.820]   because we can introduce the behavior
[01:40:42.820 --> 01:40:47.700]   of the passengers, of the cruise.
[01:40:47.700 --> 01:40:50.320]   And what we did for the first time,
[01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:53.940]   that's where, you know, we introduce some novelty
[01:40:53.940 --> 01:40:58.940]   is we introduce a pathogen agent explicitly.
[01:40:58.940 --> 01:41:04.900]   So that allowed us to essentially model the behavior
[01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:11.400]   on the horse side, as well on the pathogen side.
[01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:16.860]   And over sudden we can have a flexible model
[01:41:16.860 --> 01:41:22.260]   that allows us to integrate all the key parameters
[01:41:22.260 --> 01:41:23.940]   about the infections.
[01:41:23.940 --> 01:41:28.940]   So for example, the virus, right?
[01:41:28.940 --> 01:41:33.140]   So the ways of transmitting the virus
[01:41:33.140 --> 01:41:36.480]   between the horse.
[01:41:36.480 --> 01:41:43.100]   How long does virus survive on the surface, the fomite?
[01:41:43.100 --> 01:41:52.540]   What is, you know, how much of the viral particles
[01:41:52.540 --> 01:41:59.780]   does a horse shed when he or she is asymptomatic
[01:41:59.780 --> 01:42:02.900]   versus symptomatic?
[01:42:02.900 --> 01:42:05.460]   - And you can encode all of that into this path.
[01:42:05.460 --> 01:42:06.840]   And just for people who don't know,
[01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:08.360]   so agent-based simulation,
[01:42:08.360 --> 01:42:11.700]   usually the agent represents a single human being.
[01:42:11.700 --> 01:42:16.080]   And then there's some graphs, like contact graphs
[01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:18.840]   that represent the interaction between those human beings.
[01:42:18.840 --> 01:42:22.400]   - So yes, so we, so essentially, you know,
[01:42:22.400 --> 01:42:27.240]   so agents are, you know, individual programs
[01:42:27.240 --> 01:42:30.700]   that are run in parallel.
[01:42:30.700 --> 01:42:35.700]   And we can provide instructions for these agents
[01:42:35.700 --> 01:42:40.140]   how to interact with each other,
[01:42:40.140 --> 01:42:42.180]   how to exchange information,
[01:42:42.180 --> 01:42:45.540]   in this case, exchange the infection.
[01:42:45.540 --> 01:42:46.820]   - But in this case, in your case,
[01:42:46.820 --> 01:42:49.900]   you've added a pathogen as an agent.
[01:42:49.900 --> 01:42:51.540]   I mean, that's kind of fascinating.
[01:42:51.540 --> 01:42:56.540]   It's kind of a brilliant, like a brilliant way
[01:42:56.540 --> 01:43:00.340]   to condense the parameters, to aggregate,
[01:43:00.340 --> 01:43:01.900]   to bring the parameters together
[01:43:01.900 --> 01:43:04.500]   that represent the pathogen, the virus.
[01:43:04.500 --> 01:43:05.340]   - Yes.
[01:43:05.340 --> 01:43:06.980]   - That's fascinating, actually.
[01:43:06.980 --> 01:43:10.780]   - So yeah, it was, you know, we realized that,
[01:43:10.780 --> 01:43:13.320]   you know, by bringing in the virus,
[01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:15.540]   we can actually start modeling.
[01:43:15.540 --> 01:43:18.460]   I mean, we are not, no longer bounded
[01:43:18.460 --> 01:43:23.460]   by very specific sort of aspects of the specific virus.
[01:43:23.460 --> 01:43:27.900]   So we end up, we started with, you know,
[01:43:28.860 --> 01:43:31.040]   Norwalk virus, and of course zombies,
[01:43:31.040 --> 01:43:36.040]   but we continued to modeling Ebola virus outbreak,
[01:43:36.040 --> 01:43:41.580]   flu, SARS, and because I felt that we need
[01:43:41.580 --> 01:43:48.020]   to add a little bit more sort of excitement
[01:43:48.020 --> 01:43:51.380]   for our undergraduate students.
[01:43:51.380 --> 01:43:56.140]   So we actually modeled the virus from the contagion movie.
[01:43:56.140 --> 01:43:57.060]   - Yes.
[01:43:57.060 --> 01:44:02.060]   - So MEV-1, and you know, unfortunately,
[01:44:02.060 --> 01:44:06.980]   that virus, and we tried to extract as much information.
[01:44:06.980 --> 01:44:11.580]   Luckily, this movie was, the scientific consultant
[01:44:11.580 --> 01:44:17.020]   was Jan Lipkin, a virologist from Columbia University,
[01:44:17.020 --> 01:44:22.020]   who is actually, who provided, I think he designed
[01:44:22.020 --> 01:44:26.740]   this virus for this movie based on Nipah virus,
[01:44:26.740 --> 01:44:31.020]   and I think with some ideas behind SARS,
[01:44:31.020 --> 01:44:34.140]   or flu, like airborne viruses.
[01:44:34.140 --> 01:44:39.140]   And, you know, the movie surprisingly contained
[01:44:39.140 --> 01:44:43.740]   enough details for us to extract and to model it.
[01:44:43.740 --> 01:44:45.740]   - I was hoping you would like publish a paper
[01:44:45.740 --> 01:44:47.380]   of how this virus works.
[01:44:47.380 --> 01:44:49.340]   - Yeah, we are planning to publish it.
[01:44:49.340 --> 01:44:50.540]   - I would love it if you did.
[01:44:50.540 --> 01:44:52.500]   But it would be nice if the, you know,
[01:44:52.500 --> 01:44:57.500]   of the origin of the virus, but you're now
[01:44:57.500 --> 01:45:00.500]   actually being a scientist and studying the virus
[01:45:00.500 --> 01:45:01.780]   from that perspective.
[01:45:01.780 --> 01:45:04.820]   - But the origin of the virus, you know,
[01:45:04.820 --> 01:45:07.420]   the first time, actually, so this movie
[01:45:07.420 --> 01:45:11.300]   is assignment number one in my bioinformatics class
[01:45:11.300 --> 01:45:16.300]   that I give, because it also tells you that,
[01:45:16.300 --> 01:45:19.420]   you know, bioinformatics can be of use,
[01:45:19.420 --> 01:45:22.660]   'cause if, I don't know, you watched it,
[01:45:22.660 --> 01:45:23.500]   have you watched it?
[01:45:23.500 --> 01:45:24.460]   - A long time ago, yeah.
[01:45:24.460 --> 01:45:28.860]   - So there is, you know, approximately a week
[01:45:28.860 --> 01:45:33.100]   from the virus detection, we see a screenshot
[01:45:33.100 --> 01:45:37.500]   of a scientist looking at the structure
[01:45:37.500 --> 01:45:39.340]   of the surface protein.
[01:45:39.340 --> 01:45:41.460]   And this is where I tell my students that,
[01:45:41.460 --> 01:45:45.220]   you know, if you ask an experimental biologist,
[01:45:45.220 --> 01:45:48.040]   they will tell you that it's impossible,
[01:45:48.040 --> 01:45:51.100]   because it takes months, maybe years,
[01:45:51.100 --> 01:45:54.060]   to get the crystal structure of this,
[01:45:54.060 --> 01:45:56.220]   you know, the structure that is represented.
[01:45:56.220 --> 01:45:59.860]   If you ask a bioinformatician, they tell you,
[01:45:59.860 --> 01:46:01.060]   sure, why not?
[01:46:01.060 --> 01:46:03.940]   You know, we'll just get it modeled.
[01:46:03.940 --> 01:46:04.780]   - Yeah.
[01:46:04.780 --> 01:46:09.540]   - And, yes, so, but it was very interesting
[01:46:09.540 --> 01:46:12.380]   to see that there's actually, you know,
[01:46:12.380 --> 01:46:17.500]   and if you do it, do screenshots,
[01:46:17.500 --> 01:46:19.420]   you actually see the phylogenetic tree,
[01:46:19.420 --> 01:46:21.960]   the evolutionary tree that relate this virus
[01:46:21.960 --> 01:46:23.520]   with other viruses.
[01:46:23.520 --> 01:46:27.840]   So it was a lot of scientific thought put into the movie.
[01:46:27.840 --> 01:46:31.280]   And one thing that I was actually, you know,
[01:46:31.280 --> 01:46:34.480]   it was interesting to learn is that the origin
[01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:38.480]   of this virus was, there were two animals
[01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:45.340]   that led to the, you know, the zoonotic origin
[01:46:46.020 --> 01:46:50.460]   of this virus were fruit bat and a pig.
[01:46:50.460 --> 01:46:54.200]   So, you know, so this is--
[01:46:54.200 --> 01:46:57.920]   - This doesn't feel like we're,
[01:46:57.920 --> 01:47:00.600]   this definitely feels like we're living in a simulation.
[01:47:00.600 --> 01:47:05.600]   Okay, but maybe a big picture,
[01:47:05.600 --> 01:47:08.980]   agent-based simulation now, larger scale,
[01:47:08.980 --> 01:47:10.840]   sort of not focused on a crucia,
[01:47:10.840 --> 01:47:14.880]   but larger scale, are used now to drive some policy.
[01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:17.760]   So politicians use them to tell stories and narratives
[01:47:17.760 --> 01:47:21.680]   and try to figure out how to move forward
[01:47:21.680 --> 01:47:24.200]   under so much, so much uncertainty.
[01:47:24.200 --> 01:47:28.200]   But in your sense, are agent-based simulation
[01:47:28.200 --> 01:47:30.920]   useful for actually predicting the future?
[01:47:30.920 --> 01:47:34.720]   Or are they useful mostly for comparing,
[01:47:34.720 --> 01:47:38.340]   relative comparison of different intervention methods?
[01:47:38.340 --> 01:47:41.320]   - Well, I think both, because, you know,
[01:47:41.320 --> 01:47:44.500]   in the case of new coronavirus,
[01:47:44.500 --> 01:47:50.920]   we essentially learning that the current intervention
[01:47:50.920 --> 01:47:53.600]   methods may not be efficient enough.
[01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:59.840]   One thing that, one important aspect that I find
[01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:05.680]   to be so critical, and yet something
[01:48:09.240 --> 01:48:14.240]   that was overlooked, you know, during the past pandemics,
[01:48:14.240 --> 01:48:19.480]   is the effect of the symptomatic period.
[01:48:19.480 --> 01:48:23.400]   This virus is different because it has such a long
[01:48:23.400 --> 01:48:28.400]   symptomatic period, and over sudden,
[01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:31.880]   that creates a completely new game
[01:48:31.880 --> 01:48:34.280]   when trying to contain this virus.
[01:48:34.280 --> 01:48:36.800]   - In terms of the dynamics of the infection.
[01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:37.640]   - Exactly.
[01:48:38.920 --> 01:48:41.680]   - Do you also, I don't know how close
[01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:45.400]   you're tracking this, but do you also think
[01:48:45.400 --> 01:48:49.420]   that there's a different rate of infection
[01:48:49.420 --> 01:48:53.480]   for when you're asymptomatic, like that aspect,
[01:48:53.480 --> 01:48:55.520]   or does the virus not care?
[01:48:55.520 --> 01:48:59.840]   - So there were a couple of works.
[01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:04.080]   So one important parameter that tells us
[01:49:04.080 --> 01:49:09.080]   how contagious the person with asymptomatic virus
[01:49:09.080 --> 01:49:14.160]   versus asymptomatic is looking at the number
[01:49:14.160 --> 01:49:17.940]   of viral particles this person sheds,
[01:49:17.940 --> 01:49:21.240]   you know, as a function of time.
[01:49:21.240 --> 01:49:27.520]   So, so far, what I saw is the study that tells us
[01:49:31.640 --> 01:49:36.640]   that the, you know, the person during the asymptomatic period
[01:49:36.640 --> 01:49:41.040]   is already contagious, and it sheds,
[01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:46.040]   the person sheds enough viruses to infect another host.
[01:49:46.040 --> 01:49:50.560]   - Yeah, and I think there's so many excellent papers
[01:49:50.560 --> 01:49:53.520]   coming out, but I think I just saw maybe a Nature paper
[01:49:53.520 --> 01:49:58.520]   that said the first week is when you're symptomatic
[01:49:58.520 --> 01:50:00.920]   or asymptomatic, you're the most contagious,
[01:50:00.920 --> 01:50:05.200]   so the highest level of, like, they plot sort of,
[01:50:05.200 --> 01:50:09.200]   in the 14-day period, they collected a bunch of subjects,
[01:50:09.200 --> 01:50:11.600]   and I think the first week is when it's the most contagious.
[01:50:11.600 --> 01:50:15.360]   - Yeah, I think, I mean, I'm waiting,
[01:50:15.360 --> 01:50:20.360]   I'm waiting to see sort of more populated studies,
[01:50:20.360 --> 01:50:23.200]   or the study with higher numbers.
[01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:29.400]   My, one of my favorite studies was, again,
[01:50:29.400 --> 01:50:32.680]   a very recent one, where scientists determined
[01:50:32.680 --> 01:50:37.680]   that tears are not contagious.
[01:50:37.680 --> 01:50:44.000]   So, so there is, you know, so there is no viral shedding
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:45.660]   done through tears.
[01:50:45.660 --> 01:50:51.160]   - So they found one moist thing that's not contagious,
[01:50:51.160 --> 01:50:55.960]   and I mean, there's a lot of, I've personally been,
[01:50:55.960 --> 01:50:59.240]   'cause I'm on a survey paper, somehow,
[01:50:59.240 --> 01:51:03.320]   that's looking at masks, and there's been so much
[01:51:03.320 --> 01:51:05.720]   interesting debates on the efficacy of masks,
[01:51:05.720 --> 01:51:08.720]   and there's a lot of work, and there's a lot of
[01:51:08.720 --> 01:51:13.360]   interesting work on whether this virus is airborne.
[01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:15.320]   I mean, it's a totally open question,
[01:51:15.320 --> 01:51:16.800]   it's leaning one way right now,
[01:51:16.800 --> 01:51:19.000]   but it's a totally open question,
[01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:22.920]   whether it can travel in aerosols long distances.
[01:51:22.920 --> 01:51:25.120]   I mean, do you have a, do you think about this stuff,
[01:51:25.120 --> 01:51:27.240]   do you track this stuff, are you focused on the--
[01:51:27.240 --> 01:51:28.960]   - Yeah, I mean, you know-- - The bioinformatics of it?
[01:51:28.960 --> 01:51:33.240]   - I mean, this is a very important aspect
[01:51:33.240 --> 01:51:35.700]   for our epidemiology study.
[01:51:35.700 --> 01:51:41.880]   I think the, I mean, and it's sort of a very simple
[01:51:41.880 --> 01:51:48.680]   sort of idea, but I agree with people who say that
[01:51:48.680 --> 01:51:54.780]   the mask, the masks work in both ways.
[01:51:55.780 --> 01:52:00.780]   So it not only protects you from the incoming viral
[01:52:00.780 --> 01:52:06.300]   particles, it also, you know, it makes the potentially
[01:52:06.300 --> 01:52:11.420]   contagious person not to spread the viral particles.
[01:52:11.420 --> 01:52:13.420]   - Who is, when they're asymptomatic,
[01:52:13.420 --> 01:52:14.860]   may not even know that they're--
[01:52:14.860 --> 01:52:16.780]   - Exactly. - In fact, it seems to be
[01:52:16.780 --> 01:52:18.420]   there's evidence that they don't,
[01:52:18.420 --> 01:52:21.620]   surgical, and certainly homemade masks,
[01:52:21.620 --> 01:52:23.380]   which is what's needed now, actually,
[01:52:23.380 --> 01:52:25.780]   because there's a huge shortage of,
[01:52:25.780 --> 01:52:29.500]   they don't work as to protect you that well.
[01:52:29.500 --> 01:52:31.860]   They work much better to protect others.
[01:52:31.860 --> 01:52:36.860]   So it's a motivation for us to all wear one.
[01:52:36.860 --> 01:52:39.660]   - Yeah, exactly, 'cause I mean, you don't know where,
[01:52:39.660 --> 01:52:44.660]   you know, and about 30%, as far as I remember,
[01:52:44.660 --> 01:52:48.380]   at least 30% of the asymptomatic cases
[01:52:48.380 --> 01:52:51.060]   are completely asymptomatic, right?
[01:52:51.060 --> 01:52:53.540]   So you don't really cough, you don't,
[01:52:53.540 --> 01:52:59.020]   I mean, you don't have any symptoms, yet you shed viruses.
[01:52:59.020 --> 01:53:01.380]   - Do you think it's possible that we'll all wear masks?
[01:53:01.380 --> 01:53:03.780]   So I wore a mask at a grocery store,
[01:53:03.780 --> 01:53:06.500]   and you just, you get looks, I mean,
[01:53:06.500 --> 01:53:09.860]   this was like a week ago, maybe it's already changed,
[01:53:09.860 --> 01:53:12.780]   because I think CDC or somebody,
[01:53:12.780 --> 01:53:15.300]   I think the CDC has said that we should be wearing masks,
[01:53:15.300 --> 01:53:18.160]   like LA, it's starting to happen.
[01:53:18.160 --> 01:53:20.260]   But do you, it just seems like something
[01:53:20.260 --> 01:53:24.320]   that this country will really struggle doing, or no?
[01:53:24.320 --> 01:53:26.540]   - I hope not.
[01:53:26.540 --> 01:53:28.460]   I mean, you know, it was interesting,
[01:53:28.460 --> 01:53:33.220]   I was looking through the old pictures
[01:53:33.220 --> 01:53:38.220]   during the Spanish flu, and you could see that the,
[01:53:38.220 --> 01:53:43.860]   you know, pretty much everyone was wearing masks,
[01:53:43.860 --> 01:53:46.500]   with some exceptions, and there were like, you know,
[01:53:46.500 --> 01:53:49.340]   sort of iconic photograph of the,
[01:53:49.340 --> 01:53:52.980]   I think it was San Francisco, this tram,
[01:53:52.980 --> 01:53:57.140]   who was refusing to let in a, you know,
[01:53:57.140 --> 01:53:59.320]   someone without a mask.
[01:53:59.320 --> 01:54:03.780]   So I think, well, you know, it's also,
[01:54:03.780 --> 01:54:06.580]   you know, it's related to the fact of,
[01:54:06.580 --> 01:54:10.780]   you know, how much we are scared, right?
[01:54:10.780 --> 01:54:15.780]   So how much do we treat this problem seriously?
[01:54:17.720 --> 01:54:22.720]   And, you know, my take on it is we should,
[01:54:22.720 --> 01:54:27.360]   'cause it is very serious.
[01:54:27.360 --> 01:54:31.940]   - Yeah, I, from a psychology perspective,
[01:54:31.940 --> 01:54:36.380]   just worry about the entirety, the entire big mess
[01:54:36.380 --> 01:54:38.680]   of a psychology experiment that this is,
[01:54:38.680 --> 01:54:42.620]   whether a mask will help it or hurt it.
[01:54:42.620 --> 01:54:46.720]   You know, masks have a way of distancing us from others
[01:54:46.720 --> 01:54:50.120]   by removing the emotional expression
[01:54:50.120 --> 01:54:52.540]   and all that kind of stuff, but at the same time,
[01:54:52.540 --> 01:54:57.540]   masks also signal that I care about your well-being.
[01:54:57.540 --> 01:54:58.540]   - Exactly.
[01:54:58.540 --> 01:55:02.260]   - So it's a really interesting trade-off that's just--
[01:55:02.260 --> 01:55:05.260]   - Yeah, it's interesting, right, about distancing.
[01:55:05.260 --> 01:55:07.660]   Aren't we distanced enough?
[01:55:07.660 --> 01:55:08.880]   - Right, exactly.
[01:55:08.880 --> 01:55:13.720]   And when we try to come closer together,
[01:55:13.720 --> 01:55:15.600]   when they do reopen the economy,
[01:55:16.460 --> 01:55:20.740]   that's going to be a long road of rebuilding trust
[01:55:20.740 --> 01:55:23.620]   and not all being huge germaphobes.
[01:55:23.620 --> 01:55:29.740]   Let me ask sort of, you have a bit of a Russian accent.
[01:55:29.740 --> 01:55:31.700]   Russian or no?
[01:55:31.700 --> 01:55:33.060]   Russian accent? - Russian.
[01:55:33.060 --> 01:55:35.700]   - So were you born in Russia?
[01:55:35.700 --> 01:55:38.020]   - Yes, and you're too kind.
[01:55:38.020 --> 01:55:40.840]   I have a pretty thick Russian accent.
[01:55:40.840 --> 01:55:45.180]   - What are your favorite memories of Russia?
[01:55:45.180 --> 01:55:50.180]   - So I moved first to Canada
[01:55:50.180 --> 01:55:54.820]   and then to the United States back in '99.
[01:55:54.820 --> 01:55:56.860]   So by that time, I was 22,
[01:55:56.860 --> 01:56:01.860]   so whatever Russian accent I got back then,
[01:56:01.860 --> 01:56:06.920]   it's stuck with me for the rest of my life.
[01:56:12.540 --> 01:56:15.980]   By the time the Soviet Union collapsed,
[01:56:15.980 --> 01:56:22.900]   I was a kid, but sort of old enough
[01:56:22.900 --> 01:56:26.300]   to realize that there are changes.
[01:56:26.300 --> 01:56:30.700]   - Did you want to be a scientist back then?
[01:56:30.700 --> 01:56:31.700]   - Oh yes, oh yeah.
[01:56:31.700 --> 01:56:36.700]   I mean, the first sort of 10 years
[01:56:39.420 --> 01:56:43.920]   of my sort of juvenile life,
[01:56:43.920 --> 01:56:50.060]   I wanted to be a pilot of a passenger jet plane.
[01:56:50.060 --> 01:56:51.740]   - Wow.
[01:56:51.740 --> 01:56:55.820]   - So yes, it was like, I was getting ready
[01:56:55.820 --> 01:57:01.620]   to go to a college to get the degree,
[01:57:01.620 --> 01:57:06.620]   but I've been always fascinated by science
[01:57:06.940 --> 01:57:10.580]   and so not just by math.
[01:57:10.580 --> 01:57:13.140]   Of course, math was one of my favorite subjects,
[01:57:13.140 --> 01:57:16.580]   but biology, chemistry, physics,
[01:57:16.580 --> 01:57:21.580]   somehow I liked those four subjects together.
[01:57:21.580 --> 01:57:28.420]   And yes, so essentially after a certain period of time,
[01:57:32.500 --> 01:57:37.500]   I wanted to actually, back then it was a very popular
[01:57:37.500 --> 01:57:42.820]   sort of area of science called cybernetics.
[01:57:42.820 --> 01:57:45.440]   So it's sort of, it's not really computer science,
[01:57:45.440 --> 01:57:50.440]   but it was like computational robotics in this sense.
[01:57:50.440 --> 01:57:53.620]   And so I really wanted to do that.
[01:57:53.620 --> 01:58:00.900]   But then I realized that, you know,
[01:58:01.740 --> 01:58:06.740]   my biggest passion was in mathematics.
[01:58:06.740 --> 01:58:11.580]   And later I, you know, when, you know,
[01:58:11.580 --> 01:58:14.300]   studying in Moscow State University,
[01:58:14.300 --> 01:58:19.300]   I also realized that I really want to apply the knowledge.
[01:58:19.300 --> 01:58:25.700]   So I really wanted to mix, you know,
[01:58:25.940 --> 01:58:28.620]   the mathematical knowledge that I get
[01:58:28.620 --> 01:58:30.940]   with real life problems.
[01:58:30.940 --> 01:58:33.820]   - And that could be, you mentioned chemistry
[01:58:33.820 --> 01:58:36.320]   and now biology.
[01:58:36.320 --> 01:58:41.780]   And I sort of, does it make you sad?
[01:58:41.780 --> 01:58:44.660]   Maybe I'm wrong on this, but it seems like
[01:58:44.660 --> 01:58:50.580]   it's difficult to be in collaboration,
[01:58:50.580 --> 01:58:53.540]   to do open, big science in Russia.
[01:58:54.480 --> 01:58:57.860]   From my distant perspective in computer science,
[01:58:57.860 --> 01:59:02.100]   I don't, I'm not, we can go to conferences in Russia.
[01:59:02.100 --> 01:59:05.260]   I sadly don't have many collaborators in Russia.
[01:59:05.260 --> 01:59:08.960]   I don't know many people doing great AI work in Russia.
[01:59:08.960 --> 01:59:12.620]   Does that make you sad?
[01:59:12.620 --> 01:59:14.940]   Am I wrong in seeing it this way?
[01:59:14.940 --> 01:59:17.660]   - Well, I mean, I am, I have to tell you,
[01:59:17.660 --> 01:59:21.700]   I am privileged to have collaborators
[01:59:21.700 --> 01:59:23.860]   in bioinformatics in Russia.
[01:59:23.860 --> 01:59:26.540]   And I think this is the bioinformatics school
[01:59:26.540 --> 01:59:29.020]   in Russia is very strong.
[01:59:29.020 --> 01:59:30.680]   We have-- - In Moscow?
[01:59:30.680 --> 01:59:35.100]   - In Moscow, in Novosibirsk, in St. Petersburg,
[01:59:35.100 --> 01:59:40.260]   have great collaborators in Kazan.
[01:59:40.260 --> 01:59:46.220]   And so at least, you know, in terms of,
[01:59:46.220 --> 01:59:51.340]   you know, my area of research--
[01:59:51.340 --> 01:59:53.300]   - There's strong people there.
[01:59:53.300 --> 01:59:56.140]   - Yeah, strong people, a lot of great ideas,
[01:59:56.140 --> 01:59:57.900]   very open to collaborations.
[01:59:57.900 --> 02:00:02.900]   So I, perhaps, you know, it's my luck,
[02:00:02.900 --> 02:00:07.820]   but I haven't experienced any difficulties
[02:00:07.820 --> 02:00:13.380]   in establishing collaborations.
[02:00:13.380 --> 02:00:14.660]   That's bioinformatics, though.
[02:00:14.660 --> 02:00:17.660]   - It could be bioinformatics, too, and it could, yeah,
[02:00:17.660 --> 02:00:19.620]   it could be person-by-person related,
[02:00:19.620 --> 02:00:22.660]   but I just don't feel the warmth and love
[02:00:22.660 --> 02:00:27.620]   that I would, you know, you talk about the seminal people
[02:00:27.620 --> 02:00:30.100]   who are French in artificial intelligence.
[02:00:30.100 --> 02:00:34.300]   France welcomes them with open arms in so many ways.
[02:00:34.300 --> 02:00:37.020]   I just don't feel the love from Russia.
[02:00:37.020 --> 02:00:40.980]   I do on the human beings, like people in general,
[02:00:40.980 --> 02:00:44.820]   like friends and just cool, interesting people,
[02:00:44.820 --> 02:00:48.020]   but from the scientific community, no conferences,
[02:00:48.020 --> 02:00:49.700]   no big conferences, and it's--
[02:00:50.660 --> 02:00:54.500]   - Yeah, it's actually, you know, I'm trying to think.
[02:00:54.500 --> 02:00:59.500]   Yeah, I cannot recall any big AI conferences in Russia.
[02:00:59.500 --> 02:01:04.380]   - It has an effect on, for me,
[02:01:04.380 --> 02:01:08.220]   I haven't, sadly, been back to Russia, so I should,
[02:01:08.220 --> 02:01:10.260]   but my problem is it's very difficult.
[02:01:10.260 --> 02:01:14.220]   So I'm now, I have to renounce citizenship.
[02:01:14.220 --> 02:01:15.060]   - Oh, is that right?
[02:01:15.060 --> 02:01:16.580]   - I mean, I'm a citizen in the United States,
[02:01:16.580 --> 02:01:17.780]   and they make it very difficult.
[02:01:17.780 --> 02:01:19.740]   There's a mess now, right, so.
[02:01:19.740 --> 02:01:21.140]   - Yeah.
[02:01:21.140 --> 02:01:25.700]   - I wanna be able to travel, like, you know, legitimately.
[02:01:25.700 --> 02:01:26.540]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:01:26.540 --> 02:01:29.220]   - And it's not an obvious process.
[02:01:29.220 --> 02:01:30.140]   They don't make it super easy.
[02:01:30.140 --> 02:01:31.260]   I mean, that's part of that.
[02:01:31.260 --> 02:01:33.420]   Like, you know, it should be super easy
[02:01:33.420 --> 02:01:34.700]   for me to travel there.
[02:01:34.700 --> 02:01:37.340]   - Well, you know, hopefully,
[02:01:37.340 --> 02:01:41.740]   this unfortunate circumstances that we are in
[02:01:41.740 --> 02:01:46.740]   will actually promote the remote collaborations.
[02:01:46.740 --> 02:01:49.220]   - Yes.
[02:01:49.220 --> 02:01:52.420]   - And I think we've, I think what we are experiencing
[02:01:52.420 --> 02:01:55.760]   right now is that you still can do science,
[02:01:55.760 --> 02:02:00.700]   you know, being quarantined in your own homes.
[02:02:00.700 --> 02:02:01.540]   - Yeah.
[02:02:01.540 --> 02:02:02.900]   - Especially when it comes, I mean, you know,
[02:02:02.900 --> 02:02:05.460]   I certainly understand there is a very challenging time
[02:02:05.460 --> 02:02:07.140]   for experimental scientists.
[02:02:07.140 --> 02:02:10.740]   I mean, I have many collaborators who are, you know,
[02:02:10.740 --> 02:02:14.260]   who are affected by that, but for computational scientists.
[02:02:14.260 --> 02:02:17.400]   - Yeah, we're really leaning into the remote communication.
[02:02:17.400 --> 02:02:21.660]   Nevertheless, I had to force you to talk to you in person
[02:02:21.660 --> 02:02:24.220]   'cause there's something that you just can't do
[02:02:24.220 --> 02:02:25.600]   in terms of conversation like this.
[02:02:25.600 --> 02:02:29.260]   I don't know why, but in person is very much needed.
[02:02:29.260 --> 02:02:31.900]   So I really appreciate you doing it.
[02:02:31.900 --> 02:02:35.100]   You have a collection of science bobbleheads.
[02:02:35.100 --> 02:02:36.420]   - Yes.
[02:02:36.420 --> 02:02:37.980]   - Which look amazing.
[02:02:37.980 --> 02:02:40.900]   Which bobblehead is your favorite
[02:02:40.900 --> 02:02:43.620]   and which real world version,
[02:02:43.620 --> 02:02:46.060]   which scientist is your favorite?
[02:02:46.060 --> 02:02:46.900]   - Yeah.
[02:02:46.900 --> 02:02:50.220]   So yeah, by the way, I was trying to bring it in,
[02:02:50.220 --> 02:02:53.980]   but they are quarantined now in my office.
[02:02:53.980 --> 02:02:56.620]   They sort of demonstrate the social distance.
[02:02:56.620 --> 02:03:01.620]   So they're nicely spaced away from each other.
[02:03:01.620 --> 02:03:04.220]   But so, you know, it's interesting.
[02:03:04.220 --> 02:03:07.660]   So I've been collecting those bobbleheads
[02:03:07.660 --> 02:03:10.900]   for the past, maybe 12 or 13 years.
[02:03:10.900 --> 02:03:14.540]   And it, you know, interestingly enough,
[02:03:14.540 --> 02:03:18.420]   it started with the two bobbleheads of Watson and Crick.
[02:03:18.420 --> 02:03:23.100]   And interestingly enough,
[02:03:23.100 --> 02:03:26.740]   my last bobblehead in this collection for now,
[02:03:26.740 --> 02:03:31.740]   and my favorite one, 'cause I felt so good when I got it,
[02:03:31.740 --> 02:03:33.800]   was the Rosalind Franklin.
[02:03:33.800 --> 02:03:38.780]   And so, you know, when I got--
[02:03:38.780 --> 02:03:40.140]   - Who's the full group?
[02:03:40.140 --> 02:03:45.060]   - So I have Watson, Crick, Newton, Einstein,
[02:03:45.060 --> 02:03:47.580]   Marie Curie, Tesla,
[02:03:47.580 --> 02:03:53.740]   of course, Charles Darwin, sorry, Charles Darwin,
[02:03:53.740 --> 02:03:57.440]   and Rosalind Franklin.
[02:03:57.440 --> 02:04:01.420]   I am definitely missing quite a few of my
[02:04:01.420 --> 02:04:04.780]   favorite scientists.
[02:04:04.780 --> 02:04:06.860]   And, but so, you know,
[02:04:06.860 --> 02:04:10.660]   if I were to add to this collection,
[02:04:10.660 --> 02:04:15.660]   so I would add, of course, Kolmogorov.
[02:04:15.660 --> 02:04:16.540]   (laughing)
[02:04:16.540 --> 02:04:17.360]   - Interesting.
[02:04:17.360 --> 02:04:21.840]   - That's, you know, I've been always fascinated by
[02:04:21.840 --> 02:04:25.820]   his, well, his dedication to science,
[02:04:25.820 --> 02:04:30.820]   but also his dedication to educating young people,
[02:04:30.820 --> 02:04:33.740]   the next generation.
[02:04:33.740 --> 02:04:36.220]   So it's very inspiring.
[02:04:36.220 --> 02:04:38.580]   - He's one of the, okay, yeah,
[02:04:38.580 --> 02:04:40.540]   he's one of Russia's greats.
[02:04:40.540 --> 02:04:44.860]   - Yes, he, yeah, so he also, you know,
[02:04:44.860 --> 02:04:47.900]   the school, the high school that I attended
[02:04:47.900 --> 02:04:51.300]   was named after him, and he was great,
[02:04:51.300 --> 02:04:52.940]   you know, so he founded the school,
[02:04:52.940 --> 02:04:57.220]   and he actually taught there.
[02:04:57.220 --> 02:04:59.460]   - Is this in Moscow?
[02:04:59.460 --> 02:05:00.300]   - Yes.
[02:05:00.300 --> 02:05:06.100]   So, but then, I mean, you know,
[02:05:06.660 --> 02:05:08.860]   other people that I would definitely like
[02:05:08.860 --> 02:05:11.900]   to see in my collections was,
[02:05:11.900 --> 02:05:16.740]   would be Alan Turing, would be John von Neumann.
[02:05:16.740 --> 02:05:19.900]   - Yeah, you're a little bit later
[02:05:19.900 --> 02:05:21.580]   than the computer scientists.
[02:05:21.580 --> 02:05:24.580]   - Yes, well, I mean, they don't make them, you know.
[02:05:24.580 --> 02:05:28.700]   I still am amazed they haven't made Alan Turing.
[02:05:28.700 --> 02:05:29.540]   - Yeah.
[02:05:29.540 --> 02:05:34.540]   - Yet, yes, and I would also add Linus Pauling.
[02:05:35.060 --> 02:05:35.900]   - Linus?
[02:05:35.900 --> 02:05:36.740]   - Pauling.
[02:05:36.740 --> 02:05:38.500]   - Who is Linus Pauling?
[02:05:38.500 --> 02:05:43.500]   - So this is, to me, is one of the greatest chemists,
[02:05:43.500 --> 02:05:50.380]   and the person who actually discovered
[02:05:50.380 --> 02:05:53.620]   the secondary structure of proteins,
[02:05:53.620 --> 02:05:58.620]   who was very close to solving the DNA structure,
[02:05:58.620 --> 02:06:02.220]   and, you know, people argue,
[02:06:02.220 --> 02:06:07.220]   but some of them were pretty sure that if not
[02:06:07.220 --> 02:06:12.380]   for this, you know, photograph 51 by Rosalind Franklin,
[02:06:12.380 --> 02:06:19.980]   that, you know, Watson and Cree got access to,
[02:06:19.980 --> 02:06:23.500]   he would be the one who would solve it.
[02:06:23.500 --> 02:06:27.540]   - Science is a funny race.
[02:06:27.540 --> 02:06:29.580]   - It is.
[02:06:29.580 --> 02:06:33.740]   - It is. - Let me ask the biggest
[02:06:33.740 --> 02:06:35.060]   and the most ridiculous question.
[02:06:35.060 --> 02:06:39.420]   So you've kind of studied the human body
[02:06:39.420 --> 02:06:44.420]   and its defenses and these enemies that are about,
[02:06:44.420 --> 02:06:49.900]   from a biological perspective, bioinformatics perspective,
[02:06:49.900 --> 02:06:51.780]   a computer scientist's perspective,
[02:06:51.780 --> 02:06:55.860]   how has that made you see your own life?
[02:06:55.860 --> 02:06:59.100]   Sort of the meaning of it,
[02:06:59.100 --> 02:07:02.940]   or just even seeing what it means to be human?
[02:07:02.940 --> 02:07:08.340]   - Well, it certainly makes me realizing
[02:07:08.340 --> 02:07:11.500]   how fragile the human life is.
[02:07:11.500 --> 02:07:15.900]   If you think about this little tiny thing
[02:07:15.900 --> 02:07:22.020]   can impact the life of the whole humankind to such extent,
[02:07:23.020 --> 02:07:28.020]   so, you know, it's something to appreciate
[02:07:28.020 --> 02:07:36.860]   and to, you know, to remember that,
[02:07:36.860 --> 02:07:42.900]   that, you know, we are fragile,
[02:07:42.900 --> 02:07:47.900]   we have to bond together as a society,
[02:07:51.860 --> 02:07:56.860]   and, you know, it also gives me sort of hope
[02:07:56.860 --> 02:08:03.260]   that what we do as scientists is useful.
[02:08:03.260 --> 02:08:07.340]   - Well, I don't think there's a better way to end it.
[02:08:07.340 --> 02:08:09.140]   Dmitry, thank you so much for talking today.
[02:08:09.140 --> 02:08:10.260]   It was an honor.
[02:08:10.260 --> 02:08:12.140]   - Thank you very much.
[02:08:12.140 --> 02:08:13.580]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[02:08:13.580 --> 02:08:14.740]   with Dmitry Korkin,

[02:08:35.940 --> 02:08:40.100]   from Edward Osborne Wilson, E.O. Wilson.
[02:08:40.100 --> 02:08:44.060]   "The variety of genes on the planet in viruses exceeds
[02:08:44.060 --> 02:08:46.300]   or is likely to exceed that
[02:08:46.300 --> 02:08:49.020]   in all of the rest of life combined."
[02:08:50.020 --> 02:08:53.060]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
[02:08:53.060 --> 02:08:55.640]   (upbeat music)
[02:08:55.640 --> 02:08:58.220]   (upbeat music)
