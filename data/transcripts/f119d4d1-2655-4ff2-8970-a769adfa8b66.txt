[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.620]   I am James Hong and welcome to the Surpassing Value Podcast.
[00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.740]   The fuel and desire for this podcast was born out of a compulsion to flesh out what's
[00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.600]   been going on in the midst of an ocean of megaphones that may not actually withstand
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.620]   the test of scrutiny.
[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:32.300]   As a signpost theologian, I will do my best to filter out the impurities and point people
[00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:39.300]   in the right direction.
[00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.740]   For episode 9, I wanted to take some time and talk about the concept of human dignity,
[00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.200]   the Imago Dei, and social media.
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.760]   This might not seem like a topic worthy of discussion because after all, who doesn't
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.620]   agree that all humans carry inherent worth and therefore should be treated with a baseline
[00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.620]   of dignity.
[00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.920]   I am going to state what is an uncontroversial statement.
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:12.940]   Everyone, and I mean everyone, regardless of whatever synthetic classification we desire
[00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:20.580]   to put ourselves in, possess inherent worth and that inherent worth is inextricably linked
[00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.460]   to human dignity.
[00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.880]   To pull it apart even further, whatever race, ethnicity, people group, religion or lack
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:36.740]   thereof, sexual orientation or preference, or socioeconomic status, or sordid past, or
[00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:43.980]   gender, whatever else, the treatment and perspective we should all receive from one another in
[00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.700]   theory should be equivalent to that of a sibling within our family, a sibling you love.
[00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.440]   To put it in layman's terms, there is never a reason we should see any other human being
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.820]   on the face of the earth anything less than someone we love.
[00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.040]   I know that sounds fluffy at first, but you're going to need to bear with me a little bit
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:11.080]   as I arrive at that conclusion and why the journey itself is so important to the conclusion.
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:17.000]   As a disclaimer, I want to say that as I name these different synthetic classifications
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:25.880]   that we all use, race, ethnicity, people group, gender, religion, etc., I seldom find them
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:26.880]   helpful.
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:33.600]   In fact, on balance, I find them to be much more harmful than helpful.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.100]   One of the reasons I find them to be much more harmful than helpful is because these
[00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:45.280]   synthetic classifications begin to be the source of seeing another person as the other.
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:57.680]   We begin to see one another as groups belonging to that synthetic classification, straight
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:07.040]   or gay, Asian or brown, male or female, as opposed to just seeing each other as human
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.480]   beings.
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.840]   I want to give you an example.
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:17.140]   I could be in a restaurant with a bunch of other Koreans as that was the case for me
[00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:24.640]   growing up in Koreatown Los Angeles and feel right at home since I look like everyone else.
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:31.160]   As a side note, Koreatown Los Angeles has the highest concentration of ethnic Koreans
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.920]   outside of Korea.
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.560]   So growing up in Koreatown Los Angeles, I had Korean everything.
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:46.520]   There were Korean tutoring centers, shopping malls, auto repair shops, as I mentioned restaurants,
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.520]   Korean tax centers.
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.840]   There are about 100,000 Koreans residing in Los Angeles today.
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.080]   Not the county, I'm talking about the city.
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:04.320]   So that's a lot of people and a lot of Koreans residing within a small area.
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:11.300]   It is very easy to get lost in the community because you really don't have to learn English
[00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.160]   because the community itself is self-sufficient.
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.480]   Now going back to the restaurant, as I sit in this Korean restaurant in my head, I could
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:25.760]   feel like I belong because when I look at everyone, they look like me.
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:31.560]   But then what if I start seeing everything through the lens of one of the synthetic classifications?
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.440]   Age, sex, gender, religion.
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:45.020]   If I were to do that, I would go from a sense of real belonging to a very real sense of
[00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.560]   isolation and loneliness.
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.480]   In this restaurant, not everyone is the same age as me.
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.080]   In this restaurant, not everyone is the same gender as me.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.440]   In this restaurant, and you can go on.
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:06.360]   So instead of seeing people as people, if I start to see people through the lens of
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:17.600]   the synthetic classifications, I make within myself this cage of loneliness and isolations.
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:23.000]   Classifications, synthetic classifications, do have some utilitarian value.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:31.240]   But what I'm saying is, on balance, they have been more harmful than helpful and have
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:38.040]   been the source and have spawned this sense of cynicism that has been fueled from the
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.560]   suspicion of the other.
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:49.600]   And that has caused us to see each other as less than people because they don't share
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.000]   the same synthetic classification as you.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:00.240]   And if you have a distaste for a certain synthetic classification, you will begin to see through
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.800]   that lens of distaste.
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:13.360]   We automatically flood representative ideas of those supposed exemplars of said group.
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:19.080]   Nobody would ever explicitly articulate it as that, but isn't that what we are doing
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:26.160]   when we denigrate each other based on a certain synthetic classification?
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.760]   And aren't we all guilty of this at times?
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:36.100]   But this distaste is often flipped upside down when we share lives with one another.
[00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:40.520]   When you meet a person and share life with that person who is part of maybe a synthetic
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:46.400]   classification you have a distaste for, you begin to see that the said person is not all
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.980]   that bad.
[00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:51.000]   Maybe you even begin to like that person.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   Our distaste and our philosophy behind our distastes begins to get challenged.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.900]   I would submit to you at this moment in time, in our culture, the biggest wedge, more than
[00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:10.860]   any other synthetic classification, is ideological.
[00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:17.980]   Ideological classifications drive the biggest wedge in society and the church.
[00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:27.160]   I am not saying that racism doesn't exist, ageism doesn't exist, and every other ism
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:34.460]   doesn't exist because it exists because sin exists and we all suffer from an innate posture
[00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:37.020]   of depravity.
[00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:41.860]   Many times we will judge the intentions of another's heart and classify it as some type
[00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:48.860]   of ism based on suspicions we have for one another rather than giving people the benefit
[00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:50.580]   of the doubt.
[00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:55.420]   That judgment then begins to become our reality, doesn't it?
[00:07:55.420 --> 00:08:00.500]   But that judgment, like we talked about many times, is smashed when we begin to interact
[00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:01.900]   with people.
[00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:07.860]   And that is partly why these lockdowns have been so detrimental for us as a nation and
[00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:16.860]   as a church because we are embodied souls and the sharing of lives many times contributes
[00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:25.540]   to breaking down real divisions and sometimes the ones that only exist in our head.
[00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:31.520]   That is the travesty of this whole thing.
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:35.740]   How many stories have you heard of family members no longer speaking to one another
[00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:41.000]   because one votes for another political party and both are appalled at their choices?
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.160]   How many social media posts have you read of people denigrating, disparaging, and even
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:51.980]   outright verbally assaulting other people or certain thought leaders because of a position
[00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:54.580]   they hold?
[00:08:54.580 --> 00:09:01.060]   Don't get me wrong, we should have substantive discussions about these issues because some
[00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:03.380]   of these issues are extremely important.
[00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:06.180]   Some are weightier than others.
[00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:09.560]   Some are even maybe of the utmost concern.
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:14.860]   But even then, shouldn't we speak and act in a way that correlates with the fact that
[00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:20.300]   all people are made in the image of God?
[00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:25.780]   All people are made in the image of God.
[00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:32.300]   Behind a digital projection is an actual person.
[00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:39.260]   Theologians like to use the Latin term "Imago Dei" for image of God, "Imago Dei."
[00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:44.820]   I want to park right here just for a little bit and expand on this term and flesh out
[00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:45.820]   what this means.
[00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:50.380]   And that's part of the journey that I was explicitly referring to in the beginning of
[00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:55.340]   this episode because it is really important to flesh this out.
[00:09:55.340 --> 00:10:01.260]   Kyle and Dalich in their Old Testament commentary write regarding the image of God, "The image
[00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:06.420]   of God consists, therefore, in the spiritual personality of man, though not merely in unity
[00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:11.940]   of self-consciousness and self-determination, or in the fact that man was created a consciously
[00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:18.780]   free ego, for personality is merely the basis and form of the divine likeness, not its real
[00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:20.020]   essence.
[00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:25.180]   This consists, rather, in the fact that the man endowed with free self-conscious personality
[00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:32.060]   possesses, in his spiritual as well as his corporeal nature, a creaturely copy of the
[00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:36.620]   holiness and blessedness of the divine life.
[00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:43.100]   This concrete essence of the divine likeness was shattered by sin, and it is only through
[00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:48.540]   Christ, the brightness of the glory of God and the expression of His essence, that our
[00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:56.220]   nature is transformed into the image of God again."
[00:10:56.220 --> 00:11:00.340]   John MacArthur states in a sermon with respect to the Imago Dei, now these are going to be
[00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:04.220]   some long quotes, but they are absolutely worth it.
[00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:06.020]   They are absolutely worth it.
[00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:09.920]   He says this, "God is a plurality.
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:14.660]   God exists in Trinitarian relationship, and I have been made for relationships.
[00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:20.320]   That is the ontological aspect, or the aspect of nature, which is the image of God, personhood
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.060]   and relationship.
[00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:25.000]   There are also some ethical things, and I've already hinted at them.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.980]   As a person who is self-conscious, there are ethical features.
[00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:32.820]   I know right from wrong, I understand virtue, I understand morality, I understand righteousness,
[00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:37.460]   I understand sin, I understand holiness, I understand disobedience and rebellion, I have
[00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:41.980]   the capacity to do what is right, I have the capacity to do what is wrong, I have a capacity
[00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:46.460]   for a holy and loving fellowship with my heavenly Father, I have a capacity to know God, to
[00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:51.220]   know Christ, to know the Holy Spirit, I also have a capacity as a person in the image of
[00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:54.980]   God to know what's right and to know what's wrong, to know what's good, to know what's
[00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:56.340]   bad.
[00:11:56.340 --> 00:12:01.100]   It is true that as a human being, I resemble the creatures in my physical, corporeal form.
[00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:05.180]   I am made up of flesh, I am made up of the same components, I am made up of the same
[00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:07.860]   atomic material, the same raw elements.
[00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:10.300]   But what makes me distinct is my invisible part.
[00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:12.300]   It's the part that you can't find in my DNA.
[00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:14.540]   It's the part that is not in the chromosomes.
[00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:15.820]   It's that invisible self.
[00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:20.420]   It's that true person that makes me like God, that is capable of relationship with you and
[00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:21.420]   with God.
[00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:25.940]   And the question has been asked for the centuries, "Does the body of man bear the image of God?"
[00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:29.460]   No, not in the purest and truest sense.
[00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:33.740]   I don't want to get into splitting philosophical hairs here, but we are dust to dust and that's
[00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:34.960]   not like God.
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:38.140]   The personhood is eternal and that's like God.
[00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:42.380]   And we are capable and shall enjoy personal relationships forever with one another in
[00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:44.700]   the kingdom of God and with God himself.
[00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:49.100]   But while the body is not so much the expression of the image of God, the body does serve as
[00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:52.180]   a vehicle through which the image of God is manifest.
[00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:56.620]   To put it this way, if I didn't have a body, I'd have a hard time relating to you.
[00:12:56.620 --> 00:13:01.820]   So while the body is not the image of God, because God is a spirit and has not a body,
[00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:06.680]   my body gives me the vehicle in a corporeal world, in a physical world, for the image
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:09.060]   of God to manifest itself.
[00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:13.980]   Augustine used to say, "Man's body is appropriate for his rational soul, not because of his
[00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:18.260]   facial features and the structure of his limb, but rather because of the fact that he stands
[00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:22.460]   erect, is able to look up to heaven, and gaze upon the higher regions."
[00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:26.900]   John Calvin sort of felt the same way, that God has caused us to stand up so that we can
[00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:29.820]   face each other and so that we can look up and face him.
[00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:33.860]   Sort of emblematic and symbolic of our ability to have relationships.
[00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:37.540]   The body is not the image of God, but the body is a vehicle.
[00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:42.340]   Henry Morris wrote about this, wrote this about that, "We can only say that although
[00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:47.500]   God himself has no physical body, he designed and formed man's body to enable it to function
[00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:52.540]   physically in ways in which he himself could function without a body.
[00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:58.540]   God can see, hear, smell, according to Genesis 8.21, he can touch and he can speak, whether
[00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:02.500]   or not he has actual physical eyes, ears, nose, hands, or mouth.
[00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:07.860]   Furthermore, when he has designed to appear visibly to man, he has done so in the form
[00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:12.420]   of a human body, such as in Genesis chapter 18, and the same will be true of angels.
[00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:17.060]   They are spirits, and there are occasions when they take on bodies.
[00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:21.500]   There is something, says Morris, about the human body, therefore which is uniquely appropriate
[00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:24.180]   to God manifesting himself on occasions.
[00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:27.060]   He must have designed man's body with this in mind.
[00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:31.380]   Accordingly, he designed it not like the animals, but with an erect posture, with an upward
[00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:36.020]   gaze and countenance, capable of facial expressions corresponding to emotional feelings, and with
[00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:39.820]   a brain and a tongue capable of articulate, symbolic speech.
[00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:43.980]   He knew, of course, that in the fullness of time, even he would become a man, and in that
[00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:48.540]   day, he would prepare a human body for his son, and it would be made in the likeness
[00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:52.500]   of men, just as men have been made in the likeness of God.
[00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:53.860]   Well said.
[00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:59.260]   So we are created in the image of God, personhood, relationship, and understanding of right and
[00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:07.100]   wrong and morality, which is critical to all our relationships, particularly our relationship
[00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:10.700]   to God."
[00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:18.700]   That was John MacArthur in a sermon, and I took that and I didn't want to truncate it
[00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:27.620]   because not only is it so relevant, but because I didn't want any of the details to be missed.
[00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:36.060]   Elsewhere, John MacArthur states concerning man in a different sermon, "First of all,
[00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:38.100]   he was made in the image of God.
[00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:39.540]   That's the first thing.
[00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:42.660]   He was made for personality and relationship.
[00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:46.940]   Second thing, he was made as king of the earth to rule and subdue creation.
[00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:52.600]   The third, he was made as propagator of the human race to populate the earth, and fourth,
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:56.980]   he was made to be the recipient of rich and plentiful bounty all around him."
[00:15:56.980 --> 00:16:00.180]   Far above the animals, one last distinguishing characteristic.
[00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:04.060]   If you're going to talk about personality, if you're going to talk about relationship,
[00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:05.060]   listen carefully.
[00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:07.180]   You'll have to talk about language, right?
[00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:10.700]   How much of a relationship can you have if all you can do is grunt?
[00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:12.860]   You say, "Well, I'm working on it with my husband.
[00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:13.860]   That's about it."
[00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:15.780]   Well, and that's right.
[00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:18.420]   Relationship comes down to communication, doesn't it?
[00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:19.840]   Animals can't relate.
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:20.840]   They don't have self-consciousness.
[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:22.460]   They don't have personhood.
[00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:24.260]   They don't have relationships.
[00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:29.180]   They do whatever they need to do instinctively to achieve one end in life, and that is food
[00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:30.180]   and preservation.
[00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:34.280]   But when you come to mankind, you come to the ability to speak language.
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:39.140]   This is remarkable, and I told you a few weeks ago that there was a whole article in Newsweek
[00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:44.460]   magazine, scientists trying desperately to figure out unsuccessfully how man evolved
[00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:50.420]   the ability to speak languages, to speak abstractly, to reason abstractly.
[00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:55.540]   Linguistic studies demonstrate, as Oler and Omdahl, two linguists, have stated that apparently
[00:16:55.540 --> 00:17:00.200]   human beings and only human beings are specifically designed to acquire just a range of language
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:05.680]   systems, just as the range of language systems that we see manifested in the world's 5,000
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:07.060]   plus languages.
[00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:08.060]   Interesting.
[00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:13.780]   There are about 5,000 languages in the world, and only human beings can acquire those languages.
[00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:15.760]   You say, "Well, what about a dolphin?"
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:17.360]   When you say jump, don't they jump?
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:21.140]   They don't jump because you said jump, and they abstractly understand that those letters
[00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:23.900]   form a word, and that means to go into the air.
[00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:26.740]   There's a certain sound that results in a fish going into their mouth.
[00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:27.740]   They learned that.
[00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:32.660]   Oler and Omdahl have said that the rate of vocabulary acquisition is so high at certain
[00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:38.820]   stages of life, and the precision and delicacy of the concepts acquired so remarkable that
[00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:44.740]   it seems necessary to conclude that in some manner, the conceptual system with which lexical
[00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:48.660]   items are connected is already substantially in place.
[00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:49.660]   Wow.
[00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:50.940]   That's technical language.
[00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:56.100]   To say there's something going on in the abstract reasoning capability of a human brain
[00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:59.740]   that demands the acquisition of language to satisfy it.
[00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:01.980]   We all begin to see that with children, don't we?
[00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:06.420]   They begin to speak, and they begin to acquire the complexity of communication and language.
[00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:11.060]   Noam Chomsky, who is a great Jewish linguist, has shown that the ability to learn language
[00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:13.180]   is given in being human.
[00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:17.020]   He demonstrates that even the higher apes are unable to deal with a number system or
[00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:22.340]   with any abstract properties of space or in general with any abstract system of expressions.
[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:29.340]   Chomsky speaks elsewhere of initially given structures of mind and deep structures in
[00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:33.020]   humans which give rise to universal grammar.
[00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:36.300]   Listen, invariant among humans.
[00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:37.300]   That's true.
[00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:40.540]   You can take any language that exists and translate it into any other language that
[00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:45.100]   exists because the structural components of language are identical.
[00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:49.740]   They're literally part of the fabric of the image of God so that we who are relational
[00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:53.100]   beings with personhood can connect.
[00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:55.440]   All the hard wiring is there.
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:59.780]   His research, by the way, this Noam Chomsky, on the uniqueness of the human species as
[00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:05.580]   regards to language is so convincing that he is not welcome in evolutionist circles.
[00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:10.380]   They have labeled him as a creationist, which he denies.
[00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:15.340]   Unlike apes and other living creatures, human capacity for language is a door into the eternal
[00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:20.580]   realm, it's a door into the presence of God, and it demands the recognition that we
[00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:26.060]   have been created on a heavenly platform for communication with one another and communication
[00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:28.820]   with our Creator who made us in His image.
[00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:30.340]   All are in Omdurait.
[00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:35.560]   Our capacity for language cannot have originated within the narrow confines of any finite duration
[00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:36.740]   of experience.
[00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:41.940]   If all the eons of the space-time world could be multiplied to clear infinity, the material
[00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:46.420]   world would still fail to account for the abstract conceptions that any human being
[00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:50.300]   can easily conceive of through the gift of language.
[00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:52.040]   Amazing.
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:57.740]   Only a speaking God could have made speaking persons, right?
[00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:00.060]   God communicates and so do we.
[00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:03.100]   So we are made thusly in His image.
[00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:07.880]   Next week we'll go to those remaining points, man being king of the earth and propagator
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:18.060]   of life and recipient of rich blessing."
[00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:20.020]   Noam Chomsky.
[00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:23.780]   He is not a Christian.
[00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:30.980]   MacArthur is quoting him here extensively and talking about his research to drive home
[00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:40.560]   the point that within our ability to speak and the varied languages that exist, they
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:47.360]   inherently point to a Creator.
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:55.480]   Does this remind you of any event in the book of Genesis?
[00:20:55.480 --> 00:21:01.360]   I want to quote John MacArthur one last time, and this will be the last one.
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:03.880]   This is with respect to man.
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:09.880]   John MacArthur states with respect to man, "Man is transcendent.
[00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:13.860]   The truest part of man cannot be reduced to any chemical formula.
[00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:16.800]   The truest part of man cannot be seen in DNA.
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:18.380]   It cannot be found in chromosomes.
[00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:20.720]   It cannot be found by dissecting his brain.
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:23.360]   It cannot be found by cutting open his heart.
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:26.520]   It cannot be found by tinkering with his nervous system.
[00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:31.120]   You can take all of the scientific experiments you want on the anatomy of a human being,
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:35.940]   and never will you discover the true part of man, which is that intangible reality that
[00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:40.160]   he is a transcendent being which has no chemical constituents.
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:43.280]   Man is distinct from every other created creature."
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:47.680]   In Ecclesiastes 3, verse 11, a wonderful statement is made.
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:51.940]   He has made, speaking of God, everything appropriate in his time.
[00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:54.960]   He has also set eternity in their heart.
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.340]   What a great statement.
[00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:59.200]   He has set eternity in their heart.
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.520]   That's true only of man.
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:06.560]   Down in verse 21 of Ecclesiastes 3, "Who knows that the breath of man ascends upward, and
[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:09.640]   the breath of the beast descends downward to the earth?
[00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:12.780]   The writer is saying, 'Man, his spirit goes up.
[00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:17.940]   Any other creative being upon death, his spirit goes down, goes into the ground as if it were
[00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:23.380]   out of existence because God has set eternity in our hearts.
[00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:26.140]   You can take away our body, and we will live forever.'"
[00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:29.480]   So the image of God isn't talking about some kind of physical form.
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:33.480]   The image of God indicates attributes not shared at all by animals.
[00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:36.880]   And the bottom line word I gave you was personal.
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:39.520]   Man is a person, personhood.
[00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:43.000]   These are his distinctives, self-consciousness.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.660]   Animals are conscious, but they are not self-conscious.
[00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:48.820]   They're conscious to their environment, they react to their environment, but they don't
[00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:51.020]   know they're reacting to their environment.
[00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:53.300]   It's merely instinctive.
[00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:56.980]   But man is conscious, and he reacts to his environment.
[00:22:56.980 --> 00:23:02.900]   And he knows how to react because he reacts cognitively.
[00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:05.500]   Man has reason rather than instinct.
[00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:08.100]   Man has a capability to think abstractly.
[00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:11.660]   Man has the ability to appreciate beauty, to feel emotion, to be morally conscious,
[00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:19.700]   and above all, as we all pointed out last time, man the capacity and the need to personally
[00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:23.140]   relate to others, to other people, and especially to God.
[00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:26.780]   Being able to love Him and worship Him, that's personhood.
[00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:28.420]   Man has the ability to love.
[00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:31.340]   Man has the ability to fellowship, to converse, to commune.
[00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:37.140]   And man is the only creature in existence, in time, space, world, that has language.
[00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:39.460]   Now all of that points to the Trinity.
[00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:44.460]   And that's why, as I told you the last time, verse 26 indicates, "Let us make men."
[00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:48.620]   For the first time, God is introduced here as more than one, because He is making man
[00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:52.500]   in His image, and man is made for personal relationships.
[00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:57.780]   God discloses the fact that He Himself is a Trinity, as we well know, and as unfolds
[00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:01.540]   throughout the rest of Scripture, particularly the New Testament.
[00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:07.700]   So that God, in the relationship of the Trinity, establishes the pattern for man's relationships.
[00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:11.980]   Now that's the ontological essence of man, the ethical essence of man.
[00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:14.540]   He has a capacity for moral behavior.
[00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:16.980]   He has a capability to be holy and righteous.
[00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:18.980]   He has the ability to be sanctified.
[00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:20.860]   He has the ability to obey God.
[00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:29.020]   He has the ability to receive divine and eternal salvation."
[00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:40.260]   Human dignity is inextricably connected to the Imago Dei.
[00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:48.260]   Do you see why attributing human dignity to every single person who walks on the face
[00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:56.340]   of the earth is so important, and why we need to be reminded of this, especially in the
[00:24:56.340 --> 00:25:08.220]   era of the internet troll, in the era of the grumbler, the murmurer, the gossiper, the
[00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:13.940]   divisive person, the divisive man or woman?
[00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:21.060]   Because the vast majority of us live in what I'm going to call the public celestial sphere
[00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:27.460]   of the digital world, it is so easy for us to forget that behind a digital projection
[00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:31.580]   is an actual human being.
[00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:39.900]   But the nastiest of trolls will come out, the lamest of gossipers, the ungrateful coward
[00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:50.300]   ready to tear down the one, because at some point the one has offended them, or they haven't
[00:25:50.300 --> 00:26:00.420]   gotten what they wanted, never doing it face to face, but planting little traps with whispers.
[00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:06.380]   Things we would never say and shouldn't say to one another come out with ease, because
[00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:11.820]   we've reduced the other as less than human.
[00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:16.940]   At least that is one reason amongst many other contributing reasons.
[00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:23.820]   The ironic aspect to this is that the vast majority of online tough guys or the keyboard
[00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:30.700]   warriors are perhaps a little less than what their digital projections convey them to be.
[00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:35.180]   The vast majority of gossipers will claim to be doing it out of some noble pursuit,
[00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:41.380]   and many will claim to be tearing down of a godly zeal when their own life shows very
[00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:46.300]   little actual spiritual fruit.
[00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:52.800]   To add more meat to the bones here, let me quote to you several places in the New Testament.
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:59.780]   Matthew 12, 36, Jesus states, "But I tell you that every careless word that people speak
[00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:02.980]   they shall give an accounting for in the day of judgment."
[00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:07.900]   Matthew 15, 15-20, Peter said to him, "Explain that parable to us."
[00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:12.620]   Jesus said, "Are you also still lacking in understanding?
[00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:17.120]   Do you not understand that everything that goes into the mouth passes into the stomach
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:18.780]   and is eliminated?
[00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:24.460]   But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart, and those things defile
[00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:25.460]   the person.
[00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:32.420]   For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, acts of adultery, other immoral sexual acts,
[00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:37.540]   thefts, false testimonies, and other slanderous statements.
[00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:42.940]   These are the things that defile the person, but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile
[00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:43.940]   the person."
[00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:52.620]   Galatians 5, 13-15, Paul exhorts us, "For you were called to freedom, brothers and sisters.
[00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:57.540]   Only do not turn your freedom into an opportunity for the flesh, but serve one another through
[00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:58.620]   love.
[00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:03.780]   For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in the statement, 'You shall love your neighbor
[00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:05.220]   as yourself.'
[00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:12.420]   But if you bite and devour one another, take care that you are not consumed by one another."
[00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:21.860]   We're definitely seeing lots of consuming right now, aren't we?
[00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:30.220]   With respect to social media, as this ties in, at least for the purposes of this episode,
[00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:33.500]   listen to what Jaron Lanier has to say on this issue.
[00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:41.100]   Jaron Lanier, J-A-R-O-N, last name Lanier, L-A-N-I-E-R, he's been working in Silicon
[00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:47.580]   Valley since the '80s, and he's known as the founding father of virtual reality.
[00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:54.100]   He wrote a book called, "10 Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Account Right Now."
[00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:59.020]   "10 Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Account Right Now."
[00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:00.380]   He gives these 10 reasons.
[00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:05.180]   Now I'm not saying that I wholeheartedly agree with everything that he says, but this is
[00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:07.380]   extremely insightful.
[00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:11.780]   These are his 10 reasons.
[00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:14.140]   Social media is dismantling your free will.
[00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:18.220]   Number one, social media is dismantling your free will.
[00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:22.740]   Number two, quitting social media is the best way to push back against the craziness in
[00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:23.880]   our world.
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:27.420]   Number three, social media is turning you into a jerk.
[00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:31.180]   Number four, social media is killing truth softly.
[00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:35.140]   Number five, social media is rendering your voice meaningless.
[00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:38.980]   Number six, social media is ruining your ability to empathize.
[00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:43.340]   Number seven, social media is making you less happy rather than more.
[00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:47.680]   Number eight, social media is intentionally harming your economic dignity.
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:52.260]   Number nine, social media is poisoning political process.
[00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:58.300]   Number 10, social media hates your soul.
[00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:03.540]   He goes on to talk about how social media companies are really just behavior modification
[00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:05.820]   empires.
[00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:10.460]   And I hate telling people to watch the movie rather than read the book, but there is, I
[00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:14.280]   think still on Netflix, a film called "The Social Dilemma."
[00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:18.860]   The film is called "The Social Dilemma," and it captures the same points that Jaron Lanier
[00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:20.240]   is bringing up.
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:26.420]   And he also happens to prominently appear in the docudrama as well, in the film as well.
[00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:32.000]   He points to one degree or another, and in totality, these are all valid because every
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.380]   single one of us are made in the image of God.
[00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:43.200]   We are embodied souls, and embodied souls are meant to share meaningful relationships
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:48.260]   with one another and not digital projections of one another.
[00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:56.020]   Now, as you know, the fullest extent of this is found and only found when we have a correct
[00:30:56.020 --> 00:31:02.260]   vertical relationship with God, giving us that correct horizontal relationship, that
[00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:10.020]   unimpeded horizontal relationship that we can have with one another, and those relationships
[00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:13.620]   are pregnant with meaning and purpose.
[00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:22.020]   Moreover, you begin to see even greater weight to the imperatives that are given to us with
[00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:30.100]   respect to human conduct, right, a.k.a. the one another's of the Bible.
[00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:37.380]   One another is actually one word in the Greek, allelon, allelon.
[00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:45.300]   We do not fulfill the allelons of scripture when we bite and devour one another, or when
[00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:51.460]   we internet troll one another, or when we gossip about one another, or murmur about
[00:31:51.460 --> 00:32:02.020]   one another, or create division with one another, as opposed to just taking the non-coward's
[00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:06.900]   way and having a frank and honest dialogue.
[00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:14.500]   I'm going to end this episode here, but here's a list of what we disobey when we fail to
[00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:22.780]   see each other through the lens of the Imago Dei, and therefore impede on the practice
[00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:26.740]   of the allelons.
[00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:29.740]   Be at peace with one another, Mark 950.

[00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:35.300]   Be careful with that one.
[00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:38.460]   Be devoted to one another in love, Romans 12.10.
[00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:41.660]   Give preference to one another in honor, Romans 12.10.

[00:34:57.260 --> 00:35:04.300]   For us, here and now, these are all interlinked.
[00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:11.020]   Theology is immensely practical.
[00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:12.700]   Thanks for making it to the end.
[00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:17.060]   I'll continue to try to make the journey worth it.
[00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:20.540]   To Him be honor, glory, and eternal dominion.
[00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:21.220]   James Hong out.
