[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   Has anybody else seen due to an IMAX?
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.840]   No, don't say anything.
[00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.360]   Oh, don't say anything about Dune.
[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.440]   I want to say about Dune.
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.320]   No, don't say it.
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.600]   It is fantastic.
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.920]   And I want to see it again in IMAX.
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:12.400]   That's it.
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.720]   That's all I'm saying is that it's worth seeing twice.
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.120]   I don't even want to know that you think it's good.
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.840]   It's overrated.
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:18.480]   It makes me...
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.880]   Stop both of you.
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.000]   See, he didn't see it.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.480]   He didn't.
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.440]   Sax didn't see it.
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.560]   No, I saw Dune.
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:25.520]   Dune 2.
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.480]   Yeah, I saw it.
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.040]   It's overrated.
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.080]   Okay, stop, stop.
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.720]   Okay, stop.
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.840]   Everybody, you both...
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:30.640]   It's not overrated.
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.520]   There's like five great scenes.
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.800]   Sax, the scene...
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.120]   Stop, stop, stop.
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.360]   You guys are so annoying.
