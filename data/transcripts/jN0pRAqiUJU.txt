[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.440]   I've heard you talk before about some of the prime movers for longevity and all-risk
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.920]   mortality.
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.600]   And I'd love for you to review a little bit of that for us.
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.840]   I think we all know that we shouldn't smoke because it's very likely that we'll die earlier
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.800]   if we smoke nicotine.
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.400]   I'm neither a marijuana nor a nicotine smoker, so I feel on stable ground there.
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.640]   But anytime we see smoking nowadays, people really want to distinguish between cannabis
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.640]   and nicotine.
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:38.060]   So I am curious about any differences there in terms of impact on longevity.
[00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:45.200]   But in that context, what are the things that anyone and everyone can do, should do to live
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.200]   longer basically?
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.600]   How long you got?
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.560]   Well, you tell me.
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.560]   You tell me.
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.640]   I'd like to live to be, I'd like my final decade to be between 90 and 100.
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.640]   Oh, no.
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.640]   I meant how long do you-
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:59.640]   No, no.
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.640]   I'm just kidding.
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.640]   I'm just kidding.
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.640]   And will we spend from now until you're 90 talking about this?
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.640]   Well, there's a risk of that.
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.560]   So let's start with a couple of the things that you've already highlighted.
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.920]   So smoking, how much does smoking increase your risk of all-cause mortality?
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.040]   And the reason we like to talk about what's called ACM or all-cause mortality is it's
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.920]   really agnostic to how you die.
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.440]   And that doesn't always make sense.
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.680]   I mean, if you're talking about a very specific intervention, like a anti-cancer therapeutic,
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.780]   you really care about cancer-specific mortality or heart-specific mortality.
[00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.760]   But when we talk about these sort of broad things, we like to talk about ACM.
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:37.240]   So using smoking, smoking is approximately a 40% increase in the risk of ACM.
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.600]   What does that translate to?
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.920]   That means I'm shortening my life by 40%?
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:43.920]   No.
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.920]   It means at any point in time, there's a 40% greater risk that you're going to die relative
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.400]   to a non-smoker and a never-smoker.
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.400]   So it's important to distinguish.
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.040]   It doesn't mean your lifespan is going to be 40% less.
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.800]   It means at any point in time standing there, your risk of death is 40% higher.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.200]   And by the way, that'll catch up with you, right?
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.680]   At some point, that catches up.
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.680]   High blood pressure.
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.040]   It's about a 20% to 25% increase in all-cause mortality.
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.100]   You take something really extreme, like end-stage kidney disease.
[00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.520]   So these are patients that are on dialysis waiting for an organ.
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.960]   And again, there's a confounder there, because what's the underlying condition that leads
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:20.960]   you to that?
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.800]   It's profound hypertension, significant type 2 diabetes that's been uncontrolled.
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.800]   That's enormous.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.960]   That's about a 175% increase in ACM.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.800]   So the hazard ratio is like 2.75.
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.160]   Type 2 diabetes is probably about a 1.25 as well, so a 25% increase.
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.560]   So now the question is, how do you improve?
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.540]   So what are the things that improve those?
[00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.480]   So now here we do this by comparing low to high achievers and other metrics.
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:56.000]   So if you look at low muscle mass versus high muscle mass, what is the improvement?
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   And it's pretty significant.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.440]   It's about 3x.
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.840]   So if you compare low muscle mass people to high muscle mass people as they age, the low
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:09.040]   muscle mass people have about a 3x hazard ratio, or a 200% increase in all-cause mortality.
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.940]   Now if you look at the data more carefully, you realize that it's probably less the muscle
[00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.140]   mass fully doing that, and it's more the high association with strength.
[00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:25.420]   And when you start to tease out strength, you can realize that strength could be probably
[00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:33.300]   3.5x as a hazard ratio, meaning about 250% greater risk if you have low strength to high
[00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.300]   strength.
[00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.820]   And high strength is the ability to move loads at 80% to 90% at one repetition.
[00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.800]   And it's all defined by given studies.
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:46.400]   So the most common things that are used are actually-- they're used for the purposes of
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.020]   experiments that make it easy to do, and I don't even think they're the best metrics.
[00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:57.380]   So they're usually using grip strength, leg extensions, and wall sits, squats, things
[00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:58.380]   like that.
[00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.920]   So how long can you sit in a squatted position at 90 degrees without support would be a great
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.000]   demonstration of quad strength, a leg extension.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.480]   How much weight can you hold for how long relative to body weight, things like that.
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.000]   We have a whole strength program that we do with our patients.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.440]   We have something called the SMA, so it's the Strength Metrics Assessment.
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:22.520]   And we put them through 11 tests that are really difficult, like a dead hang is one
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.540]   of them, like how long can you dead hang your body weight, stuff like that.
[00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:31.200]   So we're trying to be more granular in that insight, but tie it back to these principles.
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.780]   If you look at cardiorespiratory fitness, it's even more profound.
[00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:40.760]   So if you look at people who are in the bottom 25% for their age and sex in terms of VO2
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:48.540]   max, and you compare them to the people that are just at the 50th to 75th percentile, you're
[00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:53.760]   talking about a 2x difference roughly in the risk of ACM.
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:59.880]   If you compare the bottom 25% to the top 2.5%, so you're talking about bottom quarter to
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:09.160]   the elite for a given age, you're talking about 5x, 400% difference in all cause mortality.
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.360]   That's probably the single strongest association I've seen for any modifiable behavior.
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.360]   Incredible.
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.960]   So when you say elite, these are people that are running marathons at a pretty rapid clip?
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:19.960]   Not necessarily.
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.680]   It's just like what the VO2 max is for that, like my VO2 max would be in the elite for
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.680]   my age group.
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.520]   My VO2 max, but again, I'm training very deliberately to make sure that it's in that.
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.440]   So I wouldn't consider myself elite at anything anymore, but I still maintain a VO2 max that
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.280]   is elite for my age.
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:44.400]   I consider you an elite physician and podcast and guy all around, but true.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.720]   But in terms of, okay, so for the point is like, you don't have to be a world-class athlete
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:49.720]   to be elite here.
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:50.720]   Yeah.
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.720]   Got it.
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.760]   So maybe we can talk a little bit about the specifics around the training to get into
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:06:00.060]   that, um, you know, top two tiers there because it seems that those are enormous positive
[00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.880]   effects of cardiovascular exercise, uh, far greater than the sorts of numbers that I see
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.440]   around, let's just say supplement a or supplement b.
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.800]   And that's, you know, like this is my whole pet peeve in life, right?
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:17.320]   It's like, I just can't get enough of the machinating and arguing about this supplement
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.600]   versus that supplement.
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.380]   And I feel like you shouldn't be having those arguments until you have your exercise house
[00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:25.380]   in order.
[00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:32.120]   Um, you know, you shouldn't be arguing about your, this nuance of your carnivore diet versus
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:36.320]   this nuance of your paleo diet versus this nuance of your vegan diet.
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.640]   Like until you can deadlift your body weight for 10 reps, like then, then you can come
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.920]   and talk about those things or something like, let's just start with some metrics like until
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:49.240]   your VO2 max is at least to the 75th percentile and you're able to dead hang for at least
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.980]   a minute and you're able to wall sit for at least two, like we could rattle off a bunch
[00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:56.600]   of relatively low hanging fruit.
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:00.400]   I wish there was a rule that said like you couldn't talk about anything else health related.
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.400]   We can make that rule.
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:02.560]   No one will listen to it.
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:03.560]   I don't know about that.
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.560]   We can make whatever rules we want.
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.480]   We can call it a Tia's rule.
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.960]   One thing I've done before in this podcast on social media is just borrowing from the
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:13.920]   tradition in science, which is it's inappropriate to name something after yourself unless you
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.920]   were a scientist before 1950.
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.680]   Um, but it's totally appropriate to name things after other people.
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:22.460]   So I'm going to call it a Tia's rule until you can do the following things.
[00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:23.820]   Um, don't talk about.
[00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.900]   Please refrain from talking about supplements and nutrition.
[00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:26.900]   There it is.
[00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:31.060]   Hereafter thought of, referred to and referenced as a Tia's rule.
[00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:35.940]   I coined the phrase, not him, so there's no ego involved, but it is now a Tia's rule.
[00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:36.940]   Watch out.
[00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:38.220]   Hashtag a Tia's rule.
[00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:39.220]   Oh God.
[00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:43.660]   Um, Wikipedia entry, a Tia's rule in all seriousness, and I am serious about that.
[00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:48.260]   Um, dead hang for about a minute seems like a really good goal for a lot of people, at
[00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:49.260]   least.
[00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:50.260]   That's our, that's our goal.
[00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.860]   I think we have a minute and a half is the goal for a 40 year old woman.
[00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:54.660]   Two minutes is the goal for 40 year old man.
[00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:59.100]   So we adjust them up and down based on, uh, age and gender.
[00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:00.100]   Great.
[00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:01.100]   And then, uh, the wall sit.
[00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:02.100]   What's, what are some numbers?
[00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:03.100]   We don't use a wall sit.
[00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:06.380]   We do as, as just a straight squat, air squat at 90 degrees.
[00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:10.540]   Um, and I believe two minutes is the standard for both men and women at 40.
[00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:11.540]   Great.
[00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:14.300]   And then, uh, because for some people thinking in terms of, you know, two max is a little
[00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:15.300]   more complicated.
[00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:18.900]   They might not have access to the equipment or the, to measure it, et cetera.
[00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:22.140]   Um, what can we talk about, think about in terms of cardiovascular?
[00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:25.300]   So run a mile at, uh, seven minutes or less, eight minutes.
[00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:26.380]   That's a good question.
[00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:31.780]   So there are VO two, there are really good VO two max estimators online and you can plug
[00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:34.060]   in your activity du jour.
[00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:39.300]   So be at a bike run or rowing machine and it can give you a sense of, of that.
[00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:40.620]   And I, I don't remember.
[00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:45.100]   I used to know all of those, but now that I just actually do the testing, I don't recall
[00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:46.100]   them.
[00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:49.180]   But it's exactly that line of thinking, like, can you run a mile in this time?
[00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:52.220]   If you can, your VO two max is approximately this.
[00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:53.220]   Great.
[00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:59.580]   And, and, and I think somewhere in my podcast realm, I've got all those charts, charts posted
[00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:04.120]   of like, this is by age, by sex.
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.620]   This is what the VO two max is in each of those buckets.
[00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:07.620]   Terrific.
[00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:08.620]   We'll provide links to those.
[00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:10.740]   We'll have our people find those links.
[00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:13.420]   And then, um, you mentioned deadlifting body weight 10 times.
[00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:14.420]   I just made that one up.
[00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:18.220]   We don't, that's not one that we include, but, but something, something like that.
[00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:20.300]   Um, we use, we use farmer carries.
[00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:25.260]   So we'll say for a male, you should be able to farmer carry your body weight for, uh,
[00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.180]   I think we have two minutes.
[00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:28.900]   So that's half your body weight in each hand.
[00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:32.100]   Um, you should be able to walk with that for, for two minutes.
[00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:35.980]   Um, for women, I think we're doing 75% of body weight or something like that.
[00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:36.980]   Yeah.
[00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:37.980]   Great.
[00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:38.980]   I love it.
[00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:42.820]   Um, as indirect measures of how healthy and how long we're going to live.
[00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:44.300]   It's basically grip strength.
[00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:45.300]   It's mobility.
[00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:49.340]   I mean, again, walking with that much weight for, for some people initially is really hard.
[00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:52.780]   Um, you know, we use different things like vertical jump, ground contact time.
[00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:54.460]   If you're jumping off a box, things like that.
[00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:57.740]   So it's, it's really trying to capture and it's, it's an evolution, right?
[00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:01.900]   Like I think the, the test is going to get only more and more involved as we, as we,
[00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:02.900]   as we get involved.
[00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:04.460]   Cause it took us about a year.
[00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:07.020]   Beth Lewis did the majority of the work to develop this.
[00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:10.940]   Um, Beth runs our strength and stability program in the practice.
[00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:13.540]   And you know, basically I just tasked her with like, Hey, go out to the literature and
[00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:18.820]   come up with all of the best movements that we think are proxies for what you need to
[00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:22.580]   be like the most kick-ass, you know, what we call centenarian decathlete, which is the
[00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:24.660]   person living in their marginal decade at the best.
[00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:32.660]   [Music]
