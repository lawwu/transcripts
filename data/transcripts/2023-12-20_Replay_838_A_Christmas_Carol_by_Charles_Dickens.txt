[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.340]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:09.540]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.460]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.460]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:16.460]   I'm your host today.
[00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:27.700]   You'll notice that my emphasis is on living a rich life now, a meaningful life now, and
[00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.720]   on the word insight.
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.640]   You'll understand that today I want to talk about what it means to live a rich and meaningful
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.440]   life and then I want to use a classic resource to draw some of the lessons.
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:48.020]   As I record this, it is Tuesday, December 21, 2021 for all the number aficionados, 12,
[00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:54.220]   21, 21, which is of course a fun number, and I want to share with you today a classic tale
[00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:00.300]   of what it means to balance money with other aspects of your life.
[00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:07.960]   The tale is A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens, a very well-known story, but in my experience,
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.820]   for those who are aware of The Christmas Carol, it's much more likely that your exposure
[00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.320]   to this story will have come from a theatrical production.
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.920]   It's a very commonly performed play.
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.960]   Last year, my wife and I went and enjoyed a stage production of A Christmas Carol, but
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.720]   although I've seen a number of stage productions and enjoyed them all, and I think they work
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:36.680]   hard to convey the truths, the meaning behind this particular story, as is quite common,
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.480]   those stage productions can't, by virtue of the way that they're presented, they simply
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.840]   cannot articulate all of the original intent of the author.
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.240]   And when Charles Dickens wrote this particular story, he was writing about money and about
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.880]   life.
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.960]   And as I was rereading this story this year with my children, we were going through and
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:05.480]   reading it to them, I was just struck by how perfect it was as a useful parable for us
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.920]   here at Radical Personal Finance.
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.560]   And so in today's episode, I want to read to you this story.
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.860]   I want to encourage you, if you've read it recently, great, or read the story, listen
[00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:17.860]   to it again.
[00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.080]   But I want to encourage you, many of you may find this difficult, but I will do my best
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.920]   to read it in a way that is engaging.
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.100]   If my young children can engage with it, even though the words may be unfamiliar at times
[00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.680]   or the sentence construction a little bit different than what we're accustomed to, then
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.280]   I am quite confident that you would enjoy it.
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:42.220]   And I want you to listen for the commentary on money and think about, as we consider the
[00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.980]   experiences that Scrooge himself goes through, I want you to think about the meaning and
[00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:54.020]   how you can apply these lessons to your own life, especially as is normal with a book,
[00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.680]   we get to interact with the thoughts and the feelings of the protagonist.
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.180]   I think this is such a valuable parable for us to consider, both now in the Christmas
[00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.100]   season and later.
[00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:13.340]   So enjoy my particular reading of "A Christmas Carol in Prose" being "A Ghost Story of Christmas"
[00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:19.140]   by Charles Dickens.
[00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.800]   Stave one, Marley's ghost.
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.820]   Marley was dead to begin with.
[00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.100]   There is no doubt whatever about that.
[00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.820]   The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker, and
[00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.540]   the chief mourner.
[00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:36.700]   Scrooge signed it.
[00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.220]   And Scrooge's name was good upon change for anything he chose to put his hand to.
[00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.260]   Old Marley was as dead as a doornail.
[00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.580]   Mind, I don't mean to say that I know of my own knowledge what there is particularly
[00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.340]   dead about a doornail.
[00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.620]   I might have been inclined myself to regard a coffin nail as the deadest piece of iron
[00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.400]   mongery in the trade.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:04.700]   But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile, and my unhallowed hands shall not
[00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.440]   disturb it, or the country's done for.
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:16.440]   You will therefore permit me to repeat emphatically that Marley was as dead as a doornail.
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.440]   Scrooge knew he was dead?
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.960]   Of course he did.
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.720]   How could it be otherwise?
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.360]   Scrooge and he were partners for I don't know how many years.
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:34.040]   Scrooge was his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole residuary legatee,
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.560]   his sole friend, and sole mourner.
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:44.080]   And even Scrooge was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event, but that he was an excellent
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:51.080]   man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnized it with an undoubted bargain.
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.640]   The mention of Marley's funeral brings me back to the point I started from.
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.120]   There is no doubt that Marley was dead.
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.440]   This must be distinctly understood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.600]   to relate.
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.600]   If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet's father died before the play began, there would
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.060]   be nothing more remarkable in his taking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon
[00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:19.440]   his own ramparts, than there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:24.580]   out after dark in a breezy spot, say St. Paul's churchyard for instance, literally to astonish
[00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.840]   his son's weak mind.
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.360]   Scrooge never painted out old Marley's name.
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:35.440]   There it stood, years afterwards, above the warehouse door, Scrooge and Marley.
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.840]   The firm was known as Scrooge and Marley.
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.000]   Sometimes people knew to the business called Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   he answered to both names, it was all the same to him.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.080]   Oh, but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge, a squeezing, wrenching,
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:59.520]   grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old sinner, hard and sharp as flint, from which
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:06.040]   no steel had ever struck out generous fire, secret and self-contained and solitary as
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.320]   an oyster.
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:14.000]   The cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose, shriveled his cheek,
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.920]   stiffened his gait, made his eyes red, his thin lips blue, and spoke out shrewdly in
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.080]   his grating voice.
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:28.560]   A frosty rhyme was on his head and on his eyebrows and his wiry chin.
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.700]   He carried his own low temperature always about with him.
[00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:39.200]   He iced his office in the dog days and didn't thaw at one degree at Christmas.
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.840]   External heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge.
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:50.000]   No warmth could warm, no wintry weather chill him, no wind that blew was bitterer than he,
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:56.160]   no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain less open to entreaty.
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.000]   Foul weather didn't know where to have him.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.980]   The heaviest rain and snow and hail and sleet could boast of the advantage over him in only
[00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:05.600]   one respect.
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:12.160]   They often came down handsomely, and Scrooge never did.
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:16.160]   Nobody ever stopped him in the street to say with gladsome looks, "My dear Scrooge, how
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.160]   are you?
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.880]   When will you come to see me?"
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:25.600]   No beggars implored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was o'clock,
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:30.200]   no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to such and such a place
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.040]   of Scrooge.
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:36.960]   Even the blind men's dogs appeared to know him, and when they saw him coming on would
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:42.960]   tug their owners into doorways and up courts, and then would wag their tails as though they
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:47.600]   said, "No eye at all is better than an evil eye, Dark Master."
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.520]   But what did Scrooge care?
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:56.960]   It was the very thing he liked, to edge his way along the crowded paths of life, warning
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:05.200]   all human sympathy to keep its distance was what the Knowing Ones called nuts to Scrooge.
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:11.440]   Once upon a time, of all the good days in the year, on Christmas Eve, old Scrooge sat
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.000]   busy in his counting house.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   It was cold, bleak, biting weather, foggy with all, and he could hear the people in
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.040]   the court outside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts and
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:29.600]   stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them.
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:34.320]   The city clocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already.
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:38.480]   It had not been light all day, and candles were flaring in the windows of the neighboring
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:43.520]   offices like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air.
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:49.520]   The fog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense without that, although
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:55.520]   the court was of the narrowest, the houses opposite were mere phantoms.
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:09:00.680]   To see the dingy cloud come drooping down, obscuring everything, one might have thought
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:05.700]   that nature lived hard by and was brewing on a large scale.
[00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:10.400]   The door of Scrooge's counting house was open that he might keep his eye upon his clerk,
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:17.640]   who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank, was copying letters.
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:23.800]   Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk's fire was so very much smaller that it looked
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.760]   like one coal.
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:29.900]   But he couldn't replenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal box in his own room, and so
[00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:34.600]   surely as the clerk came in with a shovel, the master predicted that it would be necessary
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.400]   for them to part.
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:41.600]   Wherefore the clerk put on his white comforter and tried to imagine himself at the candle,
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:46.480]   in which effort, not being a man of strong imagination, he failed.
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:48.520]   "A Merry Christmas, Uncle!
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:51.320]   God save you!" cried a cheerful voice.
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:55.520]   It was the voice of Scrooge's nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this was the
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:58.480]   first intimation he had of his approach.
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:02.060]   "Bah!" said Scrooge, "humbug!"
[00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:07.160]   He had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this nephew of Scrooge's,
[00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:08.960]   that he was all in a glow.
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:14.720]   His face was ruddy and handsome, his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:18.000]   "Christmas, a humbug, Uncle!" said Scrooge's nephew.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.640]   "You don't mean that, I'm sure."
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.680]   "I do," said Scrooge.
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:24.320]   "Merry Christmas!
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.760]   What right have you to be merry?
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:30.280]   What reason have you to be merry?
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:31.760]   You're poor enough!"
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:36.960]   "Come then," returned the nephew gaily, "what right have you to be dismal?
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:39.480]   What right have you to be morose?
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.700]   You're rich enough!"
[00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:47.720]   Scrooge having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment said, "Bah!" again, and
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.720]   followed it up with, "Humbug!"
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:52.880]   "Don't be cross, Uncle," said the nephew.
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.080]   "What else can I be?"
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:59.360]   returned the uncle, "when I live in such a world of fools as this?
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:01.200]   Merry Christmas!
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.600]   Out upon merry Christmas!
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:09.160]   What's Christmas time to you but a time for paying bills without money, a time for finding
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:15.360]   yourself a year older but not an hour richer, a time for balancing your books and having
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:20.520]   every item in 'em through a round dozen of months presented dead against you?
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:28.160]   If I could work my will," said Scrooge indignantly, "every idiot who goes about with 'Merry Christmas'
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:33.720]   on his lips should be boiled with his own pudding and buried with a stake of holly through
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.640]   his heart, he should!"
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:38.320]   "Uncle!" pleaded the nephew.
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:44.680]   "Nephew," returned the uncle sternly, "keep Christmas in your own way and let me keep
[00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:45.680]   it in mine."
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:50.400]   "Keep it!" repeated Scrooge's nephew, "but you don't keep it!"
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:56.840]   "Let me leave it alone then," said Scrooge, "much good may it do you, much good it has
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:58.840]   ever done you!"
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:04.600]   "There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I have not profited,
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:10.160]   I dare say," returned the nephew, "Christmas among the rest, but I am sure I have always
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:14.700]   thought of Christmas time when it has come round apart from the veneration due its sacred
[00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:19.840]   name and origin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that, as a good time,
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:27.320]   a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time, the only time I know of in the long calendar
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:33.600]   of the year, when men and women seem by one consent to open their shut up hearts freely
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:38.160]   and to think of people below them as if they really were fellow passengers to the grave,
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.720]   and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys.
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:47.040]   And therefore, uncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket,
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:55.400]   I believe that it has done me good and will do me good, and I say God bless it!"
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:59.940]   The clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded, becoming immediately sensible of the impropriety,
[00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:03.880]   he poked the fire and extinguished the last frail spark forever.
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:11.880]   "Let me hear another sound from you," said Scrooge, "and you'll keep your Christmas
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:13.840]   by losing your situation."
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:21.640]   "You're quite a powerful speaker, sir," he added, turning to his nephew, "I wonder you
[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:24.720]   don't go into Parliament.
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:28.560]   Don't be angry, uncle, come dine with us tomorrow."
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:33.040]   Scrooge said that he would see him, yes, indeed he did.
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:38.680]   He went the whole length of the expression and said that he would see him in that extremity
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:39.680]   first.
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:44.040]   "But why," cried Scrooge's nephew, "why?"
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:47.840]   "Why did you get married?" said Scrooge.
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:50.080]   "Because I fell in love."
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:56.240]   "Because you fell in love," growled Scrooge, as if that were the only thing in the world
[00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:59.240]   more ridiculous than a merry Christmas.
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:00.920]   "Good afternoon."
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:05.680]   "Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that happened.
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:09.320]   Why give it as a reason for not coming now?"
[00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:17.500]   "Good afternoon," said Scrooge, "I want nothing from you, I ask nothing of you.
[00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:20.000]   Why cannot we be friends?"
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:28.500]   "Good afternoon," said Scrooge, "I am sorry with all my heart to find you so resolute.
[00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:33.320]   We have never had any quarrel, to which I have been a party, but I have made the trial
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:38.400]   in homage to Christmas, and I'll keep my Christmas humor to the last.
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:41.520]   So a merry Christmas, uncle."
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:45.640]   "Good afternoon," said Scrooge, "and a happy new year."
[00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:48.600]   "Good afternoon," said Scrooge.
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:53.200]   His nephew left the room without an angry word notwithstanding.
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:56.680]   He stopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the clerk, who,
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:01.080]   cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge, for he returned them cordially.
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:07.280]   "There is another fellow," muttered Scrooge, who overheard him, "my clerk, with fifteen
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:12.480]   shillings a week, and a wife and family, talking about a merry Christmas.
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:15.380]   I'll retire to bedlam."
[00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:19.200]   This lunatic in letting Scrooge's nephew out had let two other people in.
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:23.840]   They were a portly gentleman, pleasant to behold, and now stood, with their hats off,
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:24.840]   in Scrooge's office.
[00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:28.360]   They had books and papers in their hands and bowed to him.
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:31.880]   "Scrooge and Marley's, I believe," said one of the gentlemen, referring to his list.
[00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:35.800]   "Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge or Mr. Marley?"
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:40.320]   "Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years," Scrooge replied.
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:44.160]   "He died seven years ago, this very night."
[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:49.360]   "We have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving partner," said
[00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:51.800]   the gentleman, presenting his credentials.
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:56.160]   It certainly was, for they had been two kindred spirits.
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:04.400]   At the ominous word "liberality," Scrooge frowned and shook his head and handed the
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:05.560]   credentials back.
[00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:09.320]   "At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge," said the gentleman, taking up
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:13.600]   a pen, "it is more than usually desirable that we should make some slight provision
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:17.880]   for the poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at the present time.
[00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:22.600]   Many thousands are in want of common necessaries; hundreds of thousands are in want of common
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:23.960]   comforts, sir."
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:27.560]   "Are there no prisons?" asked Scrooge.
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:30.960]   "Plenty of prisons," said the gentleman, laying down the pen again.
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:34.200]   "And the union workhouses?" demanded Scrooge.
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:36.360]   "Are they still in operation?"
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:38.880]   "They are still," returned the gentleman.
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:41.360]   "I wish I could say they were not."
[00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:46.480]   "The treadmill and the poor law are in full vigour then?" said Scrooge.
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:48.880]   "Both very busy, sir."
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:49.880]   "Oh!
[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:54.320]   I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had occurred to stop them in
[00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:56.840]   their useful course," said Scrooge.
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.880]   "I am very glad to hear it."
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:04.560]   "Under the impression that they scarcely furnish Christian cheer of mind or body to
[00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:09.160]   the multitude," returned the gentleman, "a few of us are endeavouring to raise a
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:14.440]   fund to buy the poor some meat and drink and means of warmth.
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:19.960]   We choose this time because it is a time, of all others, when want is keenly felt and
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:21.820]   abundance rejoices.
[00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:24.200]   What shall I put you down for?"
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:26.440]   "Nothing," Scrooge replied.
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.400]   "You wish to be anonymous?"
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:32.400]   "I wish to be left alone," said Scrooge.
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:36.000]   "Since you ask me what I wish, gentlemen, that is my answer.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.960]   I don't make merry myself at Christmas, and I can't afford to make idle people merry.
[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:45.520]   I help to support the establishments I have mentioned.
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:50.480]   They cost enough, and those who are badly off must go there.
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:54.160]   Many can't go there, and many would rather die."
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:18:01.000]   "If they would rather die," said Scrooge, "they had better do it, and decrease the
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.680]   surplus population.
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:05.920]   Besides, excuse me, I don't know that."
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:08.640]   "But you might know it," observed the gentleman.
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:12.000]   "It's not my business," Scrooge returned.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.320]   "It's enough for a man to understand his own business, and not to interfere with other
[00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:18.320]   people's.
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:21.080]   Mine occupies me constantly.
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:23.720]   Good afternoon, gentlemen."
[00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:29.480]   Seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the gentleman withdrew.
[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:34.880]   Scrooge resumed his labors with an improved opinion of himself, and in a more facetious
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:37.960]   temper than was usual with him.
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:44.720]   Meanwhile, the fog and darkness thickened so that people ran about with flaring links,
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:50.760]   proffering their services to go before horses in carriages and conduct them on their way.
[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:56.640]   The ancient tower of a church, whose gruff old bell was always peeping slyly down at
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:02.480]   Scrooge out of a Gothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:07.820]   quarters in the clouds with tremulous vibrations afterwards, as if its teeth were chattering
[00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:10.160]   in its frozen head up there.
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:13.000]   The cold became intense.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.480]   In the main street, at the corner of the court, some laborers were repairing the gas pipes
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:21.720]   and had lighted a great fire in a brazier, round which a party of ragged men and boys
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:27.680]   were gathered, warming their hands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture.
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:32.880]   The water plug, being left in solitude, its overflowings sullenly congealed and turned
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:35.680]   to misanthropic ice.
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:39.840]   The brightness of the shops, where holly sprigs and berries crackled in the lamp heat of the
[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:43.880]   windows, made pale faces ruddy as they passed.
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:49.080]   Poulterers and grocers' trades became a splendid joke, a glorious pageant, with which
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:55.380]   it was next to impossible to believe that such dull principles as bargain and sale had
[00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:56.840]   anything to do.
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:01.520]   The Lord Mayor, in the stronghold of the mighty mansion house, gave orders to his fifty cooks
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:06.620]   and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor's household should, and even the little tailor,
[00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:12.080]   whom he had fined five shillings on the previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:16.400]   the streets, stirred up tomorrow's pudding in his garret while his lean wife and the
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:19.240]   baby sallied out to buy the beef.
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:27.680]   Foggier yet and colder, piercing, searching, biting cold.
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:32.360]   If the good Saint Dunstan had but nipped the evil spirit's nose with a touch of such
[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:37.880]   weather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he would have roared
[00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:39.520]   to lusty purpose.
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:44.920]   The owner of one's scant young nose, gnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are
[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:50.800]   gnawed by dogs, stooped down at Scrooge's keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol,
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:56.160]   but at the first sound of "God bless you, merry gentlemen, may nothing you dismay,"
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:01.000]   Scrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action that the singer fled in terror,
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.680]   leaving the keyhole to the fog and even more congenial frost.
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:10.480]   At length, the hour of shutting up the counting house arrived.
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:17.720]   With an ill will, Scrooge dismounted from his stool and tacitly admitted the fact to
[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:22.720]   the expectant clerk in the tank, who instantly snuffed his candle out and put on his hat.
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:27.400]   "You'll want all day tomorrow, I suppose," said Scrooge.
[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:29.360]   "If quite convenient, sir."
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:33.400]   "It's not convenient," said Scrooge, "and it's not fair.
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:38.760]   If I was to stop half a crown for it, you'd think yourself ill-used, I'll be bound?"
[00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:40.800]   The clerk smiled faintly.
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:48.160]   "And yet," said Scrooge, "you don't think me ill-used when I pay a day's wages for
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:49.800]   no work?"
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:52.280]   The clerk observed that it was only once a year.
[00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:57.880]   "A poor excuse for picking a man's pocket every 25th of December," said Scrooge, buttoning
[00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:59.240]   his greatcoat to the chin.
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:02.040]   "But I suppose you must have the whole day.
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:04.760]   Be here all the earlier next morning."
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:10.380]   The clerk promised that he would, and Scrooge walked out with a growl.
[00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:14.320]   The office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends of his white
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:19.200]   comforter dangling below his waist, for he boasted no greatcoat, went down a slide on
[00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:24.060]   Corn Hill at the end of a lane of boys twenty times in honor of its being Christmas Eve,
[00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:29.440]   and then ran home to Camden Town as hard as he could pelt to play at Blindman's Buff.
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:36.400]   Scrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern, and having read all
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:41.160]   the newspapers and beguiled the rest of the evening with his banker's book, went home
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:42.480]   to bed.
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:48.040]   He lived in chambers which had once belonged to his deceased partner.
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:54.300]   They were a gloomy suite of rooms, in a lowering pile of building-up-a-yard, where it had so
[00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:59.280]   little business to be that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run there when
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:03.600]   it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other houses and forgotten the way out
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:04.600]   again.
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:10.160]   It was old enough now, and dreary enough, for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other
[00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:12.800]   rooms being all let out as offices.
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:17.920]   The yard was so dark that even Scrooge, who knew its every stone, was fain to grope with
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:19.320]   his hands.
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:24.120]   The fog and frost so hung about the black old gateway of the house that it seemed as
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:29.080]   if the genius of the weather sat in mournful meditation on the threshold.
[00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:34.360]   Now it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the knocker on the door
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:37.440]   except that it was very large.
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:42.480]   It is also a fact that Scrooge had seen it night and morning during his whole residence
[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:49.120]   in that place, also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy about him as any man
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:56.400]   in the City of London, even including—which is a bold word—the Corporation Alderman
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:58.120]   and Livery.
[00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:03.640]   Let it also be borne in mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley since
[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:08.320]   his last mention of his seven-years-dead partner that afternoon.
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:12.840]   And then let any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge, having
[00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:19.320]   his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its undergoing any intermediate
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:28.160]   process of change, not a knocker but Marley's face.
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:33.400]   It was not an impenetrable shadow as the other objects in the yard were, but had a dismal
[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:37.200]   light about it, like a bad lobster in a dark cellar.
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:42.320]   It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as Marley used to look, with ghostly
[00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:45.800]   spectacles turned up on its ghostly forehead.
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:51.880]   The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air, and though the eyes were wide
[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:55.600]   open, they were perfectly motionless.
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:59.920]   That and its livid color made it horrible, but its horror seemed to be in spite of the
[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:04.780]   face and beyond its control, rather than a part of its own expression.
[00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:09.560]   As Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.
[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:14.060]   To say that he was not startled or that his blood was not conscious of a terrible sensation
[00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:20.240]   to which it had been a stranger from infancy would be untrue, but he put his hand upon
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:24.920]   the key he had relinquished, turned it sturdily, walked in and lighted the candle.
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:32.340]   He did pause with a moment's ear-resolution before he shut the door, and he did look cautiously
[00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:38.020]   behind it first, as if he half expected to be terrified with the sight of Marley's
[00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:40.640]   pigtail sticking out into the hall.
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:44.560]   But there was nothing on the back of the door except the screws and nuts that held the knocker
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:49.320]   on, so he said, "Poo-poo," and closed it with a bang.
[00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:53.280]   The sound resounded through the house like thunder.
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:57.080]   Every room above and every cask in the wine merchant's cellars below appeared to have
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:00.720]   a separate peal of echoes of its own.
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:03.540]   George was not a man to be frightened by echoes.
[00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:08.180]   He fastened the door and walked across the hall and up the stairs, slowly, too, trimming
[00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:10.780]   his candle as he went.
[00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:16.340]   You may talk vaguely about driving a coach and six up a good old flight of stairs or
[00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:21.340]   through a bad young act of parliament, but I mean to say you might have got a hearse
[00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:26.580]   up that staircase and taken it broadwise with a splinter bar towards the wall and the door
[00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:30.060]   towards the balustrades and done it easy.
[00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:34.240]   There was plenty of width for that and room to spare, which is perhaps the reason why
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:39.340]   Scrooge thought he saw a locomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom.
[00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:43.820]   Half a dozen gas lamps out of the street wouldn't have lighted the entry too well, so you may
[00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:48.060]   suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge's dip.
[00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:50.820]   Up Scrooge went, not carrying a button for that.
[00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:54.380]   "Darkness is cheap," and Scrooge liked it.
[00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:59.560]   But before he shut his heavy door, he walked through his rooms to see that all was right.
[00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:04.820]   He had just enough recollection of the face to desire to do that.
[00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:10.760]   Sitting room, bedroom, lumber room, all as they should be.
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:14.620]   Nobody under the table, nobody under the sofa, a small fire in the grate, spoon and basin
[00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:21.300]   ready, and the little saucepan of gruel, Scrooge had a cold in his head, upon the hob.
[00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:24.220]   Nobody under the bed, nobody in the closet, nobody in his dressing gown, which was hanging
[00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:26.980]   up in a suspicious attitude against the wall.
[00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:32.660]   Lumber room as usual, old fire guard, old shoes, two fish baskets, washing stand on
[00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:35.840]   three legs, and a poker.
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:40.040]   Quite satisfied, he closed his door and locked himself in, double locked himself in, which
[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:41.960]   was not his custom.
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:47.160]   Thus secured against surprise, he took off his cravat, put on his dressing gown and slippers
[00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:52.040]   and his nightcap, and sat down before the fire to take his gruel.
[00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:56.060]   It was a very low fire indeed, nothing on such a bitter night.
[00:27:56.060 --> 00:28:02.480]   He was obliged to sit close to it and brood over it before he could extract the least
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:06.420]   sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel.
[00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:12.000]   The fireplace was an old one, built by some Dutch merchant long ago, and paved all round
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.040]   with quaint Dutch tiles designed to illustrate the scriptures.
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:23.580]   There were canes and ables, pharaoh's daughters, queens of Sheba, angelic messengers descending
[00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:29.920]   through the air on clouds like feather beds, Abraham's, Belshazzar's, apostles putting
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:35.000]   off to sea in butter boats, hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   And yet, that face of Marley, seven years dead, came like the ancient prophet's rod
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.040]   and swallowed up the whole.
[00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:48.800]   If each smooth tile had been a blanket first, with power to shape some picture on its surface
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:53.520]   from the disjointed fragments of his thoughts, there would have been a copy of old Marley's
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:55.320]   head on every one.
[00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:58.960]   "Humbug!" said Scrooge and walked across the room.
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:00.960]   After several turns, he sat down again.
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:06.720]   As he threw his head back in the chair, his glance happened to rest upon a bell, a disused
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:11.980]   bell that hung in the room and communicated, for some purpose now forgotten, with a chamber
[00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:14.720]   in the highest story of the building.
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:23.120]   It was with great astonishment and with a strange, inexplicable dread that, as he looked,
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:26.600]   he saw this bell begin to swing.
[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:32.640]   It swung so softly in the outset that it scarcely made a sound, but soon it rang out loudly
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:35.580]   and so did every bell in the house.
[00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:39.520]   This might have lasted half a minute or a minute, but it seemed an hour.
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:44.600]   The bells ceased as they had begun, together.
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:53.760]   They were succeeded by a clanking noise deep down below, as if some person were dragging
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:59.360]   a heavy chain over the casks in the wine merchant's cellar.
[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:05.480]   Scrooge then remembered to have heard that ghosts in haunted houses were described as
[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:08.480]   dragging chains.
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:12.480]   The cellar door flew open with a booming sound, and then he heard the noise much louder on
[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:16.600]   the floors below, then coming up the stairs, then coming straight towards his door.
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:18.360]   "It's Humbug still," said Scrooge.
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:20.040]   "I won't believe it."
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:24.680]   His color changed, though, when, without a pause, it came on through the heavy door and
[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:27.520]   passed into the room before his eyes.
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:32.400]   Upon its coming in, the dying flame leaped up as though it cried, "I know him!
[00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:37.800]   Marley's ghost!" and fell again.
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:43.240]   The same face, the very same.
[00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:49.000]   Marley in his pigtail, usual waistcoat, tights, and boots, the tassels on the ladder bristling
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.760]   like his pigtail, and his coat skirts, and the hair upon his head.
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:55.920]   The chain he drew was clasped about his middle.
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:31:02.200]   It was long and wound about him like a tail, and it was made, for Scrooge observed it closely,
[00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:10.120]   of cash boxes, keys, padlocks, ledgers, deeds, and heavy purses wrought in steel.
[00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:15.120]   His body was transparent, so that Scrooge, observing him and looking through his waistcoat,
[00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:19.000]   could see the two buttons on his coat behind.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.600]   Scrooge had often heard it said that Marley had no bowels, but he had never believed it
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:24.600]   until now.
[00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:28.240]   No, nor did he believe it even now, though he looked the phantom through and through
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:32.680]   and saw it standing before him, though he felt the chilling influence of its death-cold
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:37.960]   eyes and marked the very texture of the folded kerchief bound around its head and chin, which
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:39.560]   wrapper he had not observed before.
[00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:43.160]   He was still incredulous and fought against his senses.
[00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:46.600]   "How now," said Scrooge, caustic and cold as ever.
[00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:48.400]   "What do you want with me?
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:49.400]   Much?"
[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:51.000]   Marley's voice, no doubt about it.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   "Who are you?"
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.040]   "Ask me who I was."
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:57.840]   "Who were you then?" said Scrooge, raising his voice.
[00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:02.320]   "You're particular for a shade," he was going to say to a shade, but substituted
[00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:03.520]   this is more appropriate.
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:06.840]   "In life I was your partner, Jacob Marley."
[00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:14.080]   "Can you… can you sit down?" asked Scrooge, looking doubtfully at him.
[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:15.080]   "I can."
[00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:17.520]   "Do it then."
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:21.880]   Scrooge asked the question because he didn't know whether a ghost so transparent might
[00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:27.720]   find himself in a condition to take a chair and felt that in the event of its being impossible,
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:31.600]   it might involve the necessity of an embarrassing explanation.
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:35.960]   But the ghost sat down on the opposite side of the fireplace, as if he were quite used
[00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:36.960]   to it.
[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:40.240]   "You don't believe in me," observed the ghost.
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:46.120]   "I don't," said Scrooge, "what evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of
[00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:47.120]   your senses?"
[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:52.680]   "I don't know," said Scrooge, "why do you doubt your senses?"
[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:58.000]   "Because," said Scrooge, "a little thing affects them, a slight disorder of the stomach
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.520]   makes them cheats.
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:06.920]   You may be an undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment
[00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:08.920]   of an underdone potato.
[00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:14.760]   There's more of gravy than of grave about you, whatever you are."
[00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:19.240]   Scrooge was not much in the habit of cracking jokes, nor did he feel in his heart by any
[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:21.520]   means waggish then.
[00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:27.760]   The truth is that he tried to be smart as a means of distracting his own attention and
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:35.720]   keeping down his terror, for the specter's voice disturbed the very marrow in his bones.
[00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:43.560]   To sit, staring at those fixed, glazed eyes in silence for a moment, would play, Scrooge
[00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:45.520]   felt, the very deuce with him.
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:50.960]   There was something very awful, too, in the specter's being provided with an infernal
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:53.200]   atmosphere of its own.
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:57.280]   Scrooge could not feel it himself, but this was clearly the case, for though the ghost
[00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:04.680]   sat perfectly motionless, its hair and skirts and tassels were still agitated as by the
[00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:06.440]   hot vapor from an oven.
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:11.040]   "You see this toothpick," said Scrooge, returning quickly to the charge, for the reason
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:14.680]   just to sign and wishing, though it were only for a second, to divert the vision's stony
[00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:15.920]   gaze from himself.
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:18.320]   "I do," replied the ghost.
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:23.920]   "You're not looking at it," said Scrooge, "but I see it," said the ghost, "notwithstanding."
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:29.760]   "Well," returned Scrooge, "I have but to swallow this, and be, for the rest of my
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:34.800]   days, persecuted by a legion of goblins, all of my own creation.
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:37.800]   Humbug, I tell you, humbug!"
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:43.020]   At this the spirit raised a frightful cry and shook its chain with such a dismal and
[00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:48.080]   appalling noise that Scrooge held on tight to his chair to save himself from falling
[00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:49.200]   in a swoon.
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:53.360]   But how much greater was his horror when the phantom, taking off the bandage round its
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:35:00.200]   head as if it were too warm to wear indoors, its lower jaw dropped down upon its breast.
[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:03.320]   Scrooge fell upon his knees and clasped his hands before his face.
[00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:06.880]   "Mercy," he said, "dreadful apparition, why do you trouble me?"
[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:11.600]   "Man of the worldly mind," replied the ghost, "do you believe in me or not?"
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:16.200]   "I do," said Scrooge, "I must, but why do spirits walk the earth and why do they come
[00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:17.200]   to me?"
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:23.300]   "It is required of every man," the ghost returned, "that the spirit within him should
[00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:29.280]   walk abroad among his fellow men and travel far and wide, and if that spirit goes not
[00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:32.760]   forth in life it is condemned to do so after death.
[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:40.200]   It is doomed to wander through the world, oh woe is me, and witness what it cannot share
[00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:45.960]   but might have shared on earth and turned to happiness."
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:51.600]   Then the specter raised a cry and shook its chain and wrung its shadowy hands.
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:57.080]   "You are fettered," said Scrooge, trembling, "tell me why."
[00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:05.400]   "I wear the chain I forged in life," replied the ghost, "I made it link by link and yard
[00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:06.880]   by yard.
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:13.460]   I girded it on of my own free will, and of my own free will I wore it.
[00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:17.560]   Is its pattern strange to you?"
[00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:20.560]   Scrooge trembled more and more.
[00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:25.880]   "Or would you know," pursued the ghost, "the weight and length of the strong coil
[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:28.080]   you bear yourself?
[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:33.680]   It was full as heavy and as long as this seven Christmas eves ago.
[00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:36.280]   You have labored on it since.
[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:41.680]   It is a ponderous chain."
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:46.920]   Scrooge glanced about him on the floor in the expectation of finding himself surrounded
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:53.640]   by some fifty or sixty fathoms of iron cable, but he could see nothing.
[00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:58.560]   "Jacob," he said imploringly, "old Jacob Marley, tell me more.
[00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:00.120]   Speak comfort to me, Jacob."
[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:03.000]   "I have none to give," the ghost replied.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:10.280]   "It comes from other regions," Ebenezer Scrooge, "and is conveyed by other ministers
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:13.200]   to other kinds of men.
[00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:15.400]   Nor can I tell you what I would.
[00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:18.760]   A very little more is all permitted to me.
[00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:23.840]   I cannot rest, I cannot stay, I cannot linger anywhere.
[00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:28.360]   My spirit never walked beyond our counting house, mark me.
[00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:36.020]   In life my spirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of our money-changing hole, and weary
[00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:39.000]   journeys lie before me."
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:45.160]   It was a habit with Scrooge, whenever he became thoughtful, to put his hands in his breeches'
[00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:46.160]   pocket.
[00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:52.240]   Pondering on what the ghost had said, he did so now, but without lifting up his eyes or
[00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:54.080]   getting off his knees.
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:38:00.720]   "You must have been very slow about it, Jacob," Scrooge observed in a business-like manner,
[00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:03.640]   though with humility and deference.
[00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:05.960]   "Slow?" the ghost repeated.
[00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:09.880]   "Seven years dead," mused Scrooge, "and traveling all the time."
[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:19.840]   "The whole time," said the ghost, "no rest, no peace, incessant torture of remorse."
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:24.160]   "You travel fast?" said Scrooge.
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:27.960]   "On the wings of the wind," replied the ghost.
[00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:34.400]   "You might have got over a great quantity of ground in seven years," said Scrooge.
[00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:39.440]   The ghost, on hearing this, set up another cry and clanked its chain so hideously in
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:44.120]   the dead silence of the night that the ward would have been justified in indicting it
[00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:46.040]   for a nuisance.
[00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:53.640]   "Oh, captive, bound, and double-ironed," cried the phantom, "not to know that ages
[00:38:53.640 --> 00:39:00.520]   of incessant labor by immortal creatures, for this earth must pass into eternity before
[00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:03.740]   the good of which it is susceptible is all developed.
[00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:11.040]   Not to know that any Christian spirit working kindly in its little sphere, whatever it may
[00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:18.040]   be, will find its mortal life too short for its vast means of usefulness.
[00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:25.800]   Not to know that no space of regret can make amends for one life's opportunity misused.
[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:30.360]   Yet, such was I. Oh, such was I."
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:35.480]   "But you were always a good man of business, Jacob," faltered Scrooge, who now began
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:38.100]   to apply this to himself.
[00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:44.520]   "Business," cried the ghost, wringing its hands again, "mankind was my business.
[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:47.640]   The common welfare was my business.
[00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:55.500]   Charity, mercy, forbearance, and benevolence were all my business.
[00:39:55.500 --> 00:40:02.780]   The dealings of my trade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my business."
[00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:08.900]   It held up its chain at arm's length, as if that were the cause of all its unavailing
[00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:12.380]   grief, and flung it heavily upon the ground again.
[00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:18.660]   "At this time of the rolling year," the specter said, "I suffer most.
[00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:24.500]   Why did I walk through crowds of fellow-beings with my eyes turned down, and never raise
[00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:30.500]   them to that blessed star which led the wise men to a poor abode?
[00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:35.980]   Were there no poor homes to which its light would have conducted me?"
[00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:41.340]   Scrooge was very much dismayed to hear the specter going on at this rate, and began to
[00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:42.620]   quake exceedingly.
[00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:47.020]   "Hear me," cried the ghost, "my time is nearly gone."
[00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:51.340]   "I will," said Scrooge, "but don't be hard upon me.
[00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:53.460]   Don't be flowery, Jacob.
[00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:59.380]   How is it that I appear before you in a shape that you can see, I may not tell.
[00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:05.860]   I have sat invisible beside you many and many a day."
[00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:09.820]   It was not an agreeable idea.
[00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:14.060]   Scrooge shivered, and wiped the perspiration from his brow.
[00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:18.340]   "That is no light part of my penance," pursued the ghost.
[00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:26.180]   "I am here tonight to warn you that you have yet a chance and hope of escaping my
[00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:27.180]   fate.
[00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:31.340]   A chance and hope of my procuring, Ebenezer."
[00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:35.580]   "You were always a good friend to me," said Scrooge, "thank ye."
[00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:41.900]   "You will be haunted," resumed the ghost, "by three spirits."
[00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:46.500]   Scrooge's countenance fell almost as low as the ghost's had done.
[00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:52.620]   "Is that the chance and hope you mentioned, Jacob?" he demanded in a faltering voice.
[00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:54.180]   "It is."
[00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:58.300]   "I think I'd rather not," said Scrooge.
[00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:04.860]   "Without their visits," said the ghost, "you cannot hope to shun the path I tread.
[00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:08.980]   Expect the first tomorrow, when the bell tolls one."
[00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:10.620]   "Good night.
[00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:13.900]   Take 'em all at once and have it over, Jacob," hinted Scrooge.
[00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:18.300]   "Expect the second on the next night, at the same hour.
[00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:24.780]   The third upon the next night, when the last stroke of twelve has ceased to vibrate.
[00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:29.300]   Look to see me no more, and look that, for your own sake.
[00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:33.060]   You remember what has passed between us."
[00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:38.660]   When it had said these words, the spectre took its wrapper from the table and bound
[00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:41.420]   it round its head as before.
[00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:46.180]   Scrooge knew this by the smart sound its teeth made when the jaws were brought together by
[00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:47.580]   the bandage.
[00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:53.900]   He ventured to raise his eyes again and found his supernatural visitor confronting him
[00:42:53.900 --> 00:43:00.820]   in an erect attitude, with its chain wound over and about its arm.
[00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:06.820]   The apparition walked backward from him, and at every step it took the window raised itself
[00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:12.500]   a little, so that when the spectre reached it, it was wide open.
[00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:15.300]   It beckoned Scrooge to approach, which he did.
[00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:19.420]   When they were within two paces of each other, Marley's ghost held up its hand, warning
[00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:22.180]   him to come no nearer.
[00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:28.300]   Scrooge stopped, not so much in obedience as in surprise and fear, for on the raising
[00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:35.020]   of the hand he became sensible of confused noises in the air, incoherent sounds of lamentation
[00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:40.500]   and regret, wailings inexpressibly sorrowful and self-accusatory.
[00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:45.300]   The spectre, after listening for a moment, joined in the mournful dirge and floated out
[00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:49.660]   upon the bleak, dark night.
[00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:52.580]   Scrooge followed to the window, desperate in his curiosity.
[00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:54.060]   He looked out.
[00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:59.780]   The air was filled with phantoms, wandering hither and thither in restless haste and moaning
[00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:01.180]   as they went.
[00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:04.420]   Every one of them wore chains like Marley's ghost.
[00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:08.900]   Some few, they might be guilty governments, were linked together.
[00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:10.980]   None were free.
[00:44:10.980 --> 00:44:13.900]   Many had been personally known to Scrooge in their lives.
[00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:19.980]   He had been quite familiar with one old ghost in a white waistcoat, with a monstrous iron
[00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:26.580]   safe attached to its ankle, who cried piteously at being unable to assist a wretched woman
[00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:30.340]   with an infant whom it saw below upon a doorstep.
[00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:38.260]   The misery with them all was, clearly, that they sought to interfere for good in human
[00:44:38.260 --> 00:44:45.820]   matters and had lost the power forever.
[00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:52.340]   Whether these creatures faded into mist or mist enshrouded them, he could not tell.
[00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:57.820]   But they and their spirit voices faded together, and the night became as it had been when he
[00:44:57.820 --> 00:45:00.260]   walked home.
[00:45:00.260 --> 00:45:04.500]   Scrooge closed the window and examined the door by which the ghost had entered.
[00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:11.420]   It was double-locked, as he had locked it with his own hands, and the bolts were undisturbed.
[00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:15.940]   He tried to say, "Humbug," but stopped at the first syllable.
[00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:24.380]   And being from the emotion he had undergone, or the fatigues of the day, or his glimpse
[00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:30.180]   of the invisible world, or the dull conversation of the ghost, or the lateness of the hour
[00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:39.300]   much in need of repose, went straight to bed without undressing, and fell asleep upon the
[00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:44.020]   instant.
[00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:46.020]   Stave II.
[00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:50.140]   The First of the Three Spirits.
[00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:55.620]   When Scrooge awoke, it was so dark that, looking out of bed, he could scarcely distinguish
[00:45:55.620 --> 00:46:00.380]   the transparent window from the opaque walls of his chamber.
[00:46:00.380 --> 00:46:05.820]   He was endeavoring to pierce the darkness with his ferret eyes when the chimes of a
[00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:09.100]   neighboring church struck the four quarters.
[00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:11.020]   So he listened for the hour.
[00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:16.700]   To his great astonishment, the heavy bell went on from six to seven, and from seven
[00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:21.260]   to eight, and regularly up to twelve, then stopped.
[00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:22.260]   Twelve!
[00:46:22.260 --> 00:46:23.820]   It was past two when he went to bed.
[00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:24.820]   The clock was wrong.
[00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:26.940]   An icicle must have gotten into the works.
[00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:27.940]   Twelve!
[00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:32.140]   He touched the spring of his repeater to correct this most preposterous clock.
[00:46:32.140 --> 00:46:36.540]   Its rapid little pulse beat twelve, and stopped.
[00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:40.580]   "Why, it is impossible," said Scrooge, "that I can have slept through a whole day
[00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:41.780]   and far into another night.
[00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:45.560]   It isn't possible that anything has happened to the sun, and this is twelve at noon."
[00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:50.060]   The idea being an alarming one, he scrambled out of bed and groped his way to the window.
[00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:53.580]   He was obliged to rub the frost off with the sleeve of his dressing gown before he could
[00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:57.060]   see anything, and could see very little then.
[00:46:57.060 --> 00:47:02.540]   All he could make out was that it was still very foggy and extremely cold, and that there
[00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:07.820]   was no noise of people running to and fro and making a great stir as there unquestionably
[00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:13.180]   would have been if night had beaten off bright day and taken possession of the world.
[00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:16.880]   This was a great relief, because three days after sight of this first day of exchange
[00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:20.840]   pay to Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge or his order, and so forth, would have become a mere United
[00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:24.400]   States security if there were no days to count by.
[00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:28.240]   Scrooge went to bed again, and thought and thought and thought it over and over and over
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:30.260]   and could make nothing of it.
[00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:33.560]   The more he thought, the more perplexed he was, and the more he endeavored not to think,
[00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:35.320]   the more he thought.
[00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:37.620]   Marley's ghost bothered him exceedingly.
[00:47:37.620 --> 00:47:42.080]   Every time he resolved within himself, after mature inquiry, that it was all a dream, his
[00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:47.760]   mind flew back again like a strong spring released to its first position, and presented
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:52.920]   the same problem to be worked all through—was it a dream or not?
[00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:57.800]   Scrooge lay in this state until the chime had gone three-quarters more, when he remembered,
[00:47:57.800 --> 00:48:01.780]   on a sudden, that the ghost had warned him of a visitation when the bell tolled one.
[00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:07.560]   He resolved to lie awake until the hour was past, and considering that he could no more
[00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:14.680]   go to sleep than go to heaven, this was perhaps the wisest resolution in his power.
[00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:21.080]   The quarter was so long that he was more than once convinced he must have sunk into a doze
[00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:27.760]   unconsciously and missed the clock, a length that broke upon his listening ear.
[00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:33.560]   "Ding, dong, a quarter past," said Scrooge, counting.
[00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:37.880]   "Ding, dong, half-past," said Scrooge.
[00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:42.600]   "Ding, dong, a quarter to it," said Scrooge.
[00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:48.240]   "Ding, dong, the hour itself," said Scrooge triumphantly, "and nothing else."
[00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:56.560]   He spoke before the hour bell sounded, which it now did with a deep, dull, hollow, melancholy
[00:48:56.560 --> 00:49:03.400]   "One," light flashed up in the room upon the instant, and the curtains of his bed were
[00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:04.400]   drawn.
[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:07.560]   The curtains of his bed were drawn aside, I tell you, by a hand, not the curtains at
[00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:11.240]   his feet nor the curtains at his back, but those to which his face was addressed.
[00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:15.400]   The curtains of his bed were drawn aside, and Scrooge, starting up into a half-recumbent
[00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:19.680]   attitude, found himself face to face with the unearthly visitor who drew them, as close
[00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:24.200]   to it as I am now to you, and I am standing in the spirit at your elbow.
[00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:29.920]   It was a strange figure, like a child, but not so like a child as like an old man, viewed
[00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:34.240]   through some supernatural medium, which gave him the appearance of having receded from
[00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:37.600]   the view and being diminished to a child's proportions.
[00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:41.800]   Its hair, which hung about its neck and down its back, was white as if with age, and yet
[00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:45.980]   the face had not a wrinkle in it, and the tenderest bloom was on the skin.
[00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:51.120]   The arms were very long and muscular, the hands the same, as if its hold were of uncommon
[00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:52.120]   strength.
[00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:56.480]   Its legs and feet, most delicately formed, were like those upper members bare.
[00:49:56.480 --> 00:50:01.480]   It wore a tunic of the purest white, and round its waist was bound a lustrous belt, the sheen
[00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:03.340]   of which was beautiful.
[00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:07.880]   It held a branch of fresh green holly in its hand, and, in singular contradiction of that
[00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:12.120]   wintry emblem, had its dress trimmed with summer flowers.
[00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:15.960]   But the strangest thing about it was that from the crown of its head there sprung a
[00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:23.580]   bright clear jet of light, by which all this was visible, and which was doubtless the occasion
[00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:29.360]   of its using, in its duller moments, a great extinguisher for a cap which it now held under
[00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:30.920]   its arm.
[00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:36.160]   Even this, though, when Scrooge looked at it with increasing steadiness, was not its
[00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:38.040]   strangest quality.
[00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:43.720]   For as its belt sparkled and glittered, now in one part and now in another, and what was
[00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:50.760]   light one instant, at another time was dark, so the figure itself fluctuated in its distinctness,
[00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:55.740]   being now a thing with one arm, now with one leg, now with twenty legs, now a pair of legs
[00:50:55.740 --> 00:51:00.080]   without a head, now a head without a body, of which dissolving parts no outline would
[00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:03.160]   be visible in the dense gloom wherein they melted away.
[00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:06.800]   And in the very wonder of this it would be itself again, distinct and clear as ever.
[00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:11.440]   "Are you the spirit, sir, whose coming was foretold to me?" asked Scrooge.
[00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:13.280]   "I am."
[00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:19.600]   The voice was soft and gentle, singularly low as if instead of being so close beside
[00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:21.240]   him it were at a distance.
[00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:23.640]   "Who and what are you?"
[00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:24.640]   Scrooge demanded.
[00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:27.080]   "I am the ghost of Christmas Past."
[00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:28.920]   "Long past?"
[00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:33.080]   Inquired Scrooge, observant of its dwarfish stature.
[00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:36.440]   "No, your past."
[00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:42.200]   Perhaps Scrooge could not have told anybody why, if anybody could have asked him, but
[00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:48.040]   he had a special desire to see the spirit in his cap, and begged him to be covered.
[00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:53.400]   "What!" exclaimed the ghost, "would you so soon put out with worldly hands the light
[00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:54.480]   I give?
[00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:59.280]   Is it not enough that you are one of those whose passions made this cap, and forced me
[00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:03.640]   through whole trains of years to wear it low upon my brow?"
[00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:08.520]   Scrooge reverently disclaimed all intention to offend, or any knowledge of having willfully
[00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:11.680]   bonneted the spirit at any period of his life.
[00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:14.560]   He then made bold to inquire what business brought him there.
[00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:17.400]   "Your welfare," said the ghost.
[00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:20.980]   Scrooge expressed himself much obliged, but could not help thinking that a night of unbroken
[00:52:20.980 --> 00:52:23.800]   rest would have been more conducive to that end.
[00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:27.400]   The spirit must have heard him thinking, for it said immediately, "Your reclamation,
[00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:28.400]   then.
[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:29.400]   Take heed."
[00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:32.920]   It put out its strong hand as it spoke, and clasped him gently by the arm.
[00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:35.080]   "Rise and walk with me."
[00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:38.240]   It would have been in vain for Scrooge to plead that the weather and the hour were not
[00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:42.840]   adapted to pedestrian purposes, that bed was warm and the thermometer a long way below
[00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:46.720]   freezing, that he was clad but lightly in his slippers, dressing gown, and nightcap,
[00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:49.600]   and that he had a cold upon him at that time.
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:53.480]   The grasp, though gentle as a woman's hand, was not to be resisted.
[00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:59.400]   He rose, but, finding that the spirit made towards the window, clasped his robe in supplication.
[00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:03.320]   "I am a mortal," Scrooge remonstrated, "and liable to fall."
[00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:08.280]   "Bear but a touch of my hand, there," said the spirit, laying it upon his heart,
[00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:11.120]   "and you shall be upheld in more than this."
[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:15.320]   As the words were spoken, they passed through the wall, and stood upon an open country road
[00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:17.160]   with fields on either hand.
[00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:19.760]   The city had entirely vanished.
[00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:21.640]   Not a vestige of it was to be seen.
[00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:25.840]   The darkness and the mist had vanished with it, for it was a clear, cold winter day with
[00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:27.200]   snow upon the ground.
[00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:31.760]   "Good heaven," said Scrooge, clasping his hands together as he looked about him, "I
[00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:33.520]   was bred in this place.
[00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:35.280]   I was a boar here."
[00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:38.280]   The spirit gazed upon him mildly.
[00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:41.920]   Its gentle touch, though it had been light and instantaneous, appeared still present
[00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:43.900]   to the old man's sense of feeling.
[00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:48.400]   He was conscious of a thousand odors floating in the air, each one connected with a thousand
[00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:52.040]   thoughts and hopes and joys and cares long, long forgotten.
[00:53:52.040 --> 00:53:56.760]   "Your lip is trembling," said the ghost, "and what is that upon your cheek?"
[00:53:56.760 --> 00:54:02.160]   Scrooge muttered with an unusual catching in his voice that it was a pimple, and begged
[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:04.680]   the ghost to lead him where he would.
[00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:06.680]   "You recollect the way?"
[00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:07.680]   inquired the spirit.
[00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:09.360]   "Remember it!" cried Scrooge with fervor.
[00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:10.840]   "I could walk it blindfold."
[00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:15.040]   "Strange to have forgotten it for so many years," observed the ghost.
[00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:17.000]   "Let us go on."
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:21.920]   They walked along the road, Scrooge recognizing every gate and post and tree, until a little
[00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:26.640]   market town appeared in the distance, with its bridge, its church, and winding river.
[00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:30.640]   Some shaggy ponies now were seen trotting towards them, with boys upon their backs,
[00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:34.600]   who called to other boys in country gigs and carts driven by farmers.
[00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:38.200]   All these boys were in great spirits, and shouted to each other until the broadfields
[00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:42.160]   were so full of merry music that the crisp air laughed to hear it.
[00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:45.840]   "These are but shadows of the things that have been," said the ghost.
[00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:48.440]   "They have no consciousness of us."
[00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:53.320]   The jocund travelers came on, and as they came, Scrooge knew and named them every one.
[00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:55.920]   Why was he rejoiced beyond all bounds to see them?
[00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:59.520]   Why did his cold eye glisten and his heart leap up as they went past?
[00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:03.360]   Why was he filled with gladness when he heard them give each other "Merry Christmas!" as
[00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:07.220]   they parted at crossroads and byways for their several homes?
[00:55:07.220 --> 00:55:09.240]   What was Merry Christmas to Scrooge?
[00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:11.960]   Out upon Merry Christmas, what good had it ever done to him?
[00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:15.440]   "The school is not quite deserted," said the ghost.
[00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:22.240]   "A solitary child, neglected by his friends, is left there still."
[00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:27.440]   Scrooge said he knew it, and he sobbed.
[00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:31.760]   They left the high road by a well-remembered lane, and soon approached a mansion of dull
[00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:36.880]   red brick, with a little weathercock-surmounted cupola on the roof and a bell hanging in it.
[00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:43.080]   It was a large house, but one of broken fortunes, for the spacious offices were little used,
[00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:48.840]   their walls were damp and mossy, their windows broken and their gates decayed, fowls clucked
[00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:54.920]   and strutted in the stables, and the coach houses and sheds were overrun with grass.
[00:55:54.920 --> 00:56:01.280]   Nor was it more retentive of its ancient state within, for entering the dreary hall and glancing
[00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:08.820]   through the open doors of many rooms, they found them poorly furnished, cold, and vast.
[00:56:08.820 --> 00:56:14.240]   There was an earthy savor in the air, a chilly barrenness in the place which associated itself
[00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:20.480]   somehow with too much getting up by candlelight and not too much to eat.
[00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:25.500]   They went, the ghost and Scrooge, across the hall, to a door at the back of the house.
[00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:32.120]   It opened before them and disclosed a long, bare, melancholy room, made barer still by
[00:56:32.120 --> 00:56:36.440]   lines of plain deal forms and desks.
[00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:43.320]   But one of these, a lonely boy, was reading near a feeble fire, and Scrooge sat down upon
[00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:49.520]   a form and wept to see his poor forgotten self as he used to be.
[00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:56.220]   Not a latent echo in the house, not a squeak and scuffle from the mice behind the paneling,
[00:56:56.220 --> 00:57:02.160]   not a drip from the half-thawed water spout in the dull yard behind, not a sigh among
[00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:07.960]   the leafless boughs of one despondent poplar, not the idle swinging of an empty storehouse
[00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:12.880]   door, no, not a clicking in the fire but fell upon the heart of Scrooge with a softening
[00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:18.880]   influence and gave a freer passage to his tears.
[00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:25.000]   The spirit touched him on the arm and pointed to his younger self, intent upon his reading.
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:30.960]   Suddenly, a man in foreign garments, wonderfully real and distinct to look at, stood outside
[00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:35.440]   the window with an axe stuck in his belt, and leading by the bridle an ass laden with
[00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:36.440]   wood.
[00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:38.680]   "Why, it's Ali Baba!" Scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy.
[00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:40.880]   "It's dear, old, honest Ali Baba!
[00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:42.400]   Yes, yes, I know.
[00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:47.000]   One Christmas time, when yonder solitary child was left here all alone, he did come, for
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.600]   the first time, just like that.
[00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:50.600]   Poor boy!"
[00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:55.120]   "And Valentine," said Scrooge, "and his wild brother Orson, there they go!
[00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:58.320]   And what's his name, who was put down in his drawers asleep at the gate of Damascus?
[00:57:58.320 --> 00:57:59.320]   Don't you see him?"
[00:57:59.320 --> 00:58:03.120]   "Sultan's groom, turned upside down by the genie, there he is upon his head!
[00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:04.440]   Serve him right, I'm glad of it!
[00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:06.960]   What business had he to be married to the princess?"
[00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:10.840]   To hear Scrooge expending all the earnestness of his nature on such subjects, in a most
[00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:14.960]   extraordinary voice, between laughing and crying, and to see his heightened and excited
[00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:18.600]   face would have been a surprise to his business friends in the city, indeed.
[00:58:18.600 --> 00:58:22.240]   "There's the parrot!" cried Scrooge, green body and yellow tail, with a thing like
[00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:24.880]   a lettuce growing out of the top of his head, "there he is!
[00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:28.800]   Poor Robinson Crusoe!" he called him, when he came home again after sailing round the
[00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:29.800]   island.
[00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:30.800]   "Poor Robin Crusoe!
[00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:31.800]   Where have you been, Robin Crusoe?"
[00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:35.080]   The man thought he was dreaming, but he wasn't, it was the parrot, you know!
[00:58:35.080 --> 00:58:38.360]   "There goes Friday, running for his life through the little creek!
[00:58:38.360 --> 00:58:39.360]   Hello!
[00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:40.360]   Hello!"
[00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:44.560]   Then, with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his usual character, he said in pity before
[00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:49.160]   his former self, "Poor boy!" and cried again.
[00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:55.000]   "I wish," Scrooge muttered, putting his hands in his pocket, and looking about him
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:59:00.040]   after drying his eyes with his cuff, "but it's too late now."
[00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:03.640]   "What is the matter?" asked the spirit.
[00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:07.360]   "Nothing," said Scrooge, "nothing.
[00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:10.400]   There was a boy singing a Christmas carol at my door last night.
[00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:13.480]   I should like to have given him something, that's all."
[00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:18.960]   The ghost smiled thoughtfully, and waved its hand, saying as it did so, "Let us see
[00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:19.960]   another Christmas."
[00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:27.760]   Scrooge's former self grew larger at the words, and the room became a little darker
[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:29.600]   and more dirty.
[00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:37.200]   The panels shrunk, the windows cracked, fragments of plaster fell out of the ceiling, and the
[00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:39.600]   naked laths were shown instead.
[00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:43.200]   But how all this was brought about Scrooge knew no more than you do.
[00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:47.240]   He only knew that it was quite correct, that everything had happened so, that there he
[00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:54.440]   was, alone, again, when all the other boys had gone home for the jolly holidays.
[00:59:54.440 --> 01:00:00.720]   He was not reading now, but walking up and down despairingly.
[01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:05.320]   Scrooge looked at the ghost, and with a mournful shaking of his head, glanced anxiously towards
[01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:06.800]   the door.
[01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:10.320]   It opened, and a little girl, much younger than the boy, came darting in and putting
[01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:14.960]   her arms about his neck, and often kissing him, addressed him as her "dear, dear brother."
[01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:18.800]   "I have come to bring you home, dear brother," said the child, clapping her tiny hands and
[01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:21.840]   bending down to laugh, "to bring you home, home, home."
[01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:23.880]   "Home, little fan?" returned the boy.
[01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:29.800]   "Yes," said the child, brimful of glee, "home, for good and all, home, forever and ever.
[01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:31.760]   Father is so much kinder than he used to be.
[01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:33.160]   That home's like heaven.
[01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:36.920]   He spoke so gently to me one dear night, when I was going to bed, that I was not afraid
[01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:40.720]   to ask him once more if you might come home.
[01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:44.480]   And he said, 'Yes, you should,' and sent me and a coach to bring you.
[01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:49.320]   And you're to be a man!" said the child, opening her eyes, "and are never to come back here.
[01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:53.160]   But first we're to be together all the Christmas long, and have the merriest time in all the
[01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:54.160]   world."
[01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:57.580]   "You are quite a woman, little fan!" exclaimed the boy.
[01:00:57.580 --> 01:01:02.100]   She clapped her hands and laughed, and tried to touch his head, but being too little, laughed
[01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:04.840]   again and stood on tiptoe to embrace him.
[01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:09.280]   Then she began to drag him in her childish eagerness towards the door, and he, nothing
[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:11.320]   loath to go, accompanied her.
[01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:15.920]   A terrible voice in the hall cried, "Bring down Master Scrooge's box there!"
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:19.720]   And in the hall appeared the schoolmaster himself, who glared on Master Scrooge with
[01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:24.160]   a ferocious condescension, and threw him into a dreadful state of mind by shaking hands
[01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:25.160]   with him.
[01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:29.400]   He then conveyed him and his sister into the various old well of a shivering best parlor
[01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:34.040]   that ever was seen, where the maps upon the wall and the celestial and terrestrial globes
[01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:36.720]   in the windows were waxy with cold.
[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:42.880]   Here he produced a decanter of curiously light wine, and a block of curiously heavy cake,
[01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:46.920]   and administered installments of those dainties to the young people, at the same time sending
[01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:52.160]   out a meager servant to offer a glass of something to the postboy, who answered that he thanked
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:58.520]   the gentleman, but if it was the same tap as he had tasted before, he had rather not.
[01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:03.160]   Master Scrooge's trunk being by this time tied on to the top of the chaise, the children
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:07.840]   bade the schoolmaster good-bye right willingly, and getting into it drove gaily down the garden
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:12.840]   sweep, the quick wheels dashing the hoarfrost and snow from off the dark leaves of the evergreens
[01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:14.480]   like spray.
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:19.720]   "Always a delicate creature, whom a breath might have withered," said the ghost, "but
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:21.200]   she had a large heart."
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:23.000]   "So she had!" cried Scrooge.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.080]   "You're right, I will not gainsay its spirit, God forbid!"
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:30.120]   "She died a woman," said the ghost, "and had, as I think, children."
[01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:32.720]   "One child," Scrooge returned.
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:36.480]   "True," said the ghost, "your nephew."
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:42.720]   Scrooge seemed uneasy in his mind and answered briefly, "Yes."
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:46.620]   Although they had but that moment left the school behind them, they were now in the busy
[01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:52.080]   thoroughfares of a city, where shadowy passengers passed and repassed, where shadowy carts and
[01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:57.080]   coaches battled for the way, and all the strife and tumult of a real city were.
[01:02:57.080 --> 01:03:00.900]   It was made plain enough by the dressing of the shops that here, too, it was Christmas
[01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:04.080]   time again, but it was evening and the streets were lighted up.
[01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:08.120]   The ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door and asked Scrooge if he knew it.
[01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:11.080]   "Know it," said Scrooge, "was I apprenticed here?"
[01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:12.080]   They went in.
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:15.960]   At sight of an old gentleman in a Welsh wig sitting behind such a high desk that if he
[01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:19.840]   had been two inches tall he must have knocked his head against the ceiling, Scrooge cried
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:22.640]   in great excitement, "Why, it's old Fezziwig!
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:25.120]   Bless his heart, it's Fezziwig alive again!"
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:28.480]   Old Fezziwig laid down his pen and looked up at the clock, which pointed to the hour
[01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:29.480]   of seven.
[01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:33.800]   He rubbed his hands, adjusted his capacious waistcoat, laughed all over himself from his
[01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:39.440]   shoes to his organ of benevolence, and called out in a comfortable, oily, rich, fat, jovial
[01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:42.800]   voice, "Yo-ho there, Ebenezer!
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:43.800]   Dick!"
[01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:47.880]   Scrooge's former self, now grown a young man, came briskly in, accompanied by his fellow
[01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:48.880]   apprentice.
[01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:51.040]   "Dick Wilkins, to be sure," said Scrooge to the ghost.
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:52.660]   "Bless me, yes, there he is!
[01:03:52.660 --> 01:03:54.720]   He was very much attached to me, was Dick?
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:55.720]   Poor Dick!
[01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:56.720]   Dear, dear!"
[01:03:56.720 --> 01:04:00.560]   "Yo-ho, my boys," said Fezziwig, "no more work tonight, Christmas Eve!"
[01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:01.560]   "Dick!
[01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:02.560]   Christmas!
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:03.560]   Ebenezer!"
[01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:06.480]   "Let's have the shutters up," cried old Fezziwig with a sharp clap of his hands, "before
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:08.600]   a man can say Jack Robinson!"
[01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:11.240]   You wouldn't believe how those two fellows went at it.
[01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:15.360]   They charged into the street with the shutters, one, two, three, had 'em up in their places,
[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:19.280]   four, five, six, barred 'em and pinned 'em, seven, eight, nine, and came back before you
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:21.560]   could have got to twelve, panting like racehorses.
[01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:25.760]   "Hilly-ho!" cried old Fezziwig, skipping down from the high desk with wonderful agility.
[01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:28.360]   "Clear away, my lads, and let's have lots of room here!
[01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:29.360]   Hilly-ho, Dick!
[01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:30.360]   Drop it, Ebenezer!"
[01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:31.360]   "Clear away!"
[01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:33.520]   There was nothing they wouldn't have cleared away or couldn't have cleared away with old
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:34.840]   Fezziwig looking on.
[01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:36.000]   It was done in a minute.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.620]   Every movable was packed off, as if it were dismissed from public life forevermore.
[01:04:39.620 --> 01:04:42.840]   The floor was swept in water, the lamps were trimmed, fuel was heaped upon the fire, and
[01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:47.560]   the warehouse was as snug and warm and dry and bright a ballroom as you would desire
[01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:49.360]   to see upon a winter's night.
[01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:52.680]   In came a fiddler with a music book and went up to the lofty desk and made an orchestra
[01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:55.460]   of it and tuned like fifty stomachaches.
[01:04:55.460 --> 01:04:59.280]   In came Mrs. Fezziwig, one vast, substantial smile.
[01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:02.880]   In came the three Miss Fezziwigs, beaming and lovable.
[01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:05.920]   In came the six young followers whose hearts they broke.
[01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:08.800]   In came all the young men and women employed in the business.
[01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:11.600]   In came the housemaid with her cousin, the baker.
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:14.860]   In came the cook with her brother's particular friend, the milkman.
[01:05:14.860 --> 01:05:18.200]   In came the boy from over the way who was suspected of not having bored enough from
[01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:23.040]   his master, trying to hide himself behind the girl from next door, but one who was proved
[01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:25.440]   to have had her ears pulled by her mistress.
[01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:30.240]   And they all came, one after another, some shyly, some boldly, some gracefully, some
[01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:32.840]   awkwardly, some pushing, some pooling.
[01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:36.200]   In they all came, any how and every how.
[01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:39.800]   Away they all went, twenty couple at once, hands half round and back again the other
[01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:44.880]   way, down the middle and up again, round and round in various stages of affectionate grouping.
[01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:48.480]   Old top couple always turning up in the wrong place, new top couple starting off again as
[01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:52.880]   soon as they got there, all top couples at last, and not a bottom one to help them.
[01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:56.800]   When this result was brought about, old Fezziwig, clapping his hands to stop the dance, cried
[01:05:56.800 --> 01:06:01.360]   out, "Well done," and the fiddler plunged his hot face into a pot of porter, especially
[01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:02.980]   provided for that purpose.
[01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:08.400]   But scorning rest upon his reappearance, he instantly began again, though there were no
[01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:13.200]   dancers yet, as if the other fiddler had been carried home exhausted on a shutter, and he
[01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:17.880]   were a brand new man resolved to beat him out of sight or perish.
[01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:22.240]   There were more dances, and there were forfeits, and more dances, and there was cake, and there
[01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:26.000]   was negus, and there was a great piece of cold roast, and there was a great piece of
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.280]   cold boiled, and there were mince pies and plenty of beer.
[01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:33.040]   But the great effect of the evening came after the roast and boiled, when the fiddler, an
[01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:36.720]   artful dog, mind, the sort of man who knew his business better than you or I could have
[01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:41.440]   told it him, struck up Sir Roger de Coverley, then old Fezziwig stood out to dance with
[01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:45.360]   Mrs. Fezziwig, top couple too, with a good stiff piece of work cut out for them, three
[01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:49.000]   or four and twenty pair of partners, people who were not to be trifled with, people who
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.600]   would dance and had no notion of walking.
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:55.060]   But if they had been twice as many, ah, four times, old Fezziwig would have been a match
[01:06:55.060 --> 01:06:57.480]   for them, and so would Mrs. Fezziwig.
[01:06:57.480 --> 01:07:02.880]   As to her, she was worthy to be his partner in every sense of the term, if that's not
[01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:05.160]   high praise, tell me higher and I'll use it.
[01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:10.920]   A positive light appeared to issue from Fezziwig's calves, they shone in every part of the dance
[01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:12.320]   like moons.
[01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:15.820]   You couldn't have predicted at any given time what would have become of them next.
[01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:19.720]   And when old Fezziwig and Mrs. Fezziwig had gone all through the dance, advance and retire,
[01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:22.760]   both hands to your partner, bow and curtsy, corkscrew, thread the needle, and back again
[01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:27.440]   to your place, Fezziwig cut, cut so deftly that he appeared to wink with his legs and
[01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:30.720]   came upon his feet again without a stagger.
[01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:34.760]   When the clock struck eleven, this domestic ball broke up.
[01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:38.160]   Mr. and Mrs. Fezziwig took their stations, one on either side of the door, and shaking
[01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:42.600]   hands with every person individually as he or she went out, wished him or her a merry
[01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:43.760]   Christmas.
[01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:48.120]   When everybody had retired but the two prentices, they did the same to them, and thus the cheerful
[01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:51.760]   voices died away and the lads were left to their beds, which were under a counter in
[01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:53.480]   the back shop.
[01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:58.580]   During the whole of this time, Scrooge had acted like a man out of his wits.
[01:07:58.580 --> 01:08:01.960]   His heart and soul were in the scene and with his former self.
[01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:07.880]   He corroborated everything, remembered everything, enjoyed everything, and underwent the strangest
[01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:09.080]   agitation.
[01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:12.880]   It was not until now, when the bright faces of his former self and Dick returned from
[01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:16.960]   them, that he remembered the ghost and became conscious that it was looking full upon him,
[01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:19.160]   while the light upon its head burnt very clear.
[01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:24.200]   "A small matter," said the ghost, "to make these silly folks so full of gratitude."
[01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:25.440]   "Small!"
[01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:26.760]   echoed Scrooge.
[01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:30.160]   The spirit signed to him to listen to the two apprentices who were pouring out their
[01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:35.800]   hearts in praise of Fezziwig, and when he had done so said, "Why, is it not?
[01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:40.320]   He has spent but a few pounds of your mortal money, three or four perhaps.
[01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:42.560]   Is that so much that he deserves this praise?"
[01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:46.240]   "It isn't that," said Scrooge, heeded by the remark, and speaking unconsciously like
[01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:47.880]   his former, not his latter self.
[01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:49.520]   "It isn't that, spirit.
[01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:56.320]   He has the power to render us happy or unhappy, to make our service light or burdensome, a
[01:08:56.320 --> 01:08:58.560]   pleasure or a toil.
[01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:05.380]   Say that his power lies in words and looks, in things so slight and insignificant that
[01:09:05.380 --> 01:09:07.440]   it is impossible to add and count 'em up.
[01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:08.440]   What then?
[01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:13.600]   The happiness he gives is quite as great as if it cost a fortune."
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:16.600]   He felt the spirit's glance and stopped.
[01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:19.960]   "What is the matter?" asked the ghost.
[01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:22.800]   "Nothing particular," said Scrooge.
[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:25.080]   "Something, I think?"
[01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:28.760]   "No," said Scrooge, "no.
[01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:34.640]   I should like to be able to say a word or two to my clerk just now, that's all."
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:39.200]   His former self turned down the lamps as he gave utterance to the wish, and Scrooge and
[01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:42.560]   the ghost again stood side by side in the open air.
[01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:47.160]   "My time grows short," observed the spirit, "quick."
[01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:51.000]   This was not addressed to Scrooge or to anyone whom he could see, but it produced an immediate
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:54.300]   effect, for again Scrooge saw himself.
[01:09:54.300 --> 01:09:58.120]   He was older now, a man in the prime of life.
[01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:03.620]   His face had not the harsh and rigid lines of later years, but it had begun to wear the
[01:10:03.620 --> 01:10:06.920]   signs of care and avarice.
[01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:13.860]   There was an eager, greedy, restless motion in the eye, which showed the passion that
[01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:18.880]   had taken root and where the shadow of the growing tree would fall.
[01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:25.200]   He was not alone, but sat by the side of a fair young girl in a morning dress, in whose
[01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:30.040]   eyes there were tears which sparkled in the light that shone out of the ghost of Christmas
[01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:31.040]   past.
[01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:36.560]   "It matters little," she said softly, "to you very little.
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:41.400]   Another idol has displaced me, and if it can cheer and comfort you in time to come, as
[01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:45.200]   I would have tried to do, I have no just cause to grieve."
[01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:48.980]   "What idol has displaced you?" he rejoined.
[01:10:48.980 --> 01:10:50.840]   "A golden one."
[01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:54.240]   "This is the even-handed dealing of the world," he said.
[01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:58.720]   "There is nothing on which it is so hard as poverty, and there is nothing it professes
[01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:01.600]   to condemn with such severity as the pursuit of wealth."
[01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:06.200]   "You fear the world too much," she answered gently.
[01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:12.000]   "All your other hopes have merged into the hope of being beyond the chance of its sordid
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.000]   reproach.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:22.440]   I have seen your nobler aspirations fall off, one by one, until the master-passion gain
[01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:25.000]   engrosses you, have I not?"
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:30.120]   "What then?" he retorted. "Even if I have grown so much wiser, what then? I am not changed
[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:31.120]   towards you."
[01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:33.280]   She shook her head.
[01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:34.880]   "Am I?"
[01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:42.560]   "Our contract is an old one. It was made when we were both poor, and content to be so, until
[01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:50.080]   in good season we could improve our worldly fortune by our patient industry. You are changed.
[01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:53.240]   When it was made, you were another man."
[01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:56.240]   "I was a boy," he said impatiently.
[01:11:56.240 --> 01:12:01.520]   "Your own feeling tells you that you were not what you are," she returned.
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:09.400]   "I am. That which promised happiness when we were one in heart is fraught with misery
[01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:15.600]   now that we are two. How often and how keenly I have thought of this, I will not say. It
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:20.640]   is enough that I have thought of it, and can release you."
[01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:22.880]   "Have I ever sought release?"
[01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:25.440]   "In words, no. Never."
[01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:26.840]   "In what, then?"
[01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:35.320]   "In a changed nature, in an altered spirit, in another atmosphere of life, another hope
[01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:41.880]   as its great end, in everything that made my love of any worth or value in your sight.
[01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:48.240]   If this had never been between us," said the girl, looking mildly but with steadiness upon
[01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:54.040]   him, "tell me, would you seek me out and try to win me now?"
[01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:55.960]   "Ah, no."
[01:12:55.960 --> 01:13:00.160]   He seemed to yield to the justice of this supposition in spite of himself.
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:03.160]   But he said with a struggle, "You think not."
[01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:08.860]   "I would gladly think otherwise if I could," she answered. "Heaven knows. When I have learned
[01:13:08.860 --> 01:13:15.680]   a truth like this, I know how strong and irresistible it must be. But if you were free today, tomorrow,
[01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:21.120]   yesterday, can even I believe that you would choose a dowerless girl, you who in your very
[01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:28.760]   confidence with her, weigh everything by gain, or choosing her if for a moment you were false
[01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:34.840]   enough to your one guiding principle to do so, do I not know that your repentance and
[01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:44.020]   regret would surely follow? I do, and I release you, with a full heart, for the love of him
[01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:46.160]   you once were."
[01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:52.240]   He was about to speak, but with her head turned away from him she resumed. "You may, the memory
[01:13:52.240 --> 01:14:00.600]   of what is past half makes me hope you will, have pain in this, a very, very brief time,
[01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:07.060]   and you will dismiss the recollection of it gladly as an unprofitable dream, from which
[01:14:07.060 --> 01:14:13.200]   it happened well that you awoke. May you be happy in the life you have chosen."
[01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:20.040]   She left him and they parted. "Spirit," said Scrooge, "show me no more. Conduct me home.
[01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:22.040]   Why do you delight to torture me?"
[01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:27.540]   "One shadow more," exclaimed the ghost. "No more!" cried Scrooge. "No more! I don't wish
[01:14:27.540 --> 01:14:29.960]   to see it! Show me no more!"
[01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:35.080]   But the relentless ghost pinioned him in both his arms and forced him to observe what happened
[01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:41.640]   next. They were in another scene and place, a room not very large or handsome, but full
[01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:48.300]   of comfort. Near to the winter fire sat a beautiful young girl, so like that last that
[01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:54.560]   Scrooge believed it was the same until he saw her, now a comely matron sitting opposite
[01:14:54.560 --> 01:15:01.920]   her daughter. The noise in this room was perfectly tumultuous, for there were more children there
[01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:06.440]   than Scrooge and his agitated state of mind could count, and unlike the celebrated herd
[01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:11.880]   in the poem, they were not forty children conducting themselves like one, but every
[01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:18.480]   child was conducting itself like forty. The consequences were uproarious beyond belief,
[01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:23.360]   but no one seemed to care. On the contrary, the mother and daughter laughed heartily and
[01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:28.160]   enjoyed it very much, and the latter, soon beginning to mingle in the sports, got pillaged
[01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:31.320]   by the young brigands most ruthlessly.
[01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:35.800]   What would I not have given to be one of them? Though I never could have been so rude, no,
[01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:40.680]   I wouldn't for the wealth of all the world have crushed that braided hair and torn it
[01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:44.280]   down, and for the precious little shoe, I wouldn't have plucked it off, God bless
[01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:49.640]   my soul, to save my life. As to measuring her waist in sport, as they did, bold young
[01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:54.120]   brood, I couldn't have done it. I should have expected my arm to have grown round it
[01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:59.720]   for a punishment and never come straight again, and yet I should have dearly liked Ione to
[01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:04.760]   have touched her lips, to have questioned her that she might have opened them, to have
[01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:09.960]   looked upon the lashes of her downcast eyes and never raised a blush, to have let loose
[01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:15.480]   waves of hair, an inch of which would be a keepsake beyond price. In short, I should
[01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:21.400]   have liked, I do confess, to have had the lightest license of a child, and yet to have
[01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:25.640]   been man enough to know its value. But now a knocking at the door was heard, and such
[01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:31.440]   a rush immediately ensued that she, with laughing face and plundered dress, was borne towards
[01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:36.240]   it, the center of a flushed and boisterous group, just in time to greet the father, who
[01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:42.160]   came home attended by a man laden with Christmas toys and presents. Then the shouting and the
[01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:47.080]   struggling and the onslaught that was made on the defenseless porter, the scaling him
[01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:53.280]   with chairs for ladders to dive into his pockets, despoil him of brown paper parcels, hold on
[01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:58.560]   tight by his cravat, hug him round his neck, pummel his back and kick his legs in irrepressible
[01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:02.800]   affection, the shouts of wonder and delight with which the development of every package
[01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:07.600]   was received, the terrible announcement that the baby had been taken in the act of putting
[01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:11.600]   a doll's frying pan into his mouth and was more than suspected of having swallowed a
[01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:16.720]   fictitious turkey glued on a wooden platter, the immense relief of finding this a false
[01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:25.200]   alarm, the joy and gratitude and ecstasy, they are all indescribable alike. It is enough
[01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:30.160]   that by degrees the children and their emotions got out of the parlor and by one stare at
[01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:37.600]   a time up to the top of the house where they went to bed, and so subsided. And now Scrooge
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:42.920]   looked on more attentively than ever, when the master of the house, having his daughter
[01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:48.560]   leaning fondly on him, sat down with her and her mother at his own fireside, and when he
[01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:52.920]   thought that such another creature quite as graceful and as full of promise might have
[01:17:52.920 --> 01:18:00.880]   called him father, and been a springtime in the haggard winter of his life, his sight
[01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:02.840]   grew very dim indeed.
[01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:07.200]   "Bell," said the husband, turning to his wife with a smile, "I saw an old friend of yours
[01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:08.200]   this afternoon."
[01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:09.640]   "Who was it?"
[01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:10.640]   "Guess."
[01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:15.040]   "How can I? Tut, don't I know?" she added in the same breath, laughing as he laughed.
[01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:16.040]   "Mr. Scrooge."
[01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:21.400]   "Mr. Scrooge it was. I passed his office window, and as it was not shut up and he had a candle
[01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:27.160]   inside I could scarcely help seeing him. His partner lies upon the point of death, I hear,
[01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:30.920]   and there he sat alone, quite alone in the world, I do believe."
[01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:36.760]   "Spirit," said Scrooge in a broken voice, "remove me from this place."
[01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:43.040]   "I told you these were shadows of the things that have been," said the ghost, "that they
[01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:45.320]   are what they are. Do not blame me."
[01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:48.440]   "Remove me!" Scrooge exclaimed. "I cannot bear it!"
[01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:52.600]   He turned upon the ghost and seeing that it looked upon him with a face in which in some
[01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:57.760]   strange way there were fragments of all the faces that had shown him, wrestled with it,
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:19:01.120]   "Leave me! Take me back! Haunt me no longer!"
[01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:05.560]   In the struggle, if that can be called a struggle, in which the ghost with no visible resistance
[01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:10.480]   on its own part was undisturbed by any effort of its adversary, Scrooge observed that its
[01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:15.800]   light was burning high and bright, and dimly connecting that with its influence over him,
[01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:22.120]   he seized the extinguisher cap and by a sudden action pressed it down upon its head. The
[01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:26.920]   spirit dropped beneath it so that the extinguisher covered its whole form, but though Scrooge
[01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:31.820]   pressed it down with all his force, he could not hide the light which streamed from under
[01:19:31.820 --> 01:19:38.120]   it in an unbroken flood upon the ground. He was conscious of being exhausted and overcome
[01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:44.280]   by an irresistible drowsiness and further of being in his own bedroom. He gave the cap
[01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:50.440]   a parting squeeze in which his hand relaxed and had barely time to reel to bed before
[01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:56.880]   he sank into a heavy sleep.
[01:19:56.880 --> 01:20:03.480]   Stave III, the second of the three spirits. Awaking in the middle of a prodigiously tough
[01:20:03.480 --> 01:20:09.040]   snore and sitting up in bed to get his thoughts together, Scrooge had no occasion to be told
[01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:14.480]   that the bell was again upon the stroke of one. He felt that he was restored to consciousness
[01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:18.760]   in the right nick of time for the special purpose of holding a conference with the second
[01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:23.720]   messenger dispatched to him through Jacob Marley's intervention. But finding that
[01:20:23.720 --> 01:20:30.200]   he turned uncomfortably cold when he began to wonder which of his curtains this new specter
[01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:36.040]   would draw back, he put them every one aside with his own hands and lying down again established
[01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:42.000]   a sharp lookout all round the bed, for he wished to challenge the spirit on the moment
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:47.440]   of its appearance and did not wish to be taken by surprise and made nervous. Gentlemen of
[01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:53.240]   the free and easy sort, who plumed themselves on being acquainted with a move or two and
[01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:58.800]   being usually equal to the time of day, expressed the wide range of their capacity for adventure
[01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:05.040]   by observing that they are good for anything from pitch and toss to manslaughter, between
[01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:09.600]   which opposite extremes no doubt there lies a tolerably wide and comprehensive range of
[01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:15.160]   subjects. Without venturing for Scrooge quite as heartily as this, I don't mind calling
[01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:20.480]   on you to believe that he was ready for a good broad field of strange appearances and
[01:21:20.480 --> 01:21:28.160]   that nothing between a baby and rhinoceros would have astonished him very much. Now,
[01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:34.520]   being prepared for almost anything, he was not by any means prepared for nothing and
[01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:39.200]   consequently when the bell struck one and no shape appeared, he was taken with a violent
[01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:48.080]   fit of trembling. Five minutes, ten minutes, a quarter of an hour went by yet nothing came.
[01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:52.960]   All this time he lay upon his bed, the very core and center of a blaze of ruddy light
[01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:58.140]   which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the hour in which being only light was more
[01:21:58.140 --> 01:22:04.480]   alarming than a dozen ghosts, as he was powerless to make out what it meant or would be at,
[01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:08.560]   and was sometimes apprehensive that he might be at that very moment an interesting case
[01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:14.140]   of spontaneous combustion without having the consolation of knowing it. At last, however,
[01:22:14.140 --> 01:22:18.800]   he began to think as you or I would have thought at first, for it is always the person not
[01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:23.280]   in the predicament who knows what ought to have been done in it and would unquestionably
[01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:27.560]   have done it too. At last, I say, he began to think that the source and secret of this
[01:22:27.560 --> 01:22:33.080]   ghostly light might be in the adjoining room from whence, on further tracing it, it seemed
[01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:38.540]   to shine. This idea taking full possession of his mind, he got up softly and shuffled
[01:22:38.540 --> 01:22:43.140]   in his slippers to the door. The moment Scrooge's hand was on the lock, a strange voice called
[01:22:43.140 --> 01:22:52.240]   him by his name and bade him enter. He obeyed. It was his own room. There was no doubt about
[01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:57.540]   that, but it had undergone a surprising transformation. The walls and ceilings were so hung with
[01:22:57.540 --> 01:23:04.220]   living green that it looked a perfect grove from every part of which bright gleaming berries
[01:23:04.220 --> 01:23:10.400]   glistened. The crisp leaves of holly, mistletoe, and ivy reflected back the light as if so
[01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:14.940]   many little mirrors had been scattered there and such a mighty blaze went roaring up the
[01:23:14.940 --> 01:23:20.860]   chimneys as that dull petrification of a hearth had never known in Scrooge's time, or Marley's,
[01:23:20.860 --> 01:23:27.380]   or for many and many a winter season gone. Heaped up on the floor to form a kind of throne
[01:23:27.380 --> 01:23:35.000]   were turkeys, geese, game, poultry, brawn, great joints of meat, sucking pigs, long wreaths
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:41.180]   of sausages, mince pies, plum puddings, barrels of oysters, red-hot chestnuts, cherry-cheeked
[01:23:41.180 --> 01:23:48.040]   apples, juicy oranges, luscious pears, immense twelfth cakes, and seething bowls of punch
[01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:54.660]   that made the chamber dim with their delicious steam. In easy state upon this couch there
[01:23:54.660 --> 01:24:01.940]   sat a jolly giant, glorious to see, who bore a glowing torch in shape not unlike Plenty's
[01:24:01.940 --> 01:24:07.140]   horn and held it up high up to shed its light on Scrooge as he came peeping round the door.
[01:24:07.140 --> 01:24:12.140]   "Come in!" exclaimed the ghost. "Come in and know me better, man!" Scrooge entered
[01:24:12.140 --> 01:24:17.740]   timidly and hung his head before the spirit. He was not the dogged Scrooge he had been,
[01:24:17.740 --> 01:24:23.220]   and though the spirit's eyes were clear and kind, he did not like to meet them. "I
[01:24:23.220 --> 01:24:28.420]   am the ghost of Christmas present!" said the spirit. "Look upon me!" Scrooge
[01:24:28.420 --> 01:24:36.540]   reverently did so. It was clothed in one simple green robe or mantle bordered with white fur.
[01:24:36.540 --> 01:24:41.460]   This garment hung so loosely on the figure that its capacious breast was bare, as if
[01:24:41.460 --> 01:24:47.140]   disdaining to be warded or concealed by any artifice. Its feet, observable beneath the
[01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:51.380]   ample folds of the garment, were also bare, and on its head it wore no other covering
[01:24:51.380 --> 01:24:57.740]   than a holly wreath, set here and there with shining icicles. Its dark brown curls were
[01:24:57.740 --> 01:25:04.660]   long and free, free as its genial face, its sparkling eye, its open hand, its cheery voice,
[01:25:04.660 --> 01:25:10.060]   its unconstrained demeanor, and its joyful air. Girded round its middle was an antique
[01:25:10.060 --> 01:25:15.020]   scabbard, but no sword was in it, and the ancient sheath was eaten up with rust.
[01:25:15.020 --> 01:25:20.340]   "You have never seen the like of me before!" exclaimed the spirit. "Never!" Scrooge
[01:25:20.340 --> 01:25:25.220]   made answer to it. "Have never walked forth with the younger members of my family, meaning,
[01:25:25.220 --> 01:25:30.260]   for I am very young, my elder brother is born in these later years," pursued the phantom.
[01:25:30.260 --> 01:25:35.620]   "I don't think I have," said Scrooge. "I'm afraid I have not. Have you had many brothers,
[01:25:35.620 --> 01:25:36.620]   spirit?"
[01:25:36.620 --> 01:25:38.980]   "More than 1,800," said the ghost.
[01:25:38.980 --> 01:25:45.420]   "A tremendous family to provide for," muttered Scrooge. The ghost of Christmas present rose.
[01:25:45.420 --> 01:25:49.460]   "Spirit," said Scrooge submissively, "conduct me where you will."
[01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:54.660]   I went forth last night on compulsion, and I learnt a lesson which is working now. Tonight,
[01:25:54.660 --> 01:25:57.620]   if you have aught to teach me, let me profit by it.
[01:25:57.620 --> 01:26:04.660]   "Touch my robe!" Scrooge did as he was told, and held it fast. Holly, mistletoe, red berries,
[01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:09.940]   ivy, turkeys, geese, game, poultry, brawn, meat, pigs, sausages, oysters, pies, puddings,
[01:26:09.940 --> 01:26:14.740]   fruit, and punch all vanished instantly. So did the room, the fire, the ready glow, the
[01:26:14.740 --> 01:26:19.460]   hour of night, and they stood in the city streets on Christmas morning, where, for the
[01:26:19.460 --> 01:26:24.560]   weather was severe, the people made a rough but brisk and not unpleasant kind of music,
[01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:27.940]   in scraping the snow from the pavement in front of their dwellings and from the tops
[01:26:27.940 --> 01:26:32.340]   of their houses, whence it was mad delight to the boys to see it come plumping down into
[01:26:32.340 --> 01:26:37.020]   the road below, and splitting into artificial little snowstorms.
[01:26:37.020 --> 01:26:41.740]   The house fronts looked black enough, and the windows blacker, contrasting with the
[01:26:41.740 --> 01:26:46.820]   smooth white sheet of snow upon the roofs, and with the dirtier snow upon the ground,
[01:26:46.820 --> 01:26:51.900]   which last deposit had been ploughed up in deep furrows by the heavy wheels of carts
[01:26:51.900 --> 01:26:57.160]   and wagons, furrows that crossed and recrossed each other hundreds of times, where the great
[01:26:57.160 --> 01:27:02.540]   streets branched off and made intricate channels hard to trace in the thick yellow mud and
[01:27:02.540 --> 01:27:10.060]   icy water. The sky was gloomy, and the shortest streets were choked up with a dingy mist,
[01:27:10.060 --> 01:27:16.540]   half thawed, half frozen, whose heavier particles descended in a shower of sooty atoms, as if
[01:27:16.540 --> 01:27:21.500]   all the chimneys in Great Britain had by one consent caught fire and were blazing away
[01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:26.180]   to their dear hearts' content. There was nothing very cheerful in the climate or the
[01:27:26.180 --> 01:27:33.140]   town, and yet was there an air of cheerfulness abroad, that the clearest summer air and brightest
[01:27:33.140 --> 01:27:38.620]   summer sun might have endeavored to diffuse in vain? For the people who were shoveling
[01:27:38.620 --> 01:27:43.540]   away on the housetops were jovial and full of glee, calling out to one another from the
[01:27:43.540 --> 01:27:48.860]   parapets, and now and then exchanging a facetious snowball, better-natured missile far than
[01:27:48.860 --> 01:27:53.860]   many a wordy jest, laughing heartily if it went right, and not less heartily if it went
[01:27:53.860 --> 01:27:59.920]   wrong. The poultry shops were still half open, and the fruterers were radiant in their glory.
[01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:04.900]   There were great, round, pot-bellied baskets of chestnuts, shaped like the waistcoats of
[01:28:04.900 --> 01:28:09.740]   jolly old gentlemen, lolling at the doors and tumbling out into the street in their
[01:28:09.740 --> 01:28:16.340]   apoplectic opulence. There were ruddy, brown-faced, broad-girthed Spanish onions, shining in the
[01:28:16.340 --> 01:28:22.500]   fatness of their growth like Spanish friars, and winking from their shelves in wanton slyness
[01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:27.740]   at the girls as they went by, and glanced demurely at the hung-up mistletoe. There were
[01:28:27.740 --> 01:28:33.260]   pears and apples, clustered high in blooming pyramids. There were bunches of grapes made
[01:28:33.260 --> 01:28:38.580]   in the shopkeeper's benevolence to dangle from conspicuous hooks that people's mouths
[01:28:38.580 --> 01:28:45.300]   might water gratis as they passed. There were piles of filberts, mossy and brown, recalling
[01:28:45.300 --> 01:28:50.380]   in their fragrance ancient walks among the woods and pleasant shufflings ankle-deep through
[01:28:50.380 --> 01:28:56.020]   withered leaves. There were Norfolk biffins, squat and swarthy, setting off the yellow
[01:28:56.020 --> 01:29:01.440]   of the oranges and lemons, and in the great compactness of their juicy persons, urgently
[01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:06.380]   entreating and beseeching to be carried home in paper bags and eaten after dinner. The
[01:29:06.380 --> 01:29:11.900]   very gold and silver fish set forth among these choice fruits in a bowl, though members
[01:29:11.900 --> 01:29:17.100]   of a dull and stagnant-blooded race appeared to know that there was something going on,
[01:29:17.100 --> 01:29:23.100]   and to a fish went gasping round and round their little world in slow and passionless
[01:29:23.100 --> 01:29:30.940]   excitement. The grocers—oh, the grocers!—nearly closed with perhaps two shutters down or one,
[01:29:30.940 --> 01:29:36.040]   but through those gaps such glimpses. It was not alone that the scales descending on the
[01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:41.320]   counter made a merry sound, or that the twine and roller parted company so briskly, or that
[01:29:41.320 --> 01:29:45.520]   the canisters were rattled up and down like juggling tricks, or even that the blended
[01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:49.880]   scents of tea and coffee were so grateful to the nose, or even that the raisins were
[01:29:49.880 --> 01:29:55.760]   so plentiful and rare, the almonds so extremely white, the sticks of cinnamon so long and
[01:29:55.760 --> 01:30:01.080]   great, the other spices so delicious, the candied fruit so caked and spotted with molten
[01:30:01.080 --> 01:30:07.000]   sugar as to make the coldest lookers on feel faint and subsequently bilious. Nor was it
[01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:12.960]   that the figs were moist and pulpy, or that the French plums blushed in modest tartness
[01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:17.760]   from their highly decorated boxes, or that everything was good to eat and in its Christmas
[01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:22.400]   dress. But the customers were all so hurried and so eager in the hopeful promise of the
[01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:26.960]   day that they tumbled up against each other at the door, crashing their wicker baskets
[01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:31.600]   wildly and left their purchases upon the counter, and came running back to fetch them, and committed
[01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:36.440]   hundreds of the like mistakes in the best humor possible, while the grocer and his people
[01:30:36.440 --> 01:30:40.540]   were so frank and fresh that the polished hearts with which they fastened their aprons
[01:30:40.540 --> 01:30:47.000]   behind might have been their own worn outside for general inspection and for Christmas dolls
[01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:52.800]   to peck at it if they chose. But soon the steeples called good people all to church
[01:30:52.800 --> 01:30:57.520]   and chapel, and away they came, flocking through the streets in their best clothes and with
[01:30:57.520 --> 01:31:04.000]   their gayest faces. And at the same time there emerged from scores of by-streets, lanes,
[01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:09.400]   and nameless turnings innumerable people carrying their dinners to the baker's shops. The sight
[01:31:09.400 --> 01:31:14.000]   of these poor revelers appeared to interest the spirit very much, for he stood with Scrooge
[01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:19.220]   beside him in a baker's doorway, and taking off the covers as their bearers passed, sprinkled
[01:31:19.220 --> 01:31:24.200]   incense on their dinners from his torch. And it was a very uncommon kind of torch, for
[01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:28.800]   once or twice when there were angry words between some dinner carriers who had jostled
[01:31:28.800 --> 01:31:33.480]   each other, he shed a few drops of water on them from it, and their good humor was restored
[01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:37.960]   directly, for they said, "It was a shame to quarrel upon Christmas Day." And so it
[01:31:37.960 --> 01:31:45.480]   was. God love it, so it was. In time the bells ceased and the bakers were shut up, and yet
[01:31:45.480 --> 01:31:50.720]   there was a genial shadowing forth of all these dinners and the progress of their cooking
[01:31:50.720 --> 01:31:56.800]   in the thawed blotch of wet above each baker's oven, where the pavement smoked as if its
[01:31:56.800 --> 01:32:03.840]   stones were cooking too. "Is there a peculiar flavor in what you sprinkle from your torch?"
[01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:10.200]   asked Scrooge. "There is. My own." "Would it apply to any kind of dinner on this day?"
[01:32:10.200 --> 01:32:17.400]   asked Scrooge. "To any kindly given. To a poor one, most." "Why to a poor one, most?"
[01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:25.120]   asked Scrooge. "Because it needs it most." "Spirit," said Scrooge after a moment's thought,
[01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:29.920]   "I wonder you, of all the beings in the many worlds about us, should desire to cramp these
[01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:36.120]   people's opportunities of innocent enjoyment." "I," cried the Spirit, "you would deprive
[01:32:36.120 --> 01:32:40.800]   them of their means of dining every seventh day, often the only day on which they can
[01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:47.840]   be said to dine at all," said Scrooge. "Wouldn't you?" "I," cried the Spirit, "you seek
[01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:53.080]   to close these places on the seventh day?" said Scrooge. "And it comes to the same thing."
[01:32:53.080 --> 01:32:58.520]   "I seek," exclaimed the Spirit, "forgive me if I am wrong. It has been done in your
[01:32:58.520 --> 01:33:03.280]   name or at least in that of your family," said Scrooge. "There are some upon this earth
[01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:08.280]   of yours," returned the Spirit, "who lay claim to know us and who do their deeds of
[01:33:08.280 --> 01:33:16.960]   passion, pride, ill will, hatred, envy, bigotry, and selfishness in our name, who are as strange
[01:33:16.960 --> 01:33:22.480]   to us and all our kith and kin as if they have never lived. Remember that and charge
[01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:29.600]   their doings on themselves, not us." Scrooge promised that he would, and they went on,
[01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:35.140]   invisible as they had been before, into the suburbs of the town. It was a remarkable quality
[01:33:35.140 --> 01:33:40.200]   of the ghost, which Scrooge had observed at the baker's, that notwithstanding his gigantic
[01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:44.760]   size, he could accommodate himself to any place with ease, and that he stood beneath
[01:33:44.760 --> 01:33:49.440]   a low roof quite as gracefully and like a supernatural creature as it was possible he
[01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:54.480]   could have done in any lofty hall. And perhaps it was the pleasure the good Spirit had in
[01:33:54.480 --> 01:34:00.120]   showing off this power of his, or else it was his own kind, generous, hearty nature,
[01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:04.800]   and his sympathy with all poor men that led him straight to Scrooge's clerks. For there
[01:34:04.800 --> 01:34:10.080]   he went, and took Scrooge with him, holding to his robe, and on the threshold of the door
[01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:15.400]   the Spirit smiled, and stopped to bless Bob Cratchit's dwelling with the sprinkling of
[01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:22.240]   his torch. Think of that. Bob had but fifteen, Bob, a week for himself. He pocketed on Saturdays
[01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:27.120]   but fifteen copies of his Christian name, and yet the ghost of Christmas present blessed
[01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:34.160]   his four-roomed house. Then up rose Mrs. Cratchit, Cratchit's wife, dressed out but poorly in
[01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:38.840]   a twice-turned gown, but brave in ribbons, which are cheap and make a goodly show for
[01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:44.120]   six pence. And she laid the cloth, assisted by Belinda Cratchit, second of her daughters,
[01:34:44.120 --> 01:34:48.520]   also brave in ribbons, while Master Peter Cratchit plunged a fork into the saucepan
[01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:53.760]   of potatoes, and getting the corners of his monstrous shirt collar, Bob's private property
[01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:58.640]   conferred upon his son, and heir in honour of the day, into his mouth rejoiced to find
[01:34:58.640 --> 01:35:04.600]   himself so gallantly attired, and yearned to show his linen in the fashionable parks.
[01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:08.800]   And now two smaller Cratchits, boy and girl, came tearing in, screaming that outside the
[01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:14.200]   bakers they had smelt the goose, and known it for their own, and basking in luxurious
[01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:20.000]   thoughts of sage and onion, these young Cratchits danced about the table, and exalted Master
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:24.640]   Peter Cratchit to the skies, while he, not proud, although his collars nearly choked
[01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:29.720]   him, blew the fire, until the slow potatoes bubbling up, knocked loudly at the saucepan
[01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:31.640]   lid, to be let out and peeled.
[01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:36.680]   "What has ever got your precious father, then?" said Mrs. Cratchit. "And your brother, Tiny
[01:35:36.680 --> 01:35:40.280]   Tim, and Martha warn't as late last Christmas Day by half an hour."
[01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:43.400]   "Here's Martha, mother," said a girl, appearing as she spoke.
[01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:48.080]   "Here's Martha, mother," cried the two young Cratchits. "Hurrah! There's such a goose,
[01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:49.080]   Martha!"
[01:35:49.080 --> 01:35:53.120]   "Why, bless your heart alive, my dear, how late you are," said Mrs. Cratchit, kissing
[01:35:53.120 --> 01:35:57.960]   her a dozen times, and taking off her shawl and bonnet for her with officious zeal.
[01:35:57.960 --> 01:36:02.560]   "We'd a deal of work to finish up last night," replied the girl, "and had to clear away this
[01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:03.560]   morning, mother."
[01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:07.520]   "Well, never mind, so long as you're come," said Mrs. Cratchit. "Sit ye down before the
[01:36:07.520 --> 01:36:10.080]   fire, my dear, and have a warm, Lord bless ye."
[01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:13.920]   "No, no, there's father coming," cried the two young Cratchits, who were everywhere at
[01:36:13.920 --> 01:36:15.640]   once. "Hide, Martha, hide!"
[01:36:15.640 --> 01:36:19.720]   So Martha hid herself, and in came Little Bob, the father, with at least three feet
[01:36:19.720 --> 01:36:24.420]   of comforter, exclusive of the fringe, hanging down before him, and his threadbare clothes
[01:36:24.420 --> 01:36:29.880]   darned up and brushed to look seasonable, and Tiny Tim upon his shoulder. Alas, for
[01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:34.920]   Tiny Tim, he bore a little crutch, and had his limbs supported by an iron frame.
[01:36:34.920 --> 01:36:38.560]   "Why, where's our Martha?" cried Bob Cratchit, looking round.
[01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:40.600]   "Not coming," said Mrs. Cratchit.
[01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:45.640]   "Not coming!" said Bob, with a sudden declension in his high spirits, for he had been Tim's
[01:36:45.640 --> 01:36:50.640]   blood horse all the way from church, and had come home rampant. "Not coming upon Christmas
[01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:51.720]   Day!"
[01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:55.680]   Martha didn't like to see him disappointed, if it were only in jokes, so she came out prematurely
[01:36:55.680 --> 01:37:00.360]   from behind the closet door, and ran into his arms, while the two young Cratchits hustled
[01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:04.240]   Tiny Tim, and bore him off into the wash house, that he might hear the pudding singing in
[01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:05.240]   the copper.
[01:37:05.240 --> 01:37:09.520]   "And how did little Tim behave?" asked Mrs. Cratchit, when she had rallied Bob on
[01:37:09.520 --> 01:37:13.080]   his credulity, and Bob had hugged his daughter to his heart's content.
[01:37:13.080 --> 01:37:17.960]   "As good as gold," said Bob, "and better. Somehow he gets thoughtful, sitting by himself
[01:37:17.960 --> 01:37:22.360]   so much, and thinks the strangest things you ever heard. He told me, coming home, that
[01:37:22.360 --> 01:37:25.640]   he hoped the people saw him in the church, because he was a cripple, and it might be
[01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:30.640]   pleasant to them to remember, upon Christmas Day, who made lame beggars walk and blind
[01:37:30.640 --> 01:37:32.240]   men see."
[01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:37.640]   Bob's voice was tremulous when he told them this, and trembled more when he said that
[01:37:37.640 --> 01:37:43.580]   Tiny Tim was growing strong and hearty. His act of little crutch was heard upon the floor,
[01:37:43.580 --> 01:37:48.880]   and back came Tiny Tim before another word was spoken, escorted by his brother and sister
[01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:54.920]   to his stool before the fire, and while Bob, turning up his cuffs, as if, poor fellow,
[01:37:54.920 --> 01:38:00.080]   they were capable of being made more shabby, compounded some hot mixture in a jug with
[01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:05.800]   gin and lemons, and stirred it round and round, and put it on the hob to simmer, Master Peter
[01:38:05.800 --> 01:38:11.000]   and the two ubiquitous young Cratchits went to fetch the goose, with which they soon returned
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.080]   in high procession.
[01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:18.160]   Such a bustle ensued that you might have thought a goose, the rarest of all birds, a feathered
[01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:23.160]   phenomenon to which a black swan was a matter of course, and in truth it was something very
[01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:28.480]   like it in that house. Mrs. Cratchit made the gravy, ready beforehand in a little saucepan,
[01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:33.600]   hissing hot. Master Peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigor. Miss Belinda sweetened
[01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:38.940]   up the applesauce. Martha dusted the hot plates. Bob took Tiny Tim beside him in a tiny corner
[01:38:38.940 --> 01:38:44.120]   at the table. The two young Cratchits set chairs for everybody, not forgetting themselves,
[01:38:44.120 --> 01:38:48.740]   and mounting guard upon their posts, crammed spoons into their mouths, lest they should
[01:38:48.740 --> 01:38:53.800]   shriek for goose before their turn came to be helped. At last the dishes were set on
[01:38:53.800 --> 01:38:59.640]   and grace was said. It was succeeded by a breathless pause as Mrs. Cratchit, looking
[01:38:59.640 --> 01:39:06.220]   slowly all along the carving knife, prepared to plunge it in the breast. But when she did,
[01:39:06.220 --> 01:39:11.460]   and when the long-expected gush of stuffing issued forth, one murmur of delight arose
[01:39:11.460 --> 01:39:16.840]   all around the board, and even Tiny Tim, excited by the two young Cratchits, beat on the table
[01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:23.260]   with the handle of his knife and feebly cried, "Hurrah!" There never was such a goose.
[01:39:23.260 --> 01:39:28.160]   Bob said he didn't believe there ever was such a goose cooked. Its tenderness and flavor,
[01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:34.320]   size, and cheapness were the themes of universal admiration. Eeked out by applesauce and mashed
[01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:38.560]   potatoes, it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family. Indeed, as Mrs. Cratchit said
[01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:42.480]   with great delight, surveying one small atom of a bone upon the dish, they hadn't ate
[01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:47.440]   it all at last. Yet every one had had enough, and the youngest Cratchits in particular were
[01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:53.280]   steeped in sage and onion to the eyebrows. But now, the plates being changed by Miss
[01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:57.880]   Belinda, Mrs. Cratchit left the room alone, too nervous to bear witness, to take the pudding
[01:39:57.880 --> 01:40:02.280]   up and bring it in. Suppose it should not be done enough. Suppose it should break in
[01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:06.160]   turning out. Suppose somebody should have got over the wall of the backyard and stolen
[01:40:06.160 --> 01:40:09.800]   it while they were merry with the goose, a supposition at which the two young Cratchits
[01:40:09.800 --> 01:40:15.920]   became livid. All sorts of horrors were supposed. "Ello!" A great deal of steam. The pudding
[01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:20.520]   was out of the copper. A smell like a washing day. That was the cloth. A smell like an eating
[01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:25.200]   house and the pastry cooks next door to each other with a laundress next door to that.
[01:40:25.200 --> 01:40:30.240]   That was the pudding. In half a minute, Mrs. Cratchit entered, flushed but smiling proudly,
[01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:36.280]   with the pudding like a speckled cannonball, so hard and firm, blazing in half of half
[01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:41.320]   a quarter of ignited brandy and bedite with Christmas holly stuck into the top.
[01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:45.520]   "Oh, what a wonderful pudding," Bob Cratchit said, and calmly, too, that he regarded it
[01:40:45.520 --> 01:40:51.520]   as the greatest success achieved by Mrs. Cratchit since their marriage. Mrs. Cratchit said that
[01:40:51.520 --> 01:40:56.040]   now the weight was off her mind, she would confess she had had her doubts about the quantity
[01:40:56.040 --> 01:41:01.560]   of flour. Everybody had something to say about it, but nobody said or thought it was at all
[01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:07.240]   a small pudding for a large family. It would have been flat heresy to do so. Any Cratchit
[01:41:07.240 --> 01:41:12.280]   would have blushed to hint at such a thing. At last, the dinner was all done, the cloth
[01:41:12.280 --> 01:41:16.980]   was cleared, the hearth swept, and the fire made up, the compound and the jug being tasted
[01:41:16.980 --> 01:41:20.880]   and considered perfect. Apples and oranges were put upon the table and a shovelful of
[01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:26.240]   chestnuts on the fire. Then all the Cratchit family drew round the hearth in what Bob Cratchit
[01:41:26.240 --> 01:41:30.720]   called a circle, meaning half a one, and above Cratchit's elbow stood the family display
[01:41:30.720 --> 01:41:35.880]   of glass, two tumblers, and a custard cup without a handle. These held the hot stuff
[01:41:35.880 --> 01:41:41.320]   from the jug, however, as well as golden goblets would have done, and Bob served it out with
[01:41:41.320 --> 01:41:46.680]   beaming looks, while the chestnuts on the fire sputtered and cracked noisily. Then Bob
[01:41:46.680 --> 01:41:52.440]   proposed, "A merry Christmas to us all, my dears. God bless us," which all the family
[01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:58.700]   re-echoed. "God bless us, everyone," said Tiny Tim, the last of all. He sat very close
[01:41:58.700 --> 01:42:03.520]   to his father's side upon his little stool. Bob held his withered little hand in his as
[01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:07.720]   if he loved the child and wished to keep him by his side and dreaded that he might be taken
[01:42:07.720 --> 01:42:13.120]   from him. "Spirit," said Scrooge with an interest he had never felt before, "tell
[01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:18.000]   me if Tiny Tim will live." "I see a vacant seat," replied the ghost, "in the poor
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:23.360]   chimney corner and a crutch without an owner, carefully preserved. If these shadows remain
[01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:29.360]   unaltered by the future, the child will die." "No, no," said Scrooge. "Oh, no, kind
[01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:35.880]   spirit. Say he will be spared." "If these shadows remain unaltered by the future, none
[01:42:35.880 --> 01:42:41.920]   other of my race," returned the ghost, "will find him here. What then? If he be like to
[01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:48.240]   die, he had better do it and decrease the surplus population." Scrooge hung his head
[01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:52.760]   to hear his own words quoted by the spirit and was overcome with penitence and grief.
[01:42:52.760 --> 01:42:58.600]   "Man," said the ghost, "if man you be in heart, not adamant, forbear that wicked
[01:42:58.600 --> 01:43:04.680]   Kent until you have discovered what the surplus is and where it is. Will you decide what men
[01:43:04.680 --> 01:43:10.520]   shall live, what men shall die? It may be that in the sight of heaven you are more worthless
[01:43:10.520 --> 01:43:16.700]   and less fit to live than millions like this poor man's child. Oh God, to hear the insect
[01:43:16.700 --> 01:43:24.000]   on the leaf pronouncing on the too much life among his hungry brothers in the dust."
[01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:31.000]   Scrooge bent before the ghost's rebuke, and trembling cast his eyes upon the ground.
[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:37.440]   But he raised them speedily on hearing his own name. "Mr. Scrooge," said Bob, "I'll
[01:43:37.440 --> 01:43:40.760]   give you Mr. Scrooge, the founder of the feast."
[01:43:40.760 --> 01:43:45.680]   "The founder of the feast indeed," cried Mrs. Cratchit, reddening. "I wish I had
[01:43:45.680 --> 01:43:49.560]   him here. I'd give him a piece of my mind to feast upon, and I hope he'd have a good
[01:43:49.560 --> 01:43:55.000]   appetite for it. My dear," said Bob, "the children, Christmas Day."
[01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:59.360]   "It should be Christmas Day, I'm sure," said she, "on which one drinks the health
[01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:06.160]   of such an odious, stingy, hard, unfeeling man as Mr. Scrooge. You know he is, Robert.
[01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:08.600]   Nobody knows it better than you do, poor fellow."
[01:44:08.600 --> 01:44:13.920]   "My dear," was Bob's mild answer, "Christmas Day."
[01:44:13.920 --> 01:44:19.800]   "I'll drink his health for your sake and the day's," said Mrs. Cratchit, "not
[01:44:19.800 --> 01:44:24.920]   for his. Long life to him. A merry Christmas and a happy New Year. He'll be very merry
[01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:27.800]   and very happy, I have no doubt."
[01:44:27.800 --> 01:44:32.600]   The children drank the toast after her. It was the first of their proceedings which had
[01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:40.640]   no heartiness. Tiny Tim drank it last of all, but he didn't care two pence for it. Scrooge
[01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:47.560]   was the ogre of the family. The mention of his name cast a dark shadow on the party,
[01:44:47.560 --> 01:44:53.300]   which was not dispelled for full five minutes. After it had passed away, they were ten times
[01:44:53.300 --> 01:44:59.960]   merrier than before from the mere relief of Scrooge the baleful being done with. Bob Cratchit
[01:44:59.960 --> 01:45:04.960]   told them how he had a situation in his eye for Master Peter, which would bring in if
[01:45:04.960 --> 01:45:09.840]   it obtained full five and six pence weekly. The two young Cratchits laughed tremendously
[01:45:09.840 --> 01:45:15.400]   at the idea of Peter as being a man of business, and Peter himself looking thoughtfully at
[01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:20.880]   the fire from between his collars, as if he were deliberating what particular investments
[01:45:20.880 --> 01:45:25.760]   he should favor when he came into the receipt of that bewildering income. Martha, who was
[01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:30.360]   a poor apprentice at a milliner's, then told them what kind of work she had to do, and
[01:45:30.360 --> 01:45:34.760]   how many hours she worked at a stretch, and how she meant to lie abed tomorrow morning
[01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:41.080]   for a good long rest, tomorrow being a holiday she passed at home. Also how she had seen
[01:45:41.080 --> 01:45:46.080]   a countess and a lord some days before, and how the lord was much about as tall as Peter,
[01:45:46.080 --> 01:45:49.520]   at which Peter pulled up his collar so high that you couldn't have seen his head if you
[01:45:49.520 --> 01:45:54.760]   had been there. All this time the chestnuts in the jug went round and round, and by and
[01:45:54.760 --> 01:45:59.920]   by they had a song about a lost child travelling in the snow from Tiny Tim, who had a plaintive
[01:45:59.920 --> 01:46:05.000]   little voice and sang it very well indeed. There was nothing of high mark in this. They
[01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:10.080]   were not a handsome family, they were not well dressed, their shoes were far from being
[01:46:10.080 --> 01:46:15.080]   waterproof, their clothes were scanty, and Peter might have known, and very likely did,
[01:46:15.080 --> 01:46:21.600]   the inside of a pawnbroker's. But they were happy, grateful, pleased with one another
[01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:26.600]   and contented with the time, and when they faded and looked happier yet in the bright
[01:46:26.600 --> 01:46:32.560]   sprinklings of the spirit's torch at parting, Scrooge had his eye upon them, and especially
[01:46:32.560 --> 01:46:37.680]   on Tiny Tim until the last. By this time it was getting dark and snowing pretty heavily,
[01:46:37.680 --> 01:46:41.080]   and as Scrooge and the spirit went along the streets, the brightness of the roaring fires
[01:46:41.080 --> 01:46:46.800]   in kitchens, parlours, and all sorts of rooms was wonderful. Here the flickering of the
[01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:52.000]   blaze showed preparations for a cosy dinner, with hot plates baking through and through
[01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:57.840]   before the fire, and deep red curtains ready to be drawn to shut out cold and darkness.
[01:46:57.840 --> 01:47:01.520]   There all the children of the house were running out into the snow to meet their married sisters,
[01:47:01.520 --> 01:47:05.560]   brothers, cousins, uncles, aunts, and be the first to greet them. Here again were shadows
[01:47:05.560 --> 01:47:10.160]   on the window blind of guests assembling, and there a group of handsome girls, all hooded
[01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:15.160]   and fur booted, and all chattering at once, tripped lightly off to some near neighbour's
[01:47:15.160 --> 01:47:19.720]   house, where, woe upon the single man who saw them enter, artful witches, well they
[01:47:19.720 --> 01:47:24.240]   knew it, in a glow. But if you had judged from the numbers of people on their way to
[01:47:24.240 --> 01:47:27.680]   friendly gatherings, you might have thought that no one was at home to give them welcome
[01:47:27.680 --> 01:47:31.800]   when they got there, instead of every house expecting company and piling up its fires
[01:47:31.800 --> 01:47:37.280]   half chimney high. Blessings on it how the ghost exulted, how it bared its breadth of
[01:47:37.280 --> 01:47:43.280]   breast and opened its capacious palm and floated on outpouring with a generous hand its bright
[01:47:43.280 --> 01:47:48.160]   and harmless mirth on everything within its reach. The very lamplighter who ran on before
[01:47:48.160 --> 01:47:53.400]   dotting the dusky street with specks of light, and who was dressed to spend the evening somewhere,
[01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:58.120]   laughed out loudly as the spirit passed, though little kenned the lamplighter that he had
[01:47:58.120 --> 01:48:03.000]   any company but Christmas. And now, without a word of warning from the ghost, they stood
[01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:09.280]   upon a bleak and desert moor, where monstrous masses of rude stone were cast about, as though
[01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:14.560]   it were the burial place of giants, and water spread itself wheresoever it listed, or would
[01:48:14.560 --> 01:48:19.800]   have done so but for the frost that held it prisoner, and nothing grew but moss and firs
[01:48:19.800 --> 01:48:26.960]   and coarse-rank grass. Down in the west the setting sun had left a streak of fiery red,
[01:48:26.960 --> 01:48:34.560]   which glared upon the desolation for an instant like a sullen eye, and frowning lower, lower,
[01:48:34.560 --> 01:48:40.880]   lower yet, was lost in the thick gloom of darkest night. "What place is this?" asked
[01:48:40.880 --> 01:48:47.240]   Scrooge. "A place where miners live, who labour in the bowels of the earth," returned
[01:48:47.240 --> 01:48:52.360]   the spirit. "But they know me, see?" A light shone from the window of a hut, and
[01:48:52.360 --> 01:48:57.440]   swiftly they advanced towards it. Passing through the wall of mud and stone, they found
[01:48:57.440 --> 01:49:02.560]   a cheerful company assembled round a glowing fire, an old, old man and woman, with their
[01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:06.720]   children and their children's children, and another generation beyond that, all decked
[01:49:06.720 --> 01:49:11.360]   out gaily in their holiday attire. The old man, in a voice that seldom rose above the
[01:49:11.360 --> 01:49:15.560]   howling of the wind upon the barren waste, was singing them a Christmas song. It had
[01:49:15.560 --> 01:49:20.400]   been a very old song when he was a boy, and from time to time they all joined in the chorus.
[01:49:20.400 --> 01:49:25.240]   So surely as they raised their voices the old man got quite blithe and loud, and so
[01:49:25.240 --> 01:49:31.200]   surely as they stopped his vigour sank again. The spirit did not tarry here, but bade Scrooge
[01:49:31.200 --> 01:49:39.880]   hold his robe, and passing on above the moor, sped wither, not to see, to see. To Scrooge's
[01:49:39.880 --> 01:49:44.800]   horror looking back he saw the last of the land, a frightful range of rocks behind them,
[01:49:44.800 --> 01:49:48.920]   and his ears were deafened by the thundering of water as it rolled and roared and raged
[01:49:48.920 --> 01:49:54.080]   among the dreadful caverns it had worn, and fiercely tried to undermine the earth. Built
[01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:59.720]   upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks, some league or so from shore, on which the waters chafed
[01:49:59.720 --> 01:50:05.200]   and dashed, the wild year through there stood a solitary lighthouse. Great heaps of seaweed
[01:50:05.200 --> 01:50:10.440]   clung to its base, and storm-birds, born of the wind one might suppose, as seaweed of
[01:50:10.440 --> 01:50:15.440]   the water, rose and fell about it like the waves they skimmed. But even here two men
[01:50:15.440 --> 01:50:19.760]   who watched the light had made a fire, that through the loophole in the thick stone wall
[01:50:19.760 --> 01:50:24.520]   shed out a ray of brightness on the awful sea. Joining their horny hands over the rough
[01:50:24.520 --> 01:50:29.640]   table at which they sat, they wished each other Merry Christmas in their can of grog,
[01:50:29.640 --> 01:50:34.400]   and one of them, the elder too, with his face all damaged and scarred with hard weather,
[01:50:34.400 --> 01:50:38.800]   as the figurehead of an old ship might be, struck up a sturdy song that was like a gale
[01:50:38.800 --> 01:50:45.640]   in itself. Again the ghosts sped on, above the black and heaving sea, on, on, until being
[01:50:45.640 --> 01:50:50.280]   far away, as he told Scrooge, from any shore they lighted on a ship. They stood beside
[01:50:50.280 --> 01:50:55.680]   the helmsmen at the wheel, the lookout and the bow, the officers who had the watch, dark,
[01:50:55.680 --> 01:50:59.600]   ghostly figures in their several stations, but every man among them hummed a Christmas
[01:50:59.600 --> 01:51:04.400]   tune, or had a Christmas thought, or spoke below his breath to his companion of some
[01:51:04.400 --> 01:51:10.740]   bygone Christmas day, with homeward hopes belonging to it. And every man on board, walking
[01:51:10.740 --> 01:51:16.320]   or sleeping, good or bad, had had a kinder word for another on that day than on any day
[01:51:16.320 --> 01:51:21.360]   in the year, and had shared to some extent in its festivities, and had remembered those
[01:51:21.360 --> 01:51:26.980]   he cared for at a distance, and had known that they were delighted to remember him.
[01:51:26.980 --> 01:51:30.880]   It was a great surprise to Scrooge, while listening to the moaning of the wind, and
[01:51:30.880 --> 01:51:36.080]   thinking what a solemn thing it was to move on through the lonely darkness over an unknown
[01:51:36.080 --> 01:51:42.560]   abyss, whose depths were secrets as profound as death. It was a great surprise to Scrooge,
[01:51:42.560 --> 01:51:48.000]   while thus engaged, to hear a hearty laugh. It was a much greater surprise to Scrooge
[01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:56.160]   to recognize it as his own nephews, and to find himself in a bright, dry, gleaming room,
[01:51:56.160 --> 01:52:01.720]   with the spirit standing smiling by his side, and looking at that same nephew with approving
[01:52:01.720 --> 01:52:08.240]   affability. "Ha, ha, ha!" laughed Scrooge's nephew. "Ha, ha, ha! If you should happen
[01:52:08.240 --> 01:52:13.400]   by any unlikely chance to know a man more blessed in a laugh than Scrooge's nephew,
[01:52:13.400 --> 01:52:18.760]   all I can say is, I should like to know him too. Introduce him to me, and I'll cultivate
[01:52:18.760 --> 01:52:24.880]   his acquaintance." It is a fair, even-handed, noble adjustment of things that while there
[01:52:24.880 --> 01:52:32.520]   is infection in disease and sorrow, there is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious
[01:52:32.520 --> 01:52:37.920]   as laughter and good humor. When Scrooge's nephew laughed in this way, holding his sides
[01:52:37.920 --> 01:52:43.040]   rolling his head and twisting his face into the most extravagant contortions, Scrooge's
[01:52:43.040 --> 01:52:47.960]   niece, by marriage, laughed as heartily as he, and their assembled friends, being not
[01:52:47.960 --> 01:52:55.320]   a bit behind hand, roared out lustily. "Ha, ha, ha! He said that Christmas was a humbug
[01:52:55.320 --> 01:53:00.960]   as I live!" cried Scrooge's nephew. "He believed it too!" "More shame for him,
[01:53:00.960 --> 01:53:04.680]   Fred," said Scrooge's niece indignantly. "Bless those women! They never do anything
[01:53:04.680 --> 01:53:09.240]   by halves. They are always in earnest." She was very pretty, exceedingly pretty, with
[01:53:09.240 --> 01:53:13.320]   a dimpled, surprised-looking capital face, a ripe little mouth that seemed made to be
[01:53:13.320 --> 01:53:17.800]   kissed, as no doubt it was, all kinds of good little dots about her chin that melted into
[01:53:17.800 --> 01:53:23.680]   one another when she laughed, and the sunniest pair of eyes you ever saw in any little creature's
[01:53:23.680 --> 01:53:29.560]   head. Altogether, she was what you would have called provoking, you know, but satisfactory
[01:53:29.560 --> 01:53:34.400]   too. Oh, perfectly satisfactory. "He's a comical old fellow," said Scrooge's
[01:53:34.400 --> 01:53:38.800]   nephew. "That's the truth, and not so pleasant as he might be. However, his offenses carry
[01:53:38.800 --> 01:53:42.200]   their own punishment, and I have nothing to say against him."
[01:53:42.200 --> 01:53:47.360]   "I am sure he is very rich, Fred," hinted Scrooge's niece. "At least you always tell
[01:53:47.360 --> 01:53:52.400]   me so." "What of that, my dear," said Scrooge's nephew. "His wealth is of no
[01:53:52.400 --> 01:53:57.600]   use to him. He don't do any good with it. He don't make himself comfortable with it.
[01:53:57.600 --> 01:54:04.440]   He hasn't the satisfaction of thinking that he's ever going to benefit us with it."
[01:54:04.440 --> 01:54:09.840]   "I have no patience with him," observed Scrooge's niece. Scrooge's niece's sisters
[01:54:09.840 --> 01:54:12.320]   and all the other ladies expressed the same opinion.
[01:54:12.320 --> 01:54:17.440]   "Oh, I have," said Scrooge's nephew. "I'm sorry for him. I couldn't be angry
[01:54:17.440 --> 01:54:23.840]   with him if I tried. Who suffers by his ill whims? Himself, always. Here he takes it into
[01:54:23.840 --> 01:54:29.560]   his head to dislike us, and he won't come and dine with us. What's the consequences?
[01:54:29.560 --> 01:54:30.800]   He don't lose much of a dinner."
[01:54:30.800 --> 01:54:36.040]   "Indeed, I think he loses a very good dinner," interrupted Scrooge's niece. "Everybody
[01:54:36.040 --> 01:54:40.000]   else said the same, and they must be allowed to have been competent judges, because they
[01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:43.880]   had just had dinner, and, with the dessert upon the table, were clustered round the fire
[01:54:43.880 --> 01:54:44.880]   by lamplight."
[01:54:44.880 --> 01:54:48.680]   "Well, I'm very glad to hear it," said Scrooge's nephew, "because I haven't
[01:54:48.680 --> 01:54:53.400]   great faith in these young housekeepers. What do you say, Topper?"
[01:54:53.400 --> 01:54:57.120]   Topper had clearly got his eye upon one of Scrooge's niece's sisters, for he answered
[01:54:57.120 --> 01:55:01.640]   that a bachelor was a wretched outcast who had no right to express an opinion on the
[01:55:01.640 --> 01:55:06.920]   subject, whereat Scrooge's niece's sister, the plump one with the lace tucker, not the
[01:55:06.920 --> 01:55:08.720]   one with the roses, blushed.
[01:55:08.720 --> 01:55:13.140]   "Do go on, Fred," said Scrooge's niece, clasping her hands. "He never finishes
[01:55:13.140 --> 01:55:16.240]   what he begins to say. He is such a ridiculous fellow."
[01:55:16.240 --> 01:55:20.800]   Scrooge's nephew reveled in another laugh, and as it was impossible to keep the infection
[01:55:20.800 --> 01:55:26.440]   off, though the plump sister tried hard to do it with aromatic vinegar, his example was
[01:55:26.440 --> 01:55:27.760]   unanimously followed.
[01:55:27.760 --> 01:55:32.140]   "I was only going to say," said Scrooge's nephew, "that the consequences of his taking
[01:55:32.140 --> 01:55:38.400]   a dislike to us and not making merry with us is, as I think, that he loses some pleasant
[01:55:38.400 --> 01:55:43.760]   moments, which could do him no harm. I am sure he loses pleasanter companions than he
[01:55:43.760 --> 01:55:49.560]   can find in his own thoughts, either in his mouldy old office or his dusty chambers. I
[01:55:49.560 --> 01:55:55.640]   mean to give him the same chance every year whether he likes it or not, for I pity him.
[01:55:55.640 --> 01:56:00.760]   He may rail at Christmas till he dies, but he can't help thinking better of it. I defy
[01:56:00.760 --> 01:56:07.960]   him if he finds me going there, in good temper, year after year, and saying, 'Uncle Scrooge,
[01:56:07.960 --> 01:56:12.640]   how are you?' If it only puts him in the vein to leave his poor clerk fifty pounds,
[01:56:12.640 --> 01:56:16.440]   that's something, and I think I shook him yesterday."
[01:56:16.440 --> 01:56:21.420]   It was their turn to laugh now at the notion of his "shaking" Scrooge, but being thoroughly
[01:56:21.420 --> 01:56:27.200]   good-natured and not much caring what they laughed at, so that they laughed at any rate,
[01:56:27.200 --> 01:56:31.860]   he encouraged them in their merriment and passed the bottle joyously.
[01:56:31.860 --> 01:56:35.560]   After tea they had some music, for they were a musical family and knew what they were about
[01:56:35.560 --> 01:56:40.520]   when they sung a glee or catch, I can assure you, especially Topper, who could growl away
[01:56:40.520 --> 01:56:44.780]   in the bass like a good one and never swell the large veins in his forehead or get red
[01:56:44.780 --> 01:56:48.840]   in the face over it. Scrooge's niece played well upon the harp and played among other
[01:56:48.840 --> 01:56:53.400]   tunes a simple little air, a mere nothing (you might learn to whistle it in two minutes),
[01:56:53.400 --> 01:56:57.640]   which had been familiar to the child who fetched Scrooge from the boarding school as he had
[01:56:57.640 --> 01:57:03.440]   been reminded by the ghost of Christmas past. When this strain of music sounded, all the
[01:57:03.440 --> 01:57:10.000]   things that ghost had shown him came upon his mind. He softened more and more, and thought
[01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:15.020]   that if he could have listened to it often years ago, he might have cultivated the kindnesses
[01:57:15.020 --> 01:57:20.600]   of life for his own happiness with his own hands, without resorting to the sexton's
[01:57:20.600 --> 01:57:26.800]   spade that buried Jacob Marley. But they didn't devote the whole evening to music. After a
[01:57:26.800 --> 01:57:30.860]   while they played at forfeits, for it is good to be children sometimes, and never better
[01:57:30.860 --> 01:57:35.780]   than at Christmas, when its mighty founder was a child himself. Stop! There was first
[01:57:35.780 --> 01:57:40.180]   a game at blind man's buff, of course there was, and I no more believe Topper was really
[01:57:40.180 --> 01:57:45.020]   blind than I believe he had eyes in his boots. My opinion is that it was a done thing between
[01:57:45.020 --> 01:57:49.920]   him and Scrooge's nephew, and that the ghost of Christmas present knew it. The way he went
[01:57:49.920 --> 01:57:55.200]   after that plump sister in the lace tucker was an outrage on the credulity of human nature,
[01:57:55.200 --> 01:57:59.480]   knocking down the fire irons, tumbling over the chairs, bumping against the piano, smothering
[01:57:59.480 --> 01:58:05.540]   himself among the curtains. Wherever she went, there went he. He always knew where the plump
[01:58:05.540 --> 01:58:10.240]   sister was. He wouldn't catch anybody else. If you had fallen up against him, as some
[01:58:10.240 --> 01:58:14.560]   of them did, on purpose, he would have made a feint of endeavoring to seize you, which
[01:58:14.560 --> 01:58:18.240]   would have been an affront to your understanding, and would instantly have sidled off in the
[01:58:18.240 --> 01:58:23.280]   direction of the plump sister. She often cried out that it wasn't fair, and it really was
[01:58:23.280 --> 01:58:27.920]   not. But when at last he caught her, when, in spite of all her silken rustlings and her
[01:58:27.920 --> 01:58:32.920]   rapid flutterings past him, he got her into a corner whence there was no escape, then
[01:58:32.920 --> 01:58:38.520]   his conduct was the most execrable. For his pretending not to know her, his pretending
[01:58:38.520 --> 01:58:42.360]   that it was necessary to touch her headdress, and further to assure himself of her identity
[01:58:42.360 --> 01:58:47.800]   by pressing a certain ring upon her finger, and a certain chain about her neck, was vile,
[01:58:47.800 --> 01:58:52.880]   monstrous, no doubt she told him her opinion of it, when, another blind man being in office,
[01:58:52.880 --> 01:58:58.040]   they were so very confidential together, behind the curtains. Scrooge's niece was not one
[01:58:58.040 --> 01:59:02.680]   of the blind man's buff party, but was made comfortable with a large chair and a footstool
[01:59:02.680 --> 01:59:07.200]   in a snug corner, where the ghost and Scrooge were close behind her. But she joined in the
[01:59:07.200 --> 01:59:12.400]   forfeits and loved her love to admiration with all the letters of the alphabet. Likewise
[01:59:12.400 --> 01:59:17.160]   at the game of how, when, and where, she was very great, and to the secret joy of Scrooge's
[01:59:17.160 --> 01:59:21.560]   nephew beat her sisters hollow, though they were sharp girls too, as Topper could have
[01:59:21.560 --> 01:59:26.320]   told you. There might have been twenty people there, young and old, but they all played,
[01:59:26.320 --> 01:59:31.040]   and so did Scrooge, for wholly forgetting in the interest he had in what was going on,
[01:59:31.040 --> 01:59:34.920]   that his voice made no sound in their ears, he sometimes came out with his guess quite
[01:59:34.920 --> 01:59:39.640]   loud, and very often guessed quite right too, for the sharpest needle, best Whitechapel
[01:59:39.640 --> 01:59:44.120]   warranted not to cut in the eye, was not sharper than Scrooge, blunt as he took it in his head
[01:59:44.120 --> 01:59:49.120]   to be. The ghost was greatly pleased to find him in this mood, and looked upon him with
[01:59:49.120 --> 01:59:53.920]   such favor that he begged like a boy to be allowed to stay until the guests departed.
[01:59:53.920 --> 01:59:56.800]   But this, the spirit said, could not be done.
[01:59:56.800 --> 02:00:01.560]   "Here is a new game," said Scrooge. "One half hour, spirit, only one!"
[02:00:01.560 --> 02:00:06.080]   It was a game called Yes and No, where Scrooge's nephew had to think of something and the rest
[02:00:06.080 --> 02:00:11.760]   must find out what, he only answering to their questions, yes or no, as the case was. The
[02:00:11.760 --> 02:00:15.720]   brisk fire of questioning to which he was exposed elicited from him that he was thinking
[02:00:15.720 --> 02:00:21.440]   of an animal, a live animal, rather a disagreeable animal, a savage animal, an animal that growled
[02:00:21.440 --> 02:00:25.240]   and grunted sometimes and talked sometimes and lived in London and walked about the streets
[02:00:25.240 --> 02:00:29.400]   and wasn't made a show of and wasn't led by anybody and didn't live in a menagerie and
[02:00:29.400 --> 02:00:33.600]   was never killed in a market and was not a horse or an ass or a cow or a bull or a tiger
[02:00:33.600 --> 02:00:36.560]   or a dog or a pig or a cat or a bear.
[02:00:36.560 --> 02:00:41.160]   At every fresh question that was put to him, this nephew burst into a fresh roar of laughter
[02:00:41.160 --> 02:00:45.960]   and was so inexpressibly tickled that he was obliged to get up off the sofa and stamp.
[02:00:45.960 --> 02:00:50.880]   At last, the plump sister falling into a similar state cried out, "I've found it out! I know
[02:00:50.880 --> 02:00:57.520]   what it is, Fred! I know what it is!" "What is it?" cried Fred. "It's your Uncle Scrooge!"
[02:00:57.520 --> 02:01:02.320]   Which it certainly was. Admiration was the universal sentiment, though some objected
[02:01:02.320 --> 02:01:06.880]   that the reply to, "Is it a bear?" ought to have been, "Yes," inasmuch as an answer
[02:01:06.880 --> 02:01:11.160]   in the negative was sufficient to have diverted their thoughts from Mr. Scrooge, supposing
[02:01:11.160 --> 02:01:13.600]   they had ever had any tendency that way.
[02:01:13.600 --> 02:01:19.840]   "He has given us plenty of merriment, I am sure," said Fred, "and it would be ungrateful
[02:01:19.840 --> 02:01:25.880]   not to drink his health. Here is a glass of mulled wine, ready to our hand at the moment,
[02:01:25.880 --> 02:01:30.760]   and I say, 'Uncle Scrooge!'" "Well, Uncle Scrooge!" they cried.
[02:01:30.760 --> 02:01:35.640]   "A Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to the old man, whatever he is," said Scrooge's
[02:01:35.640 --> 02:01:43.560]   nephew. "He wouldn't take it from me, but may he have it nevertheless. Uncle Scrooge!"
[02:01:43.560 --> 02:01:48.760]   Uncle Scrooge had imperceptibly become so gay and light of heart that he would have
[02:01:48.760 --> 02:01:53.880]   pledged the unconscious company in return, and thanked them in an audible speech if the
[02:01:53.880 --> 02:01:58.920]   ghost had given him time. But the whole scene passed off in the breath of the last word
[02:01:58.920 --> 02:02:03.120]   spoken by his nephew, and he and the spirit were again upon their travels.
[02:02:03.120 --> 02:02:08.000]   Much they saw, and far they went, and many homes they visited, but always with a happy
[02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:13.320]   end. The spirit stood beside sick beds, and they were cheerful; on foreign lands, and
[02:02:13.320 --> 02:02:17.720]   they were close at home; by struggling men, and they were patient in their greater hope;
[02:02:17.720 --> 02:02:24.000]   by poverty, and it was rich; in almshouse, hospital, and jail; in miseries every refuge,
[02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:28.080]   where vain man in his little brief authority had not made fast the door and barred the
[02:02:28.080 --> 02:02:34.160]   spirit out, he left his blessing and taught Scrooge his precepts.
[02:02:34.160 --> 02:02:38.720]   It was a long night, if it were only a night, but Scrooge had his doubts of this, because
[02:02:38.720 --> 02:02:43.960]   the Christmas holidays appeared to be condensed into the space of time they passed together.
[02:02:43.960 --> 02:02:49.480]   It was strange, too, that while Scrooge remained unaltered in his outward form, the ghost grew
[02:02:49.480 --> 02:02:55.440]   older, clearly older. Scrooge had observed this change, but never spoke of it until they
[02:02:55.440 --> 02:02:59.520]   left a children's twelfth-night party, when, looking at the spirit as they stood together
[02:02:59.520 --> 02:03:03.200]   in an open place, he noticed that its hair was gray.
[02:03:03.200 --> 02:03:06.680]   "Are spirits' lives so short?" asked Scrooge.
[02:03:06.680 --> 02:03:11.600]   "My life upon this globe is very brief," replied the ghost. "It ends tonight."
[02:03:11.600 --> 02:03:17.080]   "Tonight!" cried Scrooge. "Tonight at midnight! Hark! The time is drawing near!"
[02:03:17.080 --> 02:03:20.720]   The chimes were ringing the three quarters past eleven at that moment.
[02:03:20.720 --> 02:03:25.760]   "Forgive me if I am not justified in what I ask," said Scrooge, looking intently at
[02:03:25.760 --> 02:03:30.060]   the spirit's robe, "but I see something strange and not belonging to yourself protruding
[02:03:30.060 --> 02:03:33.520]   from your skirts. Is it a foot or a claw?"
[02:03:33.520 --> 02:03:38.160]   "It might be a claw, for the flesh there is upon it," was the spirit's sorrowful
[02:03:38.160 --> 02:03:45.400]   reply. "Look here!" From the foldings of its robe, it brought two children, wretched,
[02:03:45.400 --> 02:03:53.000]   abject, frightful, hideous, miserable. They knelt down at its feet and clung upon the
[02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:54.480]   outside of its garment.
[02:03:54.480 --> 02:03:59.360]   "Oh man, look here! Look, look, down here!" exclaimed the ghost.
[02:03:59.360 --> 02:04:06.120]   They were a boy and a girl, yellow, meager, ragged, scowling, wolfish, but prostrate too
[02:04:06.120 --> 02:04:10.640]   in their humility. Where graceful youth should have filled their features out and touched
[02:04:10.640 --> 02:04:16.480]   them with its freshest tints, a stale and shriveled hand like that of age had pinched
[02:04:16.480 --> 02:04:22.480]   and twisted them and pulled them into shreds. Where angels might have sat enthroned, devils
[02:04:22.480 --> 02:04:28.800]   lurked and glared out menacing. No change, no degradation, no perversion of humanity
[02:04:28.800 --> 02:04:34.560]   in any grade, through all the mysteries of wonderful creation, has monsters half so horrible
[02:04:34.560 --> 02:04:40.040]   and dread. Scrooge started back, appalled. Having them shown to him in this way, he tried
[02:04:40.040 --> 02:04:46.040]   to say they were fine children, but the words choked themselves rather than be parties to
[02:04:46.040 --> 02:04:48.360]   a lie of such enormous magnitude.
[02:04:48.360 --> 02:04:51.880]   "Spirit, are they yours?" Scrooge could say no more.
[02:04:51.880 --> 02:04:56.600]   "They are man's," said the spirit, looking down upon them. "And they cling to me, appealing
[02:04:56.600 --> 02:05:02.720]   from their fathers. This boy is ignorance, this girl is want. Beware them both and all
[02:05:02.720 --> 02:05:08.400]   of their degree, but most of all, beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which
[02:05:08.400 --> 02:05:13.960]   is doom, unless the writing be erased. Deny it," cried the spirit, stretching out its
[02:05:13.960 --> 02:05:19.640]   hand towards the city. "Slander those who tell it ye. Admit it for your factious purposes
[02:05:19.640 --> 02:05:22.360]   and make it worse, and bide the end."
[02:05:22.360 --> 02:05:25.400]   "Have they no refuge or resource?" Cried Scrooge.
[02:05:25.400 --> 02:05:29.360]   "Are there no prisons?" Said the spirit, turning on him for the last time with his
[02:05:29.360 --> 02:05:35.360]   own words. "Are there no workhouses?" The bell struck twelve.
[02:05:35.360 --> 02:05:40.520]   Scrooge looked about him for the ghost and saw it not. As the last stroke ceased to vibrate,
[02:05:40.520 --> 02:05:46.800]   he remembered the prediction of old Jacob Marley, and lifting up his eyes, beheld a
[02:05:46.800 --> 02:06:01.880]   solemn phantom, draped and hooded, coming, like a mist along the ground, towards him.
[02:06:01.880 --> 02:06:06.520]   STAVE IV. THE LAST OF THE SPIRITS
[02:06:06.520 --> 02:06:14.960]   The phantom slowly, gravely, silently approached. When it came near him, Scrooge bent down upon
[02:06:14.960 --> 02:06:21.760]   his knee, for in the very air through which this spirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom
[02:06:21.760 --> 02:06:28.680]   and mystery. It was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed its head, its face,
[02:06:28.680 --> 02:06:35.280]   its form, and left nothing of it visible save one outstretched hand. But for this it would
[02:06:35.280 --> 02:06:40.080]   have been difficult to detach its figure from the night and separate it from the darkness
[02:06:40.080 --> 02:06:46.480]   by which it was surrounded. He felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside him,
[02:06:46.480 --> 02:06:52.760]   and that its mysterious presence filled him with a solemn dread. He knew no more, for
[02:06:52.760 --> 02:07:00.640]   the spirit neither spoke nor moved. "I am in the presence of the ghost of Christmas
[02:07:00.640 --> 02:07:10.040]   yet to come," said Scrooge. The spirit answered not, but pointed onward with its hand. "You
[02:07:10.040 --> 02:07:14.040]   are about to show me shadows of the things that have not happened but will happen in
[02:07:14.040 --> 02:07:17.880]   the time before us," Scrooge pursued. "Is that so, spirit?"
[02:07:17.880 --> 02:07:24.040]   The upper portion of the garment was contracted for an instant in its folds, as if the spirit
[02:07:24.040 --> 02:07:31.760]   had inclined its head. That was the only answer he received. Although well used to ghostly
[02:07:31.760 --> 02:07:37.320]   company by this time, Scrooge feared the silent shape so much that his legs trembled beneath
[02:07:37.320 --> 02:07:42.120]   him and he found that he could hardly stand when he prepared to follow it. The spirit
[02:07:42.120 --> 02:07:46.800]   paused a moment as observing his condition and giving him time to recover. But Scrooge
[02:07:46.800 --> 02:07:51.160]   was all the worse for this. It thrilled him with a vague, uncertain horror to know that
[02:07:51.160 --> 02:07:57.360]   behind the dusky shroud there were ghostly eyes intently fixed upon him while he, though
[02:07:57.360 --> 02:08:02.360]   he stretched his own to the utmost, could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great
[02:08:02.360 --> 02:08:08.880]   heap of black. "Ghost of the future!" he exclaimed. "I fear you more than any specter
[02:08:08.880 --> 02:08:13.080]   I have seen, but as I know your purpose is to do me good and as I hope to live to be
[02:08:13.080 --> 02:08:18.480]   another man from what I was, I am prepared to bear you company and do it with a thankful
[02:08:18.480 --> 02:08:27.420]   heart. Will you not speak to me?" It gave him no reply. The hand was pointed straight
[02:08:27.420 --> 02:08:33.320]   before them. "Lead on!" said Scrooge. "Lead on! The night is waning fast and it
[02:08:33.320 --> 02:08:39.480]   is precious time to me, I know. Lead on, spirit!" The phantom moved away as it had
[02:08:39.480 --> 02:08:44.760]   come towards him. Scrooge followed in the shadow of its dress which bore him up, he
[02:08:44.760 --> 02:08:49.640]   thought, and carried him along. They scarcely seemed to enter the city, but the city rather
[02:08:49.640 --> 02:08:54.960]   seemed to spring up about them and encompass them of its own act. But there they were,
[02:08:54.960 --> 02:08:59.280]   in the heart of it, on change, amongst the merchants who hurried up and down and chinked
[02:08:59.280 --> 02:09:05.120]   the money in their pockets and conversed in groups and looked at their watches and trifled
[02:09:05.120 --> 02:09:12.160]   thoughtfully with their great gold seals and so forth, as Scrooge had seen them often.
[02:09:12.160 --> 02:09:18.020]   The spirit stopped beside one little knot of businessmen. Observing that the hand was
[02:09:18.020 --> 02:09:22.640]   pointed to them, Scrooge advanced to listen to their talk.
[02:09:22.640 --> 02:09:28.480]   "No," said a great fat man with a monstrous chin. "I don't know much about it, either
[02:09:28.480 --> 02:09:32.700]   way. I only know he's dead." "When did he die?" inquired another. "Last
[02:09:32.700 --> 02:09:36.880]   night, I believe." "Why, what was the matter with him?" asked a third, taking
[02:09:36.880 --> 02:09:43.040]   a vast quantity of snuff out of a very large snuff box. "I thought he'd never die."
[02:09:43.040 --> 02:09:47.920]   "God knows," said the first, with a yawn. "What has he done with his money?"
[02:09:47.920 --> 02:09:54.360]   asked a red-faced gentleman with a pendulous excrescence on the end of his nose that shook
[02:09:54.360 --> 02:09:59.520]   like the gills of a turkey cock. "I haven't heard," said the man with a large
[02:09:59.520 --> 02:10:02.840]   chin, yawning again. "Left it to his company, perhaps."
[02:10:02.840 --> 02:10:08.040]   "He hasn't left it to me, that's all I know." This pleasantry was received with
[02:10:08.040 --> 02:10:13.400]   a general laugh. "It's likely to be a very cheap funeral," said the same speaker,
[02:10:13.400 --> 02:10:18.840]   "for upon my life I don't know of anybody to go to it. Suppose we make up a party and
[02:10:18.840 --> 02:10:23.200]   volunteer." "I don't mind going if a lunch is provided,"
[02:10:23.200 --> 02:10:28.600]   observed the gentleman with the excrescence on his nose, "but I must be fed if I make
[02:10:28.600 --> 02:10:34.760]   one." Another laugh. "Well, I am the most disinterested among you after all," said
[02:10:34.760 --> 02:10:41.000]   the first speaker, "for I never wear black gloves and I never eat lunch. But I'll offer
[02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:45.300]   to go if anybody else will. When I come to think of it I'm not at all sure that I wasn't
[02:10:45.300 --> 02:10:51.400]   his most particular friend, for we used to stop and speak whenever we met. Bye-bye."
[02:10:51.400 --> 02:10:55.800]   Speakers and listeners strolled away, and mixed with other groups. Scrooge knew the
[02:10:55.800 --> 02:11:02.520]   men and looked towards the spirit for an explanation. The phantom glided on into a street, its
[02:11:02.520 --> 02:11:08.240]   finger pointed to two persons meeting. Scrooge listened again, thinking that the explanation
[02:11:08.240 --> 02:11:14.240]   might lie here. He knew these men also perfectly. They were men of business, very wealthy and
[02:11:14.240 --> 02:11:20.120]   of great importance. He had made a point always of standing well in their esteem. On a business
[02:11:20.120 --> 02:11:23.120]   point of view, that is, strictly in a business point of view.
[02:11:23.120 --> 02:11:26.440]   "How are you?" said one. "How are you?" returned the other.
[02:11:26.440 --> 02:11:30.720]   "Well," said the first, "old Scratch has got his own at last, eh? So I'm told,"
[02:11:30.720 --> 02:11:34.000]   returned the second. "Cold, isn't it? Seasonable for Christmastime. You're not
[02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:40.000]   a skater, I suppose? No, no, something else to think of. Good morning."
[02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:46.200]   Not another word. That was their meeting, their conversation, and their parting.
[02:11:46.200 --> 02:11:49.480]   Scrooge was at first inclined to be surprised that the spirit should attach importance to
[02:11:49.480 --> 02:11:54.600]   conversations apparently so trivial, but feeling assured that they must have some hidden purpose,
[02:11:54.600 --> 02:11:58.640]   he set himself to consider what it was likely to be. They could scarcely be supposed to
[02:11:58.640 --> 02:12:03.320]   have any bearing on the death of Jacob, his old partner, for that was past and this ghost's
[02:12:03.320 --> 02:12:07.800]   province was the future. Nor could he think of anyone immediately connected with himself
[02:12:07.800 --> 02:12:12.960]   to whom he could apply them, but nothing doubting that to whomsoever they applied they had some
[02:12:12.960 --> 02:12:18.040]   latent moral for his own improvement, he resolved to treasure up every word he heard and everything
[02:12:18.040 --> 02:12:22.880]   he saw, and especially to observe the shadow of himself when it appeared, for he had an
[02:12:22.880 --> 02:12:27.120]   expectation that the conduct of his future self would give him the clue he missed and
[02:12:27.120 --> 02:12:31.840]   would render the solution of these riddles easy. He looked about in that very place for
[02:12:31.840 --> 02:12:37.520]   his own image, but another man stood in his accustomed corner, and though the clock pointed
[02:12:37.520 --> 02:12:43.100]   to his usual time of day for being there, he saw no likeness of himself among the multitudes
[02:12:43.100 --> 02:12:48.120]   that poured in through the porch. It gave him little surprise, however, for he had been
[02:12:48.120 --> 02:12:53.880]   revolving in his mind a change of life, and thought and hoped he saw his newborn resolutions
[02:12:53.880 --> 02:13:00.400]   carried out in this. Quiet and dark beside him stood the phantom with its outstretched
[02:13:00.400 --> 02:13:05.520]   hand. When he roused himself from his thoughtful quest, he fancied from the turn of the hand
[02:13:05.520 --> 02:13:12.680]   and its situation in reference to himself that the unseen eyes were looking at him keenly.
[02:13:12.680 --> 02:13:19.440]   It made him shudder and feel very cold. They left the busy scene and went into an obscure
[02:13:19.440 --> 02:13:24.920]   part of the town where Scrooge had never penetrated before, although he recognized its situation
[02:13:24.920 --> 02:13:33.400]   and its bad repute. The ways were foul and narrow, the shops and houses wretched, the
[02:13:33.400 --> 02:13:42.720]   people half-naked, drunken, slipshod, ugly. Alleys and archways like so many cesspools
[02:13:42.720 --> 02:13:50.240]   disgorged their offenses of smell and dirt and life upon the straggling streets, and
[02:13:50.240 --> 02:13:58.260]   the whole quarter reeked with crime, with filth and misery. Far in this den of infamous
[02:13:58.260 --> 02:14:06.120]   resort there was a low-browed beetling shop below a penthouse roof where iron, old rags,
[02:14:06.120 --> 02:14:12.160]   bottles, bones, and greasy offal were bought. Upon the floor within were piled up heaps
[02:14:12.160 --> 02:14:21.000]   of rusty keys, nails, chains, hinges, files, scales, weights, and refuse iron of all kinds.
[02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:27.120]   Secrets that few would like to scrutinize were bred and hidden in mountains of unseemly
[02:14:27.120 --> 02:14:34.440]   rags, masses of corrupted fat, and sepulchres of bones. Sitting in among the wares he dealt
[02:14:34.440 --> 02:14:41.280]   in by a charcoal stove made of old bricks was a gray-haired rascal, nearly seventy years
[02:14:41.280 --> 02:14:47.160]   of age, who had screened himself from the cold air without, by a frowsy curtaining of
[02:14:47.160 --> 02:14:53.760]   miscellaneous tatters, hung upon a line, and smoked his pipe in all the luxury of calm
[02:14:53.760 --> 02:14:59.720]   retirement. Scrooge and the Phantom came into the presence of this man, just as a woman
[02:14:59.720 --> 02:15:06.240]   with a heavy bundle slunk into the shop; but she had scarcely entered when another woman,
[02:15:06.240 --> 02:15:11.720]   similarly laden, came in too, and she was closely followed by a man in faded black,
[02:15:11.720 --> 02:15:15.480]   who was no less startled by the sight of them than they had been upon the recognition of
[02:15:15.480 --> 02:15:20.720]   each other. After a short period of blank astonishment in which the old man with the
[02:15:20.720 --> 02:15:27.080]   pipe had joined them, they all three burst into a laugh. "Let the charwoman alone to
[02:15:27.080 --> 02:15:30.920]   be the first," cried she who had entered first. "Let the laundress alone to be the
[02:15:30.920 --> 02:15:35.600]   second, and let the undertaker's man alone to be the third. Look here, old Joe, here's
[02:15:35.600 --> 02:15:39.360]   a chance, if we haven't all three met here without meaning it."
[02:15:39.360 --> 02:15:44.320]   "You couldn't have met in a better place," said old Joe, removing his pipe from his mouth.
[02:15:44.320 --> 02:15:48.320]   "Come into the parlor. You were made free of it long ago, you know, and the other two
[02:15:48.320 --> 02:15:53.080]   aren't strangers. Stop till I shut up the door of the shop. Ah, how it squeaks! There
[02:15:53.080 --> 02:15:56.560]   ain't such a rusty bit of metal in the place as its own hinges, I believe, and I'm sure
[02:15:56.560 --> 02:16:01.680]   there's no such old bones here as mine. Ha ha, we're all suitable to our calling. We're
[02:16:01.680 --> 02:16:06.280]   well matched. Come into the parlor, come into the parlor." The parlor was the space behind
[02:16:06.280 --> 02:16:11.560]   the screen of rags. The old man raked the fire together with an old stair rod, and having
[02:16:11.560 --> 02:16:17.240]   trimmed his smoky lamp, for it was night, with the stem of his pipe put it in his mouth
[02:16:17.240 --> 02:16:22.760]   again. While he did this, the woman who had already spoken threw her bundle on the floor,
[02:16:22.760 --> 02:16:27.720]   and sat down in a flaunting manner on a stool, crossing her elbows on her knees and looking
[02:16:27.720 --> 02:16:33.760]   with a bold defiance at the other two. "What odds, then? What odds, Mrs. Dilber?" said
[02:16:33.760 --> 02:16:38.680]   the woman. "Every person has a right to take care of themselves. He always did."
[02:16:38.680 --> 02:16:42.480]   "That's true, indeed," said the laundress. "No man more so."
[02:16:42.480 --> 02:16:46.560]   "Why, then, don't stand staring as if you was afraid, woman. Who's the wiser? We're
[02:16:46.560 --> 02:16:48.920]   not going to pick holes in each other's coats, I suppose."
[02:16:48.920 --> 02:16:53.040]   "No, indeed," said Mrs. Dilber and the man together. "We should hope not."
[02:16:53.040 --> 02:16:57.040]   "Very well, then," cried the woman. "That's enough. Who's the worse for the loss of a
[02:16:57.040 --> 02:16:59.600]   few things like these? Not a dead man, I suppose."
[02:16:59.600 --> 02:17:04.480]   "No, indeed," said Mrs. Dilber, laughing. "If he wanted to keep him after he was dead,
[02:17:04.480 --> 02:17:08.600]   a wicked old screw," pursued the woman, "why wasn't he natural in his lifetime?
[02:17:08.600 --> 02:17:11.640]   If he had been, he'd have had somebody to look after him when he was struck with death
[02:17:11.640 --> 02:17:16.440]   instead of lying gasping out his last there, alone by himself."
[02:17:16.440 --> 02:17:21.920]   "It's the truest word that ever was spoke," said Mrs. Dilber. "It's a judgment on him."
[02:17:21.920 --> 02:17:26.040]   "I wish it was a little heavier judgment," replied the woman, "and it should have been.
[02:17:26.040 --> 02:17:30.520]   You may depend upon it. If I could have laid my hands on anything else. Open that bundle,
[02:17:30.520 --> 02:17:34.240]   old Joe, and let me know the value of it. Speak out plain. I'm not afraid to be the
[02:17:34.240 --> 02:17:37.920]   first nor afraid for them to see it. We know pretty well that we were helping ourselves
[02:17:37.920 --> 02:17:42.120]   before we met here, I believe. It's no sin. Open the bundle, Joe."
[02:17:42.120 --> 02:17:47.080]   But the gallantry of her friends would not allow of this, and the man in faded black
[02:17:47.080 --> 02:17:54.160]   mounting the breach first produced his plunder. It was not extensive. A seal or two, a pencil
[02:17:54.160 --> 02:18:00.000]   case, a pair of sleeve buttons, and a brooch of no great value were all. They were severally
[02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:05.180]   examined and appraised by old Joe, who chalked the sums he was disposed to give for each
[02:18:05.180 --> 02:18:10.320]   upon the wall and added them up into a total when he found there was nothing more to come.
[02:18:10.320 --> 02:18:14.400]   "That's your account," said Joe, "and I wouldn't give another sixpence if I was to be boiled
[02:18:14.400 --> 02:18:16.560]   for not doing it. Who's next?"
[02:18:16.560 --> 02:18:22.960]   Mrs. Dilber was next. Sheets and towels, a little wearing apparel, two old-fashioned
[02:18:22.960 --> 02:18:28.000]   silver teaspoons, a pair of sugar tongs, and a few boots. Her account was stated on the
[02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:29.520]   wall in the same manner.
[02:18:29.520 --> 02:18:33.840]   "I always give too much to ladies. It's a weakness of mine, and that's the way I ruin myself,"
[02:18:33.840 --> 02:18:37.400]   said old Joe. "That's your account. If you asked me for another penny and made it an open
[02:18:37.400 --> 02:18:40.000]   question I'd repent of being so liberal and knock off half a crown."
[02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:44.080]   "And now undo my bundle, Joe," said the first woman.
[02:18:44.080 --> 02:18:48.800]   Joe went down on his knees for the greater convenience of opening it, and having unfastened
[02:18:48.800 --> 02:18:53.000]   a great many knots, dragged out a large and heavy roll of some dark stuff.
[02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:55.600]   "What do you call this?" said Joe.
[02:18:55.600 --> 02:18:56.600]   "Bed-curtains."
[02:18:56.600 --> 02:19:02.360]   "Ah!" returned the woman, laughing and leaning forward on her crossed arms. "Bed-curtains!
[02:19:02.360 --> 02:19:06.160]   You don't mean to say you took 'em down rings and all with him lying there?" said Joe.
[02:19:06.160 --> 02:19:09.360]   "Yes, I do," replied the woman. "Why not?"
[02:19:09.360 --> 02:19:15.500]   "You were born to make your fortune," said Joe, "and you'll certainly do it. I certainly
[02:19:15.500 --> 02:19:19.060]   shan't hold my hand when I can get anything in it by reaching it out for the sake of such
[02:19:19.060 --> 02:19:24.560]   a man as he was, I promise you, Joe!" returned the woman, coolly. "Don't drop that oil upon
[02:19:24.560 --> 02:19:25.560]   the blankets now."
[02:19:25.560 --> 02:19:27.800]   "His blankets?" asked Joe.
[02:19:27.800 --> 02:19:32.200]   "Whose else's do you think?" replied the woman. "He isn't likely to take cold without 'em,
[02:19:32.200 --> 02:19:33.200]   I dare say."
[02:19:33.200 --> 02:19:37.880]   "I hope he didn't die of anything catching, eh?" said old Joe, stopping in his work and
[02:19:37.880 --> 02:19:38.880]   looking up.
[02:19:38.880 --> 02:19:42.240]   "Don't you be afraid of that," returned the woman. "I ain't so fond of his company that
[02:19:42.240 --> 02:19:44.560]   I'd loiter about him for such things if he did."
[02:19:44.560 --> 02:19:48.080]   "Ah, you may look through that shirt till your eyes ache, but you won't find a hole
[02:19:48.080 --> 02:19:52.720]   in it nor a threadbare place. It's the best he had and a fine one, too. They'd have wasted
[02:19:52.720 --> 02:19:54.120]   it if it hadn't been for me."
[02:19:54.120 --> 02:19:57.000]   "What do you call wasting of it?" asked old Joe.
[02:19:57.000 --> 02:20:00.840]   "Putting it on him to be buried and to be sure," replied the woman with a laugh. "Somebody
[02:20:00.840 --> 02:20:04.040]   was fool enough to do it, but I took it off again. If calico ain't good enough for such
[02:20:04.040 --> 02:20:07.920]   a purpose, it isn't good enough for anything. It's quite as becoming to the body. He can't
[02:20:07.920 --> 02:20:10.520]   look uglier than he did in that one."
[02:20:10.520 --> 02:20:16.720]   Scrooge listened to this dialogue in horror. As they sat grouped about their spoil in the
[02:20:16.720 --> 02:20:23.520]   scanty light afforded by the old man's lamp, he viewed them with a detestation and disgust
[02:20:23.520 --> 02:20:28.920]   which could hardly have been greater, though they had been obscene demons, marketing the
[02:20:28.920 --> 02:20:30.320]   corpse itself.
[02:20:30.320 --> 02:20:35.360]   "Ha ha!" laughed the same woman, when old Joe, producing a flannel bag with money in
[02:20:35.360 --> 02:20:39.920]   it, told out their several gains upon the ground. "This is the end of it, you see."
[02:20:39.920 --> 02:20:46.720]   He frightened everyone away from him when he was alive, to profit us when he was dead.
[02:20:46.720 --> 02:20:54.680]   "Ha ha ha ha! Spirit," said Scrooge, shuddering from head to foot, "I see. I see. The case
[02:20:54.680 --> 02:20:59.720]   of this unhappy man might be my own. My life tends that way now. Merciful heaven, what
[02:20:59.720 --> 02:21:01.200]   is this?"
[02:21:01.200 --> 02:21:07.440]   He recoiled in terror, for the scene had changed, and now he almost touched a bed, a bare, uncurtained
[02:21:07.440 --> 02:21:13.520]   bed, on which, beneath a ragged sheet, there lay a something covered up, which, though
[02:21:13.520 --> 02:21:19.880]   it was dumb, announced itself in awful language. The room was very dark, too dark to be observed
[02:21:19.880 --> 02:21:24.800]   with any accuracy, though Scrooge glanced round it in obedience to a secret impulse,
[02:21:24.800 --> 02:21:29.520]   anxious to know what kind of room it was. A pale light, rising in the outer air, fell
[02:21:29.520 --> 02:21:36.680]   straight upon the bed, and on it, plundered and bereft, unwatched, unwept, uncared for,
[02:21:36.680 --> 02:21:39.160]   was the body of this man.
[02:21:39.160 --> 02:21:44.640]   Scrooge glanced towards the phantom. Its steady hand was pointed to the head. The cover was
[02:21:44.640 --> 02:21:49.080]   so carelessly adjusted that the slightest raising of it, the motion of a finger upon
[02:21:49.080 --> 02:21:53.640]   Scrooge's part, would have disclosed the face. He thought of it, felt how easy it would be
[02:21:53.640 --> 02:21:59.440]   to do, and longed to do it, but had no more power to withdraw the veil than to dismiss
[02:21:59.440 --> 02:22:06.920]   the spectre at his side. "Oh, cold, cold, rigid, dreadful death! Set up thine altar
[02:22:06.920 --> 02:22:14.120]   here and dress it with such terrors as thou hast at thy command, for this is thy dominion.
[02:22:14.120 --> 02:22:21.040]   But of the loved, revered, and honoured head thou canst not turn one hair to thy dread
[02:22:21.040 --> 02:22:27.720]   purposes or make one feature odious. It is not that the hand is heavy and will fall down
[02:22:27.720 --> 02:22:35.800]   when released. It is not that the heart and pulse are still, but that the hand was open,
[02:22:35.800 --> 02:22:44.440]   generous and true, the heart brave, warm and tender, and the pulse a man's. Strike, shadow,
[02:22:44.440 --> 02:22:52.720]   strike, and see his good deeds springing from the wound to sow the world with life immortal."
[02:22:52.720 --> 02:22:58.300]   No voice pronounced these words in Scrooge's ears, and yet he heard them when he looked
[02:22:58.300 --> 02:23:03.960]   upon the bed. He thought, "If this man could be raised up now, what would be his foremost
[02:23:03.960 --> 02:23:11.960]   thoughts? Avarice? Hard-dealing? Griping cares? They have brought him to a rich end. Truly,
[02:23:11.960 --> 02:23:17.080]   he lay in the dark, empty house with not a man, a woman, or a child to say that he was
[02:23:17.080 --> 02:23:22.560]   kind to me in this or that. And for the memory of one kind word, I will be kind to him."
[02:23:22.560 --> 02:23:28.560]   A cat was tearing at the door, and there was a sound of gnawing rats beneath the hearthstone.
[02:23:28.560 --> 02:23:33.960]   What they wanted in the room of death, and why they were so restless and disturbed, Scrooge
[02:23:33.960 --> 02:23:40.680]   did not dare to think. "Spirit," he said, "this is a fearful place. In leaving it I
[02:23:40.680 --> 02:23:45.440]   shall not leave its lesson. Trust me, let us go." Still the ghost pointed with an unmoved
[02:23:45.440 --> 02:23:49.960]   finger to the head. "I understand you," Scrooge returned, "and I would do it if I could, but
[02:23:49.960 --> 02:23:55.640]   I have not the power. Spirit, I have not the power." Again it seemed to look upon him.
[02:23:55.640 --> 02:24:02.480]   "If there is any person in the town who feels emotion caused by this man's death," said
[02:24:02.480 --> 02:24:08.240]   Scrooge, quite agonized, "show that person to me, Spirit. I beseech you." The phantom
[02:24:08.240 --> 02:24:14.840]   spread its dark robe before him for a moment, like a wing, and withdrawing it, revealed
[02:24:14.840 --> 02:24:21.080]   a room by daylight where a mother and her children were. She was expecting someone,
[02:24:21.080 --> 02:24:26.840]   and with anxious eagerness, for she walked up and down the room, started at every sound,
[02:24:26.840 --> 02:24:31.280]   looked out from the window, glanced at the clock, tried but in vain to work with her
[02:24:31.280 --> 02:24:36.280]   needle and could hardly bear the voices of the children in their play. At length the
[02:24:36.280 --> 02:24:43.240]   long-expected knock was heard. She hurried to the door and met her husband, a man whose
[02:24:43.240 --> 02:24:48.760]   face was careworn and depressed, though he was young. There was a remarkable expression
[02:24:48.760 --> 02:24:53.880]   in it now, a kind of serious delight of which he felt ashamed and which he struggled to
[02:24:53.880 --> 02:24:59.000]   repress. He sat down to the dinner that had been hoarding for him by the fire, and when
[02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:03.880]   she asked him faintly what news, which was not until after a long silence, he appeared
[02:25:03.880 --> 02:25:10.440]   embarrassed how to answer. "Is it good," she said, "or bad," to help him. "Bad," he answered.
[02:25:10.440 --> 02:25:17.000]   "We are quite ruined." "No, there is hope yet, Caroline." "If he relents," she said
[02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:22.840]   amazed, "there is. Nothing is past hope if such a miracle has happened." "He is past
[02:25:22.840 --> 02:25:31.360]   relenting," said her husband. "He is dead." She was a mild and patient creature if her
[02:25:31.360 --> 02:25:38.600]   face spoke truth, but she was thankful in her soul to hear it, and she said so with
[02:25:38.600 --> 02:25:44.440]   clasped hands. She prayed forgiveness the next moment and was sorry, but the first was
[02:25:44.440 --> 02:25:49.160]   the emotion of her heart. What the half-drunken woman whom I told you of last night said to
[02:25:49.160 --> 02:25:54.360]   me when I tried to see him and obtain a week's delay, and what I thought was a mere excuse
[02:25:54.360 --> 02:26:01.040]   to avoid me, turns out to have been quite true. He was not only very ill but dying then.
[02:26:01.040 --> 02:26:05.600]   To whom will our debt be transferred? I don't know, but before that time we shall be ready
[02:26:05.600 --> 02:26:10.040]   with the money, and even though we were not, it would be a bad fortune indeed to find so
[02:26:10.040 --> 02:26:14.560]   merciless a creditor in his successor. We may sleep tonight with light hearts, Caroline."
[02:26:14.560 --> 02:26:21.800]   "Yes, soften it as they would. Their hearts were lighter. The children's faces, hushed
[02:26:21.800 --> 02:26:26.840]   and clustered round to hear what they so little understood, were brighter, and it was a happier
[02:26:26.840 --> 02:26:31.720]   house for this man's death. The only emotion that the ghost could show him caused by the
[02:26:31.720 --> 02:26:37.280]   event was one of pleasure. 'Let me see some tenderness connected with a death,' said
[02:26:37.280 --> 02:26:42.680]   Scrooge, 'or that dark chamber spirit which we left just now will be forever present to
[02:26:42.680 --> 02:26:48.080]   me.' The ghost conducted him through several streets familiar to his feet, and as they
[02:26:48.080 --> 02:26:53.400]   went along Scrooge looked here and there to find himself, but nowhere was he to be seen.
[02:26:53.400 --> 02:26:58.040]   They entered poor Bob Cratchit's house, the dwelling he had visited before and found the
[02:26:58.040 --> 02:27:05.160]   mother and the children seated round the fire, quiet, very quiet. The noisy little Cratchits
[02:27:05.160 --> 02:27:10.080]   were as still as statues in one corner, and sat looking up at Peter, who had a book before
[02:27:10.080 --> 02:27:14.840]   him. The mother and her daughters were engaged in sewing, but surely they were very quiet,
[02:27:14.840 --> 02:27:19.200]   and he took a child and set him in the midst of them. Where had Scrooge heard those words?
[02:27:19.200 --> 02:27:22.360]   He had not dreamed them. The boy must have read them out as he and the spirit crossed
[02:27:22.360 --> 02:27:26.760]   the threshold. Why did he not go on?' The mother laid her work upon the table and put
[02:27:26.760 --> 02:27:31.040]   her hand up to her face. 'The colour hurts my eyes,' she said.
[02:27:31.040 --> 02:27:36.160]   'The colour! Ah, poor tiny Tim!' 'They're better now again,' said Cratchit's wife. 'It
[02:27:36.160 --> 02:27:39.520]   makes them weak by candlelight, and I wouldn't show weak eyes to your father when he comes
[02:27:39.520 --> 02:27:44.280]   home for the world. It must be near his time.' 'Past it, rather,' Peter answered, shutting
[02:27:44.280 --> 02:27:49.400]   up his book. 'But I think he's walked a little slower than he used these few last evenings,
[02:27:49.400 --> 02:27:50.400]   mother.'
[02:27:50.400 --> 02:27:55.680]   They were very quiet again. At last, she said, and in a steady, cheerful voice that only
[02:27:55.680 --> 02:28:03.720]   faltered once, 'I have known him walk with Tiny Tim upon his shoulder very fast indeed.'
[02:28:03.720 --> 02:28:09.680]   'And so have I!' cried Peter, often. 'And so have I!' exclaimed another. 'So had all.'
[02:28:09.680 --> 02:28:14.760]   'But he was very light to carry,' she resumed, intent upon her work. 'And his father loved
[02:28:14.760 --> 02:28:18.720]   him so that it was no trouble, no trouble, and there was your father at the door!' She
[02:28:18.720 --> 02:28:22.800]   hurried out to meet him, and little Bob and his comforter—he had need of it, poor fellow—came
[02:28:22.800 --> 02:28:26.800]   in. His tea was ready for him on the hob, and they all tried who should help him to
[02:28:26.800 --> 02:28:31.080]   it most. Then the two young Cratchits got upon his knees and laid each child a little
[02:28:31.080 --> 02:28:36.160]   cheek against his face, as if they said, 'Don't mind it, father, don't be grieved.' Bob was
[02:28:36.160 --> 02:28:40.080]   very cheerful with them, and spoke pleasantly to all the family. He looked at the work upon
[02:28:40.080 --> 02:28:44.600]   the table, and praised the industry and speed of Mrs. Cratchit and the girls. They would
[02:28:44.600 --> 02:28:47.040]   be done long before Sunday, he said.
[02:28:47.040 --> 02:28:49.720]   'Sunday! You went to-day then, Robert?' said his wife.
[02:28:49.720 --> 02:28:53.800]   'Yes, my dear,' returned Bob, 'I wish you could have gone. It would have done you good
[02:28:53.800 --> 02:28:57.000]   to see how green a place it is, but you'll see it often. I promised him that I would
[02:28:57.000 --> 02:29:04.320]   walk there on a Sunday. My little child, my little child!' cried Bob. 'My little child!'
[02:29:04.320 --> 02:29:08.800]   He broke down all at once. He couldn't help it. If he could have helped it, he and his
[02:29:08.800 --> 02:29:12.920]   child would have been farther apart, perhaps, than they were. He left the room, and went
[02:29:12.920 --> 02:29:18.400]   upstairs into the room above, which was lighted cheerfully and hung with Christmas. There
[02:29:18.400 --> 02:29:23.320]   was a chair set close beside the child, and there were signs of someone having been there
[02:29:23.320 --> 02:29:28.880]   lately. Poor Bob sat down in it, and when he had thought a little and composed himself,
[02:29:28.880 --> 02:29:33.760]   he kissed the little face. He was reconciled to what had happened, and went down again,
[02:29:33.760 --> 02:29:39.160]   quite happy. They drew about the fire and talked, the girls and mother working still.
[02:29:39.160 --> 02:29:44.080]   Bob told them of the extraordinary kindness of Mr. Scrooge's nephew, whom he had scarcely
[02:29:44.080 --> 02:29:48.560]   seen but once, and who, meeting him in the street that day and seeing that he looked
[02:29:48.560 --> 02:29:53.800]   just a little down, you know, said Bob, inquired what had happened to distress him. 'On which?'
[02:29:53.800 --> 02:29:57.760]   said Bob. 'For he is the pleasantest spoken gentleman you ever heard,' I told him. 'I
[02:29:57.760 --> 02:30:02.880]   am heartily sorry for it, Mr. Cratchit,' he said, 'and heartily sorry for your good wife.'
[02:30:02.880 --> 02:30:07.720]   By the by, how he ever knew that, I don't know. 'Knew what, my dear?' 'Why, that you
[02:30:07.720 --> 02:30:12.400]   were a good wife,' replied Bob. 'Everybody knows that,' said Peter. 'Very well observed,
[02:30:12.400 --> 02:30:17.080]   my boy,' cried Bob. 'I hope they do. Heartily sorry,' he said, 'for your good wife. If
[02:30:17.080 --> 02:30:21.560]   I can be of service to you in any way,' he said, giving me his card, 'that's where I
[02:30:21.560 --> 02:30:26.060]   live. Pray come to me.' Now it wasn't, cried Bob, for the sake of anything he might be
[02:30:26.060 --> 02:30:31.240]   able to do for us, so much as for his kind way that this was quite delightful. It really
[02:30:31.240 --> 02:30:37.000]   seemed as if he had known our tiny Tim and felt with us. 'I'm sure he's a good soul,'
[02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:41.760]   said Mrs. Cratchit. 'You would be sure of it, my dear,' returned Bob, 'if you saw and
[02:30:41.760 --> 02:30:47.160]   spoke to him. I shouldn't be at all surprised. Mark what I say if he got Peter a better situation.'
[02:30:47.160 --> 02:30:52.280]   'Only hear that, Peter,' said Mrs. Cratchit. 'And then,' cried one of the girls, 'Peter
[02:30:52.280 --> 02:30:56.960]   will be keeping company with someone and setting up for himself. Get along with you,' retorted
[02:30:56.960 --> 02:31:01.440]   Peter, grinning. 'It's just as likely as not,' said Bob. 'One of these days, though
[02:31:01.440 --> 02:31:05.040]   there's plenty of time for that, my dear, but however and whenever we part from one
[02:31:05.040 --> 02:31:09.760]   another, I am sure we shall none of us forget poor tiny Tim, shall we? Or this first parting
[02:31:09.760 --> 02:31:14.520]   that there was amongst us?' 'Never, father,' cried they all. 'And I know,' said Bob, 'I
[02:31:14.520 --> 02:31:19.160]   know, my dears, that when we recollect how patient and how mild he was, although he was
[02:31:19.160 --> 02:31:23.940]   a little, little child, we shall not quarrel easily among ourselves and forget poor tiny
[02:31:23.940 --> 02:31:30.240]   Tim in doing it.' 'No, never, father,' they all cried again. 'I am very happy,' said little
[02:31:30.240 --> 02:31:36.040]   Bob. 'I am very happy.' Mrs. Cratchit kissed him, and his daughters kissed him. The two
[02:31:36.040 --> 02:31:42.360]   young Cratchits kissed him, and Peter and himself shook hands. 'Spirit of tiny Tim,
[02:31:42.360 --> 02:31:49.720]   thy childish essence was from God.' 'Spectre,' said Scrooge, 'something informs me that our
[02:31:49.720 --> 02:31:54.360]   parting moment is at hand. I know it, but I know not how. Tell me what man that was
[02:31:54.360 --> 02:31:59.600]   whom we saw lying dead.' The ghost of Christmas yet to come conveyed him as before, though
[02:31:59.600 --> 02:32:04.640]   at a different time, he thought. Indeed, there seemed no order in these latter visions, save
[02:32:04.640 --> 02:32:09.600]   that they were in the future, into the resorts of businessmen, but showed him not himself.
[02:32:09.600 --> 02:32:13.760]   Indeed, the spirit did not stay for anything, but went straight on as to the end just now
[02:32:13.760 --> 02:32:19.080]   desired until besought by Scrooge to tarry for a moment. 'This court,' said Scrooge,
[02:32:19.080 --> 02:32:23.240]   'through which we hurry now is where my place of occupation is, and has been for a length
[02:32:23.240 --> 02:32:29.080]   of time. I see the house. Let me behold what I shall be in days to come.' The spirit stopped.
[02:32:29.080 --> 02:32:33.400]   The hand was pointed elsewhere. 'The house is yonder,' Scrooge exclaimed. 'Why do you
[02:32:33.400 --> 02:32:38.600]   point away?' The inexorable finger underwent no change. Scrooge hastened to the window
[02:32:38.600 --> 02:32:43.000]   of his office and looked in. It was an office still, but not his. The furniture was not
[02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:47.520]   the same, and the figure in the chair was not himself. The phantom pointed as before.
[02:32:47.520 --> 02:32:51.360]   He joined it once again, and wondering why and whither he had gone, accompanied it until
[02:32:51.360 --> 02:32:56.600]   they reached an iron gate. He paused to look round before entering. A churchyard. Here
[02:32:56.600 --> 02:33:01.920]   then, the wretched man whose name he had now to learn lay underneath the ground. It was
[02:33:01.920 --> 02:33:08.080]   a worthy place, walled in by houses, overrun by grass and weeds, the growth of vegetation's
[02:33:08.080 --> 02:33:15.100]   death, not life, choked up with too much burying, fat with repleted appetite. A worthy place.
[02:33:15.100 --> 02:33:22.240]   The spirit stood among the graves and pointed down to one. He advanced towards it, trembling.
[02:33:22.240 --> 02:33:26.520]   The phantom was exactly as it had been, but he dreaded that he saw new meaning in its
[02:33:26.520 --> 02:33:31.240]   solemn shape. 'Before I draw nearer to that stone to which you point,' said Scrooge,
[02:33:31.240 --> 02:33:36.160]   'answer me one question. Are these the shadows of things that will be, or are they
[02:33:36.160 --> 02:33:43.400]   the shadow of things that may be only?' Still, the ghost pointed downward to the grave
[02:33:43.400 --> 02:33:49.360]   by which it stood. 'Men's courses will foreshadow certain ends to which, if persevered
[02:33:49.360 --> 02:33:54.280]   in, they must lead,' said Scrooge. 'But if the courses be departed from, the ends
[02:33:54.280 --> 02:34:04.300]   will change. Say it is thus with what you show me.' The spirit was immovable as ever.
[02:34:04.300 --> 02:34:11.920]   Scrooge crept towards it, trembling as he went, and following the finger read upon the
[02:34:11.920 --> 02:34:20.480]   stone of the neglected grave his own name, Ebenezer Scrooge.
[02:34:20.480 --> 02:34:27.480]   'Am I that man who lay upon the bed?' he cried upon his knees. The finger pointed
[02:34:27.480 --> 02:34:34.320]   from the grave to him and back again. 'No, spirit, no, no, no!' The finger still
[02:34:34.320 --> 02:34:39.360]   was there. 'Spirit!' he cried, tight clutching at its robe. 'Hear me! I am not
[02:34:39.360 --> 02:34:45.200]   the man I was. I will not be the man I must have been but for this intercourse. Why show
[02:34:45.200 --> 02:34:51.000]   me this if I am past all hope?' For the first time the hand appeared to shake. 'Good
[02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:55.400]   spirit!' he pursued as down upon the ground he fell before it. 'Your nature intercedes
[02:34:55.400 --> 02:35:00.760]   for me and pities me. Assure me that I yet may change these shadows you have shown me
[02:35:00.760 --> 02:35:07.280]   by an altered life.' The kind hand trembled. 'I will honour Christmas in my heart and
[02:35:07.280 --> 02:35:12.840]   try to keep it all the year. I will live in the past, the present, and the future. The
[02:35:12.840 --> 02:35:17.200]   spirits of all three shall strive within me. I will not shut out the lessons that they
[02:35:17.200 --> 02:35:25.160]   teach. Oh, tell me I may sponge away the writing on this stone!' In his agony he caught the
[02:35:25.160 --> 02:35:30.200]   spectral hand. It sought to free itself, but he was strong in his entreaty and detained
[02:35:30.200 --> 02:35:35.920]   it. The spirit, stronger yet, repulsed him. Holding up his hands in a last prayer to have
[02:35:35.920 --> 02:35:43.440]   his fate reversed, he saw an alteration in the phantom's hood and dress. It shrunk,
[02:35:43.440 --> 02:35:53.280]   collapsed, and dwindled down into a bedpost.
[02:35:53.280 --> 02:35:59.280]   Stave 5, the end of it. Yes, and the bedpost was his own. The bed was his own. The room
[02:35:59.280 --> 02:36:04.640]   was his own. Best and happiest of all, the time before him was his own. To make amends
[02:36:04.640 --> 02:36:09.240]   in 'I will live in the past, the present, and the future,' Scrooge repeated as he scrambled
[02:36:09.240 --> 02:36:14.280]   out of bed, 'the spirits of all three shall strive within me. Oh, Jacob Marley, heaven
[02:36:14.280 --> 02:36:19.640]   in the Christmas time be praised for this. I say it on my knees, old Jacob, on my knees!'
[02:36:19.640 --> 02:36:23.440]   He was so fluttered and so glowing with his good intentions that his broken voice would
[02:36:23.440 --> 02:36:27.960]   scarcely answer to his call. He had been sobbing violently in his conflict with the spirit
[02:36:27.960 --> 02:36:32.600]   and his face was wet with tears. 'They are not torn down,' cried Scrooge, folding one
[02:36:32.600 --> 02:36:36.720]   of his bed curtains in his arms. 'They are not torn down, rings and all. They are here.
[02:36:36.720 --> 02:36:41.120]   I am here. The shadow of the things that would have been may be dispelled. They will be.
[02:36:41.120 --> 02:36:45.360]   I know they will.' His hands were busy with his garments all this time, turning them inside
[02:36:45.360 --> 02:36:48.560]   out, putting them on upside down, tearing them, mislaying them, making them parties
[02:36:48.560 --> 02:36:52.400]   to every kind of extravagance. 'I don't know what to do,' cried Scrooge, laughing
[02:36:52.400 --> 02:36:56.400]   and crying in the same breath and making a perfect laucoon of himself with his stockings.
[02:36:56.400 --> 02:37:01.240]   'I am as light as a feather. I am as happy as an angel. I am as merry as a schoolboy.
[02:37:01.240 --> 02:37:06.800]   I am as giddy as a drunken man. A merry Christmas to everybody. A happy new year to all the
[02:37:06.800 --> 02:37:12.160]   world. Hello there! Hello!' He had frisked into the sitting room and was now standing
[02:37:12.160 --> 02:37:16.960]   there, perfectly winded. 'There's the saucepan that the gruel was in,' cried Scrooge, starting
[02:37:16.960 --> 02:37:20.320]   off again and going around the fireplace. 'There's the door by which the ghost of
[02:37:20.320 --> 02:37:24.560]   Jacob Marley entered. There's the corner where the ghost of Christmas presents sat.
[02:37:24.560 --> 02:37:29.240]   There's the window where I saw the wandering spirits. It's all right. It's all true.
[02:37:29.240 --> 02:37:34.480]   It all happened.' Really, for a man who had been out of practice for so many years,
[02:37:34.480 --> 02:37:38.920]   it was a splendid laugh, a most illustrious laugh. The father of a long, long line of
[02:37:38.920 --> 02:37:43.080]   brilliant laughs. 'I don't know what day of the month it is,' said Scrooge. 'I
[02:37:43.080 --> 02:37:46.400]   don't know how long I've been among the spirits. I don't know anything. I'm quite
[02:37:46.400 --> 02:37:52.080]   a baby. Never mind. I don't care. I'd rather be a baby. Hello! Hello there!' He was checked
[02:37:52.080 --> 02:37:56.360]   in his transports by the churches ringing out the lustiest peals he had ever heard.
[02:37:56.360 --> 02:38:05.880]   'Clash! Clang! Hammer! Ding! Dong! Bell! Bell! Dong! Ding! Hammer! Clang! Clash! Glorious!
[02:38:05.880 --> 02:38:10.760]   Glorious!' Running to the window, he opened and put out his head. No fog. No mist. Clear.
[02:38:10.760 --> 02:38:17.000]   Bright. Jovial. Stirring. Cold. Cold. Piping for the blood to dance to. Golden sunlight.
[02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:23.920]   Heavenly sky. Sweet, fresh air. Merry bells! Glorious! Glorious! 'What's today?'
[02:38:23.920 --> 02:38:27.240]   replied Scrooge, calling downward to a boy in Sunday clothes who perhaps had loitered
[02:38:27.240 --> 02:38:31.880]   in to look about him. 'Eh?' returned the boy with all his might of wonder. 'What's
[02:38:31.880 --> 02:38:36.960]   today, my fine young fellow?' said Scrooge. 'Today,' replied the boy. 'Why, Christmas
[02:38:36.960 --> 02:38:42.080]   Day!' 'It's Christmas Day,' said Scrooge to himself. 'I haven't missed it. The spirits
[02:38:42.080 --> 02:38:45.040]   have done it all in one night. They can do anything they like. Of course they can. Of
[02:38:45.040 --> 02:38:49.440]   course they can. Hello, my fine fellow!' 'Hello!' returned the boy. 'Do you know
[02:38:49.440 --> 02:38:53.680]   the poulterers in the next street but one at the corner?' Scrooge inquired. 'I should
[02:38:53.680 --> 02:38:58.480]   hope I did,' replied the lad. 'An intelligent boy,' said Scrooge. 'A remarkable boy.
[02:38:58.480 --> 02:39:01.680]   Do you know whether they've sold the prized turkey that was hanging up there? Not the
[02:39:01.680 --> 02:39:05.840]   little prized turkey, the big one!' 'What? The one as big as me?' returned the boy.
[02:39:05.840 --> 02:39:09.880]   'What a delightful boy,' said Scrooge. 'It's a pleasure to talk to him.' 'Yes,
[02:39:09.880 --> 02:39:14.520]   my buck!' 'It's hanging there now,' replied the boy. 'Is it?' said Scrooge. 'Go
[02:39:14.520 --> 02:39:21.480]   and buy it!' 'Walker!' exclaimed the boy. 'No, no!' said Scrooge. 'I'm in earnest.
[02:39:21.480 --> 02:39:24.680]   Go and buy it and tell him to bring it here, that I may give him the direction where to
[02:39:24.680 --> 02:39:28.440]   take it. Come back with the man and I'll give you a shilling. Come back with him in
[02:39:28.440 --> 02:39:32.600]   less than five minutes and I'll give you half a crown.' The boy was off like a shot.
[02:39:32.600 --> 02:39:35.920]   He must have had a steady hand at a trigger who could have got a shot off half so fast.
[02:39:35.920 --> 02:39:40.280]   'I'll send it to Bob Cratchit,' whispered Scrooge, rubbing his hands and splitting with
[02:39:40.280 --> 02:39:45.160]   a laugh. 'He shan't know who sends it. It's twice the size of Tiny Tim. Joe Miller
[02:39:45.160 --> 02:39:48.920]   never made such a joke as sending it to Bob's will be.' The hand in which he wrote the
[02:39:48.920 --> 02:39:52.800]   address was not a steady one, but righted he did, somehow, and went downstairs to open
[02:39:52.800 --> 02:39:56.420]   the street door, ready for the coming of the polterer's man. As he stood there awaiting
[02:39:56.420 --> 02:40:00.080]   his arrival, the knocker caught his eye. 'I shall love it as long as I live,' cried
[02:40:00.080 --> 02:40:04.820]   Scrooge, patting it with his hand. 'I scarcely ever looked at it before. What an honest expression
[02:40:04.820 --> 02:40:10.520]   it has in its face. It's a wonderful knocker. Here's the turkey. Hello! How are you? Merry
[02:40:10.520 --> 02:40:15.680]   Christmas!' It was a turkey. He never could have stood upon its legs, that bird. He would
[02:40:15.680 --> 02:40:20.000]   have snapped them short off in a minute like sticks of sealing wax. 'Why, it's impossible
[02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:24.120]   to carry that to Camden Town,' said Scrooge. 'You must have a cab.' The chuckle with which
[02:40:24.120 --> 02:40:26.960]   he said this, and the chuckle with which he paid for the turkey, and the chuckle with
[02:40:26.960 --> 02:40:30.480]   which he paid for the cab, and the chuckle with which he recompensed the boy, were only
[02:40:30.480 --> 02:40:33.760]   to be exceeded by the chuckle with which he sat down breathless in his chair again and
[02:40:33.760 --> 02:40:38.320]   chuckled till he cried. Shaving was not an easy task, for his hand continued to shake
[02:40:38.320 --> 02:40:42.360]   very much, and shaving requires attention, even when you don't dance while you are at
[02:40:42.360 --> 02:40:45.600]   it. But if he had cut the end of his nose off, he would have put a piece of sticking
[02:40:45.600 --> 02:40:49.880]   plaster over it and been quite satisfied. He dressed himself all in his best and at
[02:40:49.880 --> 02:40:53.720]   last got out into the streets. The people were by this time pouring forth as he had
[02:40:53.720 --> 02:40:57.840]   seen them with the ghost of Christmas present, and walking with his hands behind him. Scrooge
[02:40:57.840 --> 02:41:03.040]   regarded everyone with a delighted smile. He looked so irresistibly pleasant. In a word
[02:41:03.040 --> 02:41:07.100]   that three or four good-humored fellows said, 'Good morning, sir. Merry Christmas to you!'
[02:41:07.100 --> 02:41:10.720]   And Scrooge said often afterwards that of all the blithe sounds he had ever heard, those
[02:41:10.720 --> 02:41:14.920]   were the blithest in his ears. He had not gone far when coming on towards him he beheld
[02:41:14.920 --> 02:41:18.880]   the portly gentleman who had walked into his counting house the day before and said, 'Scrooge
[02:41:18.880 --> 02:41:22.720]   and Marley's, I believe?' It sent a pang across his heart to think how this old gentleman
[02:41:22.720 --> 02:41:26.160]   would look upon him when they met, but he knew what path lay straight before him, and
[02:41:26.160 --> 02:41:29.880]   he took it. 'My dear sir,' said Scrooge, quickening his pace and taking the old gentleman
[02:41:29.880 --> 02:41:34.240]   by both his hands, 'how do you do? I hope you succeeded yesterday. It was very kind
[02:41:34.240 --> 02:41:39.440]   of you. A Merry Christmas to you, sir.' 'Mr. Scrooge?' 'Yes,' said Scrooge, 'that
[02:41:39.440 --> 02:41:44.220]   is my name, and I fear it may not be pleasant to you. Allow me to ask your pardon, and will
[02:41:44.220 --> 02:41:48.560]   you have the goodness?' Here Scrooge whispered in his ear. 'Lord bless me!' cried the
[02:41:48.560 --> 02:41:52.760]   gentleman, as if his breath were taken away. 'My dear Mr. Scrooge, are you serious?'
[02:41:52.760 --> 02:41:56.680]   'If you please,' said Scrooge, 'not a farthing less. A great many back-payments
[02:41:56.680 --> 02:41:59.680]   are included in it, I assure you. Will you do me that favor?'
[02:41:59.680 --> 02:42:03.240]   'My dear sir,' said the other, shaking hands with him, 'I don't know what to
[02:42:03.240 --> 02:42:04.240]   say to such munificent—'
[02:42:04.240 --> 02:42:09.180]   'Don't say anything, please,' retorted Scrooge. 'Come and see me. Will you come
[02:42:09.180 --> 02:42:10.180]   and see me?'
[02:42:10.180 --> 02:42:13.480]   'I will,' cried the old gentleman, and it was clear he meant to do it.
[02:42:13.480 --> 02:42:17.400]   'Thank ye,' said Scrooge, 'I am much obliged to you. I thank you fifty times.
[02:42:17.400 --> 02:42:18.400]   Bless you!'
[02:42:18.400 --> 02:42:22.220]   He went to church, and walked about the streets, and watched the people hurrying to and fro,
[02:42:22.220 --> 02:42:25.600]   and patted children on the head, and questioned beggars, and looked down into the kitchens
[02:42:25.600 --> 02:42:30.360]   of houses and up to the windows, and found that everything could yield him pleasure.
[02:42:30.360 --> 02:42:35.460]   He had never dreamed that any walk, that anything, could give him so much happiness.
[02:42:35.460 --> 02:42:39.880]   In the afternoon he turned his steps towards his nephew's house. He passed the door a
[02:42:39.880 --> 02:42:44.640]   dozen times before he had the courage to go up and knock, but he made a dash and did it.
[02:42:44.640 --> 02:42:47.560]   'Is your master at home, my dear?' said Scrooge to the girl.
[02:42:47.560 --> 02:42:49.560]   'Nice girl, very. Yes, sir.'
[02:42:49.560 --> 02:42:51.440]   'Where is he, my love?' said Scrooge.
[02:42:51.440 --> 02:42:55.040]   'He's in the dining-room, sir, along with mistress. I'll show you upstairs, if you
[02:42:55.040 --> 02:42:56.040]   please.'
[02:42:56.040 --> 02:42:58.440]   'Thank ye, he knows me,' said Scrooge, with his hand already on the dining-room
[02:42:58.440 --> 02:43:00.160]   lock. 'I'll go in here, my dear.'
[02:43:00.160 --> 02:43:03.960]   He turned it gently and sidled his face in round the door. They were looking at the table,
[02:43:03.960 --> 02:43:07.360]   which was spread out in great array, for these young housekeepers are always nervous on such
[02:43:07.360 --> 02:43:09.600]   points and like to see that everything is right.
[02:43:09.600 --> 02:43:11.160]   'Fred!' said Scrooge.
[02:43:11.160 --> 02:43:15.040]   Dear heart alive, how his niece by marriage started! Scrooge had forgotten for the moment
[02:43:15.040 --> 02:43:18.280]   about her sitting in the corner with a footstool, or he wouldn't have done it on any account.
[02:43:18.280 --> 02:43:21.160]   'I bless my soul!' cried Fred. 'Who's that?'
[02:43:21.160 --> 02:43:25.520]   'It's I, your Uncle Scrooge. I have come to dinner. Will you let me in, Fred?'
[02:43:25.520 --> 02:43:29.920]   Let him in? It is a mercy he didn't shake his arm off. He was at home in five minutes,
[02:43:29.920 --> 02:43:34.160]   nothing could be heartier. His niece looked just the same, so did Topper when he came,
[02:43:34.160 --> 02:43:39.520]   so did the plump sister when she came, so did everyone when they came. Wonderful party,
[02:43:39.520 --> 02:43:44.320]   wonderful games, wonderful unanimity, wonderful happiness.
[02:43:44.320 --> 02:43:48.260]   But he was early at the office next morning. He was early there. If he could only be there
[02:43:48.260 --> 02:43:52.660]   first and catch Bob Cratchit coming late, that was the thing he had set his heart upon.
[02:43:52.660 --> 02:43:57.920]   And he did it, yes he did. The clock struck nine. No, Bob. A quarter passed. No, Bob.
[02:43:57.920 --> 02:44:03.220]   He was full eighteen minutes and a half behind his time. Scrooge sat with his door wide open
[02:44:03.220 --> 02:44:07.560]   that he might see him come into the tank. His hat was off before he opened the door,
[02:44:07.560 --> 02:44:11.200]   his comforter too. He was on his stool in the jiffy, driving away with his pen as if
[02:44:11.200 --> 02:44:15.640]   he were trying to overtake nine o'clock. 'Hello,' growled Scrooge in his accustomed voice as
[02:44:15.640 --> 02:44:19.000]   near as he could feign it. 'What do you mean by coming here at this time of day?'
[02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:22.240]   'I'm very sorry, sir,' said Bob. 'I am behind my time.'
[02:44:22.240 --> 02:44:27.480]   'You are?' repeated Scrooge. 'Yes, I think you are. Step this way, sir, if you
[02:44:27.480 --> 02:44:28.480]   please.'
[02:44:28.480 --> 02:44:31.880]   'It's only once a year, sir,' pleaded Bob, appearing from the tank. 'It shall
[02:44:31.880 --> 02:44:34.680]   not be repeated. I was making rather merry yesterday, sir.'
[02:44:34.680 --> 02:44:39.040]   'Now, I'll tell you what, my friend,' said Scrooge. 'I am not going to stand
[02:44:39.040 --> 02:44:43.480]   this sort of thing any longer, and therefore,' he continued, leaping from his stool and giving
[02:44:43.480 --> 02:44:47.240]   Bob such a dig in the waistcoat that he staggered back into the tank again, 'and therefore
[02:44:47.240 --> 02:44:49.640]   I am about to raise your salary.'
[02:44:49.640 --> 02:44:53.400]   Bob trembled and got a little nearer to the ruler. He had a momentary idea of knocking
[02:44:53.400 --> 02:44:57.280]   Scrooge down with it, holding him and calling to the people in the court for help in a straight
[02:44:57.280 --> 02:44:58.280]   waistcoat.
[02:44:58.280 --> 02:45:01.640]   'A merry Christmas, Bob,' said Scrooge with an earnestness that could not be mistaken
[02:45:01.640 --> 02:45:05.320]   as he clapped him on the back. 'A merrier Christmas, Bob, my good fellow, than I have
[02:45:05.320 --> 02:45:09.720]   given you for many a year. I'll raise your salary and endeavour to assist your struggling
[02:45:09.720 --> 02:45:15.200]   family, and we will discuss your affairs this very afternoon over a Christmas bowl of smoking,
[02:45:15.200 --> 02:45:19.560]   Bishop Bob. Make up the fires and buy another coal scuttle before you dot another I, Bob
[02:45:19.560 --> 02:45:21.080]   Cratchit.'
[02:45:21.080 --> 02:45:26.000]   Scrooge was better than his word. He did it all and infinitely more, and to Tiny Tim,
[02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:31.940]   who did not die, he was a second father. He became as good a friend, as good a master,
[02:45:31.940 --> 02:45:36.400]   and as good a man as the good old city knew, or any other good old city, town, or borough
[02:45:36.400 --> 02:45:40.800]   in the good old world. Some people laughed to see the alteration in him, but he let them
[02:45:40.800 --> 02:45:44.800]   laugh and little heeded them, for he was wise enough to know that nothing ever happened
[02:45:44.800 --> 02:45:48.360]   on this globe for good, at which some people did not have their fill of laughter in the
[02:45:48.360 --> 02:45:52.840]   outset, and knowing that such as these would be blind anyway, he thought it quite as well
[02:45:52.840 --> 02:45:56.880]   that they should wrinkle up their eyes and grins, as have the malady and less attractive
[02:45:56.880 --> 02:46:01.920]   forms. His own heart laughed and that was quite enough for him. He had no further intercourse
[02:46:01.920 --> 02:46:07.560]   with spirits, but lived upon the total abstinence principle ever afterwards, and it was always
[02:46:07.560 --> 02:46:14.640]   said of him that he knew how to keep Christmas well, if any man alive possessed the knowledge.
[02:46:14.640 --> 02:46:24.440]   May that be truly said of us, and all of us. And so, as Tiny Tim observed, God bless us
[02:46:24.440 --> 02:46:25.960]   all.
[02:46:25.960 --> 02:46:35.960]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
