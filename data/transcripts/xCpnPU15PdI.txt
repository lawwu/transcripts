[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600]   People look at storytelling as once upon a time, I was here.
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.080]   And that's not what storytelling is.
[00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.600]   That's wordsmith.
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.320]   That is wordplay.
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.160]   Storytelling is, here's the situation.
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.160]   Here's what's happening.
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.600]   Here's what's going to happen next.
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.400]   Here's why.
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.120]   Scripts are storytelling because they fill themselves
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.600]   with words, and they flow to the points.
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.720]   The points are the elements of a story that
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.680]   lead you to the next piece.
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.000]   How many people are listening that have a favorite movie?
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.120]   And they watch it, and they know what happens,
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.720]   and they still like it.
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.600]   It's not because it's so cleverly written
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.520]   that you're just like magic with words.
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.800]   You follow the story beat by beat by beat.
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.640]   And that's what makes it interesting,
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.200]   and that's what makes it fun.
