[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Happy Friday everyone.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Well, do we need church traditions?
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   And what are church traditions?
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   Questions we must answer, and they come in today from a listener named Jerome,
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   who lives in Singapore.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   "Hello Pastor John, what specifically does Paul mean by traditions in 2 Thessalonians 2.15?
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   Does Paul have in mind the apostolic traditions, or broader historic church traditions,
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   or some other type of tradition?"
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   Pastor John, what would you say to Jerome?
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   Well, this is good.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   One of the reasons that I'm glad this question is being asked is because it gives us a chance
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   to step back and, I think, address an issue that we haven't really addressed,
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   at least in a focused way, namely, what is tradition,
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   or how should we think about traditions as Christians?
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   And a good place to start is, yes, in 2 Thessalonians 2.15, and in Paul and the apostles,
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   but also in Jesus.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   So, we'll get there.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   Let me just start with the word itself.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   Get a definition clear in front of us.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Tradition.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   It's got two halves.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   Tra, across, or along.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   And dition, the Latin word for "give."
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   The two halves together, then, would mean to give across, or to give along,
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   from one generation to the next.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Now, that's relevant, not just for English, because in 2 Thessalonians 2.15,
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   the text that Jerome is asking about, Paul uses a Greek word, of course, for tradition,
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   which also has two parts, paradosis, paradosis.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Para, also, like the Latin, tra, meaning "across" or "along," and dosis, meaning "give."
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   So, the same meaning in the Greek word as in the English word.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   So, we're really tracking here with Paul when we ask the question,
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   "What does 'tradition,' what does 'paradosis' actually mean, and why does he use the word?"
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   In fact, I would say that's a great place to start with probing into the New Testament understanding of traditions.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Namely, in 2 Thessalonians 2.15, why did Paul use that word here?
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   He says, "Stand firm and hold to the traditions that you were taught by us."
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Why didn't he say, "Stand firm and hold fast to the teachings," or to the truth,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   or to the commands that you were taught by us?
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Why did he use the word "traditions"?
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   The answer seems to be that Paul wants to call attention to the fact that his teaching is in harmony
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   with the teaching that has gone before, namely, from Jesus and from the other apostles.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   The effect of the word "traditions" here is to make us realize Paul does not want to be seen as a maverick apostle,
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   a rogue apostle, a cult leader off on his own, establishing a new religion.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Rather, he wants to be seen as a faithful part of a larger body of teachers with roots firmly in the ultimate authority of Jesus and his word.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   So, the first signal that we get from this text is that there is great value in tradition
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   in the sense that it protects us from novelties that come out of individuals' own heads
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   with no necessary correspondence to what Jude called, in Jude 1, verse 3,
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   "the faith once for all delivered to the saints."
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   In other words, tradition first and foremost declares that there is such a thing as truth.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   There is such a thing that our statements ought to correspond to or agree with.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Tradition requires us to be humble and to admit that we are not the originators of truth.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Wisdom and right views of reality do not begin with us.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   We are servants of a reality outside ourselves.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   It originates in God. It becomes incarnate in Jesus.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   It is inspired in the mouth of the apostles.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   If anybody comes along, even an apostle, Paul says in Galatians 1.8,
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   "Even an apostle declares another truth beside the one that coheres with Christ in his word,
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   and his apostles let him be accursed."
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Now, that's the fundamental reason, I think, why Paul uses the word "traditions" in 2 Thessalonians 2.15.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   Namely, there is such a thing as truth, and it doesn't originate with me.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   I am its servant, not its creator, not its Lord.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   To believe in tradition, in this sense then, is a mark of humility and faithfulness to the way reality really is.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   Now, let me give maybe just one example of what Paul calls tradition, namely his preaching of the gospel.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   So, in 1 Corinthians 15.1-3, he says, "Now I would remind you, brothers, of the gospel I preached to you,
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   for I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received,
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures," and then he finishes it.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Now, those two words are the way Paul talked about tradition.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   "I received something, I delivered it, I handed it on to you."
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   In other words, when it comes to the gospel, no apostle is called to be creative.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   He's called to be faithful.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   The gospel is not a reality that he is making up.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   It is a reality outside himself. It has objective reality.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   His job is to preserve it, to preach it, to pass it along to another generation.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   This is the great preciousness and the great necessity of tradition.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   Now, that may remind some of our listeners, including Jerome, of a text that sounds almost like a contradiction,
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   namely Galatians 1, 11 and 12, where Paul says this,
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   "I would have you know, brothers, that the gospel that was preached by me is not man's gospel,
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   for I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it,
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ."
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   Now, that sounds almost like the opposite of 1 Corinthians 15,
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   but it's not a contradiction.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   What was at stake in Galatians 1 and 2 was the validity of Paul's apostleship.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   Was he, in fact, commissioned by the risen Christ,
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   and was he a direct recipient of divine revelation,
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   or was he a pretender to that authority,
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   and just like any other Christian teacher, totally dependent on human tradition?
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   Like me, I'm dependent on tradition, namely the New Testament, a divinely inspired tradition.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   And Paul's answer is, "I'm not dependent on Peter and James and John,
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   but I am in harmony with them on the gospel."
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   Now, both of those are crucial, Paul's non-dependence and Paul's harmony with them.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   "I went to visit Peter," yes, he says, "not because I had no revelation from Jesus,
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   but to make clear to Peter and to everybody that Peter and I are on the same page.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   We preach the same gospel.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   There is one apostolic word, and we're in harmony on it."
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   And let me make one other crucial observation about tradition,
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   namely that just as there is good tradition that reflects reality and preserves truth,
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   there's bad tradition that distorts reality and preserves mere human opinion
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   as though it were an authority, an opinion which often nullifies the very true tradition,
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   the Word of God.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   And we know that because Jesus said in Matthew 15, 3 to the Pharisees,
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   "Why do you break the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?"
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   And then he gives them the example of what he's talking about,
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   and he says, "Many such things you do."
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   And Paul himself, before his conversion, was totally committed
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   to those very Word of God nullifying traditions.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   He said in Galatians 1, 14, "I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   So extremely zealous was I for the traditions of my fathers."
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   And with that zeal for tradition, he was imprisoning and killing Christians.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   So clearly, tradition in and of itself can be very destructive.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   Here's one more example of false tradition.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   Paul says in Colossians 2, 8, "See to it that no one takes you captive by philosophy
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   and empty deceit according to human tradition and not according to Christ."
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   So all tradition is to be measured by whether it accords with Christ.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   So the sum of the matter is that we measure merely human tradition
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   by the tradition, which we call the New Testament,
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   that is rooted in Jesus and his Word and his apostles and their teachings.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   So the answer to Jerome's question then is that 2 Thessalonians 2, 15
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   is Paul's referring to the truth that Jesus and the apostles had taught
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   and that he himself, under divine inspiration, was confirming by his own letter.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   Yeah, very good. Thank you, Pastor John. Thank you, Jerome.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   Thanks for listening today, all of you.

[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   Well, today we talked about traditions, and next time we're going to look at shame,
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   the topic of shame. Should we have shame? Should we not have shame?
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   How do we talk about shame in the church?
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   Is there a healthy, necessary form of shame in the Christian life?
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   Those are questions that must get answered, and they will get answered next time
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   when I ask Pastor John. I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   We'll see you back here on Monday for that. Have a great weekend.
