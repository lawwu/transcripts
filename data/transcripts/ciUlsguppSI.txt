[00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:11.720]   Our next question comes from Steven. Steven says, "I'm very interested in the
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:18.260]   deep life, but sometimes sitting down to do it is tough while wildfires, social
[00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.800]   and political turmoil, and a deadly virus are ever-present and overwhelming. Is it
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.520]   wrong to shut off the outside world when the outside world needs so much help?" So
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.160]   Steven, I think it's a good question. I think when you when you're using the
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.280]   phrase "deep life," you actually mean something more specific. I think you're
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.080]   talking about, in general, doing one thing at a time, having a small number of
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.520]   things you really focus on, and getting lost in those activities, versus an
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.400]   approach to life where you're more constantly plugged into the hive mind of
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.240]   what's going on, what's the latest news, what's happening in the world. You
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.400]   see someone like me who maybe doesn't use social media and just reads an
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.200]   old-fashioned newspaper, and you think, "Okay, you're not fully up to speed
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:05.120]   with what's going on, and this somehow seems worrisome," or it just seems very
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.280]   difficult to do because all this stuff going on out there in the world really
[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.640]   pulls at your attention. It's a very timely question. There's a lot going on
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.800]   in the world right now that can be constantly pulling at your attention. The
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.920]   media, of course, does us no favors. It is in their interest to pull our attention
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.800]   as much as possible, and so they will push everything. I'm using "they." It doesn't
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.520]   matter who we're talking about here. They will push everything in a way that's
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:38.280]   alarm bells going. It is constant emergency alarm all the day. Omicron is
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.400]   going to set a forest fire that's going to steal your identity before pushing
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.800]   your democracy into an authoritarian dictatorship. It all is just going
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.880]   together, and it's all just terrible. Here's the reality, Stephen.
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.480]   You cannot function if you're bathing in that. I mean, I have serious, empathetic
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.360]   concerns for professional journalists right now that have to be marinated in
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.520]   that world because it's their job. I think we should be thinking about
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.600]   post-traumatic stress-style benefits for these journalists right now because the
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.760]   drumbeat, the negativity, and the alarmism, and everything that's out there, it
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.080]   overloads the brain. Our brain can't handle that much, and so you do have to
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.520]   be, I think, quite careful in how you let this into your
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.000]   life. If you are constantly consuming information, especially coming from the
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   internet, especially information that has gone through the attention-centric
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   filters of tools like social media, you will fry your brain. If you are, God
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.560]   forbid, receiving coronavirus news through Twitter all day long, you are
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.040]   going to be digging out a bunker, and you're never going to leave it. If you
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:56.760]   are, God forbid, looking at conversations on social media to be your barometer of
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.520]   what the political discussion is like in this country, you are going to be, again,
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.680]   digging that bunker even deeper because civilization is about to end. It's going
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.440]   to fry your brain. You've got to be way more careful about this. You have to be way more
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.400]   selective about it. So what I would argue is that as part of going through your
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.720]   process of trying to intentionally cultivate a deep life, part of that
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.640]   should be figuring out, "How do I want to consume information about the world? Let's
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:30.440]   get specific about it, and let's do it with intention." You can put this, if you
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.120]   want, if you're using my bucket system where you figure out the buckets that
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.480]   are important to your life and then go over each of them, this could go in
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.400]   various places. The community bucket, I think, makes sense because you want to
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.720]   know what's going on in the community writ large to be a citizen of the world.
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.680]   Be incredibly specific and careful about how this information
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.200]   comes in. I'm very, very careful about it. So I look at the paper, newspaper, every
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.200]   day, so it's not like I'm going to miss a very important world-changing event. I
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:02.160]   can see it. But on almost everything else, I have to be very careful to titrate the
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.240]   information that comes into my world. Like if it comes to coronavirus, for
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.120]   example, you know, as listeners know, I spent about a year or so doing a daily
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.960]   newsletter for my family and friends where I filtered through a lot of
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.080]   information and tried to give them a less alarmist, more fact-based
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.440]   presentation of what's going on. After the vaccines came out, I stopped that
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.200]   newsletter because, honestly, I thought it was more healthy for the people I know
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:32.040]   now that they weren't facing immediate potential grave harm to focus on living
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.300]   other parts of their life. But in doing that, I became really closely acquainted
[00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.680]   with the various sources of news, what doctors really got it, what experts were
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.360]   non-alarmist but very accurate, really knew what they were talking about. I've
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.560]   interviewed some of these or some articles I've written as well. And so now
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.320]   for coronavirus news, for example, there's a small number of people that a couple
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.600]   times a week I check in to get their take. And you know what that's done to my
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:02.000]   stress level? Dropped it all the way down, right? I know probably more about this
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.480]   still than most people I know because it's kind of ironic if you just bathe in
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.000]   Twitter, you're all over the place and other types of things come in and affect
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.520]   you and political biases or where you happen to live or your anxiety, natural
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.680]   anxiety levels, and you end up in random places and how you think about what's
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.160]   going on. But I'm very specific. A couple days a week, a couple experts, good, I know
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:26.160]   what's going on, I'm out. You can do this about almost any area of domestic or
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.080]   international news, and Stephen, that's what I'm going to recommend for you. Make
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.240]   this part of your plan to live a deep life is to be incredibly intentional
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.080]   about how you bring in information. You can know what's going on in the world
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:43.360]   without having to marinate in a frenetic stew of anxiety. And it's not only
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.920]   possible, I think it is critical because we can't keep living this way. It's not
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:53.560]   good for you. It's not going to make you a better citizen. There is never going to
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:58.120]   be a case, Stephen, where you know a tweet will come through that says if Stephen
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.640]   can get this tweet in the next 15 minutes, this forest fire can get put out.
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.560]   And you missed it and you screwed that whole part of Australia that burned.
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:10.640]   Never going to happen. You'll be fine. The news on Tuesday will be fine even if
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.960]   you missed it on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. Hearing from one non-alarmist
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:20.640]   expert, here's my take on what's going on, will bring you as up to speed as if you
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:25.800]   followed 50 Twitter feeds five times a day, right? So cut back, be
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:30.960]   intentional. I think that is the only way to live deeply in a world of so much
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.160]   anxiety-producing information.
