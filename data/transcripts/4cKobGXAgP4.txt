[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.640]   All right. Well, speaking of books, Jesse, this is the first episode that will air in
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.440]   April, right? We're recording it. I mean, in May. Yeah. Yeah. We're recording it in
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.200]   April, but it'll be the first one that we, uh, release in May. And what's our tradition
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.120]   is the first episode that we either record or release in each month. I, I discussed the
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:24.480]   five books I read in the month before, and though it's only the 28th, I have, as is my
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.200]   habit long since finished my five books for April. So I figure we can, we can talk about
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:38.960]   them now in our standard, what I read segment. All right. So in April of 2022, the first
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.840]   book I read, and we talked about this on the show was the seven story mountain by Thomas
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:50.200]   Merton. So you remember, this is the story. It came out in 1948. It was a memoir of Thomas
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:56.600]   Merton who had grown up with his artist father, traveling throughout Europe, ended up in the
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:04.040]   States, ended up at Columbia, was sort of a intellectual writer, started teaching English
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.160]   literature classes and dropped everything and became a Trappist monk at the Garden of
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.360]   Gethsemane Trappist monastery in Kentucky. And the Trappists, if you don't know, are
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:21.340]   pretty, pretty, um, far on the aesthetic, no, ascetic end. You know, we're going to,
[00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.140]   we're not out there in the community also having jobs and we're not Jesuits that are
[00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.720]   also astronomers. It's like, no, we're chopping wood and waking up four times in the middle
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.520]   of the night to say prayers. So it was about that transition. It's very influential. It's
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.800]   very influential because it, it, it came out during this post-war doldrums period where
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:47.640]   people were adrift and moving to suburbs and getting boring jobs. And so this book of reinvention
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:54.240]   and focusing on depth and values in a radical way. And this is a clear example of my notion
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.360]   of the deep life in action really struck a chord. So I figured I needed to read it because
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.280]   so much more that's recent is informed by it, whether the author's note or not. Uh,
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.680]   we talked about it before because I tried to read it on Kindle and I was like, nah,
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.120]   this book can't be read on Kindle. Uh, I need a hardcover. But instead of just like a normal
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.040]   person buying a hardcover, I went back and bought a first edition, first printing from
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.760]   1948 of the book. I think it really mattered. I think it really helped. I think it really
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.480]   changed my experience of reading the book. Um, and it's a long one. It's 400 something
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.120]   pages and in the original hardcover, which are wide pages. And they didn't mess around
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.760]   with this sort of business book you buy in the airport in the 2000 and twenties, you
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.920]   know, double spaced lines and giant fonts. They didn't mess around with that back in
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.240]   the forties, you know, people had time. So the lines are, the lines are small. So it
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.880]   took me a while to read. Um, but I'm really glad I did. I'm really glad I did. I know
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.880]   more about Catholic practice now than I ever have before. So I, I recommend it. It is the,
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.000]   it's a foundational book that so many more self-transformation books, all of the big
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.240]   self-transformation books that fall in the 20th centuries were informed by seven story
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:08.100]   mountain and he's a good writer. All right. So speaking about writing, I then went on
[00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:15.000]   to read Anne Lamott's bird by bird. I had never read that. No, I had read the other
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.120]   famous writing instruction books. So bird by bird, if you don't know, is Anne Lamott's
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:27.120]   book about writing. It's a book about writing now, because as you might expect, I've internalized
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.960]   a patriarchy. I had read Stephen King's book on writing on writing, probably because
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:38.200]   of the, the male gendered gaze was more comfortable for me than the, the, the female gaze or what
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.360]   have you. But for whatever reason, I had never read bird by bird, but it is right up there
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.240]   with Stephen King's on writing as one of the two most famous nonfiction books about
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:56.040]   writing from the last, whatever, three or four decades. I like Anne Lamott. I mean,
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.120]   I like her writing. I like her as a person, just her, excuse me, like just her approach
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:08.320]   to life. She lives and she's had an interesting, difficult life. And she, I always go deep
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:15.320]   stalker mode on, on the houses of writers. And so she bought this cool piece of land
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.960]   in Northern California that was kind of run down and they slowly converted it over time
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:26.640]   into this like Oasis. I love that type of stuff. The book is good. It's focused on fiction
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.160]   writing and I'll say the main thing I came away with other than Anne Lamott is a great
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:42.400]   writer. And the main thing I came away with is fiction writing, I think attracts more
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:50.320]   aspiring writers than nonfiction because on paper becoming a success seems easier. And
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:56.240]   what I mean by that is when you read bird by bird or you read Stephen King's book and
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.900]   you read about novel writing, the only real activity you do is sit down at a computer
[00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:06.040]   and write. And so it's all about that, like just sitting down there and writing and overcoming
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:12.040]   the psychological fears. So in theory, if you've never written anything before, you
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.920]   have all of the tools and things you need to potentially write a great novel. You just
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:22.320]   have to sit down there and write. Where nonfiction, excuse me, seems more scary, right? It's
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.600]   like I got to get a book deal first. You don't write nonfiction before you get the book.
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:32.300]   I got to go actually talk to people. I got to do interviews. So it seems harder. But
[00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.020]   the reality is when you read something like bird by bird, it's like, oh my God, fiction
[00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:40.300]   is so much harder. Like, yeah, yeah, you can just get going, but man, it's just you and
[00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.740]   the screen and you have to just craft out of nowhere these characters and narratives
[00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:50.220]   that reveal the human experience and do so with perfect craft because any deviation from
[00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:54.660]   perfect craft is going to ring out. Where in nonfiction, I don't know, you just have
[00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:59.940]   to be competent. I have something to read about. I did research on it. If I just do
[00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.700]   the work to do the research and I know how to write in a way that's not going to annoy
[00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:08.900]   people like you can be in the game. So I think this is the allure of National Novel Writing
[00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.180]   Month and fiction writing and bird by bird is like, maybe if I just sit there at the
[00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:19.300]   keyboard of mice and men is going to come out. But I think it's way harder. So I'm
[00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:24.380]   glad I'm not a fiction writer. That just seems like it's impossible. It's like trying to
[00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:29.040]   be a screenwriter. Everyone's like, I bet I could do that because I know movies. I movie
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:33.980]   seems straightforward and it's impossible. It's impossible to actually like, right, because
[00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:37.860]   everyone can do it, but to do it well, it's like near impossible. So it's a good book.
[00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:41.720]   Makes me glad I'm a nonfiction writer and to all you aspiring writers out there. Nonfiction
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:46.540]   is actually way, it's way easier in my opinion to like be a working writer than in fiction.
[00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:52.500]   All right. Then I went on and read some fiction because April had some good weather and good
[00:06:52.500 --> 00:07:02.340]   weather. I like to have fun books to read. So I went and read the Carl Sagan novel contact,
[00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:07.420]   which actually I really enjoyed. So it was a premise of the book was it focused on someone
[00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:13.460]   at SETI, S-E-T-I, search for extraterrestrial intelligence. And Carl Sagan works through
[00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:19.660]   what would happen if we actually did get a signal from an alien civilization. And the
[00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:25.540]   parts I like the best actually is he works through the science of how that would work.
[00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:34.160]   You know, like, okay, it would be a signal on this frequency that corresponds to the
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:42.100]   emission frequency of hydrogen. And there would be pulses corresponding to the prime
[00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:47.260]   numbers because that'd be really universal. And then they're using various modulation
[00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:52.900]   screens to encode information into those, into those symbols. And so anyways, I thought
[00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:55.740]   that was real interesting. So I really loved the part where he got in whenever he would
[00:07:55.740 --> 00:08:00.380]   get into the science of like how alien communication would work and, and how we would track it
[00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:03.940]   down. I love those parts, but there was pretty good characters as well. I mean, it was a
[00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:10.700]   good book and I love when scientists write books and they're good. The only nerd comment
[00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:14.740]   I need to make, my apologies to the Sagan estate, actually no apologies, it's not his
[00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:21.820]   fault. It just is a demonstration of how things have changed. So the book takes place like
[00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:26.540]   in 99. And so he gets wrong, he gets right a lot of things. He didn't get the internet
[00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:31.260]   right. So they had instead these like portable fax machines they would carry around that
[00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.180]   like would send messages, they would like send and receive messages through portable
[00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:39.060]   fax machines. Like he wasn't quite there on the internet, but, but you know, it was pretty
[00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:48.540]   close. But the, the, the small nerd detail that I noticed is the aliens used for one
[00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:56.380]   of the layers of encoding in their signal phase modulation. And in, in the book Sagan's
[00:08:56.380 --> 00:09:00.100]   like, Oh, we don't phase modulation is something that theoretically you could do, but it's
[00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:05.820]   not something that we use really in like human devices. Like we know about it, but it's just
[00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:13.100]   not something we're used to. Based on my understanding, phase modulation is actually now heavily used
[00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:18.540]   in wireless data protocols, like in particular in 802.11 protocols for access points, like
[00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:23.260]   phase modulations at the core of it. So that was a prediction that was gotten wrong in
[00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:28.780]   the age of wifi phase modulation as well used. So what I'm doing here, Jesse is I'm giving
[00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:34.740]   the people the information they really care about. You know, you cut past the superfluous
[00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:40.500]   and you focus in on what is it that the crowds really care about. And I look, if there's
[00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:47.860]   one thing I will say about deep questions, listeners, they are RF modulation, RF modulation
[00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:52.060]   fans. Yeah. You got us primed up for your comments about Jurassic Park a couple months
[00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:57.540]   ago. Yeah. Yeah. That's right. Yeah. Forget, forget any mistake I said about Jurassic Park,
[00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:06.020]   the overlooking the importance of phase modulation. I mean, let me get going about QAM constellation
[00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:11.100]   encoding. This all came from, by the way, so again, no one cares about this. I'm mainly
[00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:15.800]   a theoretician, but I do theory. I used to do theory about problems that were motivated
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:21.220]   by wireless networks. So for my postdoc, for my two years as a postdoc at MIT, I'd left
[00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:27.420]   the theory group and I went up to the network and mobile systems group and learned a lot
[00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:33.780]   about how wireless network technology actually works. So there you go. It finally paid off
[00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:39.700]   in allowing me to do an awesome, cool critique of Carl Sagan. I don't want to say that makes
[00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:46.300]   this book a garbage book, but you know, you're going to get modulation wrong. I mean, I don't
[00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:50.540]   know guys, I don't know what we're doing here. All right. Then I went on and read a book
[00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:55.660]   I found in a little free library at the field where my oldest son was playing little league
[00:10:55.660 --> 00:11:05.580]   called blue latitudes. So this is Tony Horwitz. I'm a big Tony Horwitz booster. He died a
[00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:10.060]   few years ago, like at the age of 60, just tragic, just like heart attack, just boom
[00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:15.900]   streets of DC, you know, fickle finger of fate, which was really tragic. Fascinating
[00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:21.420]   guy. Talk about a writing power couple, by the way. So he married Geraldine Brooks, the
[00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:32.060]   novelist. When he married her, he had a Pulitzer. From his war correspondent reporting, and
[00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:37.620]   then not long after they got married, she got a Pulitzer for one of her novels. I don't
[00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:43.660]   know if it was March or The Crossing. So it's a it's a dual Pulitzer couple, a nonfiction
[00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:49.300]   writer and a novelist. But anyways, I mean, the book is probably his most famous book
[00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:53.060]   is Confederates in the Attic, which is a fantastic book, the first Horwitz book I wrote. But
[00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:57.580]   he does these. These are like nonfiction travelogue type books and blue latitudes. He was tracing
[00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:01.740]   Captain Cook's journeys through the Pacific of the 18th century. And so he's going all
[00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:06.340]   over like remote Pacific islands and all the way up to the Aleutian Islands in Alaska.
[00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:10.780]   And he's really good at this travel writing because he's a Pulitzer Prize winning war
[00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:18.180]   correspondent. So he knows how to go to these remote, interesting places and insert himself
[00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:23.860]   into interesting situations and find interesting people. He's he's he's twitchy and high energy
[00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:28.780]   and is just constantly trying to find places to go and people to meet. And and he's a good.
[00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:33.700]   So it's it's interesting. He does interesting things. And so in this book, he's doing interesting
[00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:38.500]   things. He's on these islands you've never heard of meeting these characters who he who
[00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:44.340]   capture so interestingly, like the the life on these islands and the impact of colonialism,
[00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:50.580]   etc. written beautifully and just interleaving with the story of Captain Cook. Great book,
[00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:56.660]   but long. It's another 450 pager. So it took me a while. It took me a while. So I had to
[00:12:56.660 --> 00:13:02.700]   450 pagers this month. So I was surprised by how long that took. The final book I read.
[00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:12.740]   It's a bit of an odd one. This is a deep pole. Uncle Petros and gold blocks conjecture. As
[00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:19.700]   a long process by which I came to this book. It is a novel written by a mathematician,
[00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:25.860]   a Greek mathematician named Apostolos Doxias. So between this and Sagan, as you can see,
[00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:32.060]   I'm on a kick of scientists writing books about their field. And the book is about it's
[00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:38.180]   like a young boy and his uncle and his uncle was like this super math prodigy who became
[00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:44.940]   obsessed with trying to solve gold box conjecture. Which was at the time one of the three big
[00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:49.300]   famous number theory conjectures that hadn't been solved. So the Riemann hypothesis, Fermat's
[00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:57.140]   last theorem and the gold block conjecture. Fermat's has since been proven by Andrew Wiles.
[00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:02.540]   Was the Riemann solved? Can you look that up, Jesse? The Riemann hypothesis. I have
[00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:11.540]   this vague memory of this R-E-I-M-A-N-N. I have this vague memory of this, this eccentric
[00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:17.780]   mathematician George or Goreg or something solved it and didn't even show up. But I might
[00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:21.180]   be thinking about something different. So you have to fact check me on that. Anyways,
[00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:26.460]   Wikipedia says many consider it to be the most important unsolved problem in pure mathematics
[00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:47.260]   in the first paragraph. So what did he, oh, look up, I think he solved Poincare's conjecture.
[00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:54.140]   Maybe that's what he solved. The guy I'm thinking about. So Jesse's going to fact
[00:14:54.140 --> 00:15:01.660]   check that. Yeah. Maybe that's what it was. Originally conjectured by Henry Poincare in
[00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:06.540]   1904, the theorem conserves spaces that locally look like ordinary three-dimensional space.
[00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:12.700]   Yeah. Was it solved? Attempts to resolve the conjecture drove much progress in the field
[00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:17.500]   of geometric topology during the 20th century. So a guy whose name started with G who solved
[00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:23.380]   it? I'll keep on looking. Yeah. Anyways, the point be there was something famous solved
[00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:27.500]   and the guy was this weird eccentric, I think it was Russian. And he didn't even show up
[00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:30.980]   for, I think he got to give him like a Fields Medal or something. He didn't even show up.
[00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:37.180]   But anyways, this book was sort of about a character like this. So it's a math prodigy
[00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:41.420]   who became obsessed with solving this conjecture. And basically his life fell apart because
[00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:49.700]   of that. And it is from the perspective of his son who kind of uncovers this. And so
[00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:55.460]   it's cool. It's a short book. I wouldn't say there's a lot of sophisticated plot in it.
[00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:58.580]   There's like long periods of just exposition of like, let me just tell you, let me just
[00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:01.780]   summarize my uncle's story. And it kind of just tells the story, but it's really cool
[00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:07.620]   because he puts in a lot of famous figures from logic and number theory and analysis.
[00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:17.460]   So Turing plays a role. Kurt Gödel shows up in the book. He's hanging out with Rajanaman
[00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:22.780]   Hardy at Cambridge. And so it's cool. It's like all these mathematical cameos, not much
[00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:27.980]   really happens, but I love to see specialists in their fields, write fiction about their
[00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:33.300]   fields because I want to do that one day. So maybe that's why I was reading Sagan and
[00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:34.300]   Uncle Petros.
[00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:37.140]   You should have used your French accent.
[00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:46.620]   Yeah. The proper pronunciation is Henry Honkai is how, if you're going to be sophisticated.
[00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:51.860]   You're saying, you're like, that's good. I remember when the guy from Russia saw the
[00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:58.860]   hungry, hungry conjecture. Yeah, that was, that was good. So do we figure out, is that
[00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:00.420]   the thing you solved?
[00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:06.260]   I was reading through the Wikipedia. Wikipedia is unbelievable. Yeah. This one guy tried
[00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:10.340]   to solve in the thirties, but then it was retracted. Bunch of other guys tried in the
[00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:11.340]   fifties and sixties.
[00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:15.740]   Well, I'm sure there's some nerd listening. He's a bigger nerd to me. He will write in
[00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:16.740]   and please do.
[00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:21.420]   An exposition of attempts to prove this conjecture can be found in the book.
[00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:22.420]   Because I'm thinking about.
[00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:26.220]   Care's Prize by George Fizo Spiro.
[00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:30.900]   Because this is what I'm, all right, someone has to write in. There's someone who solved
[00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:35.060]   something hard in the last 10 years, maybe the last 15 years. And his name was George
[00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:39.180]   and he's Russian and he's eccentric. It's not the Ryman hypothesis. It's not, it doesn't
[00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:45.500]   sound like it's the Poncari conjecture. So, all right, someone has to write in and set
[00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:46.500]   us straight.
[00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:52.300]   I got a quick question. So before you would say that you read two chapters a day before
[00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:58.700]   you bumped up to five books a month, right? So what do you think you read? Like four chapters
[00:17:58.700 --> 00:17:59.900]   a day now?
[00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:06.860]   It's uneven. Yeah. So, I mean, part of what happens is you just, when you, you take advantage
[00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:11.820]   of quiet time to like go nuts. Like once you're in the habit of reading, you're looking for
[00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:17.140]   times to kind of go nuts and read. And so some days you don't get that much time in.
[00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:20.700]   You just have your standard times you read. And other days you're like, Ooh, I have, you
[00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:25.980]   know, an half hour. Like the, the kids are with my wife and they're coming home and they
[00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:30.660]   won't be home for a half hour or something. And if it's your default activity, you just,
[00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:34.940]   you lean into it. Like, great. I can really, and once you get into the books and I talked
[00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:41.380]   about this in the podcast last week, that once you're no longer are using your phone
[00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:47.820]   as a default source of distraction. And conversely, you've gotten really into like the books you're
[00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:52.580]   reading and the idea of reading books. Your mind is used to that. You begin to crave it.
[00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:57.580]   It's great. Like, this is what, this is what I want. Like everything slows down. The leisure
[00:18:57.580 --> 00:19:05.940]   is deeper. Your brain gets quiet. Your thoughts get clear. I just really am more and more
[00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:09.980]   of an advocate of this is, this is the medicine people need right now.
[00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:13.980]   Were any of the five audio books? None of those five are audio books. None of
[00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:21.900]   those five are audio books. I'm listening to the, the first book from the expanse series,
[00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:25.300]   sci-fi series. I was listening. I'm listening to that on audio, but it's long. It's a 40
[00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:30.140]   minute book. So I was listening to that off and on throughout. And then I'm also listening
[00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:34.020]   to the Steve Martin's professional memoir, born standing up.
[00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:37.100]   I just finished that actually. Yeah. I mean, I'd read it obviously was influential
[00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:43.940]   in my work, but I read it in 2007 or something. So I don't remember so much. I don't remember.
[00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:49.820]   So I'm enjoying that. I'm almost done with that as well. I'm actually, so I have three
[00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:54.560]   books I'm reading simultaneously right now and I'm pretty close on all three. So like
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:20:01.540]   I'm, once we cross over the May boundary, I'm probably going to be three books in, you
[00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:06.820]   know, by the first week of May. Cause I just kind of, I have a bunch going in parallel
[00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:10.620]   right now. I actually miscounted. So I was on, we were on a little trip to the beach
[00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:14.140]   when I finished the fifth book and I thought it was my fourth. So I had like a lot of other
[00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:18.900]   stuff going. And so then, so then I spread out. It's like, well, let me make progress
[00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:22.780]   in a lot of books so that I can finish them all. So I'm just off schedule now. So like
[00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:25.780]   I'm finishing stuff like halfway through a month and kind of starting the new stuff.
[00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:28.540]   It's just my readings not scheduled with the start of the month basically.
