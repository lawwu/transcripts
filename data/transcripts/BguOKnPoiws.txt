[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.740]   You said you protect the inner landscape, but certainly you're not averse to high-intensity
[00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:08.740]   stimulation.
[00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.780]   Last night, we went to the AEW, and by the way, thank you for taking me.
[00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.420]   That was such an incredible experience.
[00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:14.420]   It was really fun.
[00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:15.420]   It was really fun.
[00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.620]   It reminded me of early punk rock shows, some of my first punk rock shows, where I went
[00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:26.700]   and just was like, "Oh my gosh, this is exciting and scary, and I love it."
[00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:33.260]   And it felt loving, too, which is also the community of punk rock that I observed and
[00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.660]   have been blessed to be a part of.
[00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.940]   It's like, yeah, there's aggression, but there's also love, and then there's romance, and then
[00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.660]   there's also betrayal, and there's all the elements.
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.180]   But there's still a sense of like everyone wants to be here, and there's a sense of goodness
[00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.780]   behind it all, even though some of it was bloody and violent.
[00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:56.460]   So for you, what does wrestling allow you to feel in those high-intensity environments?
[00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:03.100]   It completely relaxes me because there are no stakes.
[00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.620]   Everyone's working together in the show to protect each other.
[00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.540]   No one's trying to hurt anybody, regardless of what the storyline is.
[00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:17.180]   It's like a ballet where there's a fight in the ballet.
[00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.900]   There's no actual aggression of people towards each other.
[00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.020]   It's just the opposite.
[00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:32.260]   But you get to experience this wildly dynamic, exciting, surreal theater piece where people
[00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:42.260]   are doing these gymnastic and acrobatic things that are truly death-defying.
[00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:48.500]   And it's fun, and the storylines absorb you in a way where you never know what's true
[00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.680]   and what's not.
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.820]   We know wrestling's fake.
[00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.900]   We're told wrestling's fake.
[00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:02.220]   But there's something legitimate about it that seems to me more legitimate than anything
[00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:10.580]   else, the most legitimate, because it's the closest to what the world's actually like.
[00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.140]   People don't always tell you what they really think.
[00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.620]   And when someone tells you a story, it might not really be the true story.
[00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:26.180]   They may think they're telling you the real story, and that might not be the real story.
[00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.180]   We don't know.
[00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.400]   We know so little.
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.060]   We experience something, and then we make up a story to understand it ourselves.
[00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.740]   And then forevermore, when we tell that story, it was our version of an experience.
[00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.260]   But we don't know that's what happened.
[00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.780]   That was our take on it.
[00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:54.020]   Wrestling is like-- that's what the real world is like, because when you watch wrestling,
[00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.020]   you never know what's true.
[00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:02.660]   If you watch the news like you watch wrestling, and you never know what's true, it would be
[00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:03.660]   more accurate.
[00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.020]   You'd have a better sense of the world if you took it all in like it was pro wrestling.
[00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.260]   I think we're in a place in human history where people are starting to feel that way
[00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.280]   about the media.
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.500]   It's also why wrestling is so popular.
[00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.580]   It's more popular than it's ever been.
[00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:20.580]   Yeah, that's interesting.
[00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:26.480]   Things like UFC, the kind of gladiator-like octagon fights, and wrestling are increasing
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.660]   in popularity, despite the fact that supposedly we're evolving.
[00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.420]   So I think it reflects something both primitive and evolved about the human brain.
[00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.100]   Primitive in the sense that, yeah, there's some violence.
[00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.580]   It's physical.
[00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.740]   That's down in the hypothalamus, as we'd say.
[00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:50.100]   It scratches that itch, but they're actually protecting each other.
[00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:57.860]   It scratches that itch of seeing the gladiators, but it's like watching a movie.
[00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.500]   They're not really hurting each other.
[00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.860]   They get hurt, but only because the things they're doing are so crazy.
[00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.740]   I think in order to be able to thoroughly enjoy wrestling, one has to be able to give
[00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:12.060]   up narrative distancing just a little bit.
[00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.340]   Narrative distancing is this sense that this is a story, it's a movie, it's not real.
[00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.000]   But there were moments like yesterday, the jump off the top rope onto the guy who's splayed
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.020]   out on the ladder.
[00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:23.020]   The ladder breaks.
[00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.000]   This was right in front of us.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.500]   It couldn't have felt good.
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.780]   He walked away.
[00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:37.480]   He seemed fine-ish, but that and then there was a match between two women where a woman
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:43.520]   put a metal plate into the bottoms of her suit and then ran and then jumped onto the
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.340]   other woman and hit her with the metal plate.
[00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.940]   Then the metal plate slipped out.
[00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.500]   She was walking around and everyone knew she had cheated because you're not supposed to
[00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.500]   use the metal plate.
[00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.980]   It was exciting because she had done it, exciting because she had gotten away with it.
[00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:02.460]   Then at the same time, exciting and upsetting that the referee saw it, but then didn't call
[00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.460]   it.
[00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:10.860]   This is like Twitter X, this is like Instagram, this is like politics, this is real life.
[00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.900]   Seeing people get away with things is so frustrating if you feel they shouldn't have.
[00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.580]   That's all part of it.
[00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:28.860]   It's a very accurate representation of the world.
