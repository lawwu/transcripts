[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.280]   We end the week with episode 1800.
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.440]   Yes, episode 1800.
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.640]   It's an incredible benchmark for us
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.680]   and it's only possible for us because of you.
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.520]   So thank you for a decade of support
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.680]   and for your encouragements and email questions
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.920]   and for your 250 million episode plays
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.280]   and for hundreds of thousands of subscribes over the years.
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.600]   This podcast happens because you invest time with us,
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.320]   precious time we don't take for granted.
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.040]   And that's one reason why we don't have ads or sponsors.
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.300]   And it's one reason why we don't dilly dally around
[00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.560]   with windy introductions.
[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.080]   So moving on to the episode,
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.080]   today's question is a great one, Pastor John.
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.320]   Scripture gives us a constellation of ways
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.800]   to think of the Christian life.
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.920]   And a listener to the podcast named Jason
[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.280]   wants to know how they relate.
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.860]   Here's what he asks.
[00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.040]   Pastor John, hello, can you help me figure something out?
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.280]   Is the key to personal sanctification
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.480]   more about looking to Jesus, as Hebrews 12, two says,
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.480]   or is it more about being united to him
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.680]   who has been raised from the dead?
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.880]   As Romans 7, four puts it, some more on union,
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.400]   or is it mostly about beholding Christ's glory
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.240]   as 2 Corinthians 3, 18 puts it?
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.840]   Or is it more just about obeying
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.640]   and doing the work of faith,
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.120]   as 2 Thessalonians 1, 11 says?
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.260]   I know the answer is likely gonna be yes, all of those,
[00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.520]   but I'm trying to connect them all
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.160]   in a way that is practical to teach and to live.
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.640]   And I find myself jumping from one to the other
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.160]   as though they are multiple things.
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.960]   Surely there are logical connections
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.240]   that make them all one and the same.
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.040]   Pastor John, how would you put this puzzle together
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.260]   for Jason?
[00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.600]   - Wow, I just love this kind of--
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.440]   - It's a great question.
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.880]   - Not only this kind of question,
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.560]   but just this way of thinking.
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.020]   - Yeah.
[00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.120]   - Taking different parts of scripture,
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.840]   they use very different language,
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.760]   and asking, are there deep, common,
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.080]   unified, coherent realities here?
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.880]   That is so helpful to do.
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.880]   So let's see if I can weave these four strands together
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.100]   into some kind of cord that the Lord might use
[00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.100]   to bring us along in our pursuit of sanctification.
[00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.060]   That's what they're designed for.
[00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.640]   And I think the Lord is very pleased
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.280]   when we try to put the different parts of his word together
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.400]   in order to see the common realities behind them,
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.360]   even when different words
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.040]   are used to describe those realities.
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.620]   The realities in these four passages of scripture
[00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.600]   would include, I just made a list of them
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.320]   as I read these passages,
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.440]   God, word of God,
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.180]   Christ, death of Christ,
[00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.880]   glory of Christ,
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.760]   law of God,
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.740]   faith in Christ,
[00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:57.960]   faith in his word,
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.000]   hope, joy,
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.600]   Christian freedom,
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.300]   the Holy Spirit,
[00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.120]   human resolve.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.740]   All of those are realities,
[00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.820]   and they are all at work in these passages,
[00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.400]   and they are not doing contradictory things.
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.960]   There is one great work of God,
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.960]   weaving all these realities together
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.720]   in the process of making us holy,
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.840]   making us sanctified, more Christ-like.
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.840]   Different texts focus on different ones of these realities,
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.920]   but none of them leads us in a direction
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.360]   that would in any way contradict the other passages.
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.760]   We've misunderstood the text.
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.300]   If one text is sending us off in a direction
[00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.960]   that flies in the face of the other passages.
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.680]   So let me take them one at a time
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.480]   and just see if I can draw out
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.280]   some of the common connections.
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.080]   Hebrews 12, one and two.
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.340]   Since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses,
[00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.540]   let us lay aside every weight and sin
[00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.160]   that clings so closely and let us run.
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.420]   Let us run with endurance,
[00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.840]   the race that is set before us.
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:13.680]   And here's how,
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.800]   looking to Jesus,
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.440]   the founder and perfecter of our faith,
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.120]   who for the joy set before him,
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.200]   endured the cross.
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.280]   That's how he did it.
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.360]   Despising the shame and seated at the right hand
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.640]   of the throne of God.
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.040]   So in this text,
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.720]   looking to Jesus is given as the means
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.380]   by which we run our race with endurance.
[00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.520]   That race, of course, includes becoming holy,
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.520]   staying on the narrow racetrack to the end.
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.080]   And when we look to Jesus,
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.040]   we see three things that affect our running.
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.960]   First, he's called the founder and perfecter of our faith,
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.960]   which means he has done the decisive work
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.280]   in dying and rising and sitting down
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.760]   at the right hand of God.
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.760]   Because of Christ, our faith is well-founded
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.620]   and well-finished.
[00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.440]   It's as good as done.
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.640]   In other words, because of Christ,
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.680]   we're going to make it to the finish line.
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.840]   He founded our faith, he'll finish our faith.
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.840]   Second, we look to Christ as inspiring our endurance
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.980]   because of his endurance, enduring the cross.
[00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.720]   He ran his race successfully through suffering.
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:45.160]   This emboldens us to run our race through suffering.
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.180]   And third, when we look to Jesus,
[00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.660]   he shows us how he ran his race.
[00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:54.480]   He says he ran it for the joy that was set before him.
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.480]   Therefore, the key to our endurance
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:02.480]   is to stand on that finished work of Christ
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:07.560]   and be confident that all satisfying joy
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.480]   is just over the horizon.
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:10.360]   He's going to finish it.
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.760]   He's going to bring us great joy in front.
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.120]   That's how we keep going,
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.000]   because that's how he kept going.
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:21.140]   So this confidence in the joy that is set before us
[00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.360]   is called in Hebrews, faith.
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.700]   In the chapter just before,
[00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.740]   faith is the substance of things hoped for,
[00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.620]   the joy hoped for.
[00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.460]   Faith is the foretaste, the substance.
[00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.780]   Right now, you can taste it.
[00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.660]   The foretaste of the joy of the promise of God.
[00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:46.660]   Over and over in Hebrews 11, the saints obey by faith.
[00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:51.780]   It is this faith, this confident hope of a joyful future
[00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:53.580]   is the key to their obedience,
[00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.580]   just like it was the key to Jesus' obedience.
[00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.420]   So that's the picture, and that's the reality
[00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:02.940]   of how we are sanctified in Hebrews 12.
[00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:07.100]   Now here's Romans 7, 4, and 6.
[00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:12.100]   You also died to the law through the body of Christ
[00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:16.060]   so that you may belong to another,
[00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:18.100]   to him who has been raised from the dead
[00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:22.860]   in order that we may bear fruit for God.
[00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:25.700]   We are released from the law,
[00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:29.340]   having died to that which held us captive
[00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:32.260]   so that we may serve in the new way,
[00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.420]   the new way of the Spirit,
[00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:39.520]   not the old way of law-keeping or the written code.
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:45.500]   Now, the new reality that Paul introduces here
[00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:50.340]   that wasn't in Hebrews 12
[00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:53.700]   is the fact that when Christ died,
[00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:58.700]   we died, specifically, we died to the law.
[00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:03.040]   We were released from law-keeping
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:06.300]   as the way of getting right with God,
[00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:09.780]   as the way of ongoing fellowship with God.
[00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:11.860]   Now that's new, that's new, right?
[00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:16.260]   Nothing was said about the law in Hebrews 12, 1 and 2.
[00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:20.000]   So Paul is coming at sanctification
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.020]   with a different problem in view,
[00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:25.300]   not the need for endurance through suffering,
[00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:28.860]   that's the issue in Hebrews, that's not the issue here,
[00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:32.420]   but the need for liberation from law-keeping,
[00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:34.060]   that's the issue here.
[00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:35.160]   How do we relate to God?
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.680]   How do we become holy without law-keeping
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:39.860]   as the foundation for our lives?
[00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:42.300]   Because that we died to.
[00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:45.300]   And the other new reality that Paul introduces
[00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:48.340]   in Romans 7, 4 is the Holy Spirit.
[00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:50.620]   He says that we have died to the law
[00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:54.580]   so that we might serve in the new way of the Spirit,
[00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:57.260]   not the old way of law-keeping.
[00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:58.820]   And that wasn't in Hebrews.
[00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:03.500]   And I would say that this new way of the Spirit
[00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:08.020]   is precisely the way of Hebrews 12,
[00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:10.180]   describing the Christian life,
[00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:13.380]   namely the life of faith in the promises of God
[00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:18.380]   to fulfill us, to fill us with hope for future joy.
[00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:22.940]   That's the new way of the Spirit in Romans 7.
[00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:25.820]   That's the alternative to law-keeping
[00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:29.180]   as a way of walking with God.
[00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:31.860]   So they are complementary texts
[00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:35.900]   coming at sanctification from two very different angles.
[00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:37.820]   Thirdly, Jason introduces,
[00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:42.380]   or he brings up 2 Corinthians 3, 18.
[00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:47.100]   In this text, Paul combines the reality of the Holy Spirit
[00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.060]   mentioned in Romans 7
[00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:53.300]   and the reality of looking to Jesus mentioned in Hebrews 12.
[00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:58.300]   And he adds the realities of glory and freedom,
[00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:01.900]   neither of which had been mentioned explicitly
[00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:04.860]   in those other two texts, but are mentioned here.
[00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:09.540]   So he says, "Now, the Lord is the Spirit,
[00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:13.780]   and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.
[00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:16.180]   And we all, with unveiled face,
[00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:19.220]   beholding the glory of the Lord,
[00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:24.140]   are being transformed into the same image
[00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:26.060]   from one degree of glory to another,
[00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:29.820]   for this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit."
[00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:34.940]   What this text adds to the new way of the Spirit
[00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:38.500]   described in Hebrews 12 and Romans 7
[00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:43.340]   is that looking to Jesus in Hebrews 12
[00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:47.860]   means not only seeing him as enduring the cross,
[00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:52.740]   but seeing him as glorious in all that he's done.
[00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:56.180]   The focus is on how beautiful and glorious
[00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:58.580]   and magnificent he is,
[00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:03.580]   and finding that glory so riveting, so satisfying,
[00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:07.420]   that it has the effect of transforming us.
[00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:12.420]   We tend to take on the traits of those we most admire.
[00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:17.420]   This is freedom because it happens by the Spirit
[00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:19.660]   as a natural process.
[00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:23.540]   This is what Paul called bearing fruit for God in Romans 7.
[00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:30.340]   Faith and hope and joy are not mentioned
[00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:33.060]   in 2 Corinthians 3,
[00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:37.660]   but I would say that they are implied in the phrase
[00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:41.500]   beholding the glory of the Lord.
[00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:46.500]   I think that transforming beholding is the sight of faith.
[00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:51.020]   That's the way faith sees Christ.
[00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:54.740]   Faith beholds the beauty of Christ.
[00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:59.740]   Faith finds joy in him when it looks at him
[00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:03.060]   and all that God promises to be for us in him.
[00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:08.060]   And beholding him that way, faith transforms.
[00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:11.180]   And that's sanctification.
[00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:16.020]   And one more, Jason refers us to 2 Thessalonians 1, 11,
[00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:21.020]   where Paul says, "May God fulfill every resolve for good
[00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:27.100]   and every work of faith by his power."
[00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:32.100]   So in the process of sanctification, we do make resolves.
[00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:33.500]   Yes, we do.
[00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:38.500]   We intend things, we will things, we exercise our will.
[00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:42.100]   But Paul says that all of these volitional actions
[00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:46.700]   are "works of faith by God's power."
[00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:49.780]   In other words, we are back in the realm
[00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:52.100]   of God's empowering Spirit.
[00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:56.940]   We work by trusting God's promise
[00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:59.780]   that he is at work in us.
[00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:03.500]   So Jason, good question.
[00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:08.500]   I think if you bore into the actual reality
[00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:12.780]   of these four descriptions of sanctification,
[00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:17.780]   you will find they are deeply unified
[00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:21.380]   and mutually illuminating.
[00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:24.380]   It's a thrilling thing to meditate
[00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:26.980]   on the realities of scripture
[00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:30.780]   until we see how beautifully they cohere.
[00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:32.420]   - Thanks for assembling that constellation
[00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:33.660]   of texts for us, Pastor John.
[00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:37.460]   And thank you for joining us today on episode number 1800.
[00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:39.180]   It's amazing, we're so grateful for each of you.
[00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:41.700]   It's taken us a decade to build this archive
[00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:43.100]   and you can search all of it,
[00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:48.100]   all 1800 episodes at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:51.820]   Well, for the next two weeks,
[00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:53.820]   we're gonna look at hard Bible questions
[00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:55.540]   related to eschatology,
[00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:57.300]   questions you have asked us
[00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:59.740]   on the first two chapters of 2 Thessalonians.
[00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:02.220]   Namely, there's three of those questions.
[00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:06.940]   Is God present or is he absent in his eternal judgment?
[00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:09.500]   That's a question from 2 Thessalonians 1.9,
[00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:11.620]   which seems to say that he's absent.
[00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:13.060]   That's on Monday.
[00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:15.900]   Then many of you have asked about the man of lawlessness
[00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:17.420]   in 2 Thessalonians chapter two.
[00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:18.820]   Who is that?
[00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:20.020]   That's next Friday.
[00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:20.860]   We're gonna address that.
[00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:23.660]   And then a question about God sending strong delusions
[00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:24.680]   into the world.
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:25.860]   Does he do that today?
[00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:27.560]   If so, how so?
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:30.620]   That's a question on 2 Thessalonians 2, verse 11.
[00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:33.600]   And that will be on the table in two Fridays from now.
[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:37.700]   Some hard but very important texts that we need to address.
[00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:38.540]   I'm your host Tony Renke.
[00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:40.700]   We'll see you back here on Monday.
[00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:43.280]   (upbeat music)
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:45.860]   (upbeat music)
[00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:55.860]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
