[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.160]   In Romans 8 30 the Apostle Paul gives us what has been called the golden chain of redemption.
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.800]   God predestines us.
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.440]   He predestines us in order to call us.
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.280]   He calls us in order to justify us.
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.880]   He justifies us in order to glorify us.
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.920]   It's an amazing chain of grace.
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.760]   But if we stop here, we behold some amazing works of God in our lives, but we miss the
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.120]   35 carat diamond that hanks from this golden chain.
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.280]   So what's the gospel for?
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.280]   This is so important.
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.240]   Today's sermon clip explains and it was sent to us from Brian in Peachtree City, Georgia.
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.280]   It's from a sermon preached back in 2012.
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.280]   Here's Pastor John.
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.240]   Psalm 16 11 in your presence there is fullness of joy.
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.240]   God at your right hand are pleasures forevermore.
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.880]   Whom have I in heaven but you?
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.560]   And on earth there's nothing that I desire besides you.
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:06.160]   My flesh, my heart may fail, but you are the strength of my heart and my portion forever.
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.480]   That's where the gospel is going for the enjoyment of that.
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.040]   Nothing less and nothing beyond.
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.600]   The third snapshot first Corinthians 15.
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.920]   I invite you to turn there in your Bibles.
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.160]   This may be the clearest definition of the gospel in all the Bible.
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.880]   It's often gone to by those who want to define the gospel in brief terms because Paul does
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.000]   it.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:39.360]   I see six elements, five of them explicit in the text, one of them implicit.
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.480]   So let me read it and then point out these six elements to the gospel.
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:51.800]   Now I would remind you brothers of the gospel which I preached to you, which you received
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.080]   and in which you stand and by which you are being saved.
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.480]   So note, did I go too fast by that word gospel?
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.720]   Brothers I remind you the gospel.
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.440]   So he's about to define the gospel.
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.120]   The gospel I preached to you, which you received and which you stand and by which you are being
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.120]   saved.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.120]   Yes you are.
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.120]   It's the power of God unto salvation.
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.840]   If you hold fast to the word preached to you unless you believed in vain for I delivered
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.840]   to you, here it comes, as of first importance what I also received that Christ died for
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.720]   our sins in accordance with the scriptures.
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:35.400]   That he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the scriptures.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.760]   Here are six elements I see in that text of the gospel.
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.840]   If any one of these six is missing we have no gospel.
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.120]   Okay, here we go.
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.420]   Number one, the gospel is a divine plan.
[00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.680]   Look at verse three, end of the verse.
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:57.040]   Christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures, which were written hundreds
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:03.160]   of years before Christ died, which means God had a plan.
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.520]   And if he didn't, we have no gospel.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.800]   It just was a fluke of history, but it's all written down in the Old Testament hundreds
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.240]   of years before it happened.
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.240]   And Paul says that's essential.
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.920]   Number two, the gospel is not only a plan of God.
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.240]   It is a historical event.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.120]   Christ died, Christ rose again.
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.720]   If that did not happen historically so you can see it with your physical eyes, we have
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:28.720]   no gospel.
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:37.160]   There's a lot of modern people who try to demythologize this and just turn it into ideas.
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.000]   It's not an idea.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.240]   He ate fish after the resurrection.
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:52.440]   Number three, the gospel is a divine achievement through that event of suffering and resurrection.
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.720]   And by achievement, I mean things like he died for our sins.
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.160]   Verse three, again at the end, Christ died for our sins.
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.440]   There's a design in it.
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.880]   There's an accomplishment in it.
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.280]   Something is achieved in this death.
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.800]   It's not a random death.
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.840]   God has a design.
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.640]   He's accomplishing something through the historical event like covering our sins, Colossians
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:15.640]   2.14.
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.480]   Removing God's wrath, Romans 8.3.
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.800]   Purchasing eternal life, John 3.16.
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:28.840]   These are objective achievements of the objective event which are true whether you come into
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.280]   existence 2,000 years later or not.
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.880]   This is what I mean by salvation being extra gnosis.
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:35.880]   It's out there.
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.120]   God did it in history.
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.120]   It's there.
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.120]   It's done.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.400]   And then I get born 2,000 years later.
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.920]   And so that has to come in here somewhere.
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:54.440]   Number four, the gospel is a free offer of Christ for faith.
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.800]   Now it works.
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:01.080]   The gospel is a free offer to all for faith.
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.560]   Christ is offered to you for faith alone.
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.800]   Where do I see that?
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:05.960]   Verses one and two.
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:12.040]   The gospel I preach to you which you received in which you stand, by which you are being
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:17.280]   saved if you hold fast to the word I preach to you unless you believe.
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.120]   So you got those two words, received and believe, just like in 1 John 1.12.
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.520]   To as many as received him who believed on his name, that's what it is to receive the
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.520]   gospel.
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.520]   You can't work for this.
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.840]   It is based on Christ alone.
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.520]   It is external, outside of you, achieved and accomplished 2,000 years ago.
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.760]   Now you're born.
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:38.760]   You hear that news.
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:39.760]   What do you do?
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.760]   I'm going to start working for God so I can impress him how morally worthy I am.
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:44.760]   You're not.
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.480]   And you never get there that way.
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.480]   You receive it.
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.480]   You believe it.
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:55.240]   You embrace Jesus as your treasure and your Lord and your Savior from all that you need
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.280]   saving from.
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.400]   And you are then saved forever.
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.840]   It's an awesome gospel.
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:09.240]   That's number four, a free offer of Christ for faith.
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:16.720]   And number five, the gospel is an application of the achievements accomplished in history
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.640]   to your heart individually when you believe.
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:25.200]   So forgiveness of sins purchased once, applied now.
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.080]   All your sins forgiven when you believe.
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.000]   Justification.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.080]   You weren't justified when Jesus died.
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.640]   You're justified when you believe, when it becomes yours.
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:39.440]   Then the purchase of the justification and the performance of the righteousness 2,000
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.440]   years ago is applied.
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.040]   That's why I'm using the word application.
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.920]   It's applied to you or eternal life.
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.280]   You didn't have eternal life when Jesus died.
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.000]   You have eternal life when you believe.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.160]   And then what he bought out there, what he wrought out there becomes yours through the
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.560]   connection with Jesus through faith.
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:06.120]   So the gospel is the application to believers of all that he purchased and achieved 2,000
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.120]   years ago.
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:12.440]   And now finally, number six, the gospel is the enjoyment of fellowship with God himself.
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:13.840]   Now if you say, "Where do you see that?"
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:19.880]   Well, I see it outside this text, but where I see it inside this text is in the word gospel.
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.800]   Gospel means good news, right?
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.400]   So you have to ask what's good about the good news.
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:36.080]   And if you stop after sins are forgiven and vindicated in the court and can go free and
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:43.960]   life forever, if you stop there, you haven't even mentioned God.
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.780]   That's serious.
[00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:49.800]   You know why you're forgiven?
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:52.800]   So that your guilt won't get in the way of enjoying God.
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.180]   You know why you're vindicated in the court of heaven?
[00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:57.920]   So that your condemnation won't get in the way of enjoying God.
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.760]   You know why you have new life and a promised new body someday?
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:05.160]   So that you have capacities within to finally enjoy God the way he ought to be enjoyed.
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.160]   It's all a means to number six.
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:14.560]   And if you want to know where I see it explicitly in the Bible, the clearest text would be 1
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.560]   Peter 3.18.
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.560]   I'll read it to you.
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:24.520]   Christ suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us
[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.480]   to God.
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:33.760]   So I would say Romans 5.11 and 1 Peter 3.18 are the clearest statements in the New Testament
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:40.520]   concerning God being the prize of the price of the gospel.
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.600]   And that's a great clip from Brian in Peachtree City, Georgia.
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:49.040]   This was taken from John Piper's 2012 sermon titled God in Christ, the price and the prize
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.800]   of the gospel.
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:55.240]   Brian says in his email this quote, when I first heard Pastor John say, if you stop there,
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.760]   you haven't even mentioned God.
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.720]   It hit me like a ton of bricks.
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:04.040]   Right then God in his grace changed my entire gospel paradigm.
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:08.000]   I had never heard the idea of God being the highest good of the good news.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.080]   And I certainly never rejoiced in that truth.
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.600]   I had always thought the highest good of the gospel was the forgiveness of my sins, the
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:17.600]   escape from hell and a nebulous gift called heaven.
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:24.160]   I was only aware of a salvation from something, not a salvation to someone.
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.680]   For so many years, Jesus was a means to an end.
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:31.280]   But in that sermon, Pastor John, you helped me see that Jesus is both the means and the
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:35.400]   end, the all glorious, all satisfying end.
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:38.160]   And I cannot thank you enough.
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:39.160]   Amen.
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.880]   Thank you, Brian.
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:43.680]   That's what we'd love to get in the inbox.
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.520]   Keep the life change clips coming.
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:49.640]   Send us the clips and then tell us what impacted the clip have on your life.
[00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:55.400]   Well, Friday, we return to hear from a med student preparing for a life in oncology to
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:56.720]   serve the dying.
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.680]   She wants to maximize her labors for eternal purposes.
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.200]   Pastor John is back in the studio to address that on Friday.
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.200]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.160]   We'll see you then.
