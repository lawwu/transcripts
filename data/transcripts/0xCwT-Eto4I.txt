[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.900]   One of the mysteries about depression is that it's not that tractable to pharmacological
[00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:12.900]   therapy.
[00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.180]   So if you look at people who suffer with depression, about a third of people see significant benefit
[00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:26.860]   from modern SSRI and related antidepressant drugs.
[00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:32.900]   About a third see very tiny benefit and about a third see no benefit at all.
[00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.860]   And part of the reason is because maybe our term depression is too big a bucket.
[00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.220]   Depression is actually many different biological disorders and only a subset of those are helped
[00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.700]   by SSRIs and will need different therapies for the other ones.
[00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.560]   That's certainly part of it.
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.020]   But part of it might actually have to do with inflammation.
[00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:59.460]   So if you think that inflammation is a risk factor in depression, well, you could do something
[00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.140]   very simple, right?
[00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.140]   You could gobble an ibuprofen, right?
[00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.980]   There's a whole bunch of anti-inflammatory drugs that are very well understood.
[00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.340]   And so, well, what if you just say, all right, you know, let's have a study where we have
[00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.580]   a bunch of depressed people and we have them all eat anti-inflammatory drugs for a few
[00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.060]   weeks and we see if this relieves their depression.
[00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.140]   And the answer seems to be no, it doesn't.
[00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:32.220]   Well, and that's a little bit hard to understand because there are definitely links between
[00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.620]   inflammation and depression.
[00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:40.940]   So for example, one of the early treatments for hepatitis C that's since been superseded
[00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.980]   by more modern drugs was a pro-inflammatory cytokine molecule.
[00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.620]   And when you gave it to people to treat their hepatitis C, almost everyone became depressed
[00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:52.620]   on this drug.
[00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.860]   So you say, oh, well, this really seems like a link.
[00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.340]   Likewise, there are certain neurological diseases like multiple sclerosis.
[00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:10.220]   It turns out the incidence of depression as a comorbidity in multiple sclerosis is enormous.
[00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.780]   And you might think, well, there's a trivial reason for that.
[00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.420]   If you're paralyzed from MS, you're bummed out about life.
[00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.420]   And that's the reason.
[00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.620]   But if you look at people who have spinal cord injuries from accidents, they actually
[00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.060]   have major depression at a rate from people who are uninjured.
[00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.140]   So that doesn't seem to be it.
[00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.860]   It's not just that you're bummed out from being paralyzed, although of course it's reasonable
[00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.840]   to be bummed out about being paralyzed.
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.060]   But that's not it.
[00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.940]   So what happens in MS?
[00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.960]   Well, there's a bunch of cytokines, including one called interleukin-6, IL-6.
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:46.840]   That's elevated massively if you take a spinal tap and you look at cerebral spinal fluid.
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.800]   And so that could be causative for depression.
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.440]   So all these real reasons to think that inflammation is involved.
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.440]   But yet the idea is still a little messy.
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.240]   So now what if instead of looking at the general population of depressed people, you look at
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:07.660]   the subset of people that don't respond to SSRI antidepressants?
[00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.260]   Are they helped by anti-inflammatories?
[00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.000]   And there's a bit of a hint that maybe they are.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   It's not definitive yet.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.800]   There are a couple of studies.
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.440]   It's right on the edge.
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:28.840]   But I think this is a really good example of how we are going to see progress very soon
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:39.080]   in the body-to-mind part of mind-body medicine that is going to be of enormous benefit to
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.760]   people.
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:41.840]   So interesting.
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.680]   Could I get your thoughts on one candidate hypothesis that I've been thinking about?
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.320]   I've covered depression on a few episodes.
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:56.240]   And I've had Robin Carter-Harris from UCSF and Dr. Matthew Johnson from your very own
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.600]   Johns Hopkins University, both of whom run laboratories studying psychedelics for the
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.880]   treatment of depression.
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.920]   The clinical trials on psilocybin.
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.160]   And to be clear, psilocybin is still illegal.
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.120]   It's been decriminalized a few places.
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.680]   But we're not talking about recreational use.
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:20.800]   We're talking about several therapy sessions without psilocybin, then 2.5 gram approximately
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:25.120]   dosages of psilocybin given separately, again, with therapists present, and then follow-up
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.640]   therapy sessions seem to lead to relief of depression in approximately somewhere between
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:37.320]   65% and 80% of people, in some cases total remission, in some cases some relief without
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.320]   remission.
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.320]   OK.
[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.160]   So we can set that result on the shelf.
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.360]   It's been repeated a number of different times.
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.800]   Compare that to the results of SSRIs, which seem to help a third of people, a third minimally,
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.720]   and a third not at all.
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.680]   And of course, there's the side effect profiles of the SSRIs and associated drugs, not just
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.680]   the SSRIs, but buprenorphine and the other antidepressants that are taken in prescription
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.800]   drug form.
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.780]   And then there's this inflammation piece.
[00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:11.320]   So could we hypothesize that relief from depression has something to do with neuroplasticity,
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:19.800]   rewiring of neural circuits, and that psilocybin, we know, can encourage neuroplasticity, and
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:27.320]   that perhaps SSRIs can encourage neuroplasticity in some people, not all, and that inflammation
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.780]   is a barrier to neuroplasticity?
[00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.640]   To me, this is the only thing that can reconcile the current status of the results.
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.640]   And then there's ketamine-based therapies, and so we have to also kind of set that on
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:39.640]   the shelf.
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:43.280]   But let's set that aside on the shelf for now to keep it simple.
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:48.440]   It seems to me that based on the time course over which SSRIs work, the fact that they
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:53.360]   increase serotonin very quickly, but the relief from depression comes much later, the fact
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.920]   that neuromodulators like serotonin are intimately involved in neuroplasticity, they can in some
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.880]   cases gate neuroplasticity, that it all centers back to changing neural circuits.
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.040]   And so what we're really trying to do, whether or not it's transcranial magnetic stimulation,
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:11.000]   or now we can throw ketamine in there, or psilocybin, or SSRIs, that treating depression
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.120]   is about rewiring the brain.
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:18.760]   It's not about chemical A or B per se, although serotonin seems involved.
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:25.860]   To me, what I'd love to see are more studies about the interaction between neuroplasticity
[00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.460]   and inflammation.
[00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.880]   And are we seeing that kind of work out there?
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:35.480]   And because these results sort of sit as disparate, somewhat conflicting, but it seems like inflammation
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.280]   is anti-neuroplasticity, and broadly speaking here.
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:43.520]   I realize there are many interleukins, there are many, some of which are inflammatory,
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:48.160]   some of which are anti-inflammatory, but is that a meaningful hypothesis?
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:55.240]   Do you think there's any hope whatsoever to actually cure depression if we sort of start
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:59.760]   to unify the results in these different camps?
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.680]   Yeah, I think it's a completely reasonable hypothesis, and I would be broader.
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:09.720]   And I would say, honestly, the relief of any neuropsychiatric condition ultimately is from
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.400]   neuroplasticity in some form or another.
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:19.240]   And I think it's worthwhile to step back a bit and talk about what neuroplasticity means.
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:27.000]   To date, there has been a focus on synapses, on the contacts between neurons as the site
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.360]   of neuroplasticity, and that's warranted.
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:36.800]   Neurons are plastic, they change as a result of experience, as a result of hormone changes,
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:41.000]   as a result of exercise, as a result of lots of things.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.400]   But synapses are not the be-all and end-all of neural function.
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:54.240]   So, for example, neurons work by sending electrical signals along their lengths and between neurons
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:57.280]   and interconverting those with chemical signals.
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:03.660]   And the processes of generating those electrical signals, the ion channels that are involved,
[00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:08.040]   that are embedded in membranes, that are involved in that, are also plastic.
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:11.480]   They can also change as a result of experience.
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:17.080]   That's what we call intrinsic plasticity as opposed to synaptic plasticity.
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.960]   In addition, there are literal morphological changes.
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:27.120]   So when we talk about the wiring of the brain, sometimes we're talking about literal wiring,
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:31.720]   like cell A wasn't connected to cell B and now it is, and that changes.
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:36.120]   And then sometimes, well, actually cell A was connected to cell B, but cell B wasn't
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:41.160]   responsive enough, and now there's a change in cell B, so now cell A can fire cell B.
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:45.320]   And that could have been a result of a change in its synapse, making it more receptive to
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:49.600]   neurotransmitter release from cell A, or it could be something intrinsic in cell A that
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:54.680]   makes it fire its electrical signal, its spike, more easily.
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:09:07.000]   I think that one of the key cell types that's going to be important for your hypothesis
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.840]   linking inflammation to synaptic plasticity is going to be a cell called a microglial
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:14.840]   cell.
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:19.200]   And microglial cells are non-neuronal cells in the brain that are motile.
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:25.640]   They can crawl around, they have long processes, and they can gobble things up.
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:32.800]   They can literally sort of chew away and digest bits of the extracellular scaffolding that
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:37.880]   surrounds neurons and synapses and thereby renders them plastic.
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:44.240]   They can destroy synapses, and there is a lot of indication that certain disease states
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:52.600]   may involve over-exuberant microglia pruning synapses to a degree that they shouldn't.
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:10:01.720]   And we know that microglia are chock full of cytokine receptors, and so are responsive
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.560]   to inflammatory signals.
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:09.080]   When we're talking about inflammation and we're talking about drugs, it's worthwhile
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:15.080]   to mention that there are a lot of behavioral things that also can influence the signaling.
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:21.080]   So we know, and I know you've discussed on your program, the incredibly salubrious effects
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:24.280]   of physical exercise on mental function.
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:32.520]   So exercise is about as good an antidepressant as SSRIs are, and the side effects are only
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:37.560]   good side effects as opposed to the bad side effects of SSRIs.
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:41.240]   And again, this isn't working through some airy, fairy realm.
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:46.760]   The reason that exercise works to relieve depression and the reason that exercise works
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:53.960]   to maintain your cognitive function as you age is because of biological pathways that
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:11:00.560]   we are now uncovering, some of which will involve microglial cells and neurons and other
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:06.200]   types of cells in the brains, some of which will involve not the neurons in the brain
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.760]   at all, but the brain's vasculature.
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:14.960]   So we know that exercise is very salubrious for keeping blood flowing to the brain.
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:18.920]   And when you're young, you have a super abundance of blood flowing to your brain.
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:23.440]   So it doesn't matter if it's reduced transiently, you're fine.
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:30.160]   But as you get older, your blood vessels become more occluded and less elastic, and you're
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:34.880]   closer to the trouble spot.
[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:40.960]   And if you exercise regularly, you can dilate and make your blood vessels, including those
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.880]   in your brain, more elastic.
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:52.000]   And that is almost certainly protective against both depression and cognitive decline as we
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:52.440]   age.
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:12:01.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
