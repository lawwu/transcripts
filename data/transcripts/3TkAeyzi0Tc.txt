[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found at
[00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:11.640]   the beginning of the fourteenth verse in the sixth chapter of Paul's epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:17.960]   Stand therefore having your lines girt about with truth.
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.240]   Stand therefore having your lines girt about with truth.
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:30.680]   We are here dealing with the Apostle's exposition in detail of what he has described twice as
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.000]   the whole armor of God.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.880]   He is concerned about this because he is reminding these Ephesians that they've got a great battle
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:41.880]   to fight.
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.840]   They're in a great warfare.
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.120]   They're confronted by the wiles of the devil.
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:55.840]   They're engaged in wrestling, not against flesh and blood, but against principalities,
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.800]   against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.400]   wickedness in high places.
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.760]   And such being the enemy, there's only one hope, and that is that we be filled with strength
[00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.640]   and power from the Lord himself.
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.480]   We've got to be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might.
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.920]   But in addition, we've got to put on the whole armor of God.
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.680]   And he can't rest content with just leaving that as a general statement.
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.040]   He has to enter to particulars, and we all must always remember these particulars.
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.540]   These are not just great slogans.
[00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.520]   These are not just words that we shout.
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.640]   These are detailed instructions.
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.600]   There is such a thing as the whole armor of God.
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.560]   Thank God there is, otherwise we would all be defeated.
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.880]   And we've got to put on each piece of this armor separately, carefully, and securely.
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.040]   And the first piece, as we've seen, is this one we're looking at, having you align.
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.560]   Here's the foundation of everything.
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.920]   Here's the first step, the lines, by means of which everything's going to be braced
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.120]   and keyed up and put ready for the fight.
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:12.680]   The lines have got to be girt about, he says, with truth.
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.600]   Well now then, the problem before us is this.
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.600]   What does this mean?
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.040]   It's all very well to say, having your lines girt about with truth.
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.280]   But what is truth?
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.400]   Is it possible for anybody to know what truth is?
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.200]   And we are engaged on this study because, as I've been pointing out, there is great
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.440]   confusion in the church about this at the present time.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.040]   And the whole situation of the church, and consequently of the world, I believe is mainly
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:46.640]   due to the fact that there is this tragic uncertainty with regard to the truth.
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.520]   We've seen that the majority today suggest and teach that you can't define the truth,
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.640]   you can't discover what it is.
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.960]   As long as you vaguely call yourself a Christian, as long as you're a good man, as long as
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.680]   you live a good life, nothing more is needed.
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.720]   And yet the apostle says here that we've got to have our lines girt about with truth.
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.140]   So it behoves us to discover what exactly this is.
[00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:19.160]   In other words, we are facing the great central foundational problem of authority.
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.960]   And until we are right on this, we'll be wrong everywhere else.
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.160]   You can amalgamate the churches to your heart's content, but if there isn't truth at the
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.560]   foundation, it'll come to nothing.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.800]   Truth is absolutely essential and vital.
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.160]   And then we were, therefore we've been looking into this question of authority, and we've
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.280]   been asking what is it?
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:47.240]   And we've rejected certain things that are being offered, such as reason, men's understanding.
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.240]   We've seen its utter inadequacy.
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.520]   Feelings.
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.200]   So many fall back on feelings.
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.520]   No matter what you say, this "I know, I feel," well, you use that argument and you've got
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.840]   no reply to the cults.
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.320]   They say exactly the same thing.
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:07.000]   If you judge by results and feelings, you've got no objective standard, and you'll soon
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.280]   make shipwreck of the faith.
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.200]   In the same way, we've rejected the authority of tradition.
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.520]   Tradition in the church, the great claim of the Roman Catholic Church, of course.
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:19.520]   Tradition.
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.920]   We've seen the inadequacy of that.
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.200]   And therefore we've come to this conclusion, that there is only one authority, and that
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.560]   is this book, which we call the Bible.
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:37.520]   Never was it more necessary that we should be clear about this than at this present hour.
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:43.000]   Until we come back to our authority, there is no hope at all.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:50.200]   And so we're looking into this whole question of the authority of the Bible.
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:55.000]   We've seen that it claims it itself, claims to be the Word of God, not something that
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.120]   contains the Word of God, but it is the Word of God.
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.740]   It's the claim of the writers.
[00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.680]   We found that in the Old Testament.
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.920]   Prophets talk about the burden of the Lord, or the Word of the Lord came unto me.
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:13.000]   The man doesn't say he's had a good idea, or that after much study and thought he's
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   come to this conclusion.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.820]   He's been addressed.
[00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.600]   Something was given to him.
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:23.880]   And he speaks what he's been told to speak, sometimes reluctantly, like Jeremiah and Amos.
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:29.880]   But he's done it because the pressure of the Spirit of God was so powerful upon him.
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.040]   Well now, these are just some of the main elements of this matter, which we sum up by
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:40.860]   putting like this, that our Lord also held that view of the Old Testament.
[00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.120]   So when you begin to express your judgments on the Old Testament, never forget that you're
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.160]   expressing judgments on the Lord Jesus Christ himself.
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.380]   He quotes as authoritative the Old Testament.
[00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.420]   He calls it the Word of God.
[00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.360]   He quotes even the early chapters of Genesis.
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.160]   So it isn't quite as simple as some of our friends seem to think.
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:06.060]   You can't criticize the Old Testament without criticizing him.
[00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.120]   That's the position at which we arrive.
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:14.400]   And in the same way we saw that the New Testament writers, these apostles and others, they quote
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:19.860]   it, they talk about the Scripture, the Word of God, the Holy Spirit says, and they make
[00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:24.980]   the general claim that it's all God breathed, inspired, all of it.
[00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:30.400]   And that holy men of God speak as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:36.840]   And then of course, towering above everything else in the book, is the figure, the person,
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.280]   of our blessed Lord himself.
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:46.880]   And what he says about himself, what he claims for himself, his unique authority.
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:51.960]   He has heard that it was said by them of old time, "But I say unto you."
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:58.480]   Now here is the basis of our authority, that here is one who says he has come from God.
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.600]   He is not merely trying to arrive at truth.
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.600]   He has brought it.
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:03.840]   He has come from God.
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.960]   He was face to face with God.
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.420]   No man has seen God at any time.
[00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:12.640]   The only begotten that is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:21.440]   Now this is the whole basis, that we are dealing here with God's revelation of himself and
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:27.320]   of his purpose with regard to this world and all its peoples.
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.320]   That is the claim.
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:32.160]   And that is why I say that we must come back to this.
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.380]   This is the position of Protestantism.
[00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:39.240]   This was the whole position at the time of the Protestant Reformation.
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:44.760]   They said the Church, like everything else, has got to be judged by the word, by the revelation
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:45.760]   of God.
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.480]   There is nothing higher than this.
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:53.480]   All experience, all feeling, all tradition, everything is subject to the criticism and
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:56.280]   the judgment of the word of God.
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:01.800]   Everything is going to be brought under the word of God and its searching glance.
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:07.600]   Now that was the whole origin of Protestantism, as it has been the position of the Church
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:12.360]   always in all times of reformation and of revival.
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:16.280]   It was clearly the whole position of the early Church.
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:21.340]   Well now then, we cannot afford to take any risks with regard to this matter, so I must
[00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:25.620]   proceed and take it yet further.
[00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:34.380]   This authority that our Lord claims for himself, he gave also to the apostles.
[00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:42.820]   Now this is vital, because as we shall see, we are dependent upon them.
[00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:47.780]   We have got to be so sure of this authority of ours that we will never queer it nor question
[00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:55.340]   it again, but we will be able to submit ourselves to it utterly and without any reservation.
[00:08:55.340 --> 00:09:03.220]   So we say that the same authority which our Lord himself claimed, he has given to the
[00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:04.580]   apostles.
[00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:08.140]   Now let me give you the authority for saying that.
[00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:12.340]   It is quite clear in the sixteenth chapter of John's Gospel.
[00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:19.540]   Our Lord says this to the disciples, the apostles, immediately before his departure.
[00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:25.780]   John 16, beginning to read at verse 12, "I have yet many things to say unto you, but
[00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:28.740]   you cannot bear them now.
[00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:36.460]   Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth, for he shall
[00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:42.060]   not speak of himself, but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak, and he will show
[00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:44.020]   you things to come.
[00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:49.380]   He shall glorify me, for he shall receive of mine, and shall show it unto you.
[00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:54.620]   All things that the Father hath are mine; therefore said I that he shall take of mine,
[00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:58.540]   and shall show it unto you."
[00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:00.340]   Now that's our Lord's promise.
[00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:03.900]   You see he'd been teaching them, he'd been telling them what to say when they went out
[00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:06.220]   preaching, he'd given them authority.
[00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:10.780]   But now he has just told them that he's going to leave them, and they were crestfallen and
[00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:11.780]   disappointed.
[00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:16.220]   But he says, "Let not your hearts be troubled, ye believe in God, believe also in me."
[00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:21.220]   And on he goes in this great section, starting there at that first verse in the 14th chapter
[00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:25.860]   of this Gospel of John, right away through to the end of the 16th chapter.
[00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:30.180]   He's addressing his disciples, and he says, "It's all right.
[00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:32.900]   The fact that I'm going didn't disturb you.
[00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:38.820]   It is expedient for you that I go away, for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come
[00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:42.300]   unto you; but if I go away, I will send him unto you."
[00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:45.960]   And when he comes, this is what he's going to do.
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:50.380]   They will have this divine instructor in them.
[00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:54.280]   He will bring to their minds and their memories everything he's taught them.
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:56.080]   He will show them things to come.
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.620]   He will lead them into all truth.
[00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:02.620]   He will be as authoritative as the Lord himself was.
[00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:10.020]   So, instructed and guided and informed by the indwelling Spirit, they will be able to
[00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:12.620]   teach in an authoritative manner.
[00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:16.380]   Now that was what our Lord promised them beforehand.
[00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:21.240]   And that, of course, is the very thing that we find fulfilled in the book of the Acts
[00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:25.780]   of the Apostles and in the New Testament epistles.
[00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:31.200]   We must thus familiarize ourselves with this great argument for the authority of the Scriptures,
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:36.260]   the absolute authority, the infallible authority of this Word of God.
[00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:43.060]   And if we don't grasp that, we shall be quite incapable of girding our minds about
[00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:44.060]   with the truth.
[00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:49.420]   Now, there, you see, is the promise given by the Lord himself.
[00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:51.420]   What about the fulfillment?
[00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:58.900]   Well, we've got evidence of that fulfillment in this very epistle to the Ephesians, which
[00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:02.820]   we are now considering together.
[00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:03.820]   Let me show it to you.
[00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:08.420]   How the Apostle himself is always concerned about this authority.
[00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:14.980]   We've seen it at the end of chapter 2, where he makes it quite clear that Christians, he
[00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:22.300]   says in verse 20, are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ
[00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:25.540]   himself being the chief connoisseur.
[00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:27.220]   What is our position based upon?
[00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:30.420]   It is based upon the Apostles and prophets.
[00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:31.420]   That's the foundation.
[00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:33.820]   Well, how can they be a foundation?
[00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:38.500]   They were only men like ourselves, sinful, weak, frail, fallible.
[00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:43.980]   But now, they're made foundations by this operation of the Holy Spirit in them.
[00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:48.420]   The truth is given to them, and the power to express it, and the power to write it.
[00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:49.420]   So it's authoritative.
[00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:55.500]   They're a foundation on which we can safely rest and build the whole edifice.
[00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:58.340]   Well, there it is at the end of chapter 2.
[00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:03.260]   But take what we read this morning in chapter 3, and that is why I read it, in order that
[00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.580]   you might be reminded of it.
[00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:09.620]   What is the authority of this Apostle Paul?
[00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:15.700]   What was it that enabled this man to go around the world preaching as he did, founding churches,
[00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:20.220]   instructing them, writing letters to them, speaking in the way that he does?
[00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:23.860]   Well, the answer, you see, is this.
[00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:26.780]   He puts it here so plainly in this third chapter.
[00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:31.460]   "For this cause I, Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ, for you Gentiles."
[00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:34.420]   Then, a most interesting digression.
[00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:41.140]   If you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you of.
[00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:43.500]   He says, "I've been given this commission.
[00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:45.700]   I've been given this dispensation."
[00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:48.460]   That's what it means, of the grace of God.
[00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:51.140]   It was given to me for you.
[00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:52.140]   How?
[00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:53.140]   How did it come?
[00:13:53.140 --> 00:14:00.580]   How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery.
[00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:05.300]   As I wrote afore in few words, whereby when you read you may understand my knowledge in
[00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:06.820]   the mystery of Christ.
[00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:12.060]   This is a mystery, he says, which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men,
[00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:15.780]   as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets.
[00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:20.740]   But you notice the repetition of the revealed and the revelation.
[00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:22.820]   You see, here was a great mystery.
[00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:27.780]   It was in the mind and heart of God, of course, from all eternity before the foundation of
[00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:28.780]   the world.
[00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:30.340]   But it wasn't known.
[00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:32.980]   Even the Old Testament saints didn't understand this clearly.
[00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:35.580]   They had glimpses, but it was a great mystery.
[00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:37.940]   It had not been made known before.
[00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:41.540]   But now, he says, it's been made plain and clear.
[00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:43.060]   It's been unveiled.
[00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:44.380]   It's been revealed.
[00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:45.380]   It's been unfolded.
[00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:46.380]   How?
[00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:47.380]   Well, by the revelation.
[00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:48.580]   Whose had it?
[00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:51.140]   The apostles and these prophets.
[00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:55.860]   His men were inspired by the Spirit to give authoritative teaching.
[00:14:55.860 --> 00:15:02.220]   You see, everywhere the apostle makes it quite clear that his authority is derived.
[00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:03.940]   It isn't his insight.
[00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:05.580]   It isn't his understanding.
[00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:06.580]   It isn't his learning.
[00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:07.580]   No, no.
[00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:12.580]   The thing has been given to him in order that the Gentiles should be fellow heirs and of
[00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:16.580]   the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel.
[00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:23.220]   Thereon, this great mystery and its preaching, I was made a minister according to the gift
[00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:28.220]   of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power.
[00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:34.020]   Now, there it is as plainly, surely as anything can possibly be.
[00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:37.040]   His authority is entirely derived.
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:42.260]   It has been given to him by this wonderful revelation.
[00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:47.780]   And of course, what he's really telling us there is just putting into his own words
[00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:54.260]   what he put on that famous occasion when he was on trial, you remember, before King Agrippa
[00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:55.660]   and Festus.
[00:15:55.660 --> 00:16:00.860]   You remember the famous scene which is described in the 26th chapter of the book of the Acts
[00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:02.720]   of the Apostles.
[00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:07.700]   Great apostle is on trial, and he's having to give an account of himself and of his ministry.
[00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:08.700]   And this is what he says.
[00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:17.300]   There he was, going down to Damascus to exterminate a church, hating Christ, hating Christianity.
[00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:23.220]   Suddenly the Lord appeared to him, apprehended him there on the road to Damascus.
[00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:30.060]   And he bowled over, as it were, lying helplessly on the road, looked up and said, "Lord, what
[00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:31.760]   wilt thou have me to do?"
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:33.460]   He could say nothing further.
[00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:42.780]   And our Lord answers him and says, "Rise, stand upon thy feet, for I have appeared unto
[00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:49.620]   thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou
[00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:55.900]   hast seen and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee, delivering thee from
[00:16:55.900 --> 00:17:00.620]   the people," that's to say the Jews, "and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee."
[00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:01.620]   What for?
[00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:05.860]   "To turn them from fires, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power
[00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:10.740]   of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which
[00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:13.620]   are sanctified by faith that is in me."
[00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:15.340]   What could be more explicit than that?
[00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:22.700]   Here's a man utterly opposed to it all, suddenly arrested, apprehended, and given a great commission.
[00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:24.380]   He's to be a minister.
[00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:26.900]   He's to be a preacher and a teacher.
[00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:31.260]   He's the man who's going to turn people from darkness, the ignorance of darkness, to the
[00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:36.940]   light and to the knowledge, set them free from this power and wiles of the devil, and
[00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:38.660]   translate them into the kingdom of God.
[00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:40.300]   How is he going to do it?
[00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:43.100]   Well, it's all given to him.
[00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:45.340]   He's going to be a witness of the resurrection.
[00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:48.700]   Further knowledge and information, he says, is going to be given to him.
[00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:53.660]   There on the road to Damascus, he's commissioned by the Lord and given the knowledge and the
[00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:56.060]   information, and he passes it on.
[00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:58.700]   That's the authority.
[00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:04.580]   This is something which he keeps on saying everywhere.
[00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:08.940]   I don't apologize for hurling these scriptures at you, my friends.
[00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:14.940]   With this appalling ignorance that is so rampant in the church today, it's absolutely essential.
[00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:19.060]   When I find people writing and saying that it doesn't matter what you believe, and that
[00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:23.060]   we today with our modern knowledge are in a position superior to all who've gone before
[00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:26.860]   us, well, it's essential, I say, that we should be clear about these things.
[00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:32.020]   Listen to him again in 1 Corinthians 11, as he deals with the communion service.
[00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:33.020]   Verse 23.
[00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:41.580]   "I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you."
[00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:42.580]   That's how he's received it.
[00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:48.980]   He has received it of the Lord, and what he's giving them and reminding them of is what
[00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:49.980]   he's had himself.
[00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:53.260]   1 Corinthians 15, at the beginning, same thing.
[00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:58.300]   "Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which
[00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:01.300]   also ye have received, and wherein ye stand."
[00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:02.300]   Then verse 3.
[00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:05.820]   "For I delivered unto you, first of all, that which I also received."
[00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:09.380]   It isn't Paul's good idea.
[00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:11.180]   It isn't Paul's philosophy.
[00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:13.420]   It isn't Paul's thinking in any way.
[00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:14.900]   It's all been given to him.
[00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:16.020]   He's but received it.
[00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:17.300]   He's a minister.
[00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:21.300]   He's preaching the revelation that has been given to him.
[00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:28.220]   That is why he was made a witness of the risen Lord, in order that he might testify to this
[00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:30.260]   truth concerning the resurrection.
[00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:35.860]   So he's already said in chapter 9 of 1 Corinthians, "Am I not an apostle?
[00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:37.180]   Am I not free?
[00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:41.780]   Have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord?"
[00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:46.780]   There is his right and authority for calling himself an apostle.
[00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:53.060]   But when we go on to the epistle to the Galatians, we see all this still more clearly.
[00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:54.940]   Listen to the way in which he puts it.
[00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:58.940]   "O how we are to delight in these things!
[00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:02.460]   Are you on the foundation of the apostles and prophets this morning?
[00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:04.120]   Do you know what you believe?
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.980]   Are you certain of what you believe?
[00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:11.700]   Are you ready to meet life and death and hell and all things, because you know this truth?
[00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:14.420]   Are you with your lines girt about with it?
[00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:16.980]   Well you never will be until you understand these things."
[00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:17.980]   This is the authority.
[00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:25.020]   Listen to Paul in Galatians 1, describing himself, how he had profited in the Jews'
[00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:29.780]   religion, above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of
[00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:36.860]   the traditions of my fathers, then in verse 15, "But when it pleased God, who separated
[00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:42.940]   me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace," Damascus wrote again, "to
[00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:48.380]   reveal his Son in me," that's what he did, "he revealed the Son in him, that I
[00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:50.900]   might preach him among the heathen.
[00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:54.060]   Immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood."
[00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:58.820]   He couldn't preach him to the heathen if he hadn't been revealed in him.
[00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:04.620]   It's always the basis of all his preaching and his teaching, and it's because of that
[00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:10.220]   he's already been able to say in that same first chapter of Galatians, from verse 6
[00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:17.380]   forward, where he says this, "I marvel that you were so soon removed from him who called
[00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:24.260]   you unto the grace of Christ, unto another gospel, which is not another."
[00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:29.300]   And that's the thing we need to say today, this other gospel is not another.
[00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:34.820]   There's only one gospel, but there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel
[00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:35.820]   of Christ.
[00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:40.500]   "But though we," he says, "are an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto
[00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:44.660]   you than that which we have preached, let him be accursed."
[00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:46.900]   How does he dare say such a thing?
[00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:48.640]   Is this just arrogance?
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:52.020]   Is this just an opinionated man who says, "I alone am right"?
[00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:53.020]   That's what they're saying today.
[00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:57.460]   They don't hesitate to judge this apostle Paul, but he says, "Let him be accursed,
[00:21:57.460 --> 00:21:58.860]   even though he be an angel."
[00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:02.780]   There's only one thing that enables a man to use such language, and that is that he's
[00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:08.220]   got an absolute certainty of his commission, that there's no question about his authority.
[00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:13.940]   "As I said before, so say I now again, if any man preach any other gospel unto you than
[00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:17.020]   that he have received, let him be accursed.
[00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:20.820]   For do I now persuade men, or God, or do I seek to please men?
[00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:25.820]   For if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ then.
[00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:32.420]   But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me, preached by me,
[00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:35.140]   is not after men.
[00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:43.300]   For I neither received it of men, neither was taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus
[00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:44.300]   Christ."
[00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:47.300]   Now, isn't that enough for us?
[00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:50.620]   Now, we perfectly care about all this.
[00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:58.140]   The apostle claims an authority directly and immediately from the risen Lord Jesus Christ
[00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:01.880]   himself, nothing less, nothing short of that.
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:04.740]   So he speaks in this authoritative manner.
[00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:11.100]   And we have a wonderful confirmation of his claim for himself, testimonial given to Paul
[00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:15.060]   by Peter in 2 Peter 3, 16.
[00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:20.700]   The apostle is trying to deal with the last things, the ultimate matters, prophecy.
[00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:25.700]   So he says that also, he says, "Even as our beloved brother Paul also, according to the
[00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:31.580]   wisdom given unto him, hath written unto you, as also in all his epistles, speaking in them
[00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:36.780]   of these things, in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are
[00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:46.340]   unlearned and unstable rest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction."
[00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:51.340]   You see, he doesn't hesitate to say that the writings of the apostle Paul are scriptures
[00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:55.220]   in exactly the same way as the whole of the Old Testament is.
[00:23:55.220 --> 00:24:01.260]   They are the scriptures, the other scriptures, the writings, the epistles of Paul.
[00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:07.860]   Here we are told authoritatively by the apostle Peter, are equally the scriptures, the special
[00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:13.700]   word of God, this thing that has come through the Spirit and not out of the mind of man.
[00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:20.220]   Well, there you are, there's the basis of the authority as it is stated for us so plainly
[00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:24.140]   and clearly and explicitly by the apostle Paul himself.
[00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:29.540]   And all the other apostles claimed exactly the same authority.
[00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:35.140]   One writes in an equally authoritative manner, so does Peter, they all do.
[00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:41.740]   And of course, that position was accorded to them by the early church.
[00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:48.260]   And it's simply a matter of history that when the early church, even later, came to
[00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:52.460]   determine the canon of the New Testament, there were all sorts of writings.
[00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:57.140]   The question was, what books should be put in the canon and regarded as authoritative?
[00:24:57.140 --> 00:25:04.220]   The one supreme test was always the test of apostolicity.
[00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:06.660]   Could it be traced back to the apostles?
[00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:07.660]   Why?
[00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:12.740]   Well, because they were the men who were given the revelation.
[00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:17.140]   They are the foundation, the foundation of the apostles and prophets.
[00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:23.380]   So the test of everything is ultimately the test of apostolicity.
[00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:26.380]   Is there somebody listening to me who says, "What has all this got to do with me?"
[00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:28.340]   "How am I in this troubled world?"
[00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:31.380]   "I'm concerned about the international situation."
[00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:32.740]   "What are they going to do with these bombs?"
[00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:33.740]   "Is there to be a war?"
[00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:37.460]   And here you are talking about the authority of the scripture.
[00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:47.020]   My dear friend, if that's the way in which you think, you are of all men most pitiable.
[00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:52.060]   If there is one thing you should desire to know at a time like this, and all of us, it's
[00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:53.060]   this.
[00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:57.060]   How can we go on living in this world?
[00:25:57.060 --> 00:26:00.460]   What if these bombs are let loose, how do we die?
[00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:04.220]   Don't you think that's your problem?
[00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:09.060]   If life is so insecure and uncertain, isn't it about time you made absolutely sure how
[00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:14.980]   you can be ready to meet whatever may come?
[00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:18.340]   All your possessions may suddenly be blown to nothing, your bank balance with it, and
[00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:20.900]   you're penniless, helpless, homeless, nothing.
[00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:24.360]   What do you do then?
[00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:25.360]   What if you have to die?
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:27.820]   How do you face it?
[00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:29.660]   How do you face the unknown future?
[00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:31.900]   There's only one answer.
[00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:36.700]   There's no way of doing so except on the basis of this teaching.
[00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:41.140]   That is why the authority of this teaching is more important than anything in the world
[00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:42.340]   this morning.
[00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:47.020]   And it is because I value your souls, and your peace of mind and of heart, and that
[00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:51.820]   you may have joy in tribulations which may come to us, that I'm showing you there's
[00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:54.140]   only one solid foundation.
[00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:55.140]   It is this.
[00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:58.140]   Very well, let me go on with the evidence.
[00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:05.380]   Here then is the conclusion we arrive at at the moment, that what we have here is the
[00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:10.460]   truth of God, not men.
[00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:14.620]   This isn't men, I say, trying to understand the problem of life and of the universe.
[00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:15.700]   That's philosophy.
[00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:18.820]   It's the opposite of this.
[00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:23.260]   Here are men who say one after another that this was given to them, they've received
[00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:25.100]   it, it has been shown to them.
[00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:26.100]   It's a great mystery.
[00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:27.660]   Yes, but it's been revealed.
[00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:30.820]   He's let us into the secret, he's initiated us.
[00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:33.860]   So we are telling you about the things that have been given to us.
[00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:41.880]   It is God's truth, not men groping after it, God revealing it, God making it known.
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:45.260]   But we must add to that.
[00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:53.980]   It is complete truth, by which I mean this, that we have no need to add to it.
[00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:57.340]   There is nothing further that can be desired.
[00:27:57.340 --> 00:28:02.500]   Now this is a great claim, I know, but I want to substantiate this.
[00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:11.100]   I am saying that everything that is necessary to our life and well-being in this world,
[00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:15.460]   everything that is necessary with regard to death, everything that is necessary with regard
[00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:21.460]   to what lies beyond death, it is all here.
[00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:24.780]   And you need nothing further.
[00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:28.420]   There is no need for any supplement, any addition.
[00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:31.700]   Let me give you my authority for my statement.
[00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:34.180]   Here it is in the Apostle Peter this time.
[00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:35.580]   They're all saying the same thing.
[00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:37.620]   Peter puts it in a very clear way.
[00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:41.740]   He at the beginning of his second epistle in the first chapter in verse 2, he says,
[00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:49.780]   "Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord,
[00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:59.460]   according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness,
[00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:04.860]   through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue, whereby are given
[00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:11.020]   to us exceeding great and precious promises, that by these ye might be partakers of the
[00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:16.100]   divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust."
[00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:18.300]   Did you notice the phrase?
[00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:25.460]   All things that pertain to life and godliness are already given us.
[00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:27.140]   It's all here.
[00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:32.860]   I defy you to produce a single problem but that it's already answered here in principle.
[00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:35.300]   That's the claim the Bible makes.
[00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:37.700]   Here is complete truth.
[00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:40.980]   Here is perfect entire truth.
[00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:43.820]   There is nothing further that anybody can need.
[00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:45.180]   That's why we preach it.
[00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:48.860]   That's why we must have our loins girt about with truth.
[00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:56.380]   Well very well, if this is true, I draw these deductions.
[00:29:56.380 --> 00:30:01.420]   The great first deduction is that we must submit ourselves utterly and absolutely to
[00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:06.700]   it, because it is what it is.
[00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:09.460]   If all I've been saying is true, there's only one deduction.
[00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:16.340]   I must submit myself unto this utterly and absolutely and completely.
[00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:17.340]   What does that mean?
[00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:21.000]   Well it means this, let me put it negatively.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   It means that I must stop talking about human ability and human reason and human thought
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.480]   and human learning.
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:34.360]   Because the moment I begin to do that, I'm denying all this.
[00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:37.040]   You see, these things are opposites.
[00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:44.640]   The whole fundamental postulate of the Bible is this, that man is incapable, he is unable.
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:48.320]   His only hope is God's revelation, God's given it.
[00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:51.480]   Well now then, but you must never bring the other back again.
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:56.920]   You mustn't begin to talk about man's learning and knowledge today, because the moment you
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:31:01.040]   do that, you are denying this, I say, at the very foundation.
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:05.560]   I believe I've already reminded you of this, but let me repeat it, because the days in
[00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:07.320]   which we are living are so evil.
[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:13.200]   How the apostle puts it so clearly there in 1 Corinthians in the first chapter.
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:17.680]   What he says is this, that the world by wisdom knew not God, and therefore it pleased God
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:21.000]   by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.520]   It goes on to say the foolishness of God is wiser than men and the weakness of God is
[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:28.240]   stronger than men.
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:33.240]   For you see, you're calling brethren, that not many wise men after the flesh, not many
[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:36.000]   mighty, not many noble are called.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:42.080]   But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise.
[00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:46.040]   And if you and I are not confounding the wise and the philosophers this morning, we are
[00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:48.520]   not behaving as Christians.
[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:53.040]   He hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise, and God hath chosen
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:57.240]   the weak things of the world to confound the things that are mighty, and base things of
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:00.800]   the world and things that are despised hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:07.360]   to bring to naught things that are, that no flesh should glory in his presence.
[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:11.880]   Then he goes on to say that we are in Christ Jesus who is made of God, and to us wisdom
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:15.320]   and righteousness and sanctification and redemption.
[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:20.280]   And according as it is written, he that glorieth let him glory in the Lord.
[00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:24.520]   Not in human learning, not in human wisdom, not in his great brain, not in his great understanding.
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:27.160]   No, no, it's the opposite of it.
[00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:29.120]   We've given that up.
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:32.060]   We say we know nothing apart from what we are told here.
[00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:35.120]   We are not interested in the speculations of the philosophers.
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:37.720]   Incidentally we know that they've always been wrong.
[00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:39.960]   We've always known that they've been inadequate.
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:44.120]   The world by wisdom knew not God, and there no nearer now than there were then.
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:46.080]   Very well, then why talk about learning?
[00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:47.820]   Why talk about intelligence?
[00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:51.000]   Why talk about human reason and philosophy?
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   It's useless.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   Don't bring it back.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.220]   Don't let it insinuate itself anywhere.
[00:32:57.220 --> 00:33:01.800]   We say we know nothing apart from what we are told here.
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:06.440]   I've no views on life this morning apart from this.
[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:09.800]   But I have views of life because of this.
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:12.620]   Indeed we have a better view of life than anybody else.
[00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:15.800]   It's only the Christian who can understand the world as it is today.
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:19.120]   Your clever men who've denied Christianity are quite bemused.
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:22.400]   They're completely upset in all their calculations.
[00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:27.920]   Their case was that all the world needed was education, and as we became an educated race
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:30.800]   we'd stop fighting and we'd all embrace one another.
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:34.080]   And as we traveled more and saw one another frequently we'd love one another.
[00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:37.420]   Well, we've got the education, we can travel very quickly.
[00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:40.280]   But you see the world.
[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:47.200]   Now my friends, as Christians we submit utterly and absolutely to this.
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:49.720]   And we need no admixture of anything else.
[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:51.560]   Well, I've quoted the Apostle Paul.
[00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:59.420]   Let me quote our blessed Lord himself saying the same thing much more strongly.
[00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:04.000]   In Matthew 11, verse 25.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:14.200]   At that time Jesus answered and said, "I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth,
[00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:21.600]   because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:22.600]   babes.
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:28.720]   Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight.
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:36.480]   All things are delivered unto me of my Father, and no man knoweth the Son but the Father.
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:43.680]   Neither knoweth any man the Father save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal
[00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:45.760]   him."
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:48.120]   Could it be plainer?
[00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:53.720]   Are you unhappy, Christian people, because so many of these great philosophers today
[00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:56.200]   are nothing but infidels?
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:57.200]   You shouldn't be.
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:58.840]   Here's the explanation.
[00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:01.040]   They trust to their wisdom.
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:02.720]   They're wise and prudent.
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:04.120]   They think they know.
[00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:10.400]   They think their reason is big enough to understand man and life and eternity and everything.
[00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:13.180]   Wise and prudent.
[00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:17.800]   And our Lord thanks his Father that he has hid the truth from them.
[00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:22.120]   While they are wise and prudent and proud of their brains and their knowledge and their
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:27.600]   understanding, they will remain the ignoramuses that they are.
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:33.960]   Fumbling in life today, bewildered, not understanding, and talking rubbish and nonsense more and
[00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:35.600]   more as week passes week.
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:40.320]   They're blind, they're ignorant, they know nothing, because they're proud of their wisdom
[00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:41.840]   and their prudence.
[00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:45.160]   God has hid it from them.
[00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:48.040]   And he has revealed it unto babes.
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:52.120]   And our Lord says there's no way of knowing these things except by revelation.
[00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:55.760]   No man knoweth the Son, but the Father.
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:59.640]   He wasn't surprised that the great people of the world didn't recognize him when he
[00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:01.120]   came in the flesh.
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:04.320]   They can't except it be revealed to them.
[00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:07.760]   You remember how our Lord put it at Caesarea Philippi.
[00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:09.320]   He says, "Who do people say that I am?"
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:13.040]   Well, they said, "Some say that thou art John the Baptist.
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:15.200]   Some say that thou art Jeremiah, one of the prophets.
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:16.600]   Whom do you say that I am?"
[00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:20.160]   Peter steps forward, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God."
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:22.840]   Do you remember what our Lord said to them?
[00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:26.360]   "Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-Jonah.
[00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:33.040]   Flesh and blood hath not revealed this unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven."
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:37.640]   Christian people, don't be surprised, don't be disappointed that the men whom the world
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:43.640]   reveres and almost worships as thinkers and men of understanding, with all their knowledge
[00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:49.240]   and culture, don't be surprised or disappointed that they're infidels and skeptics and unbelievers.
[00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:51.760]   They're blind.
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:56.720]   The truth is hid from them because of their pride in themselves and in their knowledge
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:57.720]   and in their understanding.
[00:36:57.720 --> 00:36:58.720]   They can't.
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:03.240]   It's got to be revealed by God, and they won't submit and become as little children.
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:05.200]   Hence their inadequacy.
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:11.240]   Hence indeed almost their folly at this present hour and juncture in the history of the world.
[00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:19.040]   Well then I say we must admit to this utterly and absolutely, without reservations, without
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:22.640]   bringing in our understanding, and without saying, "I can't follow that."
[00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:25.400]   My friend, you've got to become as a child, you've got to submit yourself.
[00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:30.520]   To have your lines built about, you accept this utterly, absolutely, without question
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:34.040]   or query, entirely as it is.
[00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:38.160]   But let me draw a second deduction.
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:44.320]   And this second deduction is equally necessary at this present time.
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:49.400]   Because there's a great deal of talk and of writing at the present time in the church,
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:51.600]   alas, along these lines.
[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:55.000]   Oh yes, the Bible, this is a wonderful book.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:01.080]   It's a book that helps us to arrive at a knowledge of God.
[00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:05.000]   Men stating their experience of God and trying to explain it.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.640]   It's a human book according to them and nothing more.
[00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:13.200]   And of course they say we mustn't expect too much from it.
[00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:16.480]   It's a very old book.
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:22.480]   Most of it was complete and written before the end of the first century A.D.
[00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:23.480]   Well there it is.
[00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:27.360]   Well they say it's a wonderful book of course when you consider the times in which it was
[00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:29.680]   written.
[00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:32.560]   And at the time it was ahead of everything else.
[00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:39.280]   But of course they say by now the world has advanced so much, civilization has grown,
[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:42.760]   knowledge has increased so much, and especially scientific knowledge.
[00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:47.760]   And the problems of life they say become so complex.
[00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:49.560]   How could that old book possibly deal with them?
[00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:51.080]   Of course it couldn't.
[00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:53.600]   It was all right in its time, in its own setting.
[00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:58.280]   But where things are as they are now, it's even wrong to expect it to be able to help
[00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:00.760]   us and to deal with our modern problems.
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:02.160]   We want something new.
[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:03.320]   We want something further.
[00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:05.080]   We must have something additional.
[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:07.720]   That's the argument.
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:16.160]   And that once more you see is a complete denial of everything that I've been saying.
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:20.660]   Let me give you first of all an authoritative word with respect to that.
[00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:23.160]   In the epistle of Jude in the third verse.
[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:29.480]   Beloved, he says, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation,
[00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:34.120]   it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend
[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:41.760]   for the faith which was once, which means once and forever, delivered, same word, delivered
[00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:44.760]   unto the saints.
[00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:50.400]   But here I want to emphasize the once and forever quality.
[00:39:50.400 --> 00:40:00.800]   This truth has been revealed and delivered and given to the apostles and prophets once
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:04.560]   and forever.
[00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:06.720]   It is the truth.
[00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:10.200]   It is the whole truth that is necessary for us.
[00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:11.760]   It can never be added unto.
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:14.480]   It's all here.
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:16.680]   Once and forever.
[00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:20.360]   But surely we ought to be in no difficulty about that.
[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:21.880]   It must be once and forever.
[00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:22.880]   Why?
[00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:26.020]   Well, for these reasons.
[00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:30.040]   What is the truth concerned about?
[00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:35.680]   What is the content of this truth, this faith which has been delivered once and forever?
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:41.240]   Well, of course, it's about God.
[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:45.760]   You see, it isn't about some scientific problem.
[00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:49.920]   It isn't anything to do with the atom at all.
[00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:54.320]   It includes all that, but that isn't its primary reference.
[00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:59.800]   The main content and message of this book is God.
[00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:01.680]   What is the greatest need of man this morning?
[00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:03.640]   It is to know God.
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:05.000]   Why is the world as it is?
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.680]   Because it doesn't know God.
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:09.720]   That's the cause of all your problems.
[00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:11.320]   It isn't some political question.
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:12.920]   It isn't an economic question.
[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:15.360]   No, no, it isn't a social question.
[00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:19.960]   All the problems of life today are due to man's ignorance of God and to the fact that
[00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:21.720]   he isn't being blessed by God.
[00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:25.360]   The supreme need at this moment is to know God.
[00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:32.480]   Yes, but God, by definition, doesn't change.
[00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:35.840]   He is from everlasting to everlasting.
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:40.120]   He is the Father of lights with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.
[00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:41.440]   He doesn't age.
[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:43.680]   He's outside time altogether.
[00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:46.040]   He dwelleth in eternity.
[00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:51.640]   God remains always absolutely the same.
[00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:54.520]   So what's the use of talking to me about the advance of knowledge?
[00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:59.600]   Can't you see it's a contradiction in terms?
[00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:06.040]   Man has always needed to know God, and the knowledge of God is always the same.
[00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:11.200]   The knowledge that God gave of himself to Abram is the same knowledge as he gave to
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:13.600]   Paul, the same knowledge he gives today.
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:17.680]   There is no difference, because God doesn't change.
[00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:21.320]   But not only that, man doesn't change either.
[00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:24.320]   You see, all this additional knowledge we've got, it's irrelevant here.
[00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:27.840]   It's got nothing to do with it.
[00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:34.520]   And man remains what he's always been, weak, ignorant, sinful, unworthy, vile.
[00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:37.200]   He doesn't change.
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:43.200]   Not only that, here's a powerful argument, and a final argument in and of itself, for
[00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:47.360]   the fact that the truth has been once and forever delivered.
[00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:52.680]   The Lord Jesus Christ, he is the truth.
[00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:56.920]   He is the light of the world.
[00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:58.640]   You can't add to it.
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:00.720]   You can't supplement it.
[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:04.960]   You can't say because the world has advanced and civilization has, and knowledge has grown,
[00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:09.280]   but we know it is, I am the light.
[00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:14.120]   He is the way, the truth, and the life.
[00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:18.880]   No man cometh unto the Father but by me.
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:21.600]   So as it's all in him, you've got to go back to him.
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:23.600]   Yeah, but you say that's two thousand years ago.
[00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:25.440]   I know, but he's the light of the world.
[00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:26.640]   He's the son of God.
[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:27.640]   He is the truth.
[00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:28.640]   Go back to him.
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:30.560]   Don't talk to me about advance.
[00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:31.680]   It's all in him.
[00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:33.400]   What I need is to know him.
[00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:34.480]   And he doesn't change.
[00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:41.040]   Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:48.320]   And then to round off this argument we put it like this.
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:53.720]   That man's knowledge of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, as we've seen so abundantly
[00:43:53.720 --> 00:44:05.240]   in these quotations, is always as the result of the operation of the Holy Spirit.
[00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:08.420]   No man can know God as he is by nature.
[00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:11.560]   No man can know Christ.
[00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:13.960]   The wise and prudent don't know him.
[00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:18.520]   Paul says the princes of this world didn't recognize him when he came, for had they known
[00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:21.360]   him they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
[00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:23.600]   He has natural ability at its best.
[00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:25.800]   He doesn't know him.
[00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:32.480]   No man coming with his natural mind to the Bible will ever get anything out of it.
[00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:34.920]   You can give them new translations.
[00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:38.120]   You can use the language of the gutter, if you like, in your translations.
[00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:41.360]   It won't help anybody at all.
[00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:46.800]   The difficulty with the Bible is not a matter of words or letters or translation.
[00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:53.560]   It's that man's mind is depraved and darkened, and he's opposed to the truth that is conveyed.
[00:44:53.560 --> 00:45:00.280]   And until he is enlightened by the Holy Spirit of God, he can do nothing with it.
[00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:01.280]   It's gibberish to him.
[00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:02.280]   It's nonsense to him.
[00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:04.880]   He may even think he understands it, but he doesn't.
[00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:08.880]   There is only one power that can enable a man to understand and receive this truth.
[00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:12.640]   It is the Holy Spirit of God.
[00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:18.400]   We have received, says the apostle again, to those Corinthians in 1 Corinthians 2, 12,
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:23.200]   we have received not the Spirit that is of the world, but the Spirit that is of God.
[00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:24.200]   What for?
[00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:30.960]   That we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.
[00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:34.920]   What's the use of talking about the 20th century, therefore?
[00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:38.920]   What's the use of talking about the advance of knowledge and of learning, and the complexity
[00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:43.640]   of our problems in the mid-20th century, the atomic age, and the new message needed for
[00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:46.200]   this is rubbish and nonsense.
[00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:47.280]   It's one.
[00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:48.280]   It's God.
[00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:49.520]   It's Christ.
[00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:51.200]   And I can't know either.
[00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:52.880]   I can't know anything.
[00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:59.600]   Until the Holy Spirit of God has given me an anointing and an anointing, and has enabled
[00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:04.680]   me to receive the truth.
[00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:10.880]   You and I today are as dependent upon the Holy Spirit as the first Christians were.
[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:16.560]   This foolish notion that the church today knows more about God and about the Lord Jesus
[00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:19.720]   Christ than the apostle Paul did is the final heresy.
[00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:20.720]   It's blasphemy.
[00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:24.280]   It's a denial of the Holy Spirit, but that's what they're saying.
[00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:26.360]   They don't hesitate to correct the apostle Paul today.
[00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:28.800]   They think he was wrong.
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:31.000]   They put him down on certain matters.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:34.560]   They say, "But now we've got knowledge, of course, which wasn't accessible to him."
[00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:36.400]   They even say that about the Lord himself.
[00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:39.960]   My friends, that is sheer blasphemy.
[00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:40.960]   That's not Christianity.
[00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:44.220]   It's a denial of it.
[00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:50.280]   We are utterly dependent in all our knowledge upon the operation of the Holy Spirit, and
[00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:55.840]   what he does is to give us understanding and enlightenment concerning the writings of
[00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:57.680]   the apostles and prophets.
[00:46:57.680 --> 00:47:02.160]   It is he who puts us on this foundation of the apostles and prophets on which everything
[00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:07.800]   depends and on which everything is built, so that what you and I need is the light of
[00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:12.940]   the Spirit to enable us to understand the writings of these men of God.
[00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:14.600]   We don't sit in judgment upon them.
[00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:16.160]   We submit ourselves to them.
[00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:18.160]   We come as little children and we learn.
[00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:21.440]   The Lord gave it to them that they might give it to us.
[00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:29.040]   We've nothing but this, and so we must submit ourselves utterly and completely and absolutely
[00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:30.040]   to this.
[00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:39.240]   Now there, I've just prepared the way, which will enable us, God willing, next Sunday to
[00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:43.640]   go forward to consider the exact character of this truth.
[00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:48.340]   But it's no use talking about the nature and the character of the truth in detail until
[00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:53.340]   we're all absolutely clear of its authority and that we've got to take it as it is, whether
[00:47:53.340 --> 00:47:55.280]   we understand or not.
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:58.460]   It's only as you believe you'll begin to understand.
[00:47:58.460 --> 00:48:00.400]   Never until then.
[00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:06.240]   We start by seeing our utter absolute need of the unction and the anointing, as John
[00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:10.520]   puts it in his first epistle, chapter 2, verses 20 and 27.
[00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:15.040]   We need that unction and anointing that will enable us to know that it is the truth of
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:16.160]   God.
[00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:21.680]   And then, having submitted ourselves to it, we can take it in its parts and portions,
[00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:27.160]   and so we will have girded our loins about with the truth.
[00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:33.000]   So that though the devil rage against us, though hell be let loose, though the world
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:38.780]   go up in flames, we know whom and what we have believed.
[00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:48.520]   We remain unshaken, unsurprised, never disappointed, because our feet are upon this impregnable
[00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:52.320]   rock of holy scripture.
[00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:54.120]   Amen.
[00:48:54.120 --> 00:49:04.040]   The closing hymn is hymn number 229, 2-2-9, "Lamp of our Feet," whereby we trace our path
[00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:09.300]   when wont to stray, 229.
[00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:39.080]   [music]
[00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:43.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
