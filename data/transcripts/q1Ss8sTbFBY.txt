[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.120]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.080]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.800]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.000]   Today, we are discussing fitness.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   Fitness, of course, is vitally important
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.840]   for cardiovascular health, for strength, for endurance,
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.720]   for lifespan, for healthspan.
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:24.940]   I can't think of anyone out there
[00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.840]   that wouldn't want to have healthy hormonal function,
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.880]   healthy cardiovascular function, to live a long time
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.340]   and to feel vital, that is to have a long healthspan
[00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.480]   as well as a long lifespan.
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.760]   Fitness and fitness protocols are tremendously powerful
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.200]   for developing all of that.
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.120]   However, despite there being an enormous amount
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.140]   of information out there on the internet
[00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.040]   and in books and elsewhere, it can be a bit overwhelming.
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.780]   So today's episode is really designed
[00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.280]   to synthesize science-based tools
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.280]   that we've covered on the podcast,
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.760]   some with expert guests like Dr. Andy Galpin
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.360]   or Dr. Peter Attia or world renowned movement specialist,
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.720]   Ido Portal or physiotherapist
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.400]   and strength and conditioning coach, Jeff Cavaliere.
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.960]   We've had all of them as guests on the podcast
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.080]   and each and every one of them provided a wealth of knowledge
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.940]   in terms of the various things that you can do
[00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.800]   to optimize very specific or multiple aspects of fitness.
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:18.920]   Today, we're going to do something
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.440]   a little bit different than usual.
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.400]   Typically on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.080]   I offer mechanism upfront or first,
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.160]   and then we talk about protocols that you can use
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.760]   that really lean on those science
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.780]   and science-based mechanisms.
[00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.500]   Today, I'm going to describe a specific protocol
[00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.200]   that serves as a general template that anyone,
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.860]   in fact, everyone can use
[00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.520]   in order to maximize all aspects of fitness.
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.700]   So that includes endurance, strength, flexibility,
[00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.080]   hypertrophy, aesthetic changes, et cetera.
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.600]   However, this general framework can also be modified
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.080]   that is customized to your particular needs.
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.140]   So if you're somebody who really wants to build more strength
[00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.080]   or bigger muscles, you can change the protocol
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.480]   and the overall program according to that.
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.360]   And I'll talk about very specific ways to do that.
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.800]   Or if you're somebody who really just wants
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.160]   to maintain strength, but you want to build endurance,
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.620]   we'll talk about that.
[00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.840]   And of course, we will cover real life issues such as,
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.920]   should you train if you are sleep deprived?
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:13.960]   What about food?
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:14.800]   When should you eat?
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.500]   What if you haven't eaten and you're hungry?
[00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.800]   Should you still train, et cetera, et cetera?
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.240]   We're going to cover all of that again
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.800]   in the context of this,
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.400]   what I would call foundational template of fitness.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.320]   And this foundational template of fitness
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.460]   is something that I personally use.
[00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.680]   In fact, I've used it for over three decades.
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.840]   Hard to believe that I'm that old,
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.480]   but I just recently turned 47
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.840]   and I still use this basic protocol
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.780]   or template across the week and modify it
[00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.960]   according to what my particular goals are that year,
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.800]   that month, even that day,
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.960]   because I, like you, live in the real world.
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.600]   And sometimes I've been traveling or I miss a workout.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.880]   Yes, it does happen.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.160]   Or life isn't organized in exactly the way that I need to
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.980]   in order to have everything go
[00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.940]   according to the protocol that's on paper.
[00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.720]   So we're going to discuss real world issues
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.760]   and how to work with the real world issues
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.060]   in order to get the most out of your fitness program.
[00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.720]   And again, by the end of today's program,
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:06.840]   I can assure you,
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.360]   you will have a template protocol
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.280]   that you can build up from, build out, change and modify,
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.760]   and that will really serve your fitness goals
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.700]   according to the science and what peer reviewed studies
[00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.780]   and the experts that appeared on this podcast
[00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.480]   and other podcasts really tell us
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.900]   is best and optimal for our fitness.
[00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.880]   I'm pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.700]   has now launched a premium channel.
[00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.940]   I want to be very clear that the Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.280]   will continue to be released every Monday
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.120]   at zero cost to consumer,
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.400]   and there will be no change in the format of these podcasts.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.000]   The premium channel is a response
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.160]   to the many questions we get about specific topics,
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.160]   and it will allow me to really drill deep
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.480]   into specific answers related to those topics.
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.800]   So once a month, I'm going to host an Ask Me Anything,
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.520]   so-called AMA, where you can ask me anything
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.880]   about specific topics covered on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.700]   and I will answer those questions.
[00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:57.980]   Those of course will be recorded.
[00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.980]   There will also be other premium content
[00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.800]   available to premium subscribers,
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.400]   such as transcripts and short videos of new tools
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.700]   and unique tools for mental health,
[00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.600]   physical health, and performance.
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.180]   If you want to check out the premium channel,
[00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.800]   you can go to HubermanLab.com/premium.
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.300]   There's a $10 a month charge or $100 per year,
[00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.820]   and I should mention that a large portion of the proceeds
[00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.500]   from the Huberman Lab premium channel
[00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.700]   will go to support scientific research
[00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.120]   that develops the very sorts of tools
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.100]   that we talk about on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.040]   The rest of the support
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.860]   for the Huberman Lab Podcast premium channel
[00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.420]   will go to supporting the regular Huberman Lab Podcast.
[00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:35.140]   Again, that's HubermanLab.com/premium.
[00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.740]   Before we dive into today's content
[00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.820]   about fitness and fitness protocols,
[00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.000]   I want to tell you about a brand new study
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.840]   that is very exciting and frankly, very unusual.
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.460]   This is a study that was published
[00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.260]   out of the University of Houston
[00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.700]   examining what I would call a micro exercise
[00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:52.820]   or a micro movement.
[00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.220]   It's a very small movement
[00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.500]   of a very small portion of your body.
[00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.280]   In fact, just 1% of your musculature
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.340]   that when it's performed continuously while seated has,
[00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:05.220]   at least what they report,
[00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.920]   are very dramatic positive changes
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.780]   in terms of blood sugar utilization and metabolism.
[00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.640]   So the title of this study is a potent physiological method
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.420]   to magnify and sustain soleus oxidative metabolism
[00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.780]   improves glucose and lipid regulation.
[00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.740]   This study was published in Eye Science
[00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.380]   and as I mentioned earlier,
[00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.180]   it is getting a lot of attention and it's very unusual.
[00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.540]   Without going into all the details of this study,
[00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:33.660]   let me just briefly give you
[00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:34.620]   a little bit of the background.
[00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.060]   First of all, you have a muscle called the soleus.
[00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.660]   The soleus muscle is a more or less wide flat muscle
[00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.180]   that sits beneath what most people think of as their calf,
[00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.860]   although it's part of the calf muscle.
[00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.260]   The other portion of the calf is called the gastrocnemius.
[00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.760]   The soleus sits below that.
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.060]   Now the soleus muscle is a unique muscle
[00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.320]   because it's largely slow twitch muscle fibers.
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.620]   It's designed to be used continuously over and over again
[00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.160]   for stabilizing your body
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.120]   when you're standing upright, for walking.
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.880]   This is a muscle that's designed to contract
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.760]   over and over and over again.
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.200]   In fact, you could walk all day on this muscle
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.000]   and most likely it would not get sore.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.720]   You've probably done that and it did not get sore.
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.420]   In contrast, a muscle like your bicep or your tricep,
[00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.920]   if I were to have you perform hundreds
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.000]   or thousands of repetitions, even with a very lightweight,
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.140]   you know, one pound weight or a two pound weight,
[00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.140]   eventually it would fatigue.
[00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:27.940]   You would feel a sort of a burn there.
[00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.820]   It's a very unusual set of muscles to use repeatedly,
[00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:32.460]   but the soleus is an unusual muscle
[00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.540]   in that it really is designed to be used continuously.
[00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:37.680]   Now this study was focused on how people
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.720]   who sit a lot of the day and don't have the opportunity
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:41.800]   for a lot of physical movement,
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.600]   or maybe who don't even exercise at all,
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.560]   can improve their metabolism and glucose utilization.
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.560]   Without going into a deep dive about glucose utilization,
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.800]   because we've done the deep dive on this podcast,
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.680]   episodes such as metabolism, et cetera,
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.760]   you can look those up at Hubermanlab.com.
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.880]   They're all timestamped and available there.
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.840]   Anytime you eat, your blood sugar goes up to some extent.
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.280]   So your blood glucose, as it's called,
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.120]   goes up to some extent.
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.840]   And then insulin is a hormone
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:11.160]   that's used to essentially chaperone and sequester
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.080]   and use that blood glucose.
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.360]   Or basically the idea is you don't want blood glucose
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.200]   to go too high.
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.480]   Hyperinsulinemia is something associated
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.680]   with blood glucose that's too high,
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.600]   because insulin goes up to essentially match
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.720]   the level of blood glucose.
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.640]   You also don't want to be hypoglycemic.
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.240]   You don't want to have blood sugar that's too low.
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.800]   And insulin is involved in both regulating peaks
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.840]   and troughs in blood sugar, blood glucose.
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.280]   So we can basically say, and this is very simple,
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:39.080]   but we can basically say that you don't want blood glucose
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.520]   to be elevated too much or for too long.
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:42.560]   That's not good.
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.920]   In fact, people who have diabetes,
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.560]   because they don't make insulin,
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.500]   people who have type 1 diabetes do not make insulin at all,
[00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.200]   their blood glucose is so high
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.280]   that they actually have to take insulin
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.200]   in order to regulate it.
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.900]   Otherwise their blood glucose can go so high
[00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:57.400]   that it can damage cells and damage organs.
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.600]   It can even kill people.
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.280]   People who have type 2 diabetes
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.000]   are so-called insulin insensitive.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   They make insulin, but the receptors to insulin
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.160]   are not sensitive to it.
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.480]   And so they make more insulin than normally would be made
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.320]   and blood glucose isn't regulated properly,
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:12.680]   et cetera, et cetera.
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.900]   The take-home message about blood glucose
[00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:16.480]   is that you want your blood glucose levels
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.040]   to go up when you eat, but not too high,
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.900]   and you don't want them to stay elevated for too long.
[00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.760]   This study looked at how people who are largely sedentary
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:27.920]   or at least sitting can increase the utilization,
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:31.640]   the clearance of glucose from the bloodstream after eating.
[00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:34.860]   And they also looked at overall metabolism for people,
[00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:38.160]   get this, that we're using just that 1% of muscle,
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:41.480]   the soleus, by doing what they call a soleus push-up.
[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:43.580]   So the soleus push-up can be described very simply
[00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:46.080]   as if you're sitting down with your knee bent
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:50.040]   at an approximately right angle, like a square corner,
[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:53.080]   and pushing up, or I should say lifting your heel
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.140]   while pushing down on your toe
[00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:58.600]   and contracting the calf muscle as it were,
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.520]   and then lowering the heel
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.880]   and then lifting that heel again,
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.500]   lowering the heel, lifting the heel again,
[00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:08.260]   each one of those is what they call a soleus push-up.
[00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:12.440]   This study had people continuously do soleus push-ups,
[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:16.040]   and they looked at things like blood glucose utilization,
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:17.860]   they looked at metabolism, and so on.
[00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:19.640]   Now, a couple of important things about this study
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:20.880]   before I tell you what they discovered,
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.120]   which was frankly pretty miraculous,
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:26.400]   almost hard to believe, and yet I believe the data,
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:30.000]   the data looked to be collected quite well,
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.300]   and there are a lot of statistics,
[00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:33.460]   and the study looks to be quite thorough.
[00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:34.700]   First of all, they used an equal number
[00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:36.680]   of male and female subjects.
[00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:40.400]   There were a wide range of body mass indices, okay?
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.120]   So this wasn't just super fit people
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:44.280]   or people that were purely sedentary and not fit.
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:47.440]   They used a wide variety of ages, time of day,
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:50.480]   people who tended to walk a lot or not walk a lot.
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.840]   They measured changes in metabolism
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.420]   and blood glucose utilization
[00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:57.080]   in people that had done these soleus push-ups
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.560]   while seated in the laboratory,
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.400]   and I must say they had them do these soleus push-ups
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:03.040]   for quite a long while continuously.
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:08.040]   So they had them do it for as long as 270 minutes total
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.280]   throughout the day.
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:11.480]   So if you divide that that's four and a half hours,
[00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:12.900]   you might say, well, four and a half hours
[00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:14.340]   of lifting the heel and putting the heel down,
[00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:16.020]   lifting the heel, putting the heel down, that's a lot,
[00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:17.700]   but they didn't always do it continuously.
[00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.000]   They had some breaks in there.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.700]   So this is the sort of thing that you could imagine
[00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:23.440]   you or other people could do while seated,
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:26.960]   while doing zooms or while on calls,
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.280]   or maybe even while eating, doing that sort of thing.
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.760]   Although I'm not suggesting that you constantly be focusing
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.000]   on soleus push-ups throughout your life,
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.560]   the point is that people who did these soleus push-ups
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:41.800]   experienced dramatic improvements in blood sugar regulation
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:42.800]   and in metabolism,
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.680]   despite the fact that the soleus is just 1%
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:47.000]   of the total musculature.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.360]   So here I'm going to read from the abstract
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:49.180]   about what they found.
[00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:51.080]   People who did these soleus push-ups,
[00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:55.320]   despite being a tiny muscle
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:58.320]   and using very little local energy,
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.440]   in fact, they measured muscle glycogen,
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:03.480]   the burn or essentially the utilization of fuel
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:04.320]   within the muscle.
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:07.000]   And there was very little utilization of fuel
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.400]   within the soleus itself.
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.680]   And that's because the soleus has this unique property
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:13.160]   of needing to basically keep you going all day,
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.640]   walking all day or moving all day.
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:19.720]   What they saw was a large magnitude, for example,
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:24.120]   52% less postprandial, that's after a meal,
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.200]   glucose excursion.
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:29.980]   So 52% less increase in blood glucose.
[00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:33.520]   And 60%, 6-0 less hyperinsulinemia,
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.260]   so reduced levels of insulin.
[00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:39.680]   They also miraculously observed that despite this being,
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:44.400]   again, a small muscle, 1% of the total muscle mass,
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.520]   so very small oxidative use,
[00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:50.440]   they saw big improvements in systemic metabolic regulation.
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:51.600]   So this is interesting.
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.080]   And I think something that we should at least know about,
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.500]   I'm not aware that anyone's replicated this study yet.
[00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.460]   I know there's a ton of excitement about this study
[00:11:58.460 --> 00:11:59.780]   in the popular press.
[00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:02.080]   And if the data turn out to hold up,
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:04.560]   which I like to imagine they will,
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:06.400]   I can understand why there's so much excitement.
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.400]   What this means is that if you're somebody who cares
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:09.780]   about blood glucose regulation,
[00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:12.080]   you want to keep your metabolism running,
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:14.000]   please don't stop exercising the other ways
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   that you exercise.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.500]   But if you're somebody who wants to maximize your health,
[00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:22.860]   doing these soleus pushups fairly continuously while seated
[00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:24.840]   is going to be beneficial.
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:25.880]   And in addition to that,
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:27.800]   I know that there are going to be people out there who,
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:28.960]   for instance, might be injured,
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.040]   or you're traveling and you're stuck on a plane,
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:34.000]   or you're in the classroom and you're forced
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.120]   to study all day or take notes all day,
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.800]   you're just not getting enough opportunity
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.100]   to get those steps that you want to take,
[00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:41.820]   whether or not it's 10,000 or fewer or more,
[00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:43.400]   getting enough steps or movement.
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.080]   Maybe you don't have time to get out and do your run,
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:47.240]   or maybe you're also running weightlifting
[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:49.760]   and doing yoga classes and things of that sort,
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.780]   but you want to further improve your fitness,
[00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:54.920]   at least in terms of your metabolic health.
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:57.840]   This seems like a terrific, very low investment way
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.620]   to do it, certainly zero cost.
[00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:01.200]   It does take a little bit of attention,
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.660]   so you have to divert your attention
[00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:03.560]   from other things you're doing
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:05.900]   to make sure that you're still doing these soleus pushups.
[00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:07.040]   I'm sure that many of you are going to have
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.120]   a lot of detailed questions,
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.280]   such as how high did they lift the heel,
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:13.240]   and did they contract the muscle very hard or not?
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.080]   Couple of things about that,
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:16.980]   they did not have subjects really contract the muscle hard.
[00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:19.620]   They did measure the angle of heel raise,
[00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:21.580]   and it was anywhere from 10 to 15 degrees,
[00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:23.800]   so they didn't have to go way, way up on their tippy toes
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.360]   or things of that sort.
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:28.880]   In any event, 270 minutes, four and a half hours
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:31.740]   of doing these soleus pushups is a lot,
[00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:35.400]   but by my read of the data and the rather significant,
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.360]   or I should say very significant effects
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.160]   that they observed on blood glucose regulation
[00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.000]   and metabolism, et cetera,
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.320]   seems to me that doing less would still be beneficial
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:47.240]   and that you don't necessarily have to do the full 270
[00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:50.080]   minutes in order to get the benefits that they observed.
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.800]   More about this study includes the fact
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.320]   that the benefits they observed were very long lasting,
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.040]   as long as two hours after a meal,
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.680]   they could still see this improved blood glucose utilization.
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:01.600]   I don't know because I wasn't able to find it
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:03.080]   in the methods, whether or not they were doing
[00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:07.360]   the soleus pushups while they were consuming blood sugar
[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:08.200]   in this study.
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.800]   The point being that if you're somebody who cares
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.320]   about their fitness, this study is interesting
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:15.080]   because what it means is that, again,
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:16.760]   if you are forced to be immobile
[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:18.840]   or sitting longer than you would like,
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:20.960]   I feel stuck in a meeting or zooms or class
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.820]   or on a plane, et cetera,
[00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:25.940]   or if you're simply trying to add a bit more fitness
[00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:29.400]   and metabolic health to your overall regimen,
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.260]   soleus pushups, at least to me,
[00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.760]   seem like a very low investment, simple zero cost tool
[00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:36.260]   to improve your metabolic health.
[00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:37.700]   For those of you that want to peruse the study
[00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:40.260]   in more detail, we will provide a link to this paper
[00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.860]   published in iScience in the show note caption.
[00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:45.480]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:48.280]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:50.460]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:53.060]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:55.680]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:56.800]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:59.520]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:01.780]   Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.
[00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:04.200]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:06.800]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:08.500]   to help you better understand your body
[00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:10.020]   and help you meet your health goals.
[00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:11.060]   Now, I've long been a believer
[00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:12.720]   in getting regular blood work done
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.980]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:17.100]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:19.540]   can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
[00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:21.020]   One issue with a lot of blood tests
[00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:22.460]   and DNA tests out there, however,
[00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:24.700]   is that you get information back about hormones,
[00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:26.060]   blood lipids, et cetera,
[00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:27.760]   but you don't know what to do with that information.
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.220]   InsideTracker makes understanding all of that very easy
[00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:33.180]   and even better points to specific directives,
[00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:35.360]   that is, things you can do in terms of your lifestyle,
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.520]   your nutrition, supplementation, et cetera,
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:40.400]   in order to bring those numbers related to metabolic factors,
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:41.860]   lipids, hormones, et cetera,
[00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:44.100]   into the ranges that are optimal for you,
[00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:46.160]   your immediate and long-term health.
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:47.840]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:50.680]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:53.160]   to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans.
[00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:56.920]   That's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off.
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:59.360]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Roca.
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.280]   Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:03.440]   that are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:04.280]   The company was founded
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:06.220]   by two all-American swimmers from Stanford,
[00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:08.580]   and everything about Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:10.840]   were designed with performance in mind.
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.660]   Now, I've spent a lifetime working on the visual system,
[00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:13.940]   and I can tell you that your visual system
[00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:16.480]   has to contend with an enormous number of challenges
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:18.240]   in order for you to be able to see clearly.
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:19.280]   Roca understands this
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:21.400]   and has designed their sunglasses and eyeglasses
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:23.580]   to be worn in any number of different conditions
[00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:26.680]   and for you to still be able to see with crystal clarity.
[00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:30.360]   Now, I wear eyeglasses at night when I work or when I drive,
[00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:31.880]   and I wear sunglasses during the day.
[00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:32.760]   I don't wear sunglasses
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:34.280]   when I get my morning sunlight viewing,
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:36.540]   a practice that I'm absolutely religious about
[00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:37.560]   every single morning,
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:39.700]   but throughout the day, I'll wear sunglasses when I drive
[00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:42.760]   or if I'm headed into bright sunlight to protect my eyes.
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:45.160]   Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses are terrific
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.360]   because they were designed for performance,
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:50.360]   so they were designed for things like cycling and running,
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:52.220]   so they won't slip off your face if they get sweaty.
[00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:53.280]   They're extremely lightweight.
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.120]   In fact, most of the time,
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:55.560]   I can't even remember that they're on my face.
[00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:56.380]   They're so lightweight.
[00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:58.360]   However, they also can be worn anywhere,
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.880]   to work, to dinner, et cetera.
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:00.940]   They have a terrific aesthetics.
[00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:03.200]   Unlike a lot of other performance eyeglasses out there,
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.620]   you can only find in designs
[00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:06.300]   that really make people look like a cyborg.
[00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:07.760]   Roca makes the cyborg versions.
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:08.600]   Some people like those,
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:11.000]   but they also make versions of their eyeglasses
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.440]   and sunglasses with frames
[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:15.080]   that you can wear out to dinner, to work, et cetera.
[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:17.260]   If you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses,
[00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:20.000]   go to roca.com, that's R-O-K-A.com,
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.480]   and enter the code Huberman
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:23.460]   to save 20% off your first order.
[00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:25.720]   Again, that's Roca, R-O-K-A.com,
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.680]   and enter the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:30.320]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:32.400]   Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:35.400]   that are customized to your unique sleep needs.
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:37.760]   Now, sleep is the fundamental layer
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:40.080]   that is the most important aspect of mental health,
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:41.260]   physical health, and performance.
[00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:42.600]   I've said that before on this podcast,
[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.320]   and I'm going to be saying it over and over again.
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:46.880]   If you're sleeping well, everything else is better,
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:48.320]   and if you're not sleeping well,
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:50.120]   everything else gets far worse.
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:51.060]   So sleep is vital,
[00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:53.760]   and sleeping on the correct mattress is absolutely vital.
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.200]   Helix understands this,
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.000]   and they have a brief quiz that you can take.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.240]   So you simply go to their website,
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:00.040]   you take this quiz, it asks you questions,
[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:02.240]   such as, do you tend to run hot or cold during the night?
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:03.800]   Do you tend to sleep on your back,
[00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:05.420]   your side of your stomach, or maybe you don't know?
[00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:07.400]   And they match you to a mattress
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:09.380]   that's ideal for your particular sleep needs.
[00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:11.660]   For me, that was the Dusk mattress, D-U-S-K.
[00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:13.400]   I've been sleeping on a Dusk mattress
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:14.680]   for well over a year now,
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:16.300]   and it's the best sleep I've ever had.
[00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:17.760]   If you'd like to try a Helix mattress,
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:20.840]   you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman,
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:22.600]   take that brief two-minute sleep quiz,
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:24.560]   and they'll match you to a customized mattress
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:25.720]   for your sleep needs.
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:27.960]   You'll get up to $200 off all mattress orders
[00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:29.220]   and two free pillows.
[00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:30.120]   Again, if you're interested,
[00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:32.340]   you go to helixsleep.com/huberman
[00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:35.000]   for up to $200 off and two free pillows.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.120]   The Huberman Lab podcast
[00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:37.960]   is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:39.280]   To find the supplements we discuss
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:40.500]   on the Huberman Lab podcast,
[00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:43.120]   you can go to Live Momentus, spelled O-U-S,
[00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:45.480]   livemomentus.com/huberman.
[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:46.400]   And I should just mention
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:47.720]   that the library of those supplements
[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:49.260]   is constantly expanding.
[00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:52.340]   Again, that's livemomentus.com/huberman.
[00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:53.800]   Let's talk about fitness,
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.400]   and let's talk about how you can develop
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.620]   the optimal fitness protocols for you.
[00:18:57.620 --> 00:19:00.340]   So that includes what to do each day of the week
[00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:02.560]   and your fitness protocol across the week
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:04.640]   and indeed across the month and the year
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:06.600]   and even year to year.
[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.080]   When we had Dr. Andy Galpin on the podcast,
[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:10.440]   he said something very important
[00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:12.360]   that we want to keep in mind today,
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:15.600]   which is concepts are few, methods are many.
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:18.120]   That is, there are an infinite number
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:20.160]   of different programs and exercises
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.160]   and set and rep schemes and different runs
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:24.920]   and burpees and pushups, et cetera, et cetera,
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:26.020]   that one can follow.
[00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:30.080]   However, there are really just a few basic concepts
[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:33.280]   or principles of muscle physiology,
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:36.720]   of cardiovascular function, of connective tissue function,
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:40.340]   that provide or set the basis for the adaptations
[00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:43.120]   that we call fitness or that lead to fitness.
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:45.100]   So I'm going to list those off now.
[00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:47.320]   We can talk about a fitness protocol
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:50.560]   that's really aimed mainly toward developing skill.
[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:51.440]   That's one.
[00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:53.840]   Or speed, that's another.
[00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:57.080]   Or power, which is speed times strength.
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:59.200]   Or specifically strength.
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:02.220]   Or hypertrophy, growth of muscles.
[00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:04.760]   Or endurance, such as muscular endurance.
[00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:06.440]   Muscular endurance is, for instance,
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:09.220]   your ability to stay in a plank position
[00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:11.120]   or to do a wall sit,
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:14.600]   you know, to sit on an invisible chair against a wall.
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:16.120]   Or other forms of endurance,
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:19.000]   like near pure anaerobic endurance.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.200]   So a one-minute sprint or less,
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:25.880]   or a one-minute all-out cycling on a stationary bike,
[00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:26.960]   this sort of thing.
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:29.560]   Or endurance that occurs in the kind of
[00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:33.120]   three to 12-minute total duration range.
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:35.740]   So that might be sprints
[00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:37.800]   or high-intensity interval type training.
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:39.860]   It could be a all-out swim.
[00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:41.800]   It could be all-out row.
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:43.040]   That's another form of endurance,
[00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:44.800]   taps into different fuel systems,
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:47.840]   different aspects of muscle physiology, et cetera.
[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:50.720]   And then endurance that lasts 30 minutes or more,
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:52.280]   which is typically what people think about
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:53.740]   when they think about endurance.
[00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:55.620]   But of course the other forms of endurance matter.
[00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:59.600]   So we've got skill, speed, power, strength, hypertrophy,
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:02.280]   muscular endurance, anaerobic endurance,
[00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:05.560]   what I would call three to 12-minute endurance,
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:07.520]   although it goes by other names as well.
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:10.080]   And 30 minutes or more endurance type
[00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:12.480]   exercise and adaptations.
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:14.560]   Each and every one of these
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:17.720]   requires different principles, different concepts,
[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:21.280]   in order to improve, say your muscular strength
[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:23.320]   or your hypertrophy or both.
[00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:25.640]   However, there's a general theme
[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:29.240]   that sits beneath all adaptations leading to fitness.
[00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:30.960]   And that's what we're really going to set down
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:32.160]   as the base layer,
[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:34.520]   the foundation of everything we talk about today.
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:37.800]   And that's that we need to think about
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:39.740]   what are the modifiable variables?
[00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:41.400]   Again, I'm borrowing directly
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.040]   from the episode with Dr. Andy Galpin.
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:45.280]   He was the one that said modifiable variables
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:46.280]   are the key thing to think about.
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:47.520]   What are you going to modify?
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.000]   What are you going to change
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.240]   in order to increase one or some
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:55.800]   of the various things I listed off before?
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:57.480]   Skill, speed, power, strength, hypertrophy,
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:59.280]   endurance, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:01.520]   And some of the key concepts
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:03.160]   that emerge from that discussion
[00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:05.440]   are that we need to think about progressive overload.
[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:07.280]   Normally, when people hear about progressive overload,
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:09.160]   they think about adding more weight to a bar
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.620]   or picking up heavier dumbbells,
[00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:13.180]   but that could also be progressive overload
[00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:16.160]   in the context of running up a hill of steeper incline
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:18.280]   or running a little bit faster or a little bit further
[00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:19.800]   and so on and so forth.
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:21.280]   Now, as I promised earlier today,
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:22.460]   we are not going to drill
[00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:24.380]   into each and every one of the mechanisms
[00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:26.700]   that underlie the different adaptations
[00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:28.120]   that are going to develop speed
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:30.040]   and strength and endurance, et cetera,
[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:31.520]   because that was covered in the podcast
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:33.680]   with Dr. Andy Galpin and the other podcasts
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:35.320]   with experts that I mentioned earlier.
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:37.360]   And we, again, we'll provide links to those podcasts
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:39.700]   if you want to drill into those mechanisms.
[00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:42.280]   Instead, what we're going to do is we're going to start
[00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:45.840]   with a program that essentially is designed
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:49.700]   for you to maximize all aspects of fitness
[00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:52.200]   to the extent that you can simultaneously
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:54.280]   maximize all aspects of fitness,
[00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:57.920]   but then to change or modify that protocol
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:01.080]   so that if you want to build up more, for instance, strength
[00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:04.280]   and you want to just hold on to the endurance you have,
[00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:05.600]   you don't want to build endurance,
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:08.720]   at least not in that week or that month, you can do that.
[00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:09.980]   Or if you want to improve your endurance
[00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:12.720]   while maintaining your strength, you can do that,
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:14.680]   and so on and so forth.
[00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:17.720]   Most people, I do believe, would like a combination
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:21.160]   of strength and endurance and flexibility
[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:22.460]   and maybe even hypertrophy,
[00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:24.520]   particularly for certain muscle groups
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:26.520]   that maybe are not as well developed
[00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:27.360]   as other muscle groups.
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:29.060]   They want to bring balance to their physique,
[00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:31.560]   both for sake of aesthetics and for sake of health
[00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:34.540]   and for sake of general functioning,
[00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:36.360]   maybe even to eliminate pain.
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:38.160]   The protocol that I'm going to describe
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:41.400]   really works as a foundational template for that as well.
[00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:43.900]   So let's drill into that foundational protocol,
[00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:47.220]   and I'll keep referring to it as the foundational protocol,
[00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:48.540]   not because it's the one that I use,
[00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:50.000]   although it is the one that I use,
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.980]   and not because it's the one that we're talking about today,
[00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:53.540]   although it's the one we're talking about today,
[00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:55.620]   but because we need some general framework
[00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:58.180]   from which to build out the more specific protocols
[00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:00.680]   that we'll get into in a bit more detail later.
[00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:02.840]   So in this foundational protocol for fitness,
[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:06.200]   what you'll notice is that on any one given day,
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:09.300]   you're going to focus on one particular aspect of fitness.
[00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:11.080]   Maybe it's endurance, maybe it's strength,
[00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:12.800]   maybe it's hypertrophy.
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:14.520]   In particular, it might be hypertrophy
[00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:17.400]   for a particular muscle group or muscle groups.
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:20.060]   That said, across the entire week,
[00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:21.980]   it's designed to bring fitness
[00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:26.440]   and different forms of fitness to all aspects of your body.
[00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:29.780]   So this particular protocol begins on Sunday,
[00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:31.740]   although that's simply the day
[00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:33.680]   that I happen to begin the protocol.
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:36.080]   And again, this protocol is not important
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:37.660]   because it's the one that I follow.
[00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:39.780]   I follow it because it is important.
[00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:42.100]   In other words, it's a protocol that's really gleaned
[00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:43.260]   from the scientific literature
[00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:45.080]   and the experts that is for you.
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:47.120]   So this fitness protocol is really about you.
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:49.740]   I just may refer to it as the one that I follow
[00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:51.340]   simply for ease of communication.
[00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:53.780]   And for me, my week begins on Sunday.
[00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:58.060]   So I do my very best to get a workout in on Sunday.
[00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:02.680]   And for me, that workout is that of a endurance workout.
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:07.440]   It's designed to either maintain or increase my endurance.
[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:09.720]   And the endurance type that I'm referring to
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:11.780]   is endurance of 30 minutes or more.
[00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:15.680]   In fact, for me, the goal is always to get
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:18.860]   either 60 to 75 minutes of jogging.
[00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:21.640]   So this would be so-called zone two cardio.
[00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:23.660]   People probably have heard of zone two cardio,
[00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:24.700]   but if you haven't, that's okay.
[00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:27.320]   Zone two cardio is something that you could measure
[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:29.320]   with a heart rate monitor or other device,
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:31.020]   but you don't need to.
[00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:33.900]   Zone two cardio is the kind of cardiovascular exercise
[00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:38.180]   in which you're pushing yourself to move
[00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:41.380]   such that you're breathing faster than normal.
[00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:43.380]   Your heart is beating faster than normal.
[00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:46.540]   However, you are still able to sustain a conversation.
[00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:49.960]   But if you were to push yourself any harder,
[00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:52.860]   that is move faster or go up a steeper incline
[00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:55.220]   at the same rate you happen to be at any one moment,
[00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:57.620]   you would lose that ability to speak.
[00:25:57.620 --> 00:25:59.020]   You wouldn't be able to complete sentences.
[00:25:59.020 --> 00:25:59.980]   You would be out of breath
[00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:01.800]   or you'd have to pause mid-sentence.
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:04.580]   Now it's near impossible, even with a heart rate monitor,
[00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:07.260]   to stay exactly in zone two
[00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:08.720]   unless you're very, very skilled at that.
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:10.320]   So I don't obsess over that.
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:11.940]   And in fact, I don't wear a heart rate monitor
[00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:12.980]   when I do this exercise.
[00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:15.580]   But for me, the goal is to head out on Sunday
[00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:19.780]   and get 60 to 75 minutes of jogging in zone two.
[00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:21.380]   Now, of course, I like to jog,
[00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:22.720]   but that doesn't mean that you have to jog.
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:26.980]   You could replace jogging with rowing on a rowing machine
[00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:28.660]   or maybe even rowing an actual boat
[00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:32.060]   if you have access to that or cycling or swimming,
[00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:34.340]   something that allows you continuous movement
[00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:38.660]   for 60 to 75 minutes at that zone two threshold
[00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:40.620]   we talked about earlier.
[00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:42.920]   For me, that can include some hills.
[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:44.920]   And when I say hills, they could be very steep hills,
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:47.600]   but I'll simply slow my pace down
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:51.340]   in order to stay in that roughly zone two range.
[00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:55.100]   Or it could be that they are more low grade hills
[00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:57.040]   and I might just slow down a little bit,
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:59.440]   or I might even push myself a tiny bit that day,
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:01.780]   but really I'm just trying to build that long endurance.
[00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:04.860]   I'm trying to build up my capacity or maintain my capacity
[00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:07.460]   to go a long distance without fatiguing.
[00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:10.300]   Now, some days, meaning some Sundays,
[00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:12.580]   since I tend to do this almost always on Sunday,
[00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:14.100]   although there are exceptions,
[00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:16.820]   instead of doing the 60 to 75 minute jog,
[00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:20.140]   what I'll do is I will head out for a long hike
[00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:22.660]   that could be two and a half hours or three hours,
[00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:24.260]   or maybe even a four or five hour hike.
[00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:25.900]   Sometimes it's very long.
[00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:30.620]   And I'll do that sometimes simply to mix up the routine
[00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:33.540]   because sometimes jogging and jogging the same routes
[00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:34.700]   gets boring to me.
[00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:35.980]   I do enjoy running.
[00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:38.060]   That's something I've been doing for a very long time,
[00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:41.940]   but sometimes it just gets a little bit tedious
[00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:43.580]   and I want to do something different.
[00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:45.800]   Also, sometimes I want to be social on Sundays.
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:47.820]   I want to head out on a hike with my partner,
[00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:49.940]   or I want to meet up with friends
[00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:50.780]   and hike with them.
[00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:52.600]   And so taking a long hike on Sunday
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:54.340]   is something that also could be quite social.
[00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:55.260]   And then I don't have to worry
[00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:56.980]   about also getting in my workout
[00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:59.380]   when heading out on a hike with my partner
[00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:03.000]   or going out to meet with friends or things of that sort.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.420]   I will say that there's a specific tool
[00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:09.680]   or a specific change that you can make
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:11.820]   to this Sunday long endurance,
[00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:13.560]   or at least what I consider long for me.
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:15.460]   I mean, it's by no means a marathon or an Ironman,
[00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:18.500]   but this long endurance training.
[00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:20.620]   And that's the use of a weight vest.
[00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:23.020]   So something that I've really started utilizing
[00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:25.260]   more recently, and by more recently,
[00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:27.420]   I really mean within the last year or so,
[00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:29.460]   is I purchased one of these weight vests
[00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:33.020]   that can be anywhere from 10 to 50 pounds.
[00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:35.400]   What I use in the weight vest is irrelevant,
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:39.280]   but it certainly changes the level of effort required
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:40.940]   when taking a hike or even a walk.
[00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:42.780]   Now there's an additional benefit of the weight vest,
[00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:45.620]   which is that if you are going out for a hike
[00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:47.460]   or even for a walk for social reasons,
[00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:48.660]   and you're with somebody that's not quite
[00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:50.660]   at the same fitness level that you are,
[00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:52.000]   frankly, it's a little bit rude
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.660]   to just keep walking ahead of them and running back
[00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:56.200]   or running ahead and running back.
[00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:57.660]   You know, oftentimes you really want to spend time
[00:28:57.660 --> 00:28:59.240]   with the person and you don't want them to feel
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:00.740]   as if they're holding you up.
[00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:02.800]   And so the weight vest is a terrific way
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:04.300]   to get some additional work.
[00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:07.100]   Then as you'll find, if you wear a weight vest,
[00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:10.460]   it is additional work on say a shorter hike.
[00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:12.220]   So maybe the person you're with
[00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:13.980]   only has time for an hour long hike,
[00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:15.380]   or maybe they just don't have the fitness
[00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:17.920]   to do a two hour or three hour hike.
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:19.540]   So I'll throw on the weight vest
[00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:21.940]   and I'll head out for a walk with them or a hike with them.
[00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:23.620]   Or sometimes I'll go out on a long hike
[00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:25.340]   with the weight vest myself.
[00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:28.380]   So again, the point of this for me Sunday,
[00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:30.180]   although it could fall on any day for you,
[00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:33.140]   workout is really to build up that long form endurance.
[00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:35.940]   And this fits well with what Dr. Andy Galpin
[00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:39.140]   and Dr. Peter Attia referred to as the real need
[00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:42.680]   to get in some long endurance type work at some point
[00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:44.980]   or even multiple points throughout the week.
[00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:48.920]   For me, this long Sunday jog of 60 to 75 minutes
[00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:52.840]   or long Sunday hike or weighted walk or weighted hike
[00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:54.660]   really accomplishes that goal.
[00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:57.140]   Sometimes leads to a little bit of soreness,
[00:29:57.140 --> 00:29:59.540]   particularly in my calves,
[00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:01.100]   or if I'm wearing the weight vest,
[00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:04.100]   sometimes my midsection will get sore
[00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:05.780]   because I'm trying to remain upright.
[00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:08.960]   So I think it also builds up some muscular endurance,
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:10.860]   not just cardiovascular endurance.
[00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:12.620]   But again, throughout the entire time
[00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:14.320]   that I'm jogging or hiking,
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:16.940]   what I'm trying to get to is a place where I can feel
[00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:19.580]   that my pulse rate is definitely elevated,
[00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:21.760]   but it's not so elevated that I have to stop
[00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:23.120]   because I'm out of breath.
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:24.900]   And because I know some people out there
[00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:27.060]   might be really neurotic about this sort of thing.
[00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:29.040]   If you have to stop because you're out of breath,
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:30.480]   that doesn't mean that you blew the workout
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:31.900]   that you know you aren't getting endurance.
[00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:34.300]   Of course, you're getting benefits from it.
[00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:37.360]   So I'm not absolutely neurotic about always staying exactly
[00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:38.700]   in that heart rate zone.
[00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:40.880]   I might stop and have a conversation for a moment
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:42.040]   if it's a longer hike,
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:43.380]   although I really try and keep moving
[00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:45.920]   and I try and push myself just a little bit further
[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:48.660]   than where I'm exceedingly comfortable.
[00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:52.660]   And so for me, doing this long Sunday hike or jog
[00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:55.880]   really provides a foundation, a base for endurance
[00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:57.860]   that then the other endurance workouts
[00:30:57.860 --> 00:30:58.800]   that I'll describe later
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:01.740]   and that take place later in the week can build on.
[00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:02.880]   Now, as I mentioned earlier,
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:05.440]   we will get back to the mechanisms that this taps into
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:07.580]   and why this is so useful.
[00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:09.620]   There are multiple benefits to doing these kinds
[00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:13.020]   of endurance type workouts and zone two cardio,
[00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:15.800]   but by putting it at the start of my week,
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:18.040]   again, my week starts on Sunday,
[00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:21.760]   I'm sure that regardless of how the rest of the week goes,
[00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:24.120]   that I got my endurance training in.
[00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:26.240]   And of course, I'm going to want to
[00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:28.560]   and I will do endurance training other days during the week,
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:30.800]   but if something comes up or I happen to get sick
[00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:33.200]   or I'm really behind in terms of work
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:34.860]   and I can't get other workouts in,
[00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:38.240]   this Sunday long jog or hike really provides
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:41.960]   that fundamental, I can honestly say foundation
[00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:44.380]   for cardiovascular fitness and endurance
[00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:46.120]   that I can hang my hat on and say,
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:47.840]   okay, I've got that one in the bag
[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:50.080]   and I can then look to other days of the week
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:52.140]   to focus on other aspects of fitness.
[00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:53.820]   Now, a really important point to make
[00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:55.840]   about this Sunday endurance workout
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:59.360]   is that allows you to check off a box
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:04.100]   and that box is 75 or so minutes of zone two cardio,
[00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:06.280]   because as you may have heard,
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:08.320]   either in this podcast or from others out there
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:09.360]   like Dr. Peter Attia,
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:13.800]   getting 180 to 200 minutes of zone two cardio per week
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:17.180]   has enormous positive effects on longevity
[00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:20.740]   and enormous positive effects on general health.
[00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:22.760]   Again, in terms of cardiovascular function,
[00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:25.680]   but also metabolic fuel utilization,
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:27.640]   also in terms of your musculature
[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:29.520]   and your ability to use your body
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:31.960]   over long distances for long periods of time.
[00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:36.960]   So while it doesn't complete all 180 to 200 minutes per week,
[00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:40.000]   it certainly gets you a good distance, pun intended,
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.220]   toward that goal.
[00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:42.840]   Now, I want to acknowledge that some people
[00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:44.680]   might be starting a fitness program
[00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:47.940]   and so 60 to 75 minutes of jogging might be too long
[00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:50.760]   or a three-hour weighted vested hike,
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:52.400]   or some people might even do what's called a ruck,
[00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:55.240]   like you wear a rucksack, that might be too much.
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:58.520]   In which case, certainly start with less
[00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:00.960]   and go on flat ground and go at the rate
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:02.880]   that allows you to get into zone two,
[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:04.800]   but that is not excessively difficult for you
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:05.960]   and then as you build up fitness,
[00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:09.280]   you can add time or you can add weight through a weight vest
[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:11.760]   or if you don't want to buy a weight vest
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:14.480]   or can't afford one, as a simple solution to that,
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:16.480]   I actually have a good anecdote about that.
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:19.400]   One time I was heading out for a hike with a friend of mine,
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:21.480]   he was a former SEAL team operator,
[00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:22.840]   I'll never forget this and he said,
[00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:25.540]   "Oh yeah, I'll bring you a sack."
[00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:26.920]   And I thought he meant like a sack lunch,
[00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:27.760]   like he was going to bring lunch
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:29.480]   and I showed up and he basically gave me a backpack
[00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:30.880]   that was loaded with a bunch of stuff
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:32.560]   and the backpack weighed about 40 pounds
[00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:33.560]   and then we took a hike.
[00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:36.920]   So I was thinking lunch, he was thinking weighted backpack
[00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:40.200]   and a weighted backpack or even just any kind of strong sack
[00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:41.440]   that you can put over your shoulders
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:42.720]   or even carrying your arms,
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:44.440]   it's going to work exceedingly well
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:46.700]   to build in some extra requirement for effort.
[00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:49.320]   So you certainly don't have to purchase a weight vest
[00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:53.640]   in order to get the benefits of bringing additional weight
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:57.040]   along with you on these long cardiovascular events.
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:59.760]   But again, build up over time, you can add time,
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:02.280]   you can add weight and that's also a really nice feature
[00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:04.720]   of adding weight, which is at some point
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:06.240]   your schedule might be such
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:10.000]   or you just don't really want to keep adding
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.600]   more and more and more time on this long endurance,
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:18.380]   Sunday in this case, workout, in that case, add weight.
[00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:19.840]   You can also, as you build up fitness,
[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:22.440]   you can add speed to it, your zone two
[00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:24.000]   and what zone two is won't shift
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.040]   but what work is required from you
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:28.400]   in order to get into zone two will shift.
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:30.000]   That is, as you get more and more fit,
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.340]   you'll have to move faster and or bring more weight
[00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:35.280]   in order to stay in zone two and that will simply tell you
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.760]   that you are indeed improving your endurance.
[00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:39.400]   Okay, so then Monday rolls around
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:43.620]   and I like most everyone else out there, I work on Monday.
[00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:47.220]   I get right into my emails and preparation for podcasts
[00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:49.000]   and running my laboratory, et cetera.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.080]   However, I make sure that at some point on Monday
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:55.820]   and for me, that some point is typically
[00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:59.520]   and ideally early in the morning, so 7 a.m. or so,
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:01.320]   I train my legs on Monday.
[00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:04.240]   So that includes quadriceps, hamstrings and calves.
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:05.840]   Why do I do that workout on Monday
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:07.360]   and what is that workout designed to do?
[00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:10.560]   Well, that workout is really designed to make sure
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:15.140]   that I'm either maintaining or building strength in my legs
[00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:18.120]   and this is not simply for aesthetic reasons.
[00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:20.360]   This is not simply to grow bigger calves
[00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:22.320]   or grow bigger quadriceps and hamstrings,
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:24.360]   although it can accomplish that as well
[00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:25.560]   depending on how you train.
[00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:27.080]   We'll talk about details of training.
[00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:29.160]   The reason for training legs on Monday is several fold.
[00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:32.840]   First of all, they are the largest muscle groups of the body
[00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:35.000]   and by training your legs on Monday,
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.580]   it sets in motion a large number of metabolic processes
[00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:41.520]   that carry you some distance even through the whole week
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:43.840]   in terms of elevating metabolism,
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:47.760]   in terms of amplifying certain hormonal events in your body,
[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:50.880]   et cetera, that are really beneficial.
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:52.680]   In addition to that, I'm of the belief
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:55.220]   that the legs are the foundation of the body
[00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:58.040]   and provided you can train legs safely,
[00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:00.100]   that training legs is vitally important,
[00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:02.440]   not just for strength of the legs,
[00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:04.720]   but also for strength of your entire body.
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:07.020]   Again, some of that is through systemic hormonal effects
[00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:09.280]   because if you're going to train the large muscle groups
[00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:11.260]   of your body under substantial loads,
[00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:13.240]   you will get systemic release of hormones,
[00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:15.720]   not just testosterone, although certainly testosterone,
[00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:18.020]   but also things like growth hormone.
[00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:20.400]   You get increases in all sorts of so-called
[00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:22.360]   anabolic hormones that even if you're somebody
[00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:24.200]   who's not trying to increase muscle size,
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:26.880]   because I realize a lot of people are not trying to do that,
[00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:29.360]   these are hormones that shift your metabolism
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:32.280]   and your overall tendon strength and ligament strength
[00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:33.780]   and overall musculature
[00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:36.920]   into what I would call a strong foundation.
[00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:38.800]   So for me, Monday is leg workout.
[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:41.320]   It also just feels good to get the leg workout
[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:43.220]   out of the way early in the week.
[00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:44.920]   And it accomplishes another goal,
[00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:48.440]   which is that I sometimes will take one or two days
[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:50.860]   off of a leg workout because they can be very intense
[00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:52.520]   and they are large muscle groups.
[00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:54.200]   And I'll explain what I do on the off days,
[00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:55.440]   they're not pure off days,
[00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:57.820]   they actually include some recovery type training
[00:36:57.820 --> 00:36:59.960]   or even some all out training.
[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:02.920]   But by training legs on Monday,
[00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:06.820]   I'm able to get what I consider the hardest strength
[00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:09.100]   and hypertrophy workout out of the way.
[00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:12.000]   And again, set all those positive physiological effects
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.840]   in motion for the entire week.
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:17.120]   The other thing is that no workout exists in isolation.
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:19.600]   What you do one day is going to be determined
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:20.960]   by what you did the previous day.
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:21.960]   And even though the previous day
[00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:24.680]   I may have taken a three hour weight vested hike,
[00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:27.160]   never are my legs so sore from that long,
[00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:30.420]   slow endurance work, because it is long and slow,
[00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:32.320]   then I'm unable to train legs.
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:36.200]   Contrast that with a say high intensity interval training
[00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:38.480]   workout, which comes later in the week.
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:40.060]   And my legs might be sore.
[00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:41.680]   In fact, they might not even be recovered
[00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:44.360]   such that I'm able to do a real leg workout.
[00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:45.480]   And when I say real workout,
[00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:47.300]   I'll describe what that means in a moment.
[00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:48.440]   So legs come on Monday.
[00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:51.000]   And I think that for those of you that are using
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   or interested in using resistance training,
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   I suggest getting your leg workout done early in the week.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.120]   And for those of you that have heard the phrase,
[00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:01.760]   don't skip leg day,
[00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:04.080]   I will go a step further and say, don't skip leg day.
[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:06.080]   In fact, make leg day your first day
[00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:08.620]   of strength and hypertrophy training, put it on Monday.
[00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:10.480]   Okay, so now that we're talking about resistance training,
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:13.040]   the question is going to come up about sets and reps
[00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:14.560]   and all of that business.
[00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:16.360]   That was covered in a lot of detail
[00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:18.120]   on the podcast with Dr. Andy Galpin.
[00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:20.720]   And I'm going to get into some of that detail now,
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:24.140]   but I'm going to wait until I describe
[00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:26.920]   the entire set of workouts for the week
[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:29.180]   before I go into even more detail,
[00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:32.040]   because there's a way of what's called periodizing,
[00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:34.760]   that is changing the sets and reps, et cetera,
[00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:38.320]   across the week and indeed from month to month,
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:39.640]   that's really optimal.
[00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:42.440]   But I don't want to make it seem as if all of that
[00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:44.460]   just pertains to the leg workout.
[00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:47.180]   It actually pertains to all of the resistance training.
[00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:49.760]   So I'll just give you a couple of teasers
[00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:52.560]   about the key principles of resistance training
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:56.040]   that I think are almost universally,
[00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:58.300]   if not universally, then generally accepted
[00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:01.400]   in the strength training and physiology community.
[00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:03.080]   And then later,
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:05.600]   I'll get back to some of the overarching principles
[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:10.040]   that apply to all strength and hypertrophy workouts
[00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:12.040]   across the week, including the ones for the torso,
[00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:13.200]   the arms, et cetera.
[00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:15.680]   Okay, so legs fall on Monday.
[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:17.560]   I should say that leg workouts,
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:21.200]   like all resistance training workouts for me,
[00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:24.520]   consist of about, again, I'm not neurotically attached to this
[00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:26.760]   but about 10 minutes of warming up
[00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:30.960]   and then about 50, five, zero to 60 minutes of real work.
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:32.500]   Now, of course, some of that is going to be rest
[00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:35.920]   between sets, but by real work, I mean really hard work,
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:37.360]   not necessarily to failure,
[00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:38.860]   we'll talk about failure in a little bit,
[00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:41.800]   but hard work where I'm struggling
[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:43.620]   to complete the final repetitions,
[00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:45.120]   if not going to failure
[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:48.000]   to continue to move the weight repetitions.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.200]   And again, the entire work portion of that workout
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:53.180]   is about 50 to 60 minutes.
[00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:54.020]   Why?
[00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:56.220]   Well, past 60 minutes, you start getting increases
[00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:58.020]   in cortisol that really impede recovery.
[00:39:58.020 --> 00:40:02.600]   And I personally am somebody that does not recover very well
[00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:04.600]   from high intensity exercise.
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:07.000]   I realized that within the literature,
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.860]   it is believed and I think generally accepted
[00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:13.960]   that when you stimulate muscle hypertrophy
[00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:18.360]   or strength increases, it impacts the nervous system.
[00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:21.140]   It also causes things like protein synthesis, et cetera.
[00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:22.920]   There are a number of different forms of adaptation
[00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:26.020]   that occur to give you muscle strength and size changes.
[00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:29.560]   And these days, people talk a lot about needing
[00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:32.040]   to stimulate muscle growth or muscle strength
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:33.880]   at least every 48 hours.
[00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:36.560]   But I can tell you that I recover rather slowly
[00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:39.620]   and I benefit from working the same muscle group
[00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:42.880]   about twice per week with longer,
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:47.080]   or I should say more days of rest in between those workouts.
[00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:49.880]   So if I train legs on Monday, believe it or not,
[00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:52.040]   I'm only training legs on Monday.
[00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:55.040]   I do not have a second leg workout during the week.
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:57.520]   However, on Friday,
[00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:00.920]   I do a high intensity interval training session
[00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:02.360]   that serves two purposes.
[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:05.000]   One is it serves the purpose of triggering
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.920]   a certain type of endurance
[00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:09.680]   and getting my heart rate very, very high.
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:10.640]   And in addition to that,
[00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:12.800]   because of the way I do that workout,
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:14.680]   it acts as a sort of supplement
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:17.960]   or a more moderate intensity workout
[00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:21.180]   for quadriceps, hamstrings, and calves,
[00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:23.960]   such that I at least never lose strength
[00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:26.760]   and in fact generally build strength from one leg workout
[00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:29.720]   to the next provided I'm doing things correctly.
[00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:33.680]   So what I'm not referring to is the kind of classic,
[00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:35.880]   super high intensity training once per week
[00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:38.720]   and then not actually training that muscle group again.
[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:40.840]   For me, it's really training each muscle group
[00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:44.920]   twice per week, once directly, and then once indirectly,
[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:47.000]   either during another weight training workout
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.120]   or during a cardiovascular,
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:50.560]   I should say endurance training workout.
[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:51.880]   So again, legs on Monday,
[00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:55.800]   the workout is 50 to 60 minutes after a brief warmup.
[00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:58.920]   I generally pick two exercises per muscle group.
[00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:01.840]   So again, I'm doing calves, I'm doing quadriceps,
[00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:03.280]   and I'm doing hamstrings.
[00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:06.340]   You should pick the exercises that work for you.
[00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:07.880]   So that's why I'm actually not going to share
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:09.020]   which exercises I use.
[00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:11.200]   I'll give you a couple of suggestions about the ones
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:13.360]   I do use, but really exercise selection,
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:15.120]   as Dr. Andy Galpin pointed out,
[00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:17.320]   is a very important variable.
[00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:19.580]   And the key thing to emphasize for that variable
[00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:22.220]   is that you need to be able to perform the movement safely.
[00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:24.180]   So I know there's a huge debate out there
[00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:25.920]   and people love to argue about whether or not
[00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:28.760]   one can squat or deadlift for long periods of time
[00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:29.880]   or should or should not.
[00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:31.540]   Some people say you absolutely should.
[00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:34.860]   I personally do not squat and do not deadlift.
[00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:38.300]   I've actually never done much squatting or deadlifting.
[00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:39.160]   And I know some people out there
[00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:40.360]   are probably rolling their eyes
[00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:42.320]   or switching the channel at this point,
[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:45.840]   but I can say that for me,
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:50.040]   I've been able to achieve the strength and hypertrophy goals
[00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:53.680]   that I've been seeking doing things like leg extensions
[00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:55.520]   and hack squats, or for hamstrings,
[00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:57.480]   doing things like leg curls and glute ham raises,
[00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:59.920]   or for calves doing standing and seated calf raises,
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:00.960]   and so on.
[00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:03.480]   I think a key principle that everyone should pay attention
[00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:05.380]   to is one that was taught to me
[00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:08.240]   by an excellent strength coach,
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:09.800]   years ago, and I still use this,
[00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:11.400]   and at least it works for me.
[00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:12.780]   For each muscle group,
[00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:16.160]   try and find an exercise in which you get that muscle
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:18.480]   into a weighted stretch position.
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:20.920]   So this would be, for instance, the standing calf raise,
[00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:22.540]   down at the bottom, it's weighted,
[00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:23.920]   and you're in a deep stretch
[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:26.600]   provided you're doing the movement correctly,
[00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:29.000]   as well as another exercise
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:30.820]   where you're getting contraction
[00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:32.520]   in the shortened position of the muscle.
[00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:34.640]   So for the hamstrings, that would be the leg curl.
[00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:37.640]   For the calves, it would be a seated calf raise.
[00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:42.000]   Or for the quadriceps, the leg extension is,
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.480]   if the machine is designed right
[00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:44.760]   and you're doing it correctly,
[00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:46.680]   the peak contraction is largely going to occur
[00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:49.120]   at the leg's extended position.
[00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:51.880]   But then another exercise for each muscle group
[00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:54.600]   that puts the muscle into more of a stretched
[00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:58.120]   or at least a larger range of motion
[00:43:58.120 --> 00:43:59.660]   or compound-type movement,
[00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:01.600]   but ideally where there's some stretch there.
[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:04.320]   So I guess I will tell you what exercise I do.
[00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:05.140]   For the quadriceps,
[00:44:05.140 --> 00:44:06.840]   it's going to be leg extensions and hack squats.
[00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:09.320]   I use hack squats because I don't do free bar squats
[00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:11.800]   for safety reasons, and I like the hack squat machine.
[00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:15.800]   I'll do leg curls and glute ham raises for hamstrings,
[00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:17.300]   and I'll do standing calf raises
[00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:18.720]   and seated calf raises for the calves.
[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:20.500]   Again, those are the movements that I use
[00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:23.680]   because I can perform them safely in the repetition ranges
[00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:25.720]   and with the weights that are required for me
[00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:28.820]   to either maintain or build leg strength and calf strength.
[00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:30.920]   But you might decide that for you,
[00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:33.300]   deadlifts are absolutely essential and terrific,
[00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:36.480]   or squats, free bar squats are absolutely terrific,
[00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:38.560]   or front squats.
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:41.360]   I'm not here to tell you which exercises to do or not do.
[00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:44.160]   I am telling you that it's probably wise
[00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:48.760]   to at least consider doing at least two exercises
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:52.160]   per muscle group, probably three maximum if you ask me,
[00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:54.560]   if you're doing your entire legs and calves in one day,
[00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:56.280]   but to think about doing one exercise
[00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:57.240]   where the muscle is brought
[00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:59.600]   into that shortened peak contraction position,
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:01.800]   like leg curls or leg extensions or seated calf raise,
[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:04.000]   and then another exercise for each muscle group
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.720]   where there's more of an elongation
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:08.000]   and maybe even a stretch on the muscle group.
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:08.960]   In fact, that's a principle
[00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:10.440]   that you'll hear me talk about later
[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:12.900]   when I talk about training other muscle groups
[00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:14.400]   for strength and hypertrophy.
[00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:17.340]   So now you know approximately how long to train.
[00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:19.240]   You might be somebody who can get away with training
[00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:22.600]   for an hour and a half, and that won't impede your recovery.
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:25.000]   For me, that really starts to impede my recovery.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.160]   Also, if I'm staying on task,
[00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:29.960]   that 60-minute limit really works well for me.
[00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:32.880]   Do I occasionally train for 75 minutes?
[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:35.040]   Yes, because if I'm waiting for a piece of equipment,
[00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:37.760]   sometimes I have to just wait longer, so that happens,
[00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:39.820]   but I really try and keep the total duration
[00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:41.600]   of the workout shorter.
[00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:43.440]   How many sets and reps and rest intervals?
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:45.800]   Well, that was covered by Dr. Andy Galpin as well.
[00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:47.760]   Without getting into the total science,
[00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:52.400]   here's a brief summary of how to structure that.
[00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:54.600]   It's pretty clear that if you're going
[00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:59.600]   to do lower repetitions and heavier weights,
[00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:03.400]   that you're going to want to do a bit more volume.
[00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:05.080]   I know that this spits in the face
[00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:06.380]   of what a lot of people think,
[00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:08.840]   but so if you're going to do five sets of five,
[00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:12.440]   I would consider five repetitions low repetition range,
[00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:15.200]   heavier weight, and if you're going to train
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:17.560]   with higher repetitions, you can do fewer sets.
[00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:19.660]   That certainly works for me.
[00:46:19.660 --> 00:46:23.800]   I generally follow a program where for about a month,
[00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:27.460]   so three to four weeks, I will do all my resistance training
[00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:31.680]   in the repetition range of about four to eight repetitions,
[00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:34.800]   so that's rather heavy, a few more sets,
[00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:39.800]   so it might be anywhere from three to four sets per exercise,
[00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:41.360]   again, still just two exercises,
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:43.380]   and longer rest between sets,
[00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:46.580]   anywhere from two minutes to maybe even four minutes
[00:46:46.580 --> 00:46:48.680]   if it's really heavy legwork,
[00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:52.200]   and then for the next month, switch to repetition range
[00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:55.020]   that's closer to eight to 12,
[00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:57.680]   maybe even 15 repetitions per set,
[00:46:57.680 --> 00:46:59.860]   but do fewer sets overall,
[00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:01.940]   so maybe just two to three sets per exercise,
[00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:05.240]   again, just two exercises per muscle group typically,
[00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:08.320]   and shorten the rest between sets
[00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:10.540]   so that it's more in the 90 second,
[00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:13.260]   maybe even as short as 60 seconds rest between sets,
[00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:15.900]   but typically 90 seconds to about two minutes
[00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:16.940]   or two and a half minutes,
[00:47:16.940 --> 00:47:19.180]   so basically it's one month heavier,
[00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:21.040]   the next month slightly lighter,
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:22.200]   although I wouldn't say light,
[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:26.060]   I would say moderate weight and moderate rep range.
[00:47:26.060 --> 00:47:28.080]   That tends to work well for me.
[00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:31.000]   It also adheres to a principle that came up
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.520]   during the discussion, again, with Dr. Andy Galpin,
[00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:34.540]   that for hypertrophy,
[00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:36.120]   you really can use repetition ranges
[00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:39.760]   anywhere from five to 30, three zero reps,
[00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:42.880]   but he emphasized changing the repetition ranges
[00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:44.820]   in order to offset boredom.
[00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:46.520]   Frankly, I like to train heavier.
[00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:48.540]   I enjoy training in the four to eight rep range.
[00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:50.360]   However, I noticed that if I do that
[00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:51.800]   for more than four weeks in a row
[00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:54.840]   and I don't switch over to training in the eight to 12,
[00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:57.360]   maybe in 15 repetition range for about a month,
[00:47:57.360 --> 00:47:59.240]   well, then I can't make continuous progress.
[00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:00.920]   I start to actually lose ground,
[00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:03.120]   but by switching back and forth,
[00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:05.680]   I actually can make continuous progress
[00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:07.540]   at least across the year.
[00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:09.440]   So I hope that that principle,
[00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:12.520]   or I should say that protocol was communicated clearly.
[00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:15.140]   It works very well, I assure you.
[00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:18.300]   Does that mean that I never get 10 repetitions on a week
[00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:20.100]   when I'm supposed to train
[00:48:20.100 --> 00:48:21.480]   in the four to eight repetition range?
[00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:22.840]   No, occasionally I'll venture up
[00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:24.880]   into the 10 repetition range,
[00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:28.200]   but I really try and cluster the low repetition work
[00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:30.440]   for about a month, again, across all workouts
[00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:33.080]   and all exercises and the slightly higher,
[00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:34.800]   I would even say moderate repetition work
[00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:36.600]   across to the next month.
[00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:37.880]   One thing that you'll notice
[00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:40.160]   since we are talking about total fitness programming
[00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:41.520]   is that during the month
[00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:45.040]   where you are doing moderate repetitions,
[00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:47.400]   you'll notice that your endurance work
[00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:49.940]   will actually be facilitated.
[00:48:49.940 --> 00:48:52.080]   And I do not think that's a coincidence.
[00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:53.440]   In fact, it's not a coincidence.
[00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:55.900]   It's because when you are training very heavy
[00:48:55.900 --> 00:48:59.180]   or in the heavier range, lower repetitions, et cetera,
[00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:01.520]   you're tapping into different processes in those muscles.
[00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:03.400]   So when you head out for that long Sunday hike,
[00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:05.160]   or as you'll soon hear,
[00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:06.560]   whereas on Friday you're going to do
[00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:08.500]   high-intensity interval training,
[00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:10.860]   what you'll notice is during certain months
[00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:12.820]   of weight training, when you're training more heavy,
[00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:16.880]   those workouts will feel, literally will feel different
[00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:18.200]   than they will during the months
[00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:20.360]   when you're doing moderate repetition work.
[00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:23.200]   I am not a competitive athlete.
[00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:26.440]   I'm not running races or triathlons like some of my friends.
[00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:27.660]   I'm very impressed by them.
[00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:29.120]   I'm really just trying to get
[00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:32.040]   overall cardiovascular fitness, overall strength,
[00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:34.400]   overall hypertrophy where I need it,
[00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:36.480]   maintain muscle size, et cetera,
[00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:38.320]   in muscle groups where I'm just trying to maintain.
[00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:39.800]   That's really my goal.
[00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:42.620]   So I'm not trying to optimize any of these workouts
[00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:44.740]   for any one performance feature,
[00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:45.580]   but in a little bit,
[00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:50.140]   we'll talk about how you can change various aspects,
[00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:51.580]   that is variables of this protocols,
[00:49:51.580 --> 00:49:54.520]   in order to say, for instance, really emphasize hypertrophy
[00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:56.640]   or really emphasize endurance.
[00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:57.880]   Okay, so with what I would call
[00:49:57.880 --> 00:50:00.260]   a standard endurance workout done on Sunday,
[00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:01.620]   and I say standard because most people,
[00:50:01.620 --> 00:50:02.460]   when they hear endurance,
[00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:04.240]   they think of the ability to endure,
[00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:07.860]   to continue in a repeated movement or exercise
[00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:09.100]   over some period of time.
[00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:10.900]   With that workout done on Sunday,
[00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:13.780]   and then with the leg workout done on Monday,
[00:50:13.780 --> 00:50:14.620]   you can feel really good
[00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:16.380]   about how you're heading into the week.
[00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:19.860]   However, after training legs on Monday,
[00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:24.300]   I experienced that doing cardiovascular workouts the next day
[00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:28.580]   is either inefficient or at least doesn't really allow me
[00:50:28.580 --> 00:50:30.700]   to completely recover from my leg workout.
[00:50:30.700 --> 00:50:31.540]   Now I realize that some people
[00:50:31.540 --> 00:50:33.340]   are going to immediately scoff at that.
[00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:36.920]   And in fact, there are really beautiful papers out there
[00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:40.380]   talking about how one can actually do a fair amount
[00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:41.620]   of cardiovascular exercise
[00:50:41.620 --> 00:50:44.180]   without interfering with their strength
[00:50:44.180 --> 00:50:49.180]   and speed and hypertrophy improvements and vice versa.
[00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:51.620]   In fact, there's a terrific review that was mentioned
[00:50:51.620 --> 00:50:53.680]   on the podcast with Dr. Andy Galpin.
[00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:56.960]   This is a review that will provide a citation to,
[00:50:56.960 --> 00:50:58.800]   and a reference and a link to,
[00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:01.360]   which is the review by Murak and Bagley,
[00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:03.640]   which talks about whether or not there's interference
[00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:05.500]   between strength and endurance workouts.
[00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:08.460]   Really interesting review if you want to peruse that.
[00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:11.100]   But with all that said, I like to take Tuesday
[00:51:11.100 --> 00:51:14.200]   as a no endurance, no resistance training day.
[00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:17.620]   But that doesn't mean that I'm not doing anything
[00:51:17.620 --> 00:51:20.240]   for my overall health and fitness.
[00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:25.240]   On Tuesdays, I do a series of heat cold contrast.
[00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:28.180]   In other words, I get really, really warm
[00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:29.420]   and then I get really, really cold.
[00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:30.320]   I get really, really warm
[00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:32.420]   and I get really, really cold repeatedly.
[00:51:32.420 --> 00:51:36.260]   And the way I do that is by getting into a hot sauna.
[00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:37.700]   So for me, that's really hot,
[00:51:37.700 --> 00:51:39.260]   but I've built up my heat conditioning.
[00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:42.160]   So please don't do this unless you've built up your ability
[00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:43.340]   to withstand heat.
[00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:45.820]   And I'll get in for about 20 minutes,
[00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:47.920]   sometimes 15, but usually 20 minutes.
[00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:50.740]   Then I get out and then I will get into an ice bath
[00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:52.580]   or a cold water bath
[00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:56.320]   that's about 45 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit.
[00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:59.280]   Again, don't get into water that's so cold
[00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:00.580]   that you go into shock.
[00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:04.980]   I'll explain what a good cold stimulus could be for you
[00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:06.340]   and how to determine that.
[00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:10.060]   Or if I don't have access to my sauna and my ice bath,
[00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:14.220]   what I can do if I'm traveling is I will take a hot bath
[00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:15.820]   and then alternate with cold shower,
[00:52:15.820 --> 00:52:17.580]   hot bath, cold shower.
[00:52:17.580 --> 00:52:19.700]   It's hard to do hot bath, ice bath,
[00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:20.620]   unless you have two baths.
[00:52:20.620 --> 00:52:21.780]   I don't know any hotel rooms,
[00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:23.380]   at least I've never stayed in one that has two baths,
[00:52:23.380 --> 00:52:25.020]   although I'm sure they're out there.
[00:52:25.020 --> 00:52:28.780]   But for me, this is heat, cold, contrast.
[00:52:28.780 --> 00:52:31.540]   And really what this day is about is two things.
[00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:34.020]   First of all, I'm trying to accelerate recovery
[00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:36.140]   from the leg workout I did previously.
[00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:38.920]   Also, if you listen to our episode
[00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:41.660]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast about deliberate heat exposure,
[00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:44.180]   or you listen to our episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast
[00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:46.580]   about deliberate cold exposure,
[00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:49.940]   I talk about some of the benefits of heat and cold.
[00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:51.780]   And I get into a lot of details about
[00:52:51.780 --> 00:52:52.780]   how you can access heat.
[00:52:52.780 --> 00:52:54.540]   You can do baths, you can do saunas,
[00:52:54.540 --> 00:52:56.100]   you can even take hot showers.
[00:52:56.100 --> 00:52:57.460]   If you don't have access to any of that,
[00:52:57.460 --> 00:52:59.860]   you could even wrap your body from the neck down
[00:52:59.860 --> 00:53:02.080]   in garbage bag, plastic garbage bags.
[00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:03.480]   Believe it or not, wrestlers used to do this.
[00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:05.980]   Put on some sweats and go running, that'll get you warm.
[00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:08.100]   Again, be careful not to overheat.
[00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:10.120]   And then you can get into a cold shower.
[00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:12.020]   So there's a lot of ways depending on your budget
[00:53:12.020 --> 00:53:13.860]   and what you have access to.
[00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:16.520]   I don't use cryo, these cryotherapy chambers.
[00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:18.580]   They're hard to find, they're expensive.
[00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:20.300]   Again, I use sauna and ice bath,
[00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:23.420]   and I will do anywhere from three to five rounds,
[00:53:23.420 --> 00:53:24.260]   which is a lot.
[00:53:24.260 --> 00:53:26.460]   Anywhere from three to five rounds of heat
[00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:29.740]   for about 20 minutes and cold for about five minutes.
[00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:31.240]   How cold should the cold be?
[00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:34.180]   We covered this in the episode on deliberate cold exposure.
[00:53:34.180 --> 00:53:35.760]   Here's a general rule of thumb.
[00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:39.660]   It should be cold enough that you really want to get out,
[00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:41.820]   but not so cold that it's unsafe.
[00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:43.660]   And that will vary from person to person.
[00:53:43.660 --> 00:53:46.220]   So I cannot give you a simple prescriptive there.
[00:53:46.220 --> 00:53:47.260]   Same thing with the heat.
[00:53:47.260 --> 00:53:49.900]   Hot enough that you're sweating and that you want to get out,
[00:53:49.900 --> 00:53:51.860]   but not so hot that you're running the risk
[00:53:51.860 --> 00:53:54.500]   of injuring yourself or killing yourself.
[00:53:54.500 --> 00:53:56.300]   And again, that will vary from person to person.
[00:53:56.300 --> 00:53:58.300]   So you have to build up slowly, be careful,
[00:53:58.300 --> 00:53:59.980]   and build up empirically.
[00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:01.500]   I do that on Tuesdays, again,
[00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:02.820]   as a way to accelerate recovery.
[00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:04.180]   And because it's very clear
[00:54:04.180 --> 00:54:05.780]   that there are cardiovascular benefits,
[00:54:05.780 --> 00:54:08.960]   maybe even benefits for the brain
[00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:10.780]   related to the cardiovascular benefits,
[00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:13.180]   because of course the brain needs a lot of blood flow
[00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:15.940]   and needs a lot of nutrients and other things
[00:54:15.940 --> 00:54:17.580]   flowing into and out of there,
[00:54:17.580 --> 00:54:20.420]   debris out and nutrients and other things into the brain.
[00:54:20.420 --> 00:54:25.060]   Heat can help accelerate that or improve that.
[00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:27.140]   And so I'm doing that to improve cardiovascular function,
[00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:28.780]   improve brain health.
[00:54:28.780 --> 00:54:32.960]   And then the cold contrast provides a sort of accelerator
[00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:34.300]   on that or an amplifier,
[00:54:34.300 --> 00:54:35.800]   I think is the better way to phrase it,
[00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:36.860]   on that process.
[00:54:36.860 --> 00:54:38.980]   Because in the cold, you get vasoconstriction.
[00:54:38.980 --> 00:54:40.660]   And then in the heat, you get vasodilation.
[00:54:40.660 --> 00:54:42.260]   And so you're maximizing that process,
[00:54:42.260 --> 00:54:44.760]   which is actually a neural process.
[00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:47.700]   Nerves actually innervate the blood vessels and capillaries
[00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:50.380]   and even the arteries in order to allow that constriction
[00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:52.420]   and dilation process to occur.
[00:54:52.420 --> 00:54:54.480]   So Tuesday is really about recovery,
[00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:57.920]   but my recovery day isn't necessarily about
[00:54:57.920 --> 00:55:00.160]   just laying around and not doing anything.
[00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:02.260]   I might still also take some walks that day.
[00:55:02.260 --> 00:55:04.120]   Remember, I want to try and get that 200 minutes
[00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:06.000]   of zone two cardio across the week.
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.260]   And sometimes, not often,
[00:55:08.260 --> 00:55:10.920]   but sometimes I'll get in a few minutes or more
[00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:12.620]   of walking quickly that day.
[00:55:12.620 --> 00:55:14.580]   But generally, I'm working a lot on Tuesday,
[00:55:14.580 --> 00:55:15.940]   as I do on Monday.
[00:55:15.940 --> 00:55:17.300]   And I'm a little bit tired
[00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:19.620]   or maybe even a little bit sore from my leg workout
[00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:20.680]   the previous day, Monday.
[00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:23.180]   So I try and get that hot cold contrast.
[00:55:23.180 --> 00:55:25.720]   There are other benefits to hot and cold contrast.
[00:55:25.720 --> 00:55:29.660]   We have a description of the different protocols for hot
[00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:31.620]   and for cold and their contrast
[00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:33.100]   at our Huberman Lab newsletter.
[00:55:33.100 --> 00:55:35.220]   You can find that by going to hubermanlab.com,
[00:55:35.220 --> 00:55:37.020]   go to the newsletter tab under the menu,
[00:55:37.020 --> 00:55:37.860]   and you can sign up.
[00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:40.460]   You can actually download those protocols very easily
[00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:41.340]   without even signing up
[00:55:41.340 --> 00:55:43.700]   if you just want to access them straight off.
[00:55:43.700 --> 00:55:45.040]   So Tuesday is really about recovery
[00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:47.720]   and about getting some additional cardiovascular benefits
[00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:49.100]   from heat cold contrast.
[00:55:49.100 --> 00:55:51.100]   One other thing that's built into the rationale
[00:55:51.100 --> 00:55:53.460]   for doing a lot of heat and cold on one day
[00:55:53.460 --> 00:55:55.060]   as opposed to doing it every day.
[00:55:55.060 --> 00:55:57.060]   Well, in addition to it being a little bit more convenient,
[00:55:57.060 --> 00:55:59.260]   because certainly some people don't have access
[00:55:59.260 --> 00:56:03.580]   to heat and cold, sauna and cold dunks, et cetera, every day.
[00:56:03.580 --> 00:56:05.660]   So maybe getting to do that one day
[00:56:05.660 --> 00:56:07.540]   is more accessible or feasible.
[00:56:07.540 --> 00:56:08.580]   But in addition to that,
[00:56:08.580 --> 00:56:12.100]   it's very clear that while there are benefits
[00:56:12.100 --> 00:56:14.100]   to doing sauna often,
[00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:16.000]   and we talked about this in the Deliberate Heat episode
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.040]   and the episode with Dr. Rhonda Patrick
[00:56:18.040 --> 00:56:20.740]   when she was a guest on this podcast,
[00:56:20.740 --> 00:56:23.460]   it's also clear that if you do sauna seldom,
[00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:26.740]   that is once a week, but you do a lot of it on one day.
[00:56:26.740 --> 00:56:28.380]   So in this case, it's an hour.
[00:56:28.380 --> 00:56:30.540]   If it's, remember it's, or more,
[00:56:30.540 --> 00:56:32.740]   it's three to five rounds of 20 minutes of sauna
[00:56:32.740 --> 00:56:36.020]   followed by about five minutes of cold or so.
[00:56:36.020 --> 00:56:38.100]   By doing that all on one day,
[00:56:38.100 --> 00:56:39.840]   the peer reviewed research that's covered
[00:56:39.840 --> 00:56:42.060]   in the episode on Deliberate Heat,
[00:56:42.060 --> 00:56:43.740]   this is a study out of Finland,
[00:56:43.740 --> 00:56:45.220]   showed that you get massive,
[00:56:45.220 --> 00:56:47.560]   even 16 fold increases in growth hormone,
[00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:48.780]   which are extremely beneficial
[00:56:48.780 --> 00:56:50.980]   for metabolism and for recovery.
[00:56:50.980 --> 00:56:53.000]   So these massive increases in growth hormone
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:56.020]   are seen when you are doing these sessions of sauna
[00:56:56.020 --> 00:56:58.180]   that are repeated on the same day,
[00:56:58.180 --> 00:57:00.180]   and you're only doing that about once a week.
[00:57:00.180 --> 00:57:01.800]   Whereas if you do sauna more often,
[00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:03.620]   there are certainly benefits to that,
[00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:07.360]   but it's time consuming and you need access to sauna
[00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:08.560]   more often than one day a week,
[00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:10.300]   if you're doing it more than one day a week.
[00:57:10.300 --> 00:57:11.440]   But if you do it one day a week
[00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:14.160]   and you're doing a lot of sessions within that day,
[00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:15.780]   as I've detailed here,
[00:57:15.780 --> 00:57:18.180]   you see these massive increases in growth hormone
[00:57:18.180 --> 00:57:20.900]   that are not observed if you're doing sauna more often
[00:57:20.900 --> 00:57:22.840]   for the other benefits of sauna.
[00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:24.560]   Now, the effects of cold are many,
[00:57:24.560 --> 00:57:26.700]   it's not just vasoconstriction,
[00:57:26.700 --> 00:57:29.680]   but the effects of cold are also counterbalanced
[00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:32.880]   by some of the problems with deliberate cold exposure
[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:35.200]   that maybe you've heard about on this podcast
[00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:36.260]   and a lot of other podcasts
[00:57:36.260 --> 00:57:40.140]   and seem to be a kind of a buzz theme
[00:57:40.140 --> 00:57:41.700]   on Twitter and elsewhere.
[00:57:41.700 --> 00:57:42.600]   And the point is this,
[00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:44.660]   there are a number of quality studies showing
[00:57:44.660 --> 00:57:46.560]   that if you do deliberate cold exposure,
[00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:49.440]   in particular ice baths or getting into very cold water,
[00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:53.100]   immediately after an endurance training session
[00:57:53.100 --> 00:57:56.480]   or a strength and hypertrophy session,
[00:57:56.480 --> 00:57:59.980]   it can indeed, yes, it can disrupt
[00:57:59.980 --> 00:58:03.180]   or prevent some of the adaptations that you are seeking
[00:58:03.180 --> 00:58:06.180]   with strength and hypertrophy and endurance workouts.
[00:58:06.180 --> 00:58:07.840]   Okay, so you heard that right,
[00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:10.160]   and I believe that to be true
[00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:13.300]   based on now several quality peer reviewed studies.
[00:58:13.300 --> 00:58:15.660]   So by doing your deliberate cold exposure on Tuesday,
[00:58:15.660 --> 00:58:18.400]   you're not going to get those effects
[00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:21.560]   that is the blocking of hypertrophy
[00:58:21.560 --> 00:58:23.320]   or the blocking of strength improvement
[00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:26.600]   or the blocking or prevention of improvements in endurance
[00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:29.120]   that would occur if you immediately got into the ice bath
[00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:32.320]   after a hypertrophy strength or endurance workout.
[00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:35.140]   Now, the caveat to that is if you are somebody
[00:58:35.140 --> 00:58:36.940]   who likes to do cold showers,
[00:58:36.940 --> 00:58:39.800]   I am not aware of any data that says
[00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:42.460]   that cold showers cannot be performed
[00:58:42.460 --> 00:58:45.740]   after a strength hypertrophy or endurance workout.
[00:58:45.740 --> 00:58:50.260]   Cold showers are different than submersion up to the neck
[00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:52.860]   in an ice bath or another cold body of water
[00:58:52.860 --> 00:58:54.020]   for a number of different reasons.
[00:58:54.020 --> 00:58:56.860]   In fact, they tap into different aspects
[00:58:56.860 --> 00:58:58.220]   of the nervous system entirely.
[00:58:58.220 --> 00:58:59.420]   We don't have time to go into that now.
[00:58:59.420 --> 00:59:01.940]   It's covered in the episode on deliberate cold exposure.
[00:59:01.940 --> 00:59:04.780]   But the simple point is by doing your heat
[00:59:04.780 --> 00:59:07.520]   and cold contrast, or, hey, listen,
[00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:09.060]   if you're somebody who doesn't have access to sauna
[00:59:09.060 --> 00:59:09.900]   or you don't like hot baths
[00:59:09.900 --> 00:59:13.480]   and you just do some deliberate cold exposure on Tuesday,
[00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:15.420]   you are doing that separate from your strength
[00:59:15.420 --> 00:59:17.180]   and hypertrophy and endurance workouts
[00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:21.180]   such that it will not impede the benefits of those workouts.
[00:59:21.180 --> 00:59:23.380]   Okay, so long endurance on Sunday,
[00:59:23.380 --> 00:59:25.380]   leg resistance training on Monday,
[00:59:25.380 --> 00:59:28.180]   and on Tuesday, heat cold contrast.
[00:59:28.180 --> 00:59:29.820]   That brings us to Wednesday.
[00:59:29.820 --> 00:59:32.120]   And on Wednesday, we get back
[00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:34.580]   to a resistance training workout.
[00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:36.580]   And the resistance training workout
[00:59:36.580 --> 00:59:38.940]   that I emphasize on Wednesday
[00:59:38.940 --> 00:59:41.420]   is one in which you train your torso.
[00:59:41.420 --> 00:59:42.600]   Yes, literally your torso.
[00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:45.660]   I know this is counter to the so-called bro science
[00:59:45.660 --> 00:59:46.580]   of bro splits.
[00:59:46.580 --> 00:59:48.180]   I don't know who originated that term.
[00:59:48.180 --> 00:59:49.240]   It's a terrible term.
[00:59:49.240 --> 00:59:53.260]   It essentially alienates anyone who's not a bro
[00:59:53.260 --> 00:59:55.140]   or considers themselves a bro.
[00:59:55.140 --> 00:59:58.480]   But in any case, this is not about training chest
[00:59:58.480 --> 00:59:59.620]   or back or shoulders.
[00:59:59.620 --> 01:00:02.340]   In fact, it's really about strengthening
[01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:03.980]   the muscles of the torso.
[01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:05.660]   And of course includes the chest
[01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:07.260]   and the shoulders and the back.
[01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:08.700]   And I'm sure as I say this,
[01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:10.180]   a number of people out there who are obsessed
[01:00:10.180 --> 01:00:11.620]   with hypertrophy and muscle growth
[01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:14.700]   and filling out their shirts or whatever it may be,
[01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:15.800]   are thinking, oh no,
[01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:17.820]   this is just kind of all around fitness.
[01:00:17.820 --> 01:00:20.780]   But no, the point is on Wednesday,
[01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:22.900]   you train your torso
[01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:24.780]   and that's going to involve some pushing.
[01:00:24.780 --> 01:00:26.480]   So that's good for you.
[01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:29.740]   That might include some training of things like bench presses
[01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:30.620]   or incline presses,
[01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:33.140]   as well as shoulder presses or lateral raises,
[01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:34.840]   things for the shoulders, as well as for the back.
[01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:36.200]   Some pulling exercises.
[01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:38.580]   These could be bent over rows or chin ups or pull ups.
[01:00:38.580 --> 01:00:40.780]   Again, there are enormous number of exercise
[01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:43.300]   for each and every one of these muscle groups.
[01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:45.380]   Now, I believe there's a clear benefit
[01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:47.460]   to training all these muscle groups together
[01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:48.980]   on the same day.
[01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:51.220]   Because much in the same way that training legs
[01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:53.660]   all on one day can lead to these systemic effects
[01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:55.260]   because they're large muscle groups
[01:00:55.260 --> 01:00:56.460]   working both the pushing muscles
[01:00:56.460 --> 01:00:58.640]   and the pulling muscles of the torso on one day,
[01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:00.160]   at least in the context of this program,
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:01.780]   is very time efficient
[01:01:01.780 --> 01:01:03.740]   and tends to wick out
[01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:06.180]   into a number of different dimensions of health
[01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:07.380]   that at least I'm interested in
[01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:09.000]   and I think a lot of other people are interested in.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:09.840]   What are those?
[01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:10.660]   Well, let's think again.
[01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:14.000]   I want to be strong in not just my legs, but my upper body.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.540]   I also may want to engage some hypertrophy,
[01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:19.980]   to grow certain muscle groups
[01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:21.540]   in order to create a sense of balance.
[01:01:21.540 --> 01:01:22.660]   That could be for aesthetic reasons,
[01:01:22.660 --> 01:01:24.780]   but also for balancing strength and for health
[01:01:24.780 --> 01:01:26.960]   and the integrity of the joints, et cetera.
[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:28.580]   And in addition to that,
[01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:31.360]   by training a bunch of different muscle groups together,
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:32.540]   you have the opportunity
[01:01:32.540 --> 01:01:35.360]   to get the more systemic hormonal effects
[01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:37.760]   and metabolic effects that occur
[01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:39.500]   when you're not just training one muscle group
[01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:40.900]   and isolating that one muscle group,
[01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:43.620]   but rather training a bunch of muscle groups together.
[01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:45.220]   So Wednesday, I train torso
[01:01:45.220 --> 01:01:46.680]   and I do that in push-pull fashion
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:50.040]   just for kind of time efficiency.
[01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:52.180]   Sometimes that means doing a pushing exercise
[01:01:52.180 --> 01:01:53.600]   and then a pulling exercise.
[01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:55.840]   Sometimes it might even mean doing a set of pushing
[01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:57.660]   and then a set of pulling and going back and forth.
[01:01:57.660 --> 01:02:01.280]   However, if you're in a gym, in a particular crowded gym,
[01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:02.380]   please don't be one of those people
[01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:04.580]   that colonizes multiple pieces of equipment
[01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:06.260]   and says, "I'm working there, I'm working there."
[01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:07.580]   And that can be quite a dance
[01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:10.080]   and it can be hard to orchestrate a workout like that.
[01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:12.300]   So sometimes it will be starting off
[01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:13.760]   with a set of shoulder presses
[01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:16.060]   and then doing all your sets of those
[01:02:16.060 --> 01:02:17.700]   and then moving to your chin ups
[01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:20.220]   and then moving perhaps back to shoulders
[01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:22.560]   and realizing, ah, oh, someone's on the machine
[01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:24.420]   that I wanted or using the equipment that I wanted,
[01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:25.720]   so I'll just finish up the pulling,
[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:27.900]   I'll finish up the back work and then going to the push.
[01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:30.220]   I don't obsess over the alternation
[01:02:30.220 --> 01:02:31.600]   in any kind of strict way.
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:33.900]   I really just try and get the muscles of the torso trained.
[01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:36.380]   And again, it's two exercises per muscle group.
[01:02:36.380 --> 01:02:38.980]   And one of those exercises is going to be something
[01:02:38.980 --> 01:02:41.280]   where there's, I realize this isn't
[01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:43.880]   physiologically accurate, but a shortening of the muscle
[01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:47.060]   or where they, at the end of the movement,
[01:02:47.060 --> 01:02:50.060]   the muscle is under maximal contraction.
[01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:51.700]   I could throw out some names of exercises
[01:02:51.700 --> 01:02:53.460]   just for purpose of understanding.
[01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:57.200]   So this would be like cable crossovers for the chest,
[01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:00.000]   the peak contraction is at the end.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.760]   Whereas something like an incline press,
[01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:03.340]   there's more of a stretch provided it's done
[01:03:03.340 --> 01:03:06.060]   over a full range of motion at the beginning of the movement.
[01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:07.360]   So again, something where there's a stretch
[01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:08.820]   and something where there's a peak contraction.
[01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:10.640]   For the shoulders, it's a little bit harder to do,
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:11.700]   although there are ways to do that.
[01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:14.200]   And Jeff Cavaliere has excellent workouts
[01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:16.300]   available at zero cost on YouTube.
[01:03:16.300 --> 01:03:19.580]   He also has excellent programs on his athleanx.com site,
[01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:22.640]   but certainly has a lot of excellent protocols
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:24.200]   on his YouTube and Instagram.
[01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:27.420]   But on YouTube, you can put in his name
[01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:29.800]   and any muscle group that you want to train.
[01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:34.180]   He has some terrific videos describing exercise choice
[01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:36.320]   and other features of exercise parameters.
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:40.320]   Again, a peak contraction or shortening
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:42.060]   of the muscle peak contraction exercise
[01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:43.260]   and a stretching exercise.
[01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:46.320]   And so for the back, one might say, okay,
[01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:50.420]   I seated row or a bent over row or a dumbbell row
[01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:52.280]   where the elbow is brought behind the torso
[01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:54.100]   for a peak contraction movement.
[01:03:54.100 --> 01:03:56.140]   And then for more of a stretching movement,
[01:03:56.140 --> 01:03:58.820]   might be something like a chin up or a pull up.
[01:03:58.820 --> 01:04:02.240]   And as I say this, I understand that stretching
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:04.780]   and peak contraction aren't the exact terms
[01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:07.460]   that one would use if they were a physiotherapist
[01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:08.620]   or a strength and conditioning coach.
[01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:10.460]   But I think for the typical person
[01:04:10.460 --> 01:04:12.940]   who's trying to generate strength and hypertrophy
[01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:15.380]   in those muscles or maintain strength and hypertrophy
[01:04:15.380 --> 01:04:17.660]   in those muscles, this kind of nomenclature way
[01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:20.500]   of describing it at least should be clear
[01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:21.860]   and even efficient.
[01:04:21.860 --> 01:04:25.380]   And just to remind you, as with the leg workout,
[01:04:25.380 --> 01:04:27.420]   the total duration of the torso workout
[01:04:27.420 --> 01:04:31.420]   is going to be 50 to 60 minutes after a brief warmup.
[01:04:31.420 --> 01:04:34.920]   The sets and repetitions are going to be dictated
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:36.440]   in the same way that I described earlier.
[01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:40.580]   So for about a month, it's going to be more sets.
[01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:42.340]   So anywhere from three to five sets
[01:04:42.340 --> 01:04:46.140]   in the lower repetition range, so four to eight repetitions.
[01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:48.580]   So that's going to be heavier weights and longer rest
[01:04:48.580 --> 01:04:50.500]   as I described earlier, the rest intervals.
[01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:51.580]   And then for the next month,
[01:04:51.580 --> 01:04:55.020]   it's going to be moderate repetitions, fewer sets,
[01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:56.540]   the same way I described earlier.
[01:04:56.540 --> 01:04:58.780]   And if you want more details on all of that,
[01:04:58.780 --> 01:05:02.620]   you can find that in the newsletter related to the optimal
[01:05:02.620 --> 01:05:04.460]   or foundational fitness protocol
[01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:06.380]   that you can access at hubermanlab.com.
[01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:08.860]   One thing I should note about the Wednesday torso workout
[01:05:08.860 --> 01:05:11.220]   is that I am a big believer in training
[01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:15.180]   what I believe is the highly avoided
[01:05:15.180 --> 01:05:18.660]   or at least overlooked, but vitally important aspect
[01:05:18.660 --> 01:05:21.700]   of total body stability, strength, and safety,
[01:05:21.700 --> 01:05:23.820]   really safety, which is the neck.
[01:05:23.820 --> 01:05:26.020]   And I realize a lot of people don't want a large neck
[01:05:26.020 --> 01:05:27.960]   and I totally understand for aesthetic reasons
[01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:29.220]   why they don't want that.
[01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:31.000]   It's kind of interesting actually, if you think about it,
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.100]   that people who have a large neck
[01:05:32.100 --> 01:05:34.220]   are often told they have no neck.
[01:05:34.220 --> 01:05:35.940]   People will say, "That guy has no neck."
[01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:38.220]   Or they have no neck when in fact they're referring
[01:05:38.220 --> 01:05:39.620]   to the fact that they have a very large neck.
[01:05:39.620 --> 01:05:40.460]   I don't know how that came to be.
[01:05:40.460 --> 01:05:42.220]   Somebody put in the comments why that is.
[01:05:42.220 --> 01:05:43.780]   How come when people have a big neck,
[01:05:43.780 --> 01:05:45.560]   they refer to it as no neck?
[01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:46.540]   So why do I train the neck?
[01:05:46.540 --> 01:05:48.220]   I train the neck for a couple of reasons.
[01:05:48.220 --> 01:05:49.780]   One is years ago I had an accident
[01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:51.540]   where I actually fell off a roof
[01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:53.700]   and I'd been training my neck at that time
[01:05:55.020 --> 01:05:56.600]   for a sport that I was involved in.
[01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:58.440]   And I walked away from it with a sore neck,
[01:05:58.440 --> 01:05:59.320]   but not a broken neck.
[01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:00.580]   And I thought, "Wow, it's really great
[01:06:00.580 --> 01:06:03.780]   that I have been training my neck."
[01:06:03.780 --> 01:06:06.280]   In addition to that, I was once in a car accident
[01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:08.340]   where I was parked.
[01:06:08.340 --> 01:06:09.740]   I just bought the car.
[01:06:09.740 --> 01:06:11.440]   It's my first new car purchase.
[01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:13.920]   Parked in that car with my mother
[01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:16.820]   and my grandfather in the back seat at the red light
[01:06:16.820 --> 01:06:18.780]   and someone rammed into us at full speed.
[01:06:18.780 --> 01:06:20.540]   Now, fortunately, none of us were hurt.
[01:06:20.540 --> 01:06:22.500]   We were all rattled.
[01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:27.480]   And once again, I was very sore in my back and in my neck,
[01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:30.180]   but I think one of the reasons why I was able
[01:06:30.180 --> 01:06:31.680]   to essentially walk away from that,
[01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:33.980]   I didn't have any sustained damage,
[01:06:33.980 --> 01:06:35.380]   was because I trained my neck.
[01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:37.500]   But I started training my neck for sport
[01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:39.020]   and I continued to train my neck
[01:06:39.020 --> 01:06:40.900]   because I noticed when I don't train my neck,
[01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:42.180]   I start getting shoulder issues.
[01:06:42.180 --> 01:06:45.300]   And if you talk to an excellent physiologist
[01:06:45.300 --> 01:06:48.500]   like Dr. Kelly Starrett of The Ready State,
[01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:49.660]   that was an excellent channel.
[01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:50.900]   You can find him on all the social media
[01:06:50.900 --> 01:06:51.960]   and standard channels where you talk
[01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:56.480]   to anyone out there who really understands the strength
[01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:58.980]   of the torso and the upper body and even the back.
[01:06:58.980 --> 01:07:01.140]   What you learn is that, of course,
[01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:03.200]   being the upper portion of the spine,
[01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:05.340]   stabilizing your neck is very important.
[01:07:05.340 --> 01:07:07.700]   Now, training the neck can be a little bit detailed
[01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:10.220]   and specific and even dangerous if you do it wrong.
[01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:12.580]   Again, Jeff Cavaliere has a terrific set of videos
[01:07:12.580 --> 01:07:13.780]   on training the neck properly.
[01:07:13.780 --> 01:07:16.500]   I know a lot of people out there might think neck bridges.
[01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:17.700]   And I used to do neck bridges.
[01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:21.220]   I occasionally still sneak in a neck bridge here or there,
[01:07:21.220 --> 01:07:22.200]   although I don't recommend it
[01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:25.140]   because in discussions with Jeff, he will tell you,
[01:07:25.140 --> 01:07:28.700]   and it's true, that the discs eventually go
[01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:31.240]   and you can run into serious issues from doing bridges.
[01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:32.740]   And it doesn't happen gradually,
[01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:33.940]   so you can't notice it happening.
[01:07:33.940 --> 01:07:35.180]   It just happens suddenly.
[01:07:35.180 --> 01:07:37.560]   So I might occasionally do a neck bridge,
[01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:40.140]   but in general, I'll train neck by wrapping a plate
[01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:42.040]   in a towel so that I don't end up with an imprint
[01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:44.860]   of the weight value on my head or face,
[01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:46.660]   and then moving the neck from side to side
[01:07:46.660 --> 01:07:47.900]   or front or back.
[01:07:47.900 --> 01:07:50.560]   And again, we'll provide a link to those videos.
[01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:52.220]   It's a terrific set of videos that describe
[01:07:52.220 --> 01:07:54.260]   how to train your neck properly and safely.
[01:07:54.260 --> 01:07:56.540]   So even if you're not trying to grow your neck,
[01:07:56.540 --> 01:07:57.600]   you definitely want to make sure
[01:07:57.600 --> 01:07:58.980]   that you use some lightweights to make sure
[01:07:58.980 --> 01:08:01.940]   that your neck is stable and upright.
[01:08:01.940 --> 01:08:04.780]   I say stable and upright because it's very clear
[01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:07.560]   that for reasons related to texting
[01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:08.940]   and staring down at computers
[01:08:08.940 --> 01:08:12.820]   and related to weak neck relative to the rest of the muscles
[01:08:12.820 --> 01:08:16.100]   that stabilize the spine, a lot of people,
[01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:18.740]   their default stance or their default posture
[01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:21.480]   is with chin forward, and that's not good.
[01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:24.500]   Not only is it aesthetically not good,
[01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:26.360]   but it also can create all sorts of issues
[01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:28.680]   related to back pain and headaches and things of that sort.
[01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:29.880]   This is a real thing.
[01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:32.640]   Training your neck allows you to stand upright, sit upright.
[01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:34.580]   I even believe that it allows you to do things
[01:08:34.580 --> 01:08:36.240]   like public speaking or have conversations
[01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:37.640]   with people on the street in a way
[01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:40.320]   where you are front-facing as opposed to looking down.
[01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:44.980]   So Wednesday is torso and neck, and then comes Thursday,
[01:08:44.980 --> 01:08:49.460]   and that means another cardiovascular exercise session,
[01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:52.060]   although it's a brief one.
[01:08:52.060 --> 01:08:54.620]   Unlike the endurance training on Sunday,
[01:08:54.620 --> 01:08:57.620]   the cardiovascular session on Thursday,
[01:08:57.620 --> 01:08:59.300]   and again, for me, it falls on Thursday,
[01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:00.840]   but for you, it could fall on a different day
[01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:03.340]   depending on when you started this protocol,
[01:09:03.340 --> 01:09:06.340]   is going to be about, again,
[01:09:06.340 --> 01:09:10.700]   about 35 minutes of, for me, running,
[01:09:10.700 --> 01:09:12.700]   although it could be rowing or it could be cycling,
[01:09:12.700 --> 01:09:14.620]   it could be something of that sort.
[01:09:14.620 --> 01:09:16.620]   The goal of this workout is what's important.
[01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:18.780]   The goal of this workout is to tap into,
[01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:20.440]   remember that long list that we talked about earlier
[01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:22.380]   where you've got skill and speed and power and strength
[01:09:22.380 --> 01:09:24.560]   and hypertrophy, et cetera, different forms of endurance,
[01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:27.240]   is to get into that range of endurance
[01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:29.820]   where your heart rate is elevated
[01:09:29.820 --> 01:09:32.000]   quite a bit more than zone two,
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.900]   but you're not really going all out sprint.
[01:09:34.900 --> 01:09:36.660]   So what that means for me is warming up
[01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:38.220]   for about five to 10 minutes.
[01:09:38.220 --> 01:09:40.660]   That could be jogging, a little bit of light calisthenics,
[01:09:40.660 --> 01:09:42.380]   might even be hopping on a stationary bike,
[01:09:42.380 --> 01:09:44.580]   although to be honest, I loathe the stationary bike,
[01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:48.700]   and then setting a timer and doing about 30,
[01:09:48.700 --> 01:09:53.700]   but ideally 35 minutes of what I call 75 to 80% of all out.
[01:09:53.700 --> 01:09:58.620]   Okay, now I realize this spits in the face
[01:09:58.620 --> 01:10:01.500]   of all you heart rate monitor wearing
[01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:04.420]   super techie exercise types,
[01:10:04.420 --> 01:10:07.660]   but when I think of all out sprint,
[01:10:07.660 --> 01:10:10.300]   I think of 100%, and what is that?
[01:10:10.300 --> 01:10:12.460]   In my mind, that's somebody is chasing me
[01:10:12.460 --> 01:10:14.580]   with a needle full of poison,
[01:10:14.580 --> 01:10:17.760]   and I am sprinting away at maximal speed.
[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:19.500]   That for me is 100%.
[01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:20.740]   So after a brief warmup,
[01:10:20.740 --> 01:10:23.540]   what I'm going to do is go out, typically outside,
[01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:25.220]   although sometimes it has to be on a treadmill
[01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:30.220]   if I'm traveling, and move, run for about 30 to 35 minutes
[01:10:30.220 --> 01:10:34.100]   at about 75 or 80% of that all out.
[01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:37.800]   What that means is that I'm striving to keep a steady pace,
[01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:40.220]   but in reality, I don't.
[01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:41.840]   I sometimes have to stop at a stoplight.
[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:43.740]   There are cars, please don't run into traffic
[01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:45.900]   just to maintain that speed and that timing.
[01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:50.580]   That would be terribly antagonistic to fitness
[01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:52.020]   in particular lifespan.
[01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:56.140]   That running tends to be running in which I'm breathing hard,
[01:10:56.140 --> 01:10:57.740]   so I'm not able to restrict myself
[01:10:57.740 --> 01:10:59.020]   to purely nasal breathing,
[01:10:59.020 --> 01:11:00.340]   and I should have mentioned earlier,
[01:11:00.340 --> 01:11:05.340]   on the Sunday long rock or weighted hike or jog,
[01:11:05.340 --> 01:11:08.380]   if I'm alone, I try and do pure nasal breathing.
[01:11:08.380 --> 01:11:10.320]   If I'm with other people or I'm talking,
[01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:12.620]   obviously I'm not going to do pure nasal breathing
[01:11:12.620 --> 01:11:15.260]   because I'm talking, although I'm sure that sometimes
[01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:16.980]   they wish I was doing pure nasal breathing.
[01:11:16.980 --> 01:11:19.300]   That Thursday workout accomplishes a number of things.
[01:11:19.300 --> 01:11:22.520]   First of all, it really gets my heart rate up,
[01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:25.260]   and it improves multiple aspects of endurance
[01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:27.060]   because as you recall earlier,
[01:11:27.060 --> 01:11:28.780]   the different bins of endurance
[01:11:28.780 --> 01:11:30.580]   that include muscular endurance, anaerobic,
[01:11:30.580 --> 01:11:31.660]   that three to 12 minute range,
[01:11:31.660 --> 01:11:33.360]   and then 30 minutes or longer,
[01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:36.020]   none of them really precisely match what's accomplished
[01:11:36.020 --> 01:11:40.280]   in this 35 minute or so cardiovascular session
[01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:43.040]   where I'm pushing hard, but not all out.
[01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:46.060]   But that's exactly the reason to do it,
[01:11:46.060 --> 01:11:49.000]   which is that it taps into multiple fuel systems
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.340]   for the muscle and multiple aspects
[01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:54.300]   of the heart and capillaries and arteries and veins
[01:11:54.300 --> 01:11:56.140]   that are involved in generating that movement.
[01:11:56.140 --> 01:11:57.600]   So it really cuts a broad swath
[01:11:57.600 --> 01:11:59.500]   into multiple categories of endurance.
[01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:02.560]   And also just keep in mind what this foundational
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:05.440]   or optimal fitness protocol is really designed to do.
[01:12:06.020 --> 01:12:09.000]   In my mind, a foundational fitness protocol
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.840]   is one that leaves you or has you in a state
[01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:14.560]   where if you need to walk really far
[01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:16.680]   and carry a bunch of weight, you can do it.
[01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:18.840]   If you need to lift a heavy object with your legs,
[01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:19.840]   you can do it.
[01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:23.940]   If you need to run really fast for two minutes,
[01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:24.980]   you can do it.
[01:12:24.980 --> 01:12:28.820]   And if you need to run a little bit further,
[01:12:28.820 --> 01:12:30.240]   like maybe in 10 minutes,
[01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:31.880]   for whatever reason, you can do that.
[01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:34.480]   So it's a really kind of all around fitness program,
[01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:36.560]   and that 35 minute run, again,
[01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:39.220]   could be swapped with a 35 minute ERGRO,
[01:12:39.220 --> 01:12:42.280]   or sometimes if you only have access to a stationary bike,
[01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:43.360]   you could do that.
[01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:45.200]   I suppose if you didn't have access to any equipment
[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:47.320]   and running is not your thing,
[01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:48.400]   one thing that I have done,
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:49.800]   especially if I've been stuck in a hotel
[01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:51.000]   'cause I arrived late someplace
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.860]   and I really want to get this workout in,
[01:12:52.860 --> 01:12:54.480]   you could do the dreaded burpee.
[01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:56.000]   I know there are a lot of opinions out there.
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.760]   Some people think burpees are downright dangerous.
[01:12:57.760 --> 01:12:59.340]   Other people love burpees.
[01:12:59.340 --> 01:13:00.840]   You could do that.
[01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:04.580]   Or you could do really fast but full jumping jacks.
[01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:07.460]   I know that's a little PE class, right?
[01:13:07.460 --> 01:13:09.520]   Physical education class-ish.
[01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:11.620]   But sometimes if I need to get the workout in,
[01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:14.040]   what I'll do in a hotel if I've arrived late,
[01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:16.960]   a particular day of travel is I will find the stairwell,
[01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:17.880]   the fire stairwell.
[01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:18.720]   I'll make sure, by the way,
[01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:20.200]   that I can get back into the building
[01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:22.280]   'cause I've been locked in those stairwells before.
[01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:25.120]   And I will simply walk really fast up the stairwell
[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:26.840]   as many flights of stairs as there are,
[01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:29.660]   or maybe even jog it, not quite sprint,
[01:13:29.660 --> 01:13:32.620]   but maybe run up those stairs over and over and over again
[01:13:32.620 --> 01:13:36.100]   in order to get that 35 minutes of 75 to 80%
[01:13:36.100 --> 01:13:38.940]   of max output cardiovascular work done.
[01:13:38.940 --> 01:13:42.000]   And if I'm really just restricted to my hotel room,
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.160]   I'll just do jumping jacks for 30, 35 minutes,
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:45.840]   sometimes while watching something on TV.
[01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:47.740]   And believe me, if you're doing full jumping jacks,
[01:13:47.740 --> 01:13:49.360]   like really extending your legs,
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:50.560]   really getting arms overhead
[01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:53.120]   and really doing the full movement,
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:54.840]   by the time you hit five or six minutes,
[01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:56.620]   you are going to be sweating
[01:13:56.620 --> 01:13:58.680]   and your heart rate is really going to be up.
[01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:00.420]   I also sometimes will travel with a jump rope.
[01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:03.980]   I always try and travel with a jump rope and skip rope,
[01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:05.480]   much to the dismay of the people
[01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:07.240]   who are housed below me in the hotel room.
[01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:08.540]   Skipping rope, I should mention,
[01:14:08.540 --> 01:14:10.220]   can be a very effective way
[01:14:10.220 --> 01:14:12.900]   of getting cardiovascular training while you're on the road.
[01:14:12.900 --> 01:14:14.040]   But in all seriousness,
[01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:15.840]   if you're in a hotel room or an apartment
[01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:17.160]   and you can't really jump high
[01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:18.620]   and you're very good at jumping rope,
[01:14:18.620 --> 01:14:20.180]   what you'll find is it's not going to get you
[01:14:20.180 --> 01:14:24.080]   into that higher elevated heart rate zone.
[01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:25.940]   Okay, it can be great for zone two type training,
[01:14:25.940 --> 01:14:27.960]   but if you're really good at skipping rope,
[01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:29.400]   and I wouldn't say I'm really good at it,
[01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:30.540]   but I've done enough skipping rope
[01:14:30.540 --> 01:14:32.260]   that I can just kind of cruise and talk,
[01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:34.080]   and it's more zone two-ish,
[01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:35.560]   even feels like walking at times.
[01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:36.680]   Now you can do double unders
[01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:37.920]   where you're really jumping
[01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:39.980]   and putting the rope under you twice each time
[01:14:39.980 --> 01:14:43.100]   or crossovers, et cetera, depending on your skill level.
[01:14:43.100 --> 01:14:44.340]   But again, if you're in an apartment
[01:14:44.340 --> 01:14:46.420]   and you're in a hotel, that's going to be harder to do.
[01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:49.060]   And because there's some skill involved,
[01:14:49.060 --> 01:14:52.100]   sometimes you're stopping more often than you're continuing.
[01:14:52.100 --> 01:14:54.200]   By the way, and I just have to mention this,
[01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:56.920]   a really terrific Instagram channel is Anna Skips.
[01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:58.840]   This is a teacher, a science teacher,
[01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:02.440]   or I believe it's a math, maths, as they say in the UK,
[01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:04.160]   'cause she's in the UK, math teacher.
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:06.360]   I don't know Anna, but I know she Skips
[01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:07.800]   'cause she has this amazing Instagram channel
[01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:08.800]   called Anna Skips.
[01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:10.880]   And what's really cool about her Instagram
[01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:12.860]   is she shows you her progression
[01:15:12.860 --> 01:15:14.240]   from not being able to skip rope at all
[01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:16.940]   to the absolutely incredible types of rope skipping
[01:15:16.940 --> 01:15:18.740]   that she's doing each morning while getting sunlight,
[01:15:18.740 --> 01:15:21.440]   which of course is a essential health protocol.
[01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:23.480]   So check out Anna Skips on Instagram,
[01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:26.440]   really inspiring and made me want to get better
[01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:28.460]   at skipping rope, I'm still working at it.
[01:15:28.460 --> 01:15:30.880]   Okay, so with that Thursday cardiovascular,
[01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:31.880]   let's call it endurance,
[01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:34.520]   but cardiovascular training workout done,
[01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:35.840]   around rolls Friday.
[01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:37.160]   And on Friday,
[01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:40.560]   I'm going to do another cardiovascular training session.
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:41.640]   And I alluded to this earlier,
[01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:43.240]   but this cardiovascular training session
[01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:48.240]   is also designed to tap into some of the ability
[01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:52.920]   of hard, I should say high-intensity interval training
[01:15:53.820 --> 01:15:58.100]   to tap into strength and hypertrophy increases for the legs.
[01:15:58.100 --> 01:16:01.360]   'Cause remember, we train legs on Monday.
[01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:05.160]   And what the science tells us is that protein synthesis
[01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:06.780]   in a muscle group can be stimulated
[01:16:06.780 --> 01:16:09.480]   about every 42 to 72 hours.
[01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:11.860]   And so we've had Tuesday off,
[01:16:11.860 --> 01:16:14.460]   Wednesday off and Thursday off.
[01:16:14.460 --> 01:16:17.380]   And you don't want to lose progress that you made
[01:16:17.380 --> 01:16:20.660]   from that terrific Monday leg workout,
[01:16:20.660 --> 01:16:23.620]   but in order to make sure that you can do the other things
[01:16:23.620 --> 01:16:26.680]   that follow in this program and pick back up on Monday
[01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:28.340]   with another leg workout,
[01:16:28.340 --> 01:16:30.440]   at least for me with my recovery abilities
[01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:31.780]   and my work schedule,
[01:16:31.780 --> 01:16:34.360]   I'm not going to do an entire other leg workout
[01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:37.160]   because it's going to set the whole thing out of whack.
[01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:39.720]   That is, I won't be able to consistently do the same workouts
[01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:40.980]   on the same days of each week.
[01:16:40.980 --> 01:16:42.520]   Now, with that said, a little bit later,
[01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:44.600]   I'll explain what happens if you have to miss a workout
[01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:46.300]   and how you can combine days, et cetera.
[01:16:46.300 --> 01:16:50.120]   But I really strive to get certain workouts done
[01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:52.680]   on certain days consistently, at least as best I can.
[01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:55.480]   So Friday is high intensity interval training.
[01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:57.960]   That can take a variety of different forms.
[01:16:57.960 --> 01:17:01.080]   For me, the ideal thing to do for me,
[01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:03.720]   again, you could do something completely different.
[01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:05.920]   Exercise choice, again, should be governed
[01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:09.060]   by what you can do safely so you don't injure yourself
[01:17:09.060 --> 01:17:10.480]   and that you can perform effectively
[01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:13.200]   and that gets you or provides you the stimulus
[01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:14.040]   that you want.
[01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:15.480]   And what I'm trying to do on Friday
[01:17:15.480 --> 01:17:17.540]   is get my heart rate way, way up.
[01:17:17.540 --> 01:17:20.040]   Talked about this in the episode with Dr. Andy Galpin.
[01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:23.840]   In addition to the benefits of getting 180 to 200 minutes
[01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:26.960]   of zone two cardio per week minimum,
[01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:29.760]   it's a really good idea to get up to that max
[01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:32.600]   or near max heart rate at least once a week.
[01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:33.560]   And you're not going to do that
[01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:34.640]   for very long periods of time.
[01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:35.840]   You're not going to do that for 30 minutes.
[01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:37.760]   You can't sprint all out for 30 minutes
[01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:39.600]   unless you're Steve Prefontaine.
[01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:41.240]   If you haven't seen the movies "Without Limits"
[01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:44.000]   or "Prefontaine," you should absolutely see those.
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.320]   He was able to go out and run 12 laps,
[01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:50.920]   what seemed to be an all out sprint or close to it.
[01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:54.280]   Incredible, but most people are not going to do that
[01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:57.500]   or are going to be carried away on a stretcher if they try.
[01:17:57.500 --> 01:17:59.720]   These high intensity interval training for me,
[01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:02.800]   ideally would be on so-called assault bike or airdyne bike.
[01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:04.400]   So these are bikes that have the fan,
[01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:06.920]   which might seem like, oh, you know, it just cools you off,
[01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:08.840]   but actually there's a lot of resistance there.
[01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:13.000]   So what I will typically do is a 20 to 30 second
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.880]   all out sprint using arms and legs,
[01:18:15.880 --> 01:18:19.620]   and then 10 seconds rest, and then repeat.
[01:18:19.620 --> 01:18:22.000]   All out sprint for 20 or 30 seconds,
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.100]   10 seconds rest, repeat.
[01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:28.200]   And I'll do that for anywhere from eight to 12 rounds,
[01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:32.720]   which trust me, even if you start out a little bit less,
[01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:35.360]   or I should say not all out intensity or effort,
[01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:37.040]   by time you hit the fifth or sixth one,
[01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:40.220]   you will be certainly headed into,
[01:18:40.220 --> 01:18:42.280]   if not near your maximum heart rate.
[01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:43.440]   Now, what is your maximum heart rate?
[01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:44.600]   Do you need a heart rate monitor?
[01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:47.240]   No, if you'd like using that sort of thing, great.
[01:18:47.240 --> 01:18:50.360]   But again, Andy Galpin beautifully supplied us
[01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:51.400]   with the information.
[01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:53.320]   He said, if you take the number 220
[01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:56.440]   and you subtract your age, that for most people,
[01:18:56.440 --> 01:18:58.360]   most is going to be your maximum heart rate.
[01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:00.080]   Although for certain people who are very fit
[01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:02.040]   or certain ages, that's not going to apply.
[01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:04.160]   So it's a little bit too crude a measure,
[01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:05.480]   but it's a good starting place
[01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:06.860]   and you can look up other information
[01:19:06.860 --> 01:19:08.200]   or see that podcast episode.
[01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:10.000]   We probably had a link to it in the show note captions
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.060]   if you want to get more details on that.
[01:19:12.060 --> 01:19:13.320]   I don't use a heart rate monitor.
[01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:15.200]   What I'm trying to do is get to that point
[01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:18.200]   where I quote unquote, feel like I want to die.
[01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:21.320]   Now I don't want to die and please don't die, right?
[01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:23.020]   If you're not in good cardiovascular health,
[01:19:23.020 --> 01:19:26.040]   do not just jump right into this fitness protocol.
[01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:28.060]   But I want to get to the point where I really feel
[01:19:28.060 --> 01:19:30.880]   like I could not pedal any faster
[01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:34.760]   or pull any faster on the assault bike, the Airdyne bike.
[01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:38.200]   Or if I'm doing this workout in a place or at a time
[01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:41.840]   or because I choose to not use a bike or a rower,
[01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:43.120]   'cause you could also use a rower,
[01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:46.400]   I will simply do sprint jog intervals.
[01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:48.960]   I will sprint for 20 or 30 seconds,
[01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:50.400]   then jog for 10 seconds.
[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:51.680]   Sprint for 20 or 30 seconds
[01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:53.960]   and then jog for 10 seconds and just repeat.
[01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:56.460]   I used to have a big field next to my laboratory,
[01:19:56.460 --> 01:19:57.440]   my old laboratory,
[01:19:57.440 --> 01:19:59.220]   and I used to bring my bulldog Costello out there.
[01:19:59.220 --> 01:20:01.180]   He was really good at the first sprint part
[01:20:01.180 --> 01:20:02.800]   and then he would just lie down and watch.
[01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:04.160]   He didn't even do the jog part.
[01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:05.120]   I would just go back and forth,
[01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:06.560]   back and forth, back and forth,
[01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:08.860]   panting like a bulldog nonstop,
[01:20:08.860 --> 01:20:11.640]   barely able to recover before sprinting again.
[01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:14.440]   And the basis of this workout again is several fold.
[01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:16.720]   First of all, it's to get the heart rate really high,
[01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:19.920]   up towards maximum heart rate at least once a week.
[01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:21.200]   So you accomplish that this Friday.
[01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:24.240]   Also, if you are sprinting and then jogging
[01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:26.600]   or you're really pushing hard on an assault bike
[01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:29.100]   or an Airdyne bike, or using a, for instance,
[01:20:29.100 --> 01:20:31.300]   a skier or the skier machine,
[01:20:31.300 --> 01:20:36.080]   or any number of different cardiovascular training tools,
[01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:40.680]   you are going to get activation of the legs.
[01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:42.980]   Of course, not to the same degree as you would with squats
[01:20:42.980 --> 01:20:44.900]   or deadlifts or leg extensions and leg curls.
[01:20:44.900 --> 01:20:46.400]   That's simply not the case,
[01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:50.120]   but you're going to trigger strength and hypertrophy
[01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:52.740]   and other types of adaptations in those muscle groups.
[01:20:52.740 --> 01:20:56.200]   So this for me also represents the second leg workout
[01:20:56.200 --> 01:20:58.800]   of the week where I'm not touching any weights.
[01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:00.160]   One important point that I don't think
[01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:01.740]   I've heard mentioned anywhere else,
[01:21:01.740 --> 01:21:04.480]   but that I hope to have Dr. Kelly Starrett
[01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:05.540]   on the podcast to discuss,
[01:21:05.540 --> 01:21:08.240]   and that I've discussed with him one-on-one,
[01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:11.600]   which is be careful with all out sprints
[01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:13.960]   or all out anything cardiovascular exercise.
[01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:15.980]   You can get injured doing those.
[01:21:15.980 --> 01:21:17.200]   So for instance, if you go out
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:19.160]   and you just sprint across a field,
[01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:20.600]   all out 20 or 30 seconds,
[01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:23.160]   and then walk back and can do it again and again,
[01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:26.500]   don't be surprised if the next day you have some sciatica
[01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:28.640]   or even some pelvic floor pain.
[01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:32.220]   I don't recommend going all out on any movement
[01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:35.720]   that you can't perform with perfect form, okay?
[01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:37.960]   So for me, I really try and stay away
[01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:39.200]   from all out sprints.
[01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:41.840]   I'll sprint at about 95% of what I can do
[01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:44.360]   because I find if I go all out sprint,
[01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:45.400]   I don't know what the reason is,
[01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:47.380]   but it might be an overextension of a limb
[01:21:47.380 --> 01:21:48.220]   or something like that.
[01:21:48.220 --> 01:21:49.060]   I'm not a sprinter.
[01:21:49.060 --> 01:21:50.160]   I'm not a sprinting coach.
[01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:54.560]   I do hope to get Stu McMillan on here or Dan Pfaff.
[01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:56.080]   They were excellent sprinting coaches.
[01:21:56.080 --> 01:21:58.880]   At some point, they're world-class sprinting coaches,
[01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:01.720]   but I'm not a pro sprinter.
[01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:03.420]   I'm not even a amateur sprinter.
[01:22:03.420 --> 01:22:05.160]   I'm a fitness sprinter.
[01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:07.720]   So the Airdyne or assault bike or the rower
[01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:09.340]   is really a safer option for me.
[01:22:09.340 --> 01:22:11.880]   And if I'm running or I'm doing some sort of movement
[01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:13.500]   where I'm unconstrained,
[01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:15.420]   really in terms of how far my stride is,
[01:22:15.420 --> 01:22:17.560]   I mean, I'm obviously constrained by the musculature,
[01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:20.120]   I'm really careful to not overextend
[01:22:20.120 --> 01:22:20.940]   or do something like that.
[01:22:20.940 --> 01:22:22.800]   And the only way to do that is to not go all out.
[01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:24.600]   So again, the goal for this Friday workout
[01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:26.120]   is to really get the heart rate high,
[01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:28.200]   do high intensity interval training.
[01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:29.420]   There are a number of different ways you could do that.
[01:22:29.420 --> 01:22:32.480]   You can look up HIIT, hit workouts online,
[01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:33.400]   find the one that's best for you
[01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:34.800]   and really pick something that's safe
[01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:36.420]   that you can do consistently.
[01:22:36.420 --> 01:22:39.600]   And I believe that ideally will also trigger a bit
[01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:41.700]   of either strength and hypertrophy
[01:22:41.700 --> 01:22:44.080]   and speed, power, maintenance,
[01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:46.040]   or even give you a little bit of a stimulus
[01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:48.960]   so that by time you roll around to that leg workout
[01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:50.240]   again on Monday,
[01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:52.320]   you've got a little bit of an additional boost
[01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:55.560]   to your leg strength, hypertrophy, speed and power.
[01:22:55.560 --> 01:22:57.480]   So we've covered Sunday through Friday
[01:22:57.480 --> 01:23:00.400]   and then Saturday rolls around.
[01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:05.400]   And Saturday is when you train arms, calves and neck.
[01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:08.260]   So this may sound as if you're training
[01:23:08.260 --> 01:23:10.380]   a bunch of small muscle groups, biceps, triceps,
[01:23:10.380 --> 01:23:12.860]   necks and calves, and that's true.
[01:23:12.860 --> 01:23:16.720]   But I should mention that you are also training your torso
[01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:19.620]   a second time and you're doing it indirectly
[01:23:19.620 --> 01:23:21.380]   or sometimes not indirectly.
[01:23:21.380 --> 01:23:22.220]   Why do I say this?
[01:23:22.220 --> 01:23:25.420]   Well, keep in mind again that for strength and hypertrophy,
[01:23:25.420 --> 01:23:29.260]   you're going for that once about every 48 to 72 hours,
[01:23:29.260 --> 01:23:31.280]   you want to stimulate that.
[01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:34.060]   On Wednesday is when you trained your torso, right?
[01:23:34.060 --> 01:23:35.900]   Chest, shoulders, back and neck.
[01:23:35.900 --> 01:23:39.840]   You've had Thursday to rest, Friday to rest.
[01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:41.720]   I know a lot of people are going to want to emphasize
[01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:42.700]   those body parts and they're going to think,
[01:23:42.700 --> 01:23:44.200]   oh, you have to train it twice a week.
[01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:48.980]   But if you have modest recovery ability
[01:23:48.980 --> 01:23:51.620]   or low recovery ability, such as I do,
[01:23:51.620 --> 01:23:52.640]   and you're doing these other
[01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:55.060]   cardiovascular training sessions, et cetera,
[01:23:55.060 --> 01:23:58.360]   well then on Saturday is when you will train arms,
[01:23:58.360 --> 01:24:01.180]   calves and neck directly, but included in that,
[01:24:01.180 --> 01:24:03.040]   remember two exercises per muscle group,
[01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:04.300]   one with a peak contraction,
[01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:06.540]   one with somewhat of a stretch in there.
[01:24:06.540 --> 01:24:11.540]   Included in that, I suggest doing some sort of dip movement,
[01:24:11.540 --> 01:24:13.840]   which I think it was Pavel Satsoulin said the dip
[01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:16.140]   is synonymous with or at least similar
[01:24:16.140 --> 01:24:17.660]   to an upper body squat.
[01:24:17.660 --> 01:24:19.260]   Excuse me, Pavel, if I got that wrong,
[01:24:19.260 --> 01:24:20.500]   maybe it wasn't you that said that,
[01:24:20.500 --> 01:24:22.820]   but I'm a big admirer of his work.
[01:24:22.820 --> 01:24:25.000]   And certainly the dip is a great exercise
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.260]   to hit multiple muscle groups,
[01:24:27.260 --> 01:24:29.440]   chest, shoulders and triceps,
[01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:30.820]   maybe even some back to some extent,
[01:24:30.820 --> 01:24:32.160]   depending on how you do it.
[01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:35.980]   So doing some dipping movement will indirectly
[01:24:35.980 --> 01:24:38.540]   stimulate strength, hypertrophy, et cetera,
[01:24:38.540 --> 01:24:40.540]   in the chest and shoulders,
[01:24:40.540 --> 01:24:43.680]   and including some sort of pulling movement for the bicep,
[01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:47.740]   like a chin up or palms facing movement,
[01:24:47.740 --> 01:24:49.260]   pulling up to the bar,
[01:24:49.260 --> 01:24:52.020]   especially if it's a close grip type movement,
[01:24:52.020 --> 01:24:54.060]   but even if it's a wide grip type movement,
[01:24:54.060 --> 01:24:57.100]   will of course trigger strength and hypertrophy,
[01:24:57.100 --> 01:25:00.020]   maintenance or improvements in the biceps,
[01:25:00.020 --> 01:25:02.780]   but will also trigger strength,
[01:25:02.780 --> 01:25:06.560]   hypertrophy in the lats, in the back, okay?
[01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:09.320]   So Saturday is this arm workout that,
[01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:11.640]   I'll just give an example of a potential workout
[01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:13.560]   where you might do a few more exercises,
[01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:14.820]   and maybe not just two, but maybe three,
[01:25:14.820 --> 01:25:17.500]   to make sure you get the torso indirect stimulation.
[01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:18.860]   So what would this look like?
[01:25:18.860 --> 01:25:21.640]   Well, this might be your sort of classic dumbbell curls
[01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:25.120]   for the bicep and maybe incline curl for the bicep
[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:27.680]   because it has more of a stretch, so on an incline bench.
[01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:31.680]   And then you might finish with two sets of chin ups,
[01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:33.980]   so palms facing you, chin ups, or three sets of chin ups,
[01:25:33.980 --> 01:25:36.440]   depending on whether or not you're in a heavier load month
[01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:38.680]   or a more moderate weight month.
[01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:42.420]   Again, activating the biceps muscles, 'cause arms day,
[01:25:42.420 --> 01:25:45.700]   but also activating strength and hypertrophy in the lats,
[01:25:45.700 --> 01:25:48.140]   or at least maintaining it so that,
[01:25:48.140 --> 01:25:50.640]   because you're not training those torso muscles again
[01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:54.160]   until Wednesday, you're not allowing the hypertrophy
[01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:57.300]   and strength gains that you generated on Wednesday
[01:25:57.300 --> 01:25:59.740]   to atrophy, to disappear.
[01:25:59.740 --> 01:26:02.640]   Then thinking about triceps,
[01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:04.600]   it might be some sort of triceps isolation
[01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:05.820]   or peak contraction movement,
[01:26:05.820 --> 01:26:09.220]   so that could be tricep kickback or some overhead extension
[01:26:09.220 --> 01:26:11.320]   would be more of a stretch type movement than a kickback,
[01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:13.640]   but then also doing regular old dips.
[01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:15.200]   You might even start with dips, which again,
[01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:18.580]   are going to activate those torso muscles and the triceps.
[01:26:18.580 --> 01:26:22.500]   And then calf work in the same way that you did on Monday,
[01:26:22.500 --> 01:26:25.620]   and neck work, again, I am a believer in training neck
[01:26:25.620 --> 01:26:27.280]   multiple times per week.
[01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:29.840]   And if you are able to finish all of that
[01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:32.080]   in 45 or 50 minutes, great.
[01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:33.420]   Most people will find when you're doing
[01:26:33.420 --> 01:26:35.520]   a lot of small muscle groups, it actually takes longer
[01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:37.880]   because you have to go around to more exercises.
[01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:39.700]   But again, just adhere to the same principles
[01:26:39.700 --> 01:26:41.000]   we talked about before,
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:45.080]   about 50 to 60 minutes of real work after a warmup
[01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:46.320]   with an asterisk next to that,
[01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:47.560]   that if someone's on the equipment
[01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:50.280]   or you can't find the dumbbells you need, et cetera,
[01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:52.240]   then maybe 75 minutes max,
[01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:55.400]   but really trying to not extend that workout too long,
[01:26:55.400 --> 01:26:58.740]   making sure that you activate the arms directly,
[01:26:58.740 --> 01:27:01.780]   but also activating the torso muscles indirectly.
[01:27:01.780 --> 01:27:04.900]   And again, I won't repeat it this time again,
[01:27:04.900 --> 01:27:07.760]   but following the same weight and repetition
[01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:10.080]   and rest interval scheme that we talked about earlier,
[01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:13.900]   a bit heavier, lower reps, more sets,
[01:27:13.900 --> 01:27:16.020]   and longer rest for about a month,
[01:27:16.020 --> 01:27:20.900]   and then alternating to more repetitions, yet fewer sets,
[01:27:22.620 --> 01:27:25.540]   shorter rest intervals, and do that for about a month.
[01:27:25.540 --> 01:27:26.380]   This carries through
[01:27:26.380 --> 01:27:28.200]   for all the resistance training workouts,
[01:27:28.200 --> 01:27:29.620]   regardless of the day of the week.
[01:27:29.620 --> 01:27:31.840]   So we've completed the total arc across the week,
[01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:34.880]   and we can summarize it as saying Sunday is,
[01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:36.320]   let's just say long endurance.
[01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:38.780]   Monday is leg resistance training.
[01:27:38.780 --> 01:27:41.020]   Tuesday, heat cold contrast.
[01:27:41.020 --> 01:27:44.800]   Wednesday, torso training plus neck.
[01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:46.800]   Thursday, I would call it
[01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:49.880]   moderate intensity cardiovascular exercise,
[01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:53.240]   so that 35 minute moderate intensity cardiovascular exercise.
[01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:56.720]   Friday, high intensity interval training of sprinting
[01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:58.620]   or some variation thereof.
[01:27:58.620 --> 01:28:01.940]   And Saturday, arms, calves, neck, and torso indirect work.
[01:28:01.940 --> 01:28:05.660]   That's the total structure, but I want to emphasize again,
[01:28:05.660 --> 01:28:07.160]   you do not need to start this on Sunday.
[01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:10.480]   That is, you could make the long endurance work
[01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:13.640]   start on Tuesday and then just fill in the rest
[01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:15.460]   as described before.
[01:28:15.460 --> 01:28:17.360]   It's really up to you.
[01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:19.120]   There's another important point I want to make,
[01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:23.800]   which is that neither I nor anyone is going to be successful
[01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:26.200]   in doing the exact workouts
[01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:27.960]   on the exact same days of every week
[01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:31.640]   because of travel, work, illness, other demands, et cetera.
[01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:33.400]   The thing about the schedule that I like so much
[01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:36.780]   and that I do believe that will benefit you as well
[01:28:36.780 --> 01:28:38.480]   is that you have some flexibility there.
[01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:39.420]   What's the flexibility?
[01:28:39.420 --> 01:28:41.000]   Well, let's say you train
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:42.760]   your typical Sunday workout of endurance,
[01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:44.800]   then you train legs on Monday,
[01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:49.540]   and then you don't manage to do your heat-cold contrast
[01:28:49.540 --> 01:28:51.080]   on Tuesday for whatever reason.
[01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:53.900]   Well, you can put it on Wednesday.
[01:28:53.900 --> 01:28:56.940]   Just make sure that if you're going to do the cold stimulus
[01:28:56.940 --> 01:28:58.680]   that you don't do it too close,
[01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:01.560]   not within four, ideally eight hours
[01:29:01.560 --> 01:29:06.280]   after the training of torso, but you could do it before,
[01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:08.240]   or you could do it just heat
[01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:11.080]   and skip the cold that particular week, right?
[01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:13.800]   Not ideal, but better than not doing anything.
[01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:15.240]   Let's say, for instance, the leg workout
[01:29:15.240 --> 01:29:16.160]   was particularly brutal.
[01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:19.380]   You don't sleep that well on Monday night or Tuesday night.
[01:29:19.380 --> 01:29:23.100]   Well, then should you do the torso workout on Wednesday?
[01:29:23.100 --> 01:29:24.980]   Well, I would say,
[01:29:24.980 --> 01:29:28.160]   why not move the heat-cold contrast to Wednesday
[01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:32.440]   and then push that torso workout to Thursday
[01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:35.840]   and maybe also try and do that 35-minute run on Thursday
[01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:36.960]   every once in a while
[01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:40.200]   rather than lose the total control of the program
[01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:41.640]   and let everything shuffle forward.
[01:29:41.640 --> 01:29:43.440]   Here's the basic principle.
[01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:46.500]   I do believe that any one of these workouts,
[01:29:46.500 --> 01:29:48.240]   whether it's for endurance or resistance training,
[01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:52.860]   can be shifted either one day forward or one day back, right?
[01:29:52.860 --> 01:29:53.960]   You could delay it by a day
[01:29:53.960 --> 01:29:56.620]   or you could accelerate it by a day
[01:29:56.620 --> 01:29:59.040]   in order to make sure that you get everything done
[01:29:59.040 --> 01:29:59.940]   across the week.
[01:29:59.940 --> 01:30:03.880]   In fact, I would say the best way to think about this
[01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:08.360]   foundational fitness program is not from the details up,
[01:30:08.360 --> 01:30:09.880]   but from the top down,
[01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:12.080]   from the big picture down to the details,
[01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:13.900]   and say to yourself, once a week,
[01:30:13.900 --> 01:30:16.320]   you're going to get some long endurance in.
[01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:17.400]   Another day during the week,
[01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:19.680]   you're going to make sure that you get a kind of moderate,
[01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:21.760]   faster endurance workout in.
[01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:23.880]   And then one other day during the week,
[01:30:23.880 --> 01:30:25.520]   you're going to get an all-out sprint,
[01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:29.040]   high-intensity cardiovascular exercise workout in.
[01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:31.920]   You're going to get those three workouts in somehow.
[01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:32.920]   And then in addition to that,
[01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:35.280]   you will also do resistance training
[01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:37.400]   for every muscle group in your body.
[01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:41.400]   And that means doing your legs hard at least once a week,
[01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:43.780]   your torso hard at least once a week,
[01:30:43.780 --> 01:30:46.440]   and your arms hard at least once a week.
[01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:48.360]   And of course, you are also paying attention
[01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:49.980]   to train your calves.
[01:30:49.980 --> 01:30:52.220]   And I do, for reasons I described before,
[01:30:52.220 --> 01:30:54.000]   believe that you want to train your neck
[01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:55.360]   at least to keep it strong.
[01:30:55.360 --> 01:30:58.080]   You may not want to generate hypertrophy there.
[01:30:58.080 --> 01:31:00.360]   People vary in terms of how quickly their neck grows.
[01:31:00.360 --> 01:31:01.600]   Some people it grows very, very fast.
[01:31:01.600 --> 01:31:02.960]   Other people, for the life of them,
[01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:04.520]   they can't get much hypertrophy in their neck,
[01:31:04.520 --> 01:31:06.080]   but keeping that neck strong,
[01:31:06.080 --> 01:31:08.240]   at least through some very light work
[01:31:08.240 --> 01:31:10.920]   to moderate weight work, very, very important.
[01:31:11.880 --> 01:31:13.560]   For reasons I stated earlier.
[01:31:13.560 --> 01:31:16.420]   If you set out those goals,
[01:31:16.420 --> 01:31:19.820]   then the specific days that you do each workout
[01:31:19.820 --> 01:31:22.800]   isn't as critical, but the specific spacing is.
[01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:24.560]   So for instance, you're not going to want to do
[01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:26.520]   your high intensity interval training
[01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:28.560]   the day after you train your legs,
[01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:29.400]   because if you're doing
[01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:31.520]   that high intensity interval training correctly,
[01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:34.120]   you're going to be taxing your legs
[01:31:34.120 --> 01:31:35.920]   and eating into their recovery.
[01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:38.280]   And so you want to space them out by two or three days.
[01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:40.320]   So I think you'll notice that the point is really
[01:31:40.320 --> 01:31:43.560]   to optimize everything on the whole
[01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:46.220]   rather than any one specific aspect
[01:31:46.220 --> 01:31:47.840]   of training or adaptation.
[01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:50.120]   Now, that said, I do realize
[01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:52.480]   that some people might be hyper-focused
[01:31:52.480 --> 01:31:54.280]   on things like strength and hypertrophy
[01:31:54.280 --> 01:31:56.040]   and the aesthetics that come with it.
[01:31:56.040 --> 01:31:58.900]   A key point about strength, hypertrophy, and weight training,
[01:31:58.900 --> 01:32:00.240]   and this is something that has been covered
[01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:01.560]   on multiple podcasts,
[01:32:01.560 --> 01:32:02.840]   certainly the one with Jeff Cavaliere
[01:32:02.840 --> 01:32:05.620]   and with Dr. Andy Galpin and the one that I did
[01:32:05.620 --> 01:32:08.840]   on building muscle strength and hypertrophy,
[01:32:08.840 --> 01:32:12.840]   the solo episode, and that is the following.
[01:32:12.840 --> 01:32:15.760]   It is the rare individual
[01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:18.720]   who has perfectly balanced musculature, right?
[01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:21.560]   Most people can be a bit quad dominant
[01:32:21.560 --> 01:32:22.800]   or hamstring dominant,
[01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:24.600]   or they have trouble activating their glutes,
[01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:26.960]   or somebody has a terrible time trying
[01:32:26.960 --> 01:32:28.800]   to activate their chest muscles,
[01:32:28.800 --> 01:32:31.480]   but they're very strong in the back, et cetera.
[01:32:31.480 --> 01:32:35.440]   It's very clear that we can know that not just
[01:32:35.440 --> 01:32:40.160]   based on aesthetics, right, but based on deliberate
[01:32:40.160 --> 01:32:41.920]   contractability of those muscles.
[01:32:41.920 --> 01:32:43.600]   So I don't want to get into this in too much detail
[01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:45.280]   for sake of time, but this is something
[01:32:45.280 --> 01:32:47.960]   that has peer-reviewed research to support it
[01:32:47.960 --> 01:32:50.560]   and was also discussed extensively with Jeff Cavaliere
[01:32:50.560 --> 01:32:52.000]   when he was a guest,
[01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.500]   and that actually he's really popularized this notion,
[01:32:54.500 --> 01:32:55.680]   and it's absolutely true,
[01:32:55.680 --> 01:32:58.320]   which is that if you can contract a muscle very hard
[01:32:58.320 --> 01:33:00.000]   to the point where it almost feels like it's cramping,
[01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.940]   if you can do that even when there's no weight in your hand
[01:33:02.940 --> 01:33:04.840]   or there's no resistance against it,
[01:33:04.840 --> 01:33:07.000]   so you're just using your mind-muscle connection
[01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.760]   to contract that muscle hard and isolate it,
[01:33:08.760 --> 01:33:11.600]   chances are you will be able to generate hypertrophy
[01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:14.240]   and strength gains pretty easily in that muscle
[01:33:14.240 --> 01:33:17.860]   compared to muscles that you have a harder time activating.
[01:33:17.860 --> 01:33:19.400]   So during all resistance training,
[01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:22.160]   that mind-muscle link is really important,
[01:33:22.160 --> 01:33:24.760]   so much so that some people will even try
[01:33:24.760 --> 01:33:26.220]   and emphasize contraction of the muscles
[01:33:26.220 --> 01:33:28.020]   in between sets, et cetera.
[01:33:28.020 --> 01:33:29.660]   I personally, because I'm not somebody
[01:33:29.660 --> 01:33:32.100]   who likes a mirror when I work out,
[01:33:32.100 --> 01:33:34.360]   and I'm not somebody who wants to spend time
[01:33:34.360 --> 01:33:37.320]   in between sets flexing muscles and et cetera,
[01:33:37.320 --> 01:33:39.720]   for whatever reason, I want to actually rest between sets,
[01:33:39.720 --> 01:33:42.360]   and I'm more concerned with performance during those sets
[01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:45.240]   and really putting my mind into the muscle during the set.
[01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:48.120]   I really try and emphasize deep relaxation between sets,
[01:33:48.120 --> 01:33:51.920]   and so here's a tool that, again, is built out of science,
[01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:53.480]   and I should say peer-reviewed studies,
[01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:55.080]   some of which are being done in my lab,
[01:33:55.080 --> 01:33:58.040]   but other labs as well, which is that in between sets,
[01:33:58.040 --> 01:34:00.960]   what I really strive to do is to bring my heart rate down
[01:34:00.960 --> 01:34:03.800]   as much as possible, calm myself down as much as possible,
[01:34:03.800 --> 01:34:06.100]   and I'll do the so-called physiological sigh
[01:34:06.100 --> 01:34:06.940]   in order to do that.
[01:34:06.940 --> 01:34:09.280]   That's two inhales through the nose, back to back,
[01:34:09.280 --> 01:34:11.920]   [inhales and exhales]
[01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:14.320]   and then long, full exhale through the mouth.
[01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:17.100]   I just did it partially there for sake of time again.
[01:34:17.100 --> 01:34:19.160]   So a big, deep inhale through the nose,
[01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:21.280]   and then sneak in a little bit more on a second inhale
[01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:23.480]   to maximally inflate the lungs and the avioli of the lungs,
[01:34:23.480 --> 01:34:26.760]   and then a full exhale of all your air
[01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:28.320]   via the mouth to empty your lungs.
[01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:31.320]   That's the fastest way that we are aware of
[01:34:31.320 --> 01:34:33.980]   to calm your nervous system down,
[01:34:33.980 --> 01:34:35.600]   and really in between sets,
[01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:38.280]   you can use that to calm yourself down and conserve energy,
[01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:42.160]   but then as you move into the weight training set,
[01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:45.140]   you really want to ratchet up your focus and attention
[01:34:45.140 --> 01:34:46.720]   to the muscles that you're going to be using.
[01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:47.560]   Now, I'd like to acknowledge
[01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:49.240]   that there's a huge range of parameters
[01:34:49.240 --> 01:34:51.780]   in terms of how to actually perform during the set.
[01:34:51.780 --> 01:34:53.640]   You can focus on a particular muscle
[01:34:53.640 --> 01:34:55.520]   and try and really isolate
[01:34:55.520 --> 01:34:56.720]   from the beginning of the movement.
[01:34:56.720 --> 01:34:58.400]   Some people will really try and isolate it
[01:34:58.400 --> 01:34:59.600]   only during the peak contraction.
[01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:01.000]   Some people will accentuate the negative.
[01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:02.480]   There's speed and cadence.
[01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:05.880]   There are, again, remember, concepts are few,
[01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:06.720]   methods are many,
[01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:08.440]   and if you're interested in the various methods
[01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:10.120]   of eccentrics and concentrics
[01:35:10.120 --> 01:35:14.080]   and all the different ways of changing up cadence
[01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:15.000]   and so forth during sets,
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.520]   there's an enormous amount of quality information out there,
[01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:20.160]   far too much for us to get into in detail now,
[01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:21.720]   but what I described the general principles
[01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:24.920]   of how to set your mind, if you will, during the set,
[01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:26.760]   you should be focused on the muscles that you're using
[01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:27.820]   and/or moving the weight.
[01:35:27.820 --> 01:35:29.360]   If movement of the weight is more important,
[01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:31.240]   you can either focus on moving the weight
[01:35:31.240 --> 01:35:33.560]   or challenging muscles, right?
[01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:35.060]   You can either try and isolate muscles
[01:35:35.060 --> 01:35:36.640]   and make specific muscles do the work
[01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:38.720]   or simply moving the weight.
[01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:40.880]   Moving the weight is going to be more geared
[01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:43.320]   towards strength improvements,
[01:35:43.320 --> 01:35:45.320]   but focusing on the muscles,
[01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:46.200]   so-called my muscle link,
[01:35:46.200 --> 01:35:48.280]   is going to shift that very same set
[01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:49.560]   more toward hypertrophy.
[01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:51.440]   I realize I'm painting with a broad brush here,
[01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:53.640]   but nonetheless, this is grounded in the way
[01:35:53.640 --> 01:35:56.880]   that the nervous system governs muscular contraction.
[01:35:56.880 --> 01:35:58.800]   And while I think most people are familiar
[01:35:58.800 --> 01:36:00.240]   with the number of different variables
[01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:02.080]   associated with the resistance training,
[01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:05.560]   you know, sets, reps, rest intervals, cadence, et cetera,
[01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:07.640]   there are also a tremendous number
[01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:09.660]   of very important variables for endurance
[01:36:09.660 --> 01:36:11.920]   and any kind of cardiovascular training.
[01:36:11.920 --> 01:36:14.040]   And there are a lot of excellent resources
[01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:15.560]   out there about that.
[01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:17.940]   I think the most important one,
[01:36:17.940 --> 01:36:19.600]   in fact, I will go on record saying
[01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:23.120]   what I believe to be the most important variable
[01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:25.760]   for any endurance or cardiovascular training
[01:36:25.760 --> 01:36:28.500]   is that because it's a repetitive movement,
[01:36:28.500 --> 01:36:31.480]   that you're able to complete the movement safely,
[01:36:31.480 --> 01:36:32.820]   meaning you're not putting your body
[01:36:32.820 --> 01:36:35.820]   into range of motion or into positions
[01:36:35.820 --> 01:36:37.780]   that can damage joints
[01:36:37.780 --> 01:36:40.400]   or put you in any kind of compromised state.
[01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:42.400]   And some of you might think, well, that seems kind of silly.
[01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:44.200]   But if you've ever set the, for instance,
[01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:45.860]   the seat too high on a stationary bike
[01:36:45.860 --> 01:36:46.900]   and then done, you know,
[01:36:46.900 --> 01:36:50.220]   airdyne or assault bike type interval training sprints,
[01:36:50.220 --> 01:36:53.640]   if it's set too high and you're over striding, as it were,
[01:36:53.640 --> 01:36:55.800]   the next day, you can really pay the price
[01:36:55.800 --> 01:36:57.640]   in terms of some back pain or sciatica.
[01:36:57.640 --> 01:37:00.260]   And sometimes that pain can extend for quite a while.
[01:37:00.260 --> 01:37:02.160]   So of course, you don't want to approach any exercise
[01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:04.540]   with so much caution that it's neurotic and preventive,
[01:37:04.540 --> 01:37:06.940]   and yet you don't want to approach any exercise
[01:37:06.940 --> 01:37:11.540]   in any way that's so cavalier, forgive the pun, Jeff,
[01:37:11.540 --> 01:37:14.460]   that you're also going to compromise
[01:37:14.460 --> 01:37:15.480]   the integrity of your joints
[01:37:15.480 --> 01:37:17.260]   and musculature and connective tissue.
[01:37:17.260 --> 01:37:20.600]   Let's talk about some real world practical variables.
[01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:23.040]   For instance, let's say you get
[01:37:23.040 --> 01:37:25.520]   a poor to terrible night's sleep.
[01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:27.680]   Should you train the next day or not?
[01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:29.120]   Well, that really depends.
[01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:30.800]   I can honestly say I've had some
[01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:32.960]   of the best training sessions, resistance training
[01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:34.120]   or endurance training sessions
[01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:36.240]   after a really poor night's sleep.
[01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:38.280]   But that's the rare event.
[01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:42.080]   More often than not, if I'm not sleeping well,
[01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:43.300]   I've had a terrible night's sleep,
[01:37:43.300 --> 01:37:46.880]   the next day I will just skip training that day.
[01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:48.840]   I know that will shock a number of you out there,
[01:37:48.840 --> 01:37:52.200]   or perhaps you're already calling me names, weak, et cetera.
[01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:54.660]   But I find that if I've slept really poorly
[01:37:54.660 --> 01:37:57.840]   or I've had a very stressful event the day before
[01:37:57.840 --> 01:37:59.240]   and I don't sleep well,
[01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:01.440]   training the next day sets me up for getting ill
[01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:02.500]   and getting ill sets me up
[01:38:02.500 --> 01:38:04.920]   for not being able to train for multiple days.
[01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:07.620]   So it is my preference in that case
[01:38:07.620 --> 01:38:10.780]   to skip a day and really focus on recovery.
[01:38:10.780 --> 01:38:12.780]   And then as I mentioned earlier,
[01:38:12.780 --> 01:38:15.240]   slide that workout to the next day
[01:38:15.240 --> 01:38:19.220]   and rarely double that workout up with another workout,
[01:38:19.220 --> 01:38:21.660]   but then just slide the schedule forward by a day.
[01:38:21.660 --> 01:38:23.440]   But I really try and strive,
[01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:27.280]   that is I really try to double up at least some workouts
[01:38:27.280 --> 01:38:28.760]   later in the week in that case,
[01:38:28.760 --> 01:38:31.360]   so that I can get back on schedule
[01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:34.800]   of starting the seven-day protocol again on the same day.
[01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:36.700]   I don't want to be excessively vague there.
[01:38:36.700 --> 01:38:38.320]   What I'm trying to say is I try and adhere
[01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:40.460]   to the same schedule, but if I get a poor night's sleep,
[01:38:40.460 --> 01:38:43.360]   I'll just simply skip the workout the next day,
[01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:44.840]   slide the workout forward.
[01:38:44.840 --> 01:38:46.120]   There is one exception to that,
[01:38:46.120 --> 01:38:47.360]   and it's an important exception,
[01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:50.840]   which is there are times when I've not slept well
[01:38:50.840 --> 01:38:53.320]   or I've had some particularly stressful event,
[01:38:53.320 --> 01:38:55.480]   the day before and haven't slept well,
[01:38:55.480 --> 01:38:58.480]   but I'm able to do so-called NSDR,
[01:38:58.480 --> 01:39:00.240]   non-sleep deep rest the next day.
[01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:02.680]   So there have been times when I've only got three
[01:39:02.680 --> 01:39:04.460]   or four hours of sleep the night before,
[01:39:04.460 --> 01:39:07.600]   and I'm feeling really behind the ball the next morning.
[01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:08.840]   I really want to get my workout in.
[01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:11.280]   So instead, what I will do is a 10,
[01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:12.480]   but ideally in that case,
[01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:15.600]   a 30 or even 60 minutes non-sleep deep rest.
[01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:18.360]   And there's a 10-minute non-sleep deep rest protocol
[01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:20.360]   read by me,
[01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:24.880]   but it is a non-spiritual, non-mystical,
[01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:27.920]   science-supported, non-sleep deep rest protocol
[01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:28.760]   available on YouTube.
[01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:30.480]   You can simply put my name Huberman,
[01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:32.920]   put N-S-D-R and Virtusan,
[01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:36.200]   V-I-R-T-U-S-A-N into YouTube,
[01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:37.200]   and you'll find that script.
[01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:39.640]   There are other NSDR scripts that you can find now
[01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:41.600]   on Spotify and on YouTube.
[01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:42.600]   And if you fall asleep
[01:39:42.600 --> 01:39:45.040]   during those non-sleep deep rest scripts, that's great.
[01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:46.020]   And if you don't,
[01:39:46.020 --> 01:39:48.480]   you will also find that it will restore your ability
[01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:50.680]   to perform mental and physical work.
[01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:54.040]   So there are times when I haven't gotten as much sleep
[01:39:54.040 --> 01:39:54.880]   as I would like,
[01:39:54.880 --> 01:39:57.460]   or I'm feeling a bit more stressed for whatever reason,
[01:39:57.460 --> 01:40:00.800]   and I'll do NSDR and then I will go train.
[01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:03.280]   And that often works fabulously well for me.
[01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:05.400]   And then I don't have to skip a workout entirely
[01:40:05.400 --> 01:40:07.080]   just because I didn't get a good night's sleep.
[01:40:07.080 --> 01:40:09.160]   A lot of people ask whether or not
[01:40:09.160 --> 01:40:10.680]   you should train fasted or fed.
[01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:12.520]   And this is a very controversial area.
[01:40:12.520 --> 01:40:15.400]   I personally prefer to do my cardiovascular work
[01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:17.280]   not having eaten anything
[01:40:18.120 --> 01:40:21.160]   in the previous three to 10 hours.
[01:40:21.160 --> 01:40:23.240]   And typically that's because I wake up
[01:40:23.240 --> 01:40:24.820]   and I'll do the cardiovascular training
[01:40:24.820 --> 01:40:27.500]   within about an hour of waking up,
[01:40:27.500 --> 01:40:30.000]   sometimes later because my first meal generally falls,
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.420]   generally not always, falls around 11 a.m.
[01:40:32.420 --> 01:40:35.000]   I don't do any kind of formal intermittent fasting,
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:38.780]   but typically my meal schedule is somewhere between 11 a.m.
[01:40:38.780 --> 01:40:40.920]   and my last bite of food is around 8 p.m.,
[01:40:40.920 --> 01:40:42.360]   but I'm not super strict about that.
[01:40:42.360 --> 01:40:45.160]   I might eat in as late as 9 p.m.
[01:40:45.160 --> 01:40:46.840]   and I might eat something at 10 a.m.
[01:40:46.840 --> 01:40:48.620]   If I wake up really hungry, I might have something
[01:40:48.620 --> 01:40:49.460]   before 11 a.m.
[01:40:49.460 --> 01:40:51.080]   I'm not neurotic about it.
[01:40:51.080 --> 01:40:54.320]   But in terms of training, I like to train fasted
[01:40:54.320 --> 01:40:56.140]   and that includes the resistance training workouts
[01:40:56.140 --> 01:40:58.100]   and those come early in the day for me.
[01:40:58.100 --> 01:41:01.020]   And typically if I'm going to train legs on Monday,
[01:41:01.020 --> 01:41:02.680]   for instance, which is when I train legs,
[01:41:02.680 --> 01:41:04.160]   I'll make sure that the night before
[01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:06.920]   I'm ingesting some starch, some carbohydrate,
[01:41:06.920 --> 01:41:09.400]   like rice or pasta or something of that sort
[01:41:09.400 --> 01:41:12.280]   to make sure that when I do that morning leg workout
[01:41:12.280 --> 01:41:14.400]   I have enough glycogen in the muscles, et cetera.
[01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:16.680]   Again, nutrition is a somewhat controversial area.
[01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:19.720]   In fact, it can evoke very strong feelings
[01:41:19.720 --> 01:41:21.880]   'cause I know we've got vegans and we've got omnivores
[01:41:21.880 --> 01:41:24.120]   and we've got carnivores and people who are keto.
[01:41:24.120 --> 01:41:27.680]   This isn't really the format for us to get into all of that.
[01:41:27.680 --> 01:41:30.200]   I think the rule to follow is figure out
[01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:31.800]   what optimizes your training
[01:41:31.800 --> 01:41:33.840]   for your particular training goals.
[01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:36.720]   For me, that most often means training fasted
[01:41:36.720 --> 01:41:38.720]   and then eating pretty soon after I train.
[01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:42.960]   And if it's a high intensity resistance training workout,
[01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:44.920]   and frankly, all of my resistance training workouts
[01:41:44.920 --> 01:41:45.860]   are pretty high intensity,
[01:41:45.860 --> 01:41:47.420]   I'm not going to failure on every set,
[01:41:47.420 --> 01:41:51.400]   but at least about 30% of those sets, I'm going to failure.
[01:41:51.400 --> 01:41:54.200]   And the other sets I'm working very hard nonetheless.
[01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:55.920]   Well, then I eat some starches after I train
[01:41:55.920 --> 01:41:57.220]   and I also ingest some protein
[01:41:57.220 --> 01:41:59.200]   in the form of a protein drink or a meal
[01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:01.180]   that includes some protein food.
[01:42:01.180 --> 01:42:03.720]   But I don't like to eat before I do resistance training
[01:42:03.720 --> 01:42:06.120]   or at least not within the hour or two
[01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:08.200]   before I do resistance training.
[01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:09.440]   There are exceptions to that.
[01:42:09.440 --> 01:42:11.440]   And I should say that the same basically applies
[01:42:11.440 --> 01:42:12.520]   to endurance work.
[01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:14.240]   If I'm going to head out for a run,
[01:42:14.240 --> 01:42:16.780]   typically I don't want my belly full of food
[01:42:16.780 --> 01:42:18.120]   or any food at all.
[01:42:18.120 --> 01:42:21.440]   But there are times where I wake up hungry
[01:42:21.440 --> 01:42:23.220]   and I very much need to eat something
[01:42:23.220 --> 01:42:25.760]   or I have something scheduled socially like a breakfast
[01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:27.520]   and I'll have that breakfast.
[01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:30.980]   And then an hour or 90 minutes later, I'll do my workout
[01:42:30.980 --> 01:42:33.440]   because I want to make sure that I finish the workout.
[01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:35.300]   I, again, I'm not neurotically attached
[01:42:35.300 --> 01:42:37.360]   to training fasted or fed.
[01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:40.280]   For me, fasted is preferred, but if I have to train fed,
[01:42:40.280 --> 01:42:42.400]   better to train than to not train at all.
[01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:44.520]   We haven't talked so much about flexibility yet,
[01:42:44.520 --> 01:42:47.160]   but we did an entire episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast
[01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:48.540]   on flexibility.
[01:42:48.540 --> 01:42:51.040]   And I encourage you to check out that episode
[01:42:51.040 --> 01:42:54.400]   if you're interested in increasing your flexibility.
[01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:56.760]   But the basic takeaway from that episode
[01:42:56.760 --> 01:42:58.360]   is that if you look at what I like to call
[01:42:58.360 --> 01:43:01.140]   the center of mass of the research,
[01:43:01.140 --> 01:43:03.380]   that is most of the studies and what the conclusions
[01:43:03.380 --> 01:43:05.200]   of most of the quality studies point to,
[01:43:05.200 --> 01:43:08.320]   so not the exceptions, but the kind of general rules
[01:43:08.320 --> 01:43:10.640]   that have been gleaned over time from multiple labs
[01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:12.620]   over multiple decades, et cetera,
[01:43:12.620 --> 01:43:15.120]   what you find is that static stretching
[01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:18.640]   that is holding a stretch and in fact exhaling
[01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:21.520]   and relaxing the midsection and torso
[01:43:21.520 --> 01:43:24.000]   and relaxing into the stretch
[01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:27.000]   as opposed to staying full of air and tense,
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:30.320]   but mentally and physically relaxing into the stretch,
[01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:33.000]   but not stretching maximally,
[01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:36.040]   that is not extending as far as you possibly can go,
[01:43:36.040 --> 01:43:38.520]   but more like 60% or even less.
[01:43:38.520 --> 01:43:41.580]   And then holding those static stretches
[01:43:41.580 --> 01:43:45.120]   for anywhere from 30 to 60 seconds and then repeating,
[01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:47.160]   doing that two or three times throughout the week
[01:43:47.160 --> 01:43:48.200]   for multiple muscle groups.
[01:43:48.200 --> 01:43:49.560]   So it could be for your quadriceps,
[01:43:49.560 --> 01:43:51.760]   could be for hamstrings, for your lats.
[01:43:51.760 --> 01:43:52.720]   There are protocols out there.
[01:43:52.720 --> 01:43:56.180]   In fact, we have a newsletter that is focused entirely
[01:43:56.180 --> 01:43:58.160]   on protocols for flexibility and stretching.
[01:43:58.160 --> 01:44:00.660]   You can find that again by going HubermanLab.com.
[01:44:00.660 --> 01:44:02.320]   You don't even need to sign up for the newsletter,
[01:44:02.320 --> 01:44:04.160]   although we invite you to if you like,
[01:44:04.160 --> 01:44:05.760]   but you can simply go there,
[01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:08.120]   scroll down to the flexibility newsletter
[01:44:08.120 --> 01:44:09.840]   and all the protocols are there
[01:44:09.840 --> 01:44:11.760]   for each of the muscle groups, et cetera.
[01:44:11.760 --> 01:44:13.200]   But what I typically try and do
[01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:15.200]   is some stretching in the evening,
[01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:16.960]   because I train in the morning,
[01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:19.720]   as I'm perhaps getting ready for bed,
[01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:21.880]   or if the TV is on,
[01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:24.460]   which in our house doesn't typically go on
[01:44:24.460 --> 01:44:25.800]   because we don't have a TV,
[01:44:25.800 --> 01:44:27.040]   but of course there are computers
[01:44:27.040 --> 01:44:29.720]   and people are on their computers, et cetera.
[01:44:29.720 --> 01:44:31.980]   Well, I'll try and do some stretching while I do that.
[01:44:31.980 --> 01:44:33.220]   I also have a standing desk.
[01:44:33.220 --> 01:44:34.720]   So during the day at work,
[01:44:34.720 --> 01:44:37.120]   regardless of whether or not I train that morning or not,
[01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:38.300]   or I'm going to train in the afternoon,
[01:44:38.300 --> 01:44:40.160]   I'll try and do some static stretching
[01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:41.880]   for my hamstrings, my quads,
[01:44:41.880 --> 01:44:43.860]   my lats, my shoulders, my back,
[01:44:43.860 --> 01:44:44.960]   really doesn't take much time.
[01:44:44.960 --> 01:44:47.420]   And I really try to space that out throughout the week,
[01:44:47.420 --> 01:44:50.300]   which if you look at the peer-reviewed research,
[01:44:50.300 --> 01:44:52.540]   matches well to what's known to be most effective,
[01:44:52.540 --> 01:44:54.560]   which are going to be short repeated sessions,
[01:44:54.560 --> 01:44:55.840]   ideally every day.
[01:44:55.840 --> 01:44:58.680]   But truth told, I fail.
[01:44:58.680 --> 01:45:00.160]   I categorically fail.
[01:45:00.160 --> 01:45:01.200]   I was about to think of whether or not
[01:45:01.200 --> 01:45:02.720]   I ever stretch every day.
[01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:03.800]   I fail to do it every day,
[01:45:03.800 --> 01:45:07.020]   but I get about three or so stretching sessions
[01:45:07.020 --> 01:45:07.860]   in per week.
[01:45:07.860 --> 01:45:09.100]   And again, it's just static hold,
[01:45:09.100 --> 01:45:11.580]   trying to really relax into the stretch.
[01:45:11.580 --> 01:45:14.180]   Now, the relax into the stretch is something
[01:45:14.180 --> 01:45:17.180]   has been talked about in martial arts circles.
[01:45:17.180 --> 01:45:19.640]   And Pavel Satsoulin has an excellent book on stretching.
[01:45:19.640 --> 01:45:21.480]   We can provide a link to that.
[01:45:21.480 --> 01:45:22.400]   He talks about this.
[01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:25.320]   Has a lot to do with relaxation of the nervous system
[01:45:25.320 --> 01:45:26.940]   and the way that the nerves innervate muscles
[01:45:26.940 --> 01:45:28.960]   and allow for stretch, if you will.
[01:45:28.960 --> 01:45:30.560]   Also the way that the tendons and ligaments
[01:45:30.560 --> 01:45:33.160]   are innervated by nerves.
[01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:34.600]   The converse is also true.
[01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:36.320]   And here, again, this is a principle
[01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:38.280]   that Pavel has put forth.
[01:45:38.280 --> 01:45:39.900]   I believe he calls it irradiation,
[01:45:39.900 --> 01:45:43.520]   meaning irradiating out or emanating out from a source,
[01:45:43.520 --> 01:45:47.540]   which is that while exhaling and relaxing the torso,
[01:45:47.540 --> 01:45:50.080]   the midsection, some people call it the core,
[01:45:50.080 --> 01:45:53.520]   although some people don't like that term,
[01:45:53.520 --> 01:45:56.780]   can facilitate relaxation and stretching
[01:45:56.780 --> 01:45:58.480]   through a larger range of motion.
[01:45:58.480 --> 01:46:02.960]   So too can contracting the core, the midsection,
[01:46:02.960 --> 01:46:05.880]   or gripping very tightly with the fist
[01:46:05.880 --> 01:46:08.000]   can facilitate muscular contraction
[01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:11.160]   because of the way that the nervous system heavily,
[01:46:11.160 --> 01:46:15.440]   we can even say over represents the fists in the brain.
[01:46:15.440 --> 01:46:16.880]   And so how would you apply this
[01:46:16.880 --> 01:46:19.720]   to your overall foundational fitness protocol?
[01:46:19.720 --> 01:46:23.240]   Well, it turns out that let's say you're doing a movement
[01:46:23.240 --> 01:46:26.320]   that involves one limb moving and then the other.
[01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:28.880]   Let's say it's bicep curls, just for sake of example.
[01:46:28.880 --> 01:46:31.440]   It turns out that you will actually be stronger
[01:46:31.440 --> 01:46:34.360]   in moving that dumbbell with the arm
[01:46:34.360 --> 01:46:35.980]   that happens to be moving
[01:46:35.980 --> 01:46:38.720]   if you grip the handle very tightly,
[01:46:38.720 --> 01:46:40.280]   but also grip the handle
[01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:42.920]   of the opposite dumbbell very tightly.
[01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:44.620]   Now that said, in between sets,
[01:46:44.620 --> 01:46:46.280]   I encourage you to do the opposite,
[01:46:46.280 --> 01:46:48.120]   to try and completely relax in between sets,
[01:46:48.120 --> 01:46:49.800]   combine that with a physiological sigh.
[01:46:49.800 --> 01:46:53.120]   And then when the next set commences,
[01:46:53.120 --> 01:46:54.840]   employ that very strong grip,
[01:46:54.840 --> 01:46:56.760]   both again of the weight that's moving
[01:46:56.760 --> 01:46:59.300]   and the weight that at that moment might be stationary
[01:46:59.300 --> 01:47:01.160]   or in isometric position.
[01:47:01.160 --> 01:47:03.480]   So the nervous system, of course,
[01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:04.960]   is what controls muscles,
[01:47:04.960 --> 01:47:07.280]   and that operates in both directions.
[01:47:07.280 --> 01:47:09.840]   If you want to relax, try and use long exhales,
[01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:11.280]   maybe even physiological sighs,
[01:47:11.280 --> 01:47:13.960]   and really concentrate on mentally and physically relaxing,
[01:47:13.960 --> 01:47:17.140]   in particular your core and your fists.
[01:47:17.140 --> 01:47:19.680]   And if you want to generate force, right,
[01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:22.400]   you want to move a heavy barbell or dumbbell,
[01:47:22.400 --> 01:47:24.680]   you want to do a chin up with the maximal force,
[01:47:24.680 --> 01:47:25.980]   that's when you can employ the opposite,
[01:47:25.980 --> 01:47:28.080]   which would be to grip the bar or dumbbell, et cetera,
[01:47:28.080 --> 01:47:31.440]   very tightly, and you want to contract your core
[01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:33.880]   or even fill your body with air as they say,
[01:47:33.880 --> 01:47:35.800]   plug all the leaks, et cetera.
[01:47:35.800 --> 01:47:37.920]   So this gets into kind of form and movement,
[01:47:37.920 --> 01:47:42.040]   which is an extensive near infinite landscape of discussion,
[01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:43.640]   again, that we don't have time to go into.
[01:47:43.640 --> 01:47:46.360]   I just want to mention those two nervous system related tips
[01:47:46.360 --> 01:47:48.280]   because I suppose as a neuroscientist,
[01:47:48.280 --> 01:47:49.860]   they appeal to me because they are grounded
[01:47:49.860 --> 01:47:51.040]   in fundamental principles
[01:47:51.040 --> 01:47:52.760]   of how the nervous system innervates muscle,
[01:47:52.760 --> 01:47:54.280]   and I know that they will benefit you
[01:47:54.280 --> 01:47:56.400]   the first time you use them and every time.
[01:47:56.400 --> 01:47:57.920]   Speaking of grip and nervous system
[01:47:57.920 --> 01:47:59.160]   and fitness and longevity,
[01:47:59.160 --> 01:48:01.480]   Dr. Peter Attia, who is a medical doctor,
[01:48:01.480 --> 01:48:03.160]   was a guest on the Huberman Lab Podcast
[01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:05.200]   and provided an enormous wealth of information
[01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:06.380]   on that podcast episode.
[01:48:06.380 --> 01:48:09.280]   I really encourage you to check it out when you have time.
[01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:11.560]   And of course, has his own spectacular podcast,
[01:48:11.560 --> 01:48:13.260]   The Drive with Peter Attia.
[01:48:13.260 --> 01:48:15.680]   Peter, Dr. Attia, I should say,
[01:48:15.680 --> 01:48:19.880]   often talks about certain movements or exercises
[01:48:19.880 --> 01:48:22.080]   that you should perform, not just to improve your fitness,
[01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:25.520]   but also to touch into or measure how fit you are
[01:48:25.520 --> 01:48:28.840]   and how well you are progressing toward a long lifespan
[01:48:28.840 --> 01:48:29.680]   and health span.
[01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:32.560]   And one of those includes the ability to hang from a bar
[01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:34.040]   for a minute or longer.
[01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:37.640]   And there are a number of different expectations
[01:48:37.640 --> 01:48:40.120]   that one can have of how long they should be able
[01:48:40.120 --> 01:48:42.120]   to hang from a bar, depending on their age
[01:48:42.120 --> 01:48:43.440]   and their fitness level, et cetera.
[01:48:43.440 --> 01:48:45.920]   Please check out Dr. Attia's podcast
[01:48:45.920 --> 01:48:47.760]   and his various social media sites
[01:48:47.760 --> 01:48:49.240]   to get more information on that.
[01:48:49.240 --> 01:48:51.320]   But what I can tell you is that if you're going to hang
[01:48:51.320 --> 01:48:53.760]   from a bar and you want to hang from that bar
[01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:56.460]   as long as possible, which turns out to be a interesting
[01:48:56.460 --> 01:48:58.980]   and important metric of your health,
[01:48:58.980 --> 01:49:01.500]   then gripping the bar very tightly will actually help.
[01:49:01.500 --> 01:49:03.560]   Earlier, we talked about whether or not to train
[01:49:03.560 --> 01:49:06.360]   if you're sleep deprived and how to recover
[01:49:06.360 --> 01:49:09.640]   from what I would say is moderate sleep deprivation
[01:49:09.640 --> 01:49:12.840]   by doing NSDR as opposed to total sleep deprivation,
[01:49:12.840 --> 01:49:15.720]   like being up all night or having a truly miserable night,
[01:49:15.720 --> 01:49:18.160]   which case I think you should just skip training
[01:49:18.160 --> 01:49:19.860]   the next day and slide it forward.
[01:49:19.860 --> 01:49:22.700]   Now, a similar issue comes up from time to time
[01:49:22.700 --> 01:49:26.020]   where people wonder whether or not they should train or not
[01:49:26.020 --> 01:49:27.200]   if they are sick.
[01:49:27.200 --> 01:49:31.720]   And here there's all sorts of crazy gym lore
[01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:34.060]   and sport specific lore.
[01:49:34.060 --> 01:49:36.340]   For instance, I used to hear this.
[01:49:36.340 --> 01:49:40.120]   When I ran cross country, there was this adage
[01:49:40.120 --> 01:49:44.200]   that if the symptoms were from the neck up,
[01:49:44.200 --> 01:49:45.120]   you could still train.
[01:49:45.120 --> 01:49:46.480]   That is, if you were really congested
[01:49:46.480 --> 01:49:48.640]   and you had a headache, you could still run.
[01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:50.680]   Whereas if it was in your chest and in your lungs,
[01:49:50.680 --> 01:49:51.720]   you couldn't run.
[01:49:51.720 --> 01:49:54.920]   I don't think there's any data whatsoever to support
[01:49:54.920 --> 01:49:58.300]   whether or not that's true or whether it's not true
[01:49:58.300 --> 01:50:02.240]   for myself and because my general goal
[01:50:02.240 --> 01:50:06.280]   is to be training and fit over time,
[01:50:06.280 --> 01:50:10.380]   but also to include general health in the fitness equation,
[01:50:10.380 --> 01:50:12.640]   that is to not be sick or chronically sick
[01:50:12.640 --> 01:50:15.300]   and certainly not to get other people sick.
[01:50:15.300 --> 01:50:17.940]   If I have a little tiny sniffle,
[01:50:17.940 --> 01:50:20.060]   like I think I might be getting sick,
[01:50:20.060 --> 01:50:22.580]   even then I'm a little cautious in the sense
[01:50:22.580 --> 01:50:25.740]   that I'm not going to do my typical workout.
[01:50:25.740 --> 01:50:28.440]   I might stop it about 15 minutes earlier
[01:50:28.440 --> 01:50:31.720]   and I would do that not by neglecting any body parts
[01:50:31.720 --> 01:50:32.620]   or anything of that sort.
[01:50:32.620 --> 01:50:33.620]   If it's a weight training workout
[01:50:33.620 --> 01:50:36.720]   by simply reducing the total number of sets,
[01:50:36.720 --> 01:50:39.100]   I probably wouldn't do any sets to failure.
[01:50:39.100 --> 01:50:41.280]   If I did, I might reduce the total number
[01:50:41.280 --> 01:50:44.220]   or percentage of sets to failure from about 30% of sets
[01:50:44.220 --> 01:50:48.040]   to maybe closer to 10% of sets, something like that.
[01:50:48.040 --> 01:50:49.280]   And if it was endurance work,
[01:50:49.280 --> 01:50:51.800]   I might throttle back by 10 or 20%
[01:50:51.800 --> 01:50:54.300]   and I will shorten the total duration of the workout.
[01:50:54.300 --> 01:50:58.060]   And I often find that because of the known,
[01:50:58.060 --> 01:51:01.220]   yes, peer reviewed, known immune system enhancing effects
[01:51:01.220 --> 01:51:04.340]   of exercise, sometimes that alone will allow me
[01:51:04.340 --> 01:51:06.020]   to avoid getting sick.
[01:51:06.020 --> 01:51:08.060]   But of course, I'm also careful to get home,
[01:51:08.060 --> 01:51:11.660]   take a hot shower, not stress myself out if I can,
[01:51:11.660 --> 01:51:13.940]   avoid getting myself stressed out and focus on sleep,
[01:51:13.940 --> 01:51:17.660]   NSDR, other forms of recovery, good nutrition, et cetera.
[01:51:17.660 --> 01:51:20.300]   If however, I have a real sniffle, a cold,
[01:51:20.300 --> 01:51:21.900]   I'm not feeling well,
[01:51:21.900 --> 01:51:23.460]   or I think I might be coming down with a flu,
[01:51:23.460 --> 01:51:24.740]   I absolutely do not train
[01:51:24.740 --> 01:51:26.920]   and I don't get back into training of any kind
[01:51:26.920 --> 01:51:29.680]   until I'm completely recovered.
[01:51:29.680 --> 01:51:31.860]   So what I'm basically saying is that, no,
[01:51:31.860 --> 01:51:34.380]   I don't believe you should train if you're sick.
[01:51:34.380 --> 01:51:37.180]   And perhaps equally importantly,
[01:51:37.180 --> 01:51:39.680]   when you come back from a layoff of any kind,
[01:51:39.680 --> 01:51:43.440]   whether or not because of illness or for whatever reason,
[01:51:43.440 --> 01:51:46.520]   I do believe that because your body is a bit untrained,
[01:51:46.520 --> 01:51:49.700]   it's not ideal to jump right back into maximal training
[01:51:49.700 --> 01:51:53.260]   and to take one, maybe two weeks of ramping up
[01:51:53.260 --> 01:51:55.620]   to the full duration and intensity of workouts
[01:51:55.620 --> 01:51:57.700]   that then I would continue on going
[01:51:57.700 --> 01:52:01.080]   for however many cycles I can complete
[01:52:01.080 --> 01:52:03.940]   before I hit another sickness
[01:52:03.940 --> 01:52:05.900]   or I hit another gap in my schedule
[01:52:05.900 --> 01:52:09.060]   due to family obligations or other obligations, et cetera.
[01:52:09.060 --> 01:52:11.380]   So we've covered a lot of tools and protocols
[01:52:11.380 --> 01:52:13.620]   and variables related to fitness,
[01:52:13.620 --> 01:52:16.380]   but we have by no means covered all the available tools
[01:52:16.380 --> 01:52:17.780]   and protocols and variables.
[01:52:18.720 --> 01:52:21.740]   Before we wrap up, I do want to emphasize one tool.
[01:52:21.740 --> 01:52:24.640]   It's a very easy, in fact, zero cost,
[01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:27.180]   very low time commitment tool.
[01:52:27.180 --> 01:52:29.100]   And this was one that was provided again
[01:52:29.100 --> 01:52:32.580]   by Dr. Andy Galpin when he was on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[01:52:32.580 --> 01:52:35.100]   And it's a tool that there's excellent research
[01:52:35.100 --> 01:52:37.780]   to support the effectiveness of,
[01:52:37.780 --> 01:52:39.580]   and that I do believe should come
[01:52:39.580 --> 01:52:42.100]   at the end of every training session.
[01:52:42.100 --> 01:52:44.980]   And that's to do three to five minutes
[01:52:44.980 --> 01:52:47.660]   of deliberately slow breathing.
[01:52:47.660 --> 01:52:49.020]   It sounds so simple.
[01:52:49.020 --> 01:52:52.280]   Three to five minutes of deliberately slowed breathing.
[01:52:52.280 --> 01:52:54.280]   So this could be while you're in the shower
[01:52:54.280 --> 01:52:56.000]   or when you arrive at your car,
[01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:57.760]   you might sit in your car quietly and do that
[01:52:57.760 --> 01:53:00.580]   if you have time, or maybe even while you're driving
[01:53:00.580 --> 01:53:04.660]   back to or onto your next destination,
[01:53:04.660 --> 01:53:06.820]   just to really slow down your breathing,
[01:53:06.820 --> 01:53:09.500]   to really look at the recovery period
[01:53:09.500 --> 01:53:11.680]   that has to follow each training session.
[01:53:11.680 --> 01:53:13.620]   And of course, during which the adaptations,
[01:53:13.620 --> 01:53:15.800]   the changes that make you more fit
[01:53:15.800 --> 01:53:18.940]   than you were going into the exercise occur.
[01:53:18.940 --> 01:53:20.340]   And that three to five minutes
[01:53:20.340 --> 01:53:22.880]   of deliberately slowed breathing has been shown
[01:53:22.880 --> 01:53:25.980]   in Andy's group and in related experiments,
[01:53:25.980 --> 01:53:27.940]   not exactly the same, but related experiments
[01:53:27.940 --> 01:53:30.100]   in our laboratory and in other laboratories
[01:53:30.100 --> 01:53:32.700]   to really so-called downshift the nervous system
[01:53:32.700 --> 01:53:36.060]   and really set you up for maximal recovery,
[01:53:36.060 --> 01:53:38.260]   rapid recovery, and allow you to lean
[01:53:38.260 --> 01:53:40.540]   into the next training session with full intensity
[01:53:40.540 --> 01:53:42.460]   when that training session eventually arrives.
[01:53:42.460 --> 01:53:45.880]   So it's a very simple tool, but a very potent tool
[01:53:45.880 --> 01:53:47.360]   for your overall fitness.
[01:53:47.360 --> 01:53:49.320]   So thank you for joining me for this discussion
[01:53:49.320 --> 01:53:52.320]   of what I'm calling a foundational,
[01:53:52.320 --> 01:53:53.620]   I guess we could even get bold
[01:53:53.620 --> 01:53:55.360]   and call it an optimal fitness protocol,
[01:53:55.360 --> 01:53:57.820]   although the word optimal is a tricky one.
[01:53:57.820 --> 01:53:59.960]   There's no real optimal fitness protocol.
[01:53:59.960 --> 01:54:01.960]   And today, what I've really tried to focus on
[01:54:01.960 --> 01:54:03.880]   is this foundational protocol,
[01:54:03.880 --> 01:54:07.120]   because it does allow you to check off
[01:54:07.120 --> 01:54:11.240]   most if not all the boxes related to strength,
[01:54:11.240 --> 01:54:16.240]   endurance, hypertrophy, speed, power, flexibility.
[01:54:16.240 --> 01:54:20.000]   It will also teach you how to regulate your nervous system
[01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.740]   up and down, that is to ramp up and focus,
[01:54:22.740 --> 01:54:24.580]   mind muscle link, et cetera,
[01:54:24.580 --> 01:54:27.200]   and then quickly calm down, physiological size,
[01:54:27.200 --> 01:54:28.740]   three to five minute decompressed breathing
[01:54:28.740 --> 01:54:30.500]   at the end of training, et cetera.
[01:54:30.500 --> 01:54:32.500]   Really, even though I talked about the protocol
[01:54:32.500 --> 01:54:34.780]   that I follow, and again, that we will provide
[01:54:34.780 --> 01:54:37.300]   as a newsletter at HubermanLab.com,
[01:54:37.300 --> 01:54:39.340]   if you want to look at it in more detail,
[01:54:39.340 --> 01:54:40.860]   even though we talked about it in the context
[01:54:40.860 --> 01:54:43.500]   of what I do, again, I really want to emphasize
[01:54:43.500 --> 01:54:46.960]   that this protocol and the description of this protocol
[01:54:46.960 --> 01:54:49.080]   and all its variables is really for you
[01:54:49.080 --> 01:54:51.780]   and for you to tailor to your specific needs.
[01:54:51.780 --> 01:54:55.360]   So please take the protocol into consideration,
[01:54:55.360 --> 01:54:56.620]   but do not treat it as wholly.
[01:54:56.620 --> 01:54:59.780]   Treat it as a starting point from which you can adapt it
[01:54:59.780 --> 01:55:02.100]   to your specific fitness needs.
[01:55:02.100 --> 01:55:03.500]   If you're learning from and are enjoying
[01:55:03.500 --> 01:55:04.900]   the Huberman Lab podcast,
[01:55:04.900 --> 01:55:06.620]   please subscribe to our YouTube channel.
[01:55:06.620 --> 01:55:09.200]   That's a terrific zero cost way to support us.

[01:55:18.680 --> 01:55:20.180]   If you have questions for us or comments
[01:55:20.180 --> 01:55:21.760]   about the information we've covered
[01:55:21.760 --> 01:55:23.820]   or suggestions about future guests,
[01:55:23.820 --> 01:55:26.200]   please put those in the comment section on YouTube.
[01:55:26.200 --> 01:55:28.040]   We do read all the comments.
[01:55:28.040 --> 01:55:29.600]   Please also check out the sponsors mentioned
[01:55:29.600 --> 01:55:31.260]   at the beginning of today's episode.
[01:55:31.260 --> 01:55:34.120]   That's the best way to support the Huberman Lab podcast.
[01:55:34.120 --> 01:55:36.280]   Not so much today, but in many previous episodes
[01:55:36.280 --> 01:55:38.680]   of the Huberman Lab podcast, we talk about supplements.
[01:55:38.680 --> 01:55:40.880]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[01:55:40.880 --> 01:55:42.900]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[01:55:42.900 --> 01:55:44.860]   for things like enhancing sleep and focus
[01:55:44.860 --> 01:55:46.540]   and hormone optimization.
[01:55:46.540 --> 01:55:48.000]   The Huberman Lab podcast has partnered
[01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:49.200]   with Momentous Supplements.
[01:55:49.200 --> 01:55:50.280]   If you'd like to see the supplements
[01:55:50.280 --> 01:55:51.760]   that the Huberman Lab podcast has partnered
[01:55:51.760 --> 01:55:54.240]   with Momentous on, you can go to Live Momentous,
[01:55:54.240 --> 01:55:57.680]   spelled O-U-S, so livemomentous.com/huberman.
[01:55:57.680 --> 01:55:59.640]   And there you'll see a number of the supplements
[01:55:59.640 --> 01:56:01.600]   that we talk about regularly on the podcast.
[01:56:01.600 --> 01:56:03.540]   I should just mention that that catalog of supplements
[01:56:03.540 --> 01:56:05.140]   is constantly being updated.
[01:56:05.140 --> 01:56:06.960]   As mentioned at the beginning of today's episode,
[01:56:06.960 --> 01:56:08.600]   the Huberman Lab podcast has now launched
[01:56:08.600 --> 01:56:10.000]   a premium channel.
[01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.560]   That premium channel will feature monthly AMAs
[01:56:12.560 --> 01:56:15.440]   or ask me anythings where I answer your questions in depth,
[01:56:15.440 --> 01:56:17.400]   as well as other premium resources.
[01:56:17.400 --> 01:56:19.240]   If you'd like to subscribe to the premium channel,
[01:56:19.240 --> 01:56:22.840]   you can simply go to HubermanLab.com/premium.
[01:56:22.840 --> 01:56:25.440]   I should mention that the proceeds from the premium channel
[01:56:25.440 --> 01:56:27.640]   go to support the standard Huberman Lab podcast,
[01:56:27.640 --> 01:56:30.960]   which will continue to be released every Monday per usual,
[01:56:30.960 --> 01:56:34.120]   as well as supporting various research projects done
[01:56:34.120 --> 01:56:36.800]   on humans to create the sorts of tools for mental health,
[01:56:36.800 --> 01:56:39.040]   physical health, and performance that you hear about
[01:56:39.040 --> 01:56:40.360]   on the Huberman Lab podcast.
[01:56:40.360 --> 01:56:43.480]   Again, it's HubermanLab.com/premium to subscribe.
[01:56:43.480 --> 01:56:46.560]   It's $10 a month or $100 per year.
[01:56:46.560 --> 01:56:47.760]   If you haven't already subscribed
[01:56:47.760 --> 01:56:49.440]   to our zero-cost newsletter,
[01:56:49.440 --> 01:56:52.060]   we have what is called the neural network newsletter.
[01:56:52.060 --> 01:56:54.500]   You can subscribe by going to HubermanLab.com,
[01:56:54.500 --> 01:56:56.320]   go to the menu and click on newsletter.
[01:56:56.320 --> 01:56:59.080]   Those newsletters include summaries of podcast episodes,
[01:56:59.080 --> 01:57:01.620]   lists of tools from the Huberman Lab podcast.
[01:57:01.620 --> 01:57:03.860]   And if you'd like to see previous newsletters
[01:57:03.860 --> 01:57:06.120]   we've released, you can also just go to HubermanLab.com,
[01:57:06.120 --> 01:57:07.440]   click on newsletter in the menu,
[01:57:07.440 --> 01:57:09.680]   and you'll see various downloadable PDFs.
[01:57:09.680 --> 01:57:11.360]   If you want to sign up for the newsletter,
[01:57:11.360 --> 01:57:12.480]   we just ask for your email.
[01:57:12.480 --> 01:57:14.400]   We do not share your email with anybody.
[01:57:14.400 --> 01:57:16.660]   And again, it's completely zero cost.
[01:57:16.660 --> 01:57:18.640]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[01:57:18.640 --> 01:57:22.120]   it's Huberman Lab on Twitter, on Facebook, and on Instagram.
[01:57:22.120 --> 01:57:23.860]   And at all three of those places,
[01:57:23.860 --> 01:57:26.320]   I cover topics and subject matter
[01:57:26.320 --> 01:57:28.980]   that are sometimes overlapping with the information covered
[01:57:28.980 --> 01:57:30.160]   on the Huberman Lab podcast,
[01:57:30.160 --> 01:57:32.200]   but that's often distinct from information
[01:57:32.200 --> 01:57:33.620]   on the Huberman Lab podcast.
[01:57:33.620 --> 01:57:36.460]   Again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media channels.
[01:57:36.460 --> 01:57:38.300]   So thank you for joining me today for our discussion
[01:57:38.300 --> 01:57:41.060]   about building your optimal toolkit for fitness.
[01:57:41.060 --> 01:57:43.300]   And last, but certainly not least,
[01:57:43.300 --> 01:57:45.100]   thank you for your interest in science.
[01:57:45.100 --> 01:57:47.680]   [upbeat music]
[01:57:47.680 --> 01:57:50.260]   (upbeat music)
