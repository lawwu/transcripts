[00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:06.720]   wall street bets is parlor 2.0 right and and what happened as soon as wall street bets started
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.080]   which is the the the reddit kids they started threatening and they wounded these powerful
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:18.000]   insiders these rich you know hedge fund magnates what happened they started getting banned off of
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.920]   discord they got discord as a tech company to kick them off how did that happen they've been
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.880]   talking on there for months and all of a sudden just magically right at the critical moment where
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.760]   they're also not allowed to trade their free speech gets cut off that's a that that was
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.240]   deliberate now i'll tell you how it happens is i guarantee you what these hedge funds did is
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:44.160]   they went through the discord room and they screenshotted you know any post that they
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.080]   could plausibly characterize as you know hate speech or what have you and you know and by the
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.880]   way i mean those there's a lot of raunchiness in these rooms but it's not hate speech and it's not
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.760]   organized for the purpose of hate it's organized for the purpose
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.520]   of the purpose of trades but what they do is they weaponize the censorship rules and they go in and
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.080]   they screenshot and they give it to discord and they get these guys kicked off and this is exactly
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.760]   what i've been talking about with censorship it starts with something you like and then becomes
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.760]   something you don't how many of the people who support these you know reddit kids were in favor
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.280]   of deplatforming trump and parlor and now they can see where it goes this is slippery slope and
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.640]   we've only had to wait three weeks to see where it goes it goes to the same place which is the same
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.920]   same place which is when the people in power get threatened they use these rules they weaponize
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.560]   these rules to shut down the outsiders and the upstarts that is the problem with censorship
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.960]   that is why you cannot let the beast get started
