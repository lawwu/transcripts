[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:22.560]   Welcome to Portfolio Rescue. Each week we get tons of questions sent to our inbox from
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.760]   YouTube viewers, blog readers, podcast listeners, and we decided, "Why don't we make a show
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.400]   to answer these questions?" That's what this show is. Remember, if you have a question,
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.980]   email us, askthecompoundshow@gmail.com. With me, as always, is Duncan. Duncan, how's it
[00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.760]   going, man? Good, good. How are you? Last week, I learned that Duncan broke up a fight
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.720]   in Brooklyn, and are we ready to start a neighborhood watch yet? Is that the next step? Yeah, I
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.280]   mean, we could. We could. Technically, I think it was an attack, not a fight. I was thinking
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.840]   more about it. That's even better. Okay. One quick comment here, if you send us an email.
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.800]   We've been getting tons of detail from people, which is great. How much money they make,
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.760]   how much they have saved, different types of investment accounts they have. If you could
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.260]   do us a favor, if you're going to give us one of these three or four-paragraph emails,
[00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.360]   put it in a TL;DR at the end, three or four sentences, what you're looking for. We can
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.920]   impart the details a little bit in the questions when we answer them, but if you can just break
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.840]   those down for us, that's helpful. Again, we love the details. I think the first one
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.560]   is actually a short question. Duncan, what do we got here?
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.480]   Yeah, on that note, we have a very short question from Patrick in Dublin, Ireland, which is
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.440]   very cool. Patrick says, "I'm a 20-year-old college student from Dublin. My question is,
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.000]   how should young people like me balance saving money to invest with traveling and enjoying
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   life in our 20s?"
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.880]   First of all, I'm very jealous here, because I would love to go to Ireland. My family is
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.200]   Irish. My parents have been there before. This is the conundrum, right? You want to
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.200]   enjoy yourself a little bit, but you also have this whole idea of compounding when you're
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.280]   young. Everyone has seen the examples where you say, "Tom begins saving $300 at age 22.
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.740]   He saves for 10 years, then he stops altogether. Then Greg, on the other hand, begins saving
[00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.500]   $300 a month at age 35, but he keeps saving all the way through retirement at 65. Who
[00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.400]   ends up with more money? Let's say an 8% annual return." I ran the numbers here. Tom
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.560]   wins by a wide margin, over $200,000 more, because he started early and you have that
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.560]   compounding effect.
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.480]   But, you're in your 20s. You don't want to look back and say, "Geez, that's great.
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.720]   I saved all this money, but now what did I do with my life? I want to do that stuff now
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.720]   and I have more responsibilities." That's certainly something that I thought about in
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.640]   my 20s. My wife and I thought, "Hey, by our 30s, we'll have kids. We'll have responsibilities.
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.400]   Let's travel as much as we can." Our whole thing was, we want to go to as many weddings
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.160]   as we can, because in our 20s, everyone has those three or four years where they have
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.280]   the wedding season. We said, "Let's travel when we can go to these places, and let's
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.280]   go on trips, too."
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.480]   There was one time when we took a trip to Mexico on a 10-day notice. I passed the CFA,
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.200]   not to brag, I did. But, after I passed, I didn't want to plan out something in advance
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.360]   and then fail and go on a trip and be miserable. But, I passed, and within 10 days, we decided
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.360]   just to go to Mexico on a whim. That's stuff you can do in your 20s.
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:06.040]   I want people to still have fun. I think a simple way of doing this is just starting
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:12.360]   out small. When I first started working, I made nothing. My salary was $30,000. I made
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.840]   no money. I started saving $50 a month in a Target Day Fund. Then, I worked my way up
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.600]   as I made more money, and I worked my way up in my career.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.320]   I think you also have to think about trade-offs here. I lived in a very shaky apartment my
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.320]   very first year out of school. It was not a great situation. I could have paid $200
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.120]   or $300 more a month to move across town and go into a nicer, newer apartment. But, instead,
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.400]   I wanted to have that money to save and spend and have fun with, so I had my $50 a month
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.600]   that I'm saving. Then, I saved some money by living in a crappy place.
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.520]   I think when you're in your 20s, you have to have some of those trade-offs. If you want
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.960]   to enjoy yourself and also give yourself some good spending and saving habits, you can start
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.440]   out saving small and work your way up, but also have some trade-offs where if you're
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.080]   going to want to enjoy yourself, then maybe somewhere else in life you're going to have
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.200]   to cut back a little bit. What do you think, Duncan?
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.200]   Do you think a lot of this comes from the FIRE movement? I see a lot of these questions
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.380]   coming in now. I think people feel pressure from a young age now to try to retire by 50
[00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.520]   or something like that.
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.160]   I think there could be some middle ground between not saving anything and saving 80%
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.120]   of your income and making your own shampoo in your backyard using wheatgrass or something.
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.940]   You don't have to take it that far. I think there has to be a middle ground where you
[00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.340]   still enjoy yourself. I certainly am glad that I did that in my 20s, because it's really
[00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.520]   hard for us to travel now that we have three kids. It's just not as easy to do. So, do
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.440]   it in your 20s when you don't have as many responsibilities and things holding you back.
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.480]   Yeah, I think that's good advice.
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.120]   Alright, next one.
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:41.580]   Okay, so next up we have a question from Ender who writes, and I left the compliments in,
[00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.900]   you know, but, "Hey guys, thanks for the dope content." I think there was an expletive
[00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.600]   too, but I took that out. "I watch and re-watch like it's Breaking Bad. My mom has $50,000
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.380]   of cash that I just found out about. I wonder if she's the real Walter White." Dot, dot,
[00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:59.300]   dot. "She's 62 and still working as a nurse. Healthy and an amazing person. I would like
[00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.960]   to help her invest this cash, but I can't decide if I should do something like a dividend
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:10.960]   ETF for her or 70% VTI and 30% QQQ or something else altogether. It definitely needs to be
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.220]   something that she can set and forget. If anyone's going to be checking it, it'll be
[00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.220]   me. Thoughts?"
[00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.380]   So, Duncan, before we hop down here, you admitted that you've never seen Breaking Bad before.
[00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:24.220]   Yeah, I quit like one or two episodes in because of that bathtub scene. I couldn't handle it.
[00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.540]   Okay, so just since we're on the subject here, I went back and looked and found some great
[00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:34.100]   money quotes from Breaking Bad. So, John, show the picture here. This is in the storage
[00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:38.860]   container where Skyler, his wife, says, "There's more money here than we could ever spend in
[00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.780]   10 lifetimes. Please tell me how much is enough? How big does this pile have to be?" And of
[00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.940]   course, for him, it was too much. One of my favorite lines, "Jesse, you asked me if I
[00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.460]   was in the meth business or the money business? Neither. I'm in the empire business." That's
[00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.020]   like a businessman, business comma man kind of thing. Here's my other favorite one. "I
[00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.460]   am not in danger, Skyler. I am the danger." I thought that was a good investing one, too,
[00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:04.380]   because it kind of works for this idea, right? "It depends" is a good way of thinking about
[00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:09.620]   this, but I think that there could be potential toxic relationship issues when investing money
[00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:14.860]   for your family. Here's something that happens. I've worked in the nonprofit endowment foundation
[00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:20.820]   space my whole career, and those funds are typically run by a committee. The biggest
[00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:25.220]   problem I've seen in those committees, besides all the politics that's involved, is that
[00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:30.380]   the individuals on the committee try to invest the money like it is their own personal risk
[00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:34.860]   profile and time horizon, instead of using the one for the organization and the beneficiaries
[00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:38.140]   of where that money is going. Because a lot of these foundations and endowments are set
[00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:41.140]   up to run in perpetuity. They're supposed to last forever. There's this great story
[00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:45.960]   where BlackRock CEO Larry Fink once said he's having dinner with one of the largest sovereign
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:51.700]   wealth fund managers in the world, and the fund's objectives, the manager told him, were
[00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:55.240]   generational. "We're saving for future generations," and Fink asked, "Well, how do you measure
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:00.100]   performance?" He said, "Of course, quarterly." That's the idea, that you can mix up your
[00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:05.620]   own time horizon and risk profile. I think the most important thing here is understanding
[00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:10.020]   your mom's risk profile and time horizon. What has she done in the past? How does she
[00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:13.980]   handle losses? How does she handle volatility? Did she sell out in the past? When does she
[00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:18.860]   need this money? I think you have to understand what the money's for, the purpose of it. How
[00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:23.260]   much risk does she need to take? How much risk does she want to take? I think the simplest
[00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.820]   boring bent answer is figure out a target date fund, potentially. But I think you have
[00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:31.780]   to understand what is going to work for her and not just work for you. Because I think
[00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:36.460]   if you make the wrong decision here, and your mom gets angry with you, you're the one where
[00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:39.580]   the buck stops at if you're making this decision for her, even if you're the one looking at
[00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:42.900]   it. Because she's certainly going to look if things go bad. So I think you just have
[00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:46.220]   to figure out what's right for her, not what's right for you.
[00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:51.660]   Yeah, it could make Thanksgiving very uncomfortable, right, if a portfolio's been cut in half or
[00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:57.220]   something like that. Yeah, for sure. All right, one more.
[00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:03.740]   Okay, so next up. "As we get closer to the end of the year, I'm debating the true value
[00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:07.780]   of tax loss harvesting as a strategy for my portfolio. I appreciate the ability to lower
[00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:11.940]   my tax liabilities this year, but the strategy seems more like a tax deferral than a tax
[00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:17.220]   write-off. If I believe taxes will go up generally, and my personal tax bracket will go up, for
[00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:21.220]   context, I'm in my early 30s and expect to have a higher tax bracket later in life. Does
[00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:25.740]   tax loss harvesting make sense for me? It seems like I'd be passing on taxes at a lower
[00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:28.900]   bracket today to potentially pay them at a higher tax bracket in the future."
[00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:33.980]   All right, and as we're getting on the end of the year, we got another one that's similar
[00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:36.580]   to this, right? So let's do them both. Let's run it back.
[00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:41.920]   Yeah, and so then we also have, "I'm buying a house closing on January 13th. I have to
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:48.660]   sell stock to pay for it. I'll have the same income in 2021 and 2022. Should I sell in
[00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:50.820]   2021 or wait until 2022?"
[00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:54.900]   Now, Duncan, this is something that surprised me. We've gotten a lot more questions about
[00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:58.260]   taxes than I ever would have assumed we would, and I think there's one simple reason. People
[00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:03.220]   hate paying taxes. You could make tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars
[00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:07.300]   or millions of dollars for a wealth management client that you work with, but if you save
[00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:13.980]   them $500 on their taxes, they are your client for life. People hate taxes. So for this one,
[00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:18.700]   because I always think, "Do you make tax decisions? Do you let that be the tail that wags the
[00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:22.620]   dog and make these decisions explicitly on taxes, or do you think about the other ramifications?"
[00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:28.300]   So I want to bring in my personal tax consultant, our CFO, Bill Sweet.
[00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:33.020]   Gentlemen, welcome to suburban New York where the trees are big and the coffee is warm.
[00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:38.140]   I agree, Ben. People generally hate paying taxes more than they like making money. That's
[00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:42.520]   something I've observed throughout my career. But listeners spot on. I mean, tax loss harvesting
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:47.460]   is simply a deferral mechanism. What you do when you tax loss harvest is you step up your
[00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:52.400]   basis from the respect that you generate a loss. In theory, sometimes using that to offset
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:57.240]   gains, sometimes using it to offset ordinary income up to $3,000 a year. But the problem
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:01.600]   with that is if your future expected tax rate is higher, you could effectively be doing
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:05.760]   some negative arbitrage, sort of realizing a small gain in the future in exchange for
[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:10.520]   a larger pain in the present in the future. And that's not a good thing. So John, can
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:14.240]   you pull up the chart for me, a little chart we put together here? So if you take a look
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:18.760]   at the tax brackets, focus on the blue here. The tax bracket for capital gains, if your
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:24.620]   joint married income is below roughly $106,000, it's actually zero. So more or less at that
[00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:29.500]   tax rate, it doesn't make any sense. If I'm going to deduct 12%, but my income's going
[00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:35.560]   up in the future, I'm going to be paying 15, 18, maybe 24% of my gains in the future. Tax
[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:40.100]   off hard loss harvesting, generally not a good idea. So I think this list is spot on.
[00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:44.980]   That's why we don't advocate a TLH for every single client that we have at Rittenholz Wealth.
[00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:49.040]   It really depends. And this is why tax does not scale. It's something that I think needs
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:52.360]   to be specifically analyzed for each individual client and situation.
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:57.000]   How hard do you think it is for people to actually predict their taxes in the future,
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.040]   unless they're in the lowest income tax bracket? That helps if you know where you are now,
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.960]   but I always see this where people say, "Well, I know I'm going to be paying more in the
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.940]   future." And we just don't know, right?
[00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:10.040]   Correct. Yeah. The future is not just unknown. It's unknowable. So a lot of things could
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:14.280]   change. The Build Back Better plan could come in and raise taxes. That was something discussed
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:19.120]   that we had an episode back a couple months ago on that very topic. So you're exactly
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:24.100]   right, Ben. But that would probably lend itself to things like this strategy, because if you
[00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:28.940]   know you're getting a benefit today, the indeterminate future, who knows? If the taxpayer takes a
[00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:33.000]   year off, maybe that's a great year to realize that gain in the future. It really depends.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.840]   It depends on each specific client, and there's no real way to predict it in advance.
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.480]   What do you think about this person who's got to sell stock to pay for a house that
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:43.920]   they're closing on in a few weeks, it sounds like? Does it make sense to do it now and
[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:47.640]   rip the Band-Aid off? Or can it potentially be better to wait and then put those taxes
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.640]   off to future you, right? Yeah, future me.
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:54.800]   Exactly, future me take care of it. Yeah, I think it goes back to that chart. So again,
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:12:00.680]   if my income for the year is $80,000, if I'm married, I can realize up to $20,000 a gain
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:04.580]   is completely federal tax-free. Maybe there's some consequences at the state, but that's
[00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:08.700]   not usually that large. So I think splitting it amongst tax years makes a lot of sense.
[00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:12.080]   But Ben, you brought up a great point before. If you don't have visibility of this, there's
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:15.400]   two weeks left here in the year to make any changes, right? And you have to make these
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:19.280]   decisions relatively quickly. So that's why I think working with a professional always
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:23.760]   makes some sense, especially if they're forward-looking. My big criticism of a lot of the accounting
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:26.960]   industry is they're always driving like the rearview mirror. They don't care about what's
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:30.120]   going to happen next year. They care about what's happening now. So finding a good tax
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:32.560]   advisor, I think, is part of this process.
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:36.720]   All right. Yeah. Talking to your own book here, but you're right.
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:39.760]   Exactly. I'm a company man.
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:41.560]   We got Bill here. Let's do one more tax question.
[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:45.440]   OK. I was going to say, I think we might be getting so many tax questions because people
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:47.120]   like hearing Bill's answers too.
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:48.120]   It's true.
[00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:49.120]   I'll take it.
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.280]   The flattery will get you everywhere, Duncan.
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:55.600]   So this is a really long one, but bear with me. I live in the San Francisco Bay Area where
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:13:00.400]   homes are very expensive. We've heard this a lot from viewers. In the state of California,
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.560]   if you own a house for five years and use it as your primary residence for at least
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:08.120]   two years during that time, you don't need to pay taxes on the first $500,000 of capital
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:12.840]   gains when selling your home for a married couple. As you can imagine, depending on where
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:17.360]   you live in the Bay Area, it doesn't take long to have a home appreciation of $500,000.
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:23.040]   If I live in an expensive area like this, am I crazy for trying to move every five years
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:27.400]   or so to minimize my tax burden? I suppose I can just buy a neighbor's home as to not
[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:31.160]   switch communities or school districts for my kid. What other considerations are there
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:36.560]   to such a strategy? I feel like this is pretty ingenious, but there's got to be a catch.
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:40.600]   My one initial thought on this, the catch is, it sounds like a lot of work.
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:42.120]   A lot of moving.
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.120]   A lot of moving.
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.120]   Moving is terrible.
[00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:47.160]   There's a lot of frictions involved when you buy and sell a house. There's closing costs,
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:53.120]   there's realtor fees, there's all these things. I understand the idea here, but Bill, from
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:56.680]   a tax perspective, aren't there better tax advantage ways of making real estate work
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:01.680]   for you, like cashing out refinance or a HELOC where you can take some money out? Is it really
[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:06.480]   that big of a deal if you're trying to take these gains quicker than try to offset some
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.100]   of it? Does that make sense to you?
[00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:12.780]   It does from the respect that assuming that you're able to generate a $500,000 capital
[00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:18.460]   grant on your property, I get that that's been the case in the West Coast specifically,
[00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:23.340]   but that's it. This is a unique thing in the tax code. That's a very large number for a
[00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:27.900]   joint couple. It's $250,000 for an individual. These are large numbers, but Ben, I think
[00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:31.900]   you hit on it. It's really transaction costs in real estate that are really painful. I
[00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:35.780]   did a refinance recently. I know you and Michael talk about this all the time on the Animal
[00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:40.700]   Spirits podcast. It's expensive to purchase and sell a house. Just talk about the real
[00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:45.060]   estate commission alone. If you happen to be lucky enough to get a $200,000 to $500,000
[00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:48.900]   gain in your property, it probably means it's worth a million dollars. You're paying somebody
[00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:54.380]   $50,000. You need to run the math and make sure the tax consequences actually outweigh
[00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:59.180]   the benefits, but it's not going away, I don't think, in the tax code. It hasn't for as long
[00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:03.920]   as it's been in the-- at least it's since '86 to my knowledge. The problem is that number's
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:07.700]   indexed for inflation, or it's not indexed for inflation. It's been around that number
[00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:11.980]   since I've been aware of it. But yeah, I think that's it. The thing that I might add as a
[00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:15.940]   planning point, which is kind of interesting to think about, is you could potentially leverage
[00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:20.900]   this arbitrage with a rental property, a business property, in that if you happen to move out
[00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:24.660]   of your primary residence, and let's say rent it for two years, again, as long as you're
[00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:28.980]   within the window and the timeframe, you're able to effectively convert that to a real
[00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:33.480]   estate residential property. You need to adjust for the fact that it's part use, but that
[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:37.140]   to me is the most interesting thing. And that's where I see the most innovation in this space.
[00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:41.500]   But would I move simply to take advantage of this every two years? Absolutely not. You
[00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:46.780]   and I both have young kids. I moved all the time in the Army, on average, every two years.
[00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:51.780]   I don't ever want to do it again. So if the personal price is worth the tax benefit, sure,
[00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:55.860]   I guess, but I wouldn't recommend this as a strategy, no.
[00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:58.900]   This also shows just how strong the real estate market has been, that someone thinks getting
[00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:04.580]   a $500,000 gain can be managed every five years. I mean, I don't know how much-
[00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:08.660]   More power to you. Yeah, I'll drink to you tonight if you can pull this off every two
[00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:09.660]   years.
[00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:12.220]   All right, one more question for Bill. This is a big one. Real tree or fake tree in the
[00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:13.220]   background?
[00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:17.580]   A hundred percent fake. Have you guys ever, at the end of the year, taken that thing out
[00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:21.980]   to the fire pit, thrown a match in that? I mean, it is gone in like 10 seconds.
[00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:25.660]   I told this story in Animal Spirits. I'm a real tree person. My family's always been
[00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:31.820]   a real tree, and we got one, and it immediately died in nine million pine needles all over
[00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:35.780]   the house. Every time the dog walked by it, it was like a big version of the Charlie Brown
[00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:36.780]   Christmas.
[00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:37.780]   But it smelled awesome.
[00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:39.540]   They do. They smell good. But yeah, you're right. My wife said, "All right, that's it.
[00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:41.780]   We tried it. We're getting a fake tree. We got one now."
[00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:45.940]   I got a bunch of candles for the smell. That's good enough for me, man.
[00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:48.020]   We're a fake tree family now. I can't believe it, but we are.
[00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:49.220]   I'm a big real tree person.
[00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:50.220]   That's awesome.
[00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:53.260]   And Bill, I thought you would literally go out and cut it down with that saw that you
[00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.100]   displayed in the past.
[00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:58.420]   It's in the basement. It's ready to go. My chainsaw, though, needs a little bit of work.
[00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:02.980]   So if you're a small parts mechanic, small machine, give me a shout. I need some help.
[00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:06.660]   All right. Thanks to Bill, as always, for his helpful tech expertise. Remember to have
