[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.500]   Garrett writes in from Louisville, Texas to say,
[00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.320]   "I've come to realize painfully that I'm a compulsive liar,
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.460]   "possibly pathological, mostly just to gain attention.
[00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.840]   "However, I hate that I do this,
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.740]   "especially now that I see that I do it.
[00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.700]   "It's such a bad habit, I can't break it on my own.
[00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.160]   "I've been saved for a little while now
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.340]   "and I can see its toll on my walk and on my life.
[00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.420]   "What steps can I take to end my addiction to lying?"
[00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.220]   - Well, what I'm gonna fasten on, Garrett,
[00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.060]   is your statement that you say you do it mostly
[00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.600]   to gain attention.
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.160]   Now, there are a lot of reasons why people lie.
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.620]   You've pointed out one.
[00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.620]   There may be others in you, but I think you're right
[00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.160]   that that's a huge, that's a huge reason
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.700]   why we exaggerate, which are untruths,
[00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.100]   and why we just flat out affirm things that aren't so,
[00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.140]   because if we deny them, then we're gonna look bad
[00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.140]   in other people's eyes.
[00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.140]   So you put your finger on a deep cause of untruth
[00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.980]   and lying in people's lives.
[00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.720]   So let me go at that root.
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.380]   Why do you want, need, crave the attention, the approval,
[00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:24.060]   the admiration of other people so much?
[00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.940]   I think that's the question you should ask,
[00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.260]   and you should dig down to the root of that
[00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.860]   and expose that, and here, let me help you do that.
[00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.280]   You, as a believer, have God's attention,
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.380]   God's adoption, God's delight,
[00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.540]   God's assistance and promise, God's commitment,
[00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.220]   and you will one day have his complete acceptance
[00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.660]   into a flawless heaven.
[00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.300]   You have that in Jesus Christ,
[00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.820]   and that is superior in its preciousness
[00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.860]   to any approval that man could give you.
[00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.660]   Meditate long and hard on the fact that,
[00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.900]   compared to the attention and the approval
[00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.540]   and the assistance and the commitment
[00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.940]   and the praise of all the other people,
[00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.720]   God's is infinitely better.
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.720]   Romans 2:29, "A true Jew is one inwardly,
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.300]   "and circumcision is a matter of the heart,
[00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.780]   "by the spirit, not by the letter.
[00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.780]   "His praise is not from man, but from God."
[00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.020]   Amazing.
[00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.760]   So to be born again is to have your heart changed
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.720]   so that you love the approval of God.
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.760]   It is thrilling to you that God, in his mercy,
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.480]   would find you worthy of his well-done
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.160]   or worthy of his approval.
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.160]   Here's one of the ways that Paul tried to pull the plug
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.520]   on the craving for approval that the Corinthians had
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.640]   when they were lining up to brag
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.400]   behind their favorite teachers.
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.100]   They really were craving being somebody,
[00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.600]   looking like they were somebody,
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.240]   because they were associated with somebody who was somebody.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.240]   And here's what Paul said in 1 Corinthians 3, 21.
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:27.240]   "Let no one boast in men, for all things are yours, Garrett.
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:33.500]   "Whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world
[00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.480]   "or life or death or the present or the future,
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.520]   "all are yours and you are Christ and Christ is God's."
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.920]   If you take every one of those and analyze them,
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.240]   they're just mind-boggling.
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.960]   Apollos is yours, life is yours, death is yours,
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.040]   present is yours, future is yours.
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.120]   What more could you want than you have?
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.760]   And therefore he says, it's just crazy to boast
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.760]   about having some special teacher or some approval of man.
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.840]   I thought of this analogy.
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.080]   I suppose the president of the United States
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.420]   calls you on the phone and says,
[00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.140]   "I'd just like to have you come as my guest.
[00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.760]   "You're very special to me
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.760]   "and I'd like to have dinner with you."
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:18.600]   (laughs)
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.760]   And you tell him, "What are you talking about?"
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.160]   And so you go and you meet with the president
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.640]   of the United States and you have dinner with him
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:26.960]   and he talks about your life.
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.720]   He doesn't let you get in a question otherwise.
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.160]   He wants to know all about you and he's enjoying you
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.400]   and all the stories you're telling him.
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.720]   And you walk out of there and on your way home,
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.200]   one of your friends says something like,
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.480]   "Did you ever get invited out by the mayor of your town?"
[00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.460]   Now are you gonna lie and say, "Uh, uh, yeah, yeah, I did."
[00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.620]   You're not.
[00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.820]   You're gonna say, "No, but I got invited
[00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:56.940]   "to have my president."
[00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.820]   (laughs)
[00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.780]   Now what's going on there?
[00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.220]   What's going on is that you've been set free
[00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:09.220]   from the need to get that praise.
[00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.740]   Oh, you're known by the mayor, whoa.
[00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.640]   And it's not true.
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.720]   And you've been set free because you've been loved
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.520]   by the president, you've been known by the president,
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.600]   you've been taken into his care.
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.840]   That's how real God should be to you.
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.960]   Jesus goes after this problem of loving the praise of man
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.200]   in Matthew six and he goes after it in Matthew five
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.240]   and maybe that's a good place to end
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.160]   is just pointing out that, I mean, imagine yourself,
[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.120]   Garrett, about to be slandered.
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.780]   You're about to be reviled.
[00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.000]   Somebody's about to say something ugly
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.360]   about what you did or didn't do
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.720]   and you are so afraid of being reviled and slandered
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.380]   that you correct them and say, "I didn't do that."
[00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.620]   Or, "I did do that."
[00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.640]   Well, and that's not true because you didn't wanna
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.540]   be reviled even though it was a good thing that you did.
[00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:07.920]   Here's what Jesus says, "Blessed are you
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.440]   "when others revile you and persecute you
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:15.320]   "and say all kinds of evil against you falsely.
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.580]   "Rejoice in that day and be glad for great
[00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.360]   "is your reward in heaven."
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.360]   Which means that if the president has welcomed you,
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.520]   if God has loved you, if God promises to give you
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:32.160]   all things with Christ, you have no need to fear
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.180]   the slander of men anymore.
[00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.720]   You should be the freest of all people
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.920]   with your contentment in God.
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.360]   - Yes, thank you, Pastor John,
