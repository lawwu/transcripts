[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in the passage of Scripture we read at the beginning, namely in the Book of the Acts of the Apostles, chapter 7, reading again from the beginning of verse 17 to the beginning of verse 20.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   But when the time of the promise drew nigh which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt, till another king arose which knew not Joseph.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   The same dealt subtly with our kindred, and evil entreated our fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the end they might not live, in which time Moses was born.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   Now those who worship here regularly will realize exactly what I am proposing to do. We've been studying this seventh chapter of the Book of the Acts of the Apostles for a number of Sunday evenings.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   It really is an account of a speech that was delivered, an address that was made, by the first Christian martyr whose name was Stephen.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   Stephen had been arrested and he was put on trial. That happened to him because he was a deacon of the Christian church, and because he'd been filled with the Spirit and was able to work wonders, perform miracles, and he was able to speak and preach the gospel.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   And he had confounded and confuted certain people who had risen up against him, trying to discredit the Christian faith. Well, for all these reasons, he is arrested and he is put on trial before the great court of Jerusalem that was called the Sanhedrin.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   The charges brought against him were those of blasphemy, because he, according to the charge, had spoken against the temple, and had spoken against Moses, and had spoken against God's law.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   But the real offense was that he was preaching Jesus of Nazareth as the Son of God. He preached that this Jesus whom they had crucified and whom they had buried in a grave, he preached that this same Jesus had arisen in the body, from the grave, had manifested himself to certain chosen representatives,
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   and had then, in the sight of similar representatives, had ascended into heaven, and had sent forth, according to his promise, the Holy Spirit on the church on the day of Pentecost.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Now that was the charge. Stephen, like all other Christians, especially the apostles, the leaders, and the preachers, were asserting that this was the Savior of the world. In the words of the apostle Peter, they said that there was none other name under heaven given amongst men whereby we must be saved.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   They preached Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and as the only Savior of men. That was the main charge that is brought against Stephen.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   And here he is now standing before the court, and the high priest addresses him saying, "Are these things so?" Stephen begins to reply. And in this chapter we are given quite a lengthy report. It's after all only a summary, but it's a fairly lengthy summary of the address which he delivered.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Now I've been pointing out that it is essential that we should understand the scheme behind the speech. Stephen realized his position. He is concerned, of course, about himself, but that wasn't his main concern.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   His main concern was that the Lord Jesus Christ should be glorified and honored. He was equally concerned that these Jews, his fellow countrymen, should be disabused of their wrong ideas. He's anxious that the gospel should be made plain and clear to them.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   So he's not only concerned about clearing himself and refuting their arguments. He's still more interested positively that they should understand the real meaning and essence of the gospel.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   So the scheme that he adopts is this. Here are these Jews, and the leaders of the Jews, the religious leaders as well as the political leaders. Here they are denouncing a man as a blasphemer because he is teaching that Jesus of Nazareth is the long expected Messiah.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   Now the Jews, as you know, had for many, many centuries been looking forward to the coming of this great Deliverer whom God was going to send to bring deliverance and redemption.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   That was a promise that went back not only to the origin of their own history, but even beyond that right back to the Garden of Eden where God had said that the seed of the woman should bruise the serpent's head.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   But it was a promise that had been made particularly clear to Abraham who was in so many senses the father of the nation. And it had been repeated many times since, but in a very striking and signal manner through Moses, the great lawgiver of the nation.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   Now then, this is the idea that Stephen has in his mind. He wants to show that this Jesus of Nazareth whom he and others were preaching was none other than the fulfillment of all these promises.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   He's the one to whom Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, then Moses, David, and all the rest had been looking forward to. He's the fulfillment of the promises. He wants to show them that.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   And at the same time he wants to show them that in rejecting him, they are just repeating, recapitulating in a sense, what this nation of Israel had been doing throughout the running centuries.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   He wants to show them that they are truly children of their fathers, that their great sin is that, as he brings it out later on in very definite and particular terms, is this, that their great trouble has always been, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   As your fathers did, so do ye.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   Now that's the scheme of the speech. Any man who knows anything about speaking knows the importance of having a skeleton, having an object, having a purpose, having a theme, a line which you work out.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   Stephen didn't just get up and talk at random. There is the most definite plan behind this great speech, and I've given you the essence of the plan, the real purpose that was in the mind of Stephen.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   Very well, so what he does, you see, is he starts with the case of Abraham. We've seen that. We've seen how he can prove very simply and easily from the case of Abraham how wrong they were.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   They boast of Abraham, they glory in him, but they're doing the exact opposite of what Abraham had done himself.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   He takes up the case of Joseph, same thing. Joseph is a type of Christ. As Joseph's brethren treated, maltreated him, so they are doing with this greater Joseph, this savior of the world.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   Now, we've looked at those two cases, the case of Abraham, the case of Joseph, as expounded and used by Stephen in order to bring home these points.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   But now we come on to a third case that he uses, and that is the case of Moses.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   And this, as I've already indicated to you, is a strategic point, because as they were proud of Abraham as their father, they were particularly proud of Moses as the great lawgiver.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   In many ways, he stands out as the greatest man of all in the Old Testament.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   You remember how John, in the prologue to his gospel, puts it like this, "The law was given by Moses, grace and truth came by Jesus Christ."
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   He is the leader, the man who led them from Egypt to Canaan, the lawgiver, God's representative.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   And indeed, you recall how Moses, towards the end of his life, had prophesied saying, "A prophet like unto me shall God raise unto you from amongst yourselves."
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   And ever since then, the children of Israel have been looking for this prophet like unto Moses.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   So you see, this is a particularly important point for Stephen to establish.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   His case is, as is the case of all Christians, that Jesus of Nazareth is this prophet that was for to come.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   And yet, these Jewish leaders, religious and political, members of the Sanhedrin, had already rejected him and crucified him, and were now doing their utmost to exterminate the teaching concerning him.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   Very well, then, this is, I say, a very particularly important point for Stephen.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   He must get the Sanhedrin to see this.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   But I am calling your attention to it because it is an equally important point for us.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   Let me say again that I am studying this speech with you, not animated by some mere antiquarian interest, not merely some historical interest.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   My dear friends, the times are too desperate for us to indulge ourselves in such a way.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   This is not mere ancient history. It is that. But it is more, it speaks to us in a contemporary manner.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   The world today is doing exactly what the Sanhedrin did.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   Every man who is not a Christian, anyone who rejects this message, is in precisely the position of these members of the Sanhedrin.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   And I want to show you the fallacy of their position, in order that I may bring home to anyone who is here tonight who is not a Christian, the fallacy of your position.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   For it is exactly the same thing today as it was then.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   Now, this is something which is put before us very plainly in these words that I have just read to you as my text tonight.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   This is the mere introduction to the story of Moses.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   You notice that it starts with these words, "But when the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworn unto Abraham,"
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   then we are told what happened. But that's the introduction, and that's the thing I want to deal with tonight.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   "When the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworn unto Abraham."
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   This is introduction.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   And at first it seems mere introduction, doesn't it?
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   You read these words, and you say, "Oh well, he's just going to tell us something about Moses, and that's how he introduces it.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   It's mere introduction, "When the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworn unto Abraham," and you tend to slip over it,
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   and go on to the story of Moses, the dramatic story which we hope to consider later,
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   of how he was placed there in that little bark you remember on the river, and how he was found by Pharaoh's daughter,
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   and all the exciting things that happened. Mere introduction.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   But you know, when you're dealing with Scripture, there's no such thing as mere introduction.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   Everything in the Scripture is of great importance.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   Phrases that appear to be merely incidental.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   If you pay attention to them, you will find they're pregnant with meaning, and full of profound doctrine.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   And that is what is true of this statement that we are looking at tonight.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   I want to show you the teaching that is enshrined in this apparent, mere introduction of the case of Moses.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   I'm not going to say much about Moses tonight, indeed if anything from here on,
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   but I do want you to see the context in which he appears, in which time Moses was born.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   It's this background that I'm anxious to present to you on this occasion.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   Now, you remember the facts, don't you? You're familiar with this old story.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   If not, go back and read the early chapters of the book of Exodus.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   If you're interested in merely in stories and in literature, I commend you to read it.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   Nothing like that's being written today, I can assure you of that.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   If you're really interested in literature, only go back and read this amazing story about the birth of Moses and so on.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   Well, the essence of it is this.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   The children of Israel have gone down to Egypt in the way we've seen, because of the famine in their land,
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   and hearing that provision had been made in Egypt, they went down.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   And there, you remember, they were given a place of honor, because Joseph, the son of Jacob,
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   was the man who'd been enabled by God not only to foretell the famine, but to make provision for it.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   And so they were given a place of great honor.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   But the years have passed.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   And another king arose, which knew not Joseph.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   And he began to maltreat these children of Israel.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   Indeed, he was bent upon their extermination.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   And then, in that context, Moses is born.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   And the great things that we shall be considering later began to happen.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   Now, what has this got to do with us, says someone?
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   What has this got to say to us?
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   Well, I want to show you what it's got to say.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   All mankind's troubles, as regards the individual and mankind as a whole, all our troubles are due to certain things.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   And they're the very things that are made prominent in this story here, concerning this king that arose, that knew not Joseph.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   You see in this man, and in his actions and his behavior, the essential trouble with all who are sinners, with all who reject the gospel,
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   with all who are opposed to God.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   What was the trouble with this man?
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   What is the trouble with mankind today?
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   Look at our troubled world.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   What's the matter?
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   I'm not only thinking about this war in Vietnam that's bad enough and a disgrace to civilization,
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   but all the other things that are happening, all the things that are happening within the life of this our own nation.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   What's the matter?
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   With all the ability of human nature, with all that is in men, why are things as they are?
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   Well, I can easily answer the question.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   I'm not so typified in the behavior of this king that arose, that knew not Joseph.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   Let me put it to you like this.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   The first trouble with mankind is that it is not aware of God's purpose in history.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   That's my first proposition.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   Man's ultimate trouble is that he's not aware of God's purpose in history.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   Now we are living in an age when people are very interested in what they call the problem of time and the problem of history.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   And this is right.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   What can be more important than the problem of time and the problem of history?
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   So many things make us think about this.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   Here we are still at the beginning of a new year.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   And if we are at all intelligent, we are bound to stop and think and say,
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   "Well, 1966, 1967, 1968 to come, what's it all mean? What's it all about? What is it?
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   What is this life of ours which we divide up in this way?
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   What's the meaning of all these figures? What is history?
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   Has it an object? Has it a purpose? Or hasn't it?"
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   This is the great problem.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   It's inevitable that it should have arisen in this century
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   because, you see, in the last century they were so confident about progress and development,
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   evolution as they called it, and still do.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   And then when you come to this present century and see things as they are now,
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   they're aware that there's something gone wrong.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   They said it was going on inevitably, but it doesn't seem to be doing so.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   And so this whole problem of history and of time has been raised again acutely
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   by the very circumstances in which we find ourselves.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   And modern man claims to be very interested in the problem of history and of time.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   But it is my object to show you this evening that there is no respect in which the modern man
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   fails so completely and entirely as in his misunderstanding of history.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   Now, this is my contention, that modern man completely misreads and misunderstands history.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   And that is why he fails to learn from it.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   I've often quoted from this pulpit that statement of Hegel,
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   "History teaches us that history teaches us nothing."
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   That's the whole trouble.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   If man were the only learned the lessons of history,
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   he couldn't possibly go on repeating the selfsame mistakes.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   Man doesn't learn from history. Why not?
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   Well, it's obvious, isn't it, that he must be misreading it somehow.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   He must be misunderstanding it.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   And that was the very trouble with this pharaoh, this king that arose in Egypt,
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   that knew not Joseph.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   The trouble, of course, with mankind is that it tends to regard history as just a series of events.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   This happens, that happens.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   Some try to find a scheme, others say you can't.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   There is no scheme. There is no purpose to be detected.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   There it is. It's just one thing after another.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   And most people seem to accept that explanation.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   Years come, years go.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   Things happen, came to pass.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   Yes, it came, but it passed.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   And on and on you go.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   The same old round, the same old cycle.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   If you want the perfect statement of all that, read the book of Ecclesiastes.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   And there you'll find it stated to perfection.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   Nothing, there is no importance in anything at all.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   As things have been, so they are, and so they ever will be.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   There is no new thing under the sun.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   The mountains come, the rivers come down from the mountains, and they go down to the sea.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   But then the water's evaporated there and goes back again to the mountains.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   There's rain, and comes out again, and round and round it goes.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   Well now, this is, I say, the whole essence of the tragedy of mankind.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   And never has this been so patent and evident as it is in this generation to which you and I belong.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   What are our errors, and speaking of the natural man, the man who's not a Christian,
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   what are his errors with regard to history?
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   Well, it seems to me they're shown here very plainly.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   The first is that he looks at and is interested only in his own little sector of history.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   He's interested in his own immediate history.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   He's interested in his own times.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   It is his failure to take the whole of history into consideration.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   The whole grand sweep of history, backwards, forwards.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   No, he doesn't do that.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   He's interested in himself and in the immediate present.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   Now, this is always the tendency of men, but it is particularly the tendency today.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   I believe this is the very center of the modern predicament, the modern problem.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   The modern man thinks that he alone matters, that really, in a sense, nothing is of any value that has happened in the past.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   We are so proud of our scientific discoveries that we dismiss the whole of the past.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   We feel it's got nothing to teach us, nothing to tell us at all.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   And the man, the modern man, therefore, is a man who ignores the past completely.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   The past is all wrong. It was dark, it was fumbling, it was misled.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   We alone have wisdom. It's been born with us.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   Of course, in saying all that, he doesn't know that all that has been said perfectly in the book of Job, perhaps the oldest book in the Bible.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   However, that is what he says.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   Now, this is a terrible fallacy, this dismissal of the past.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   "The king arose which knew not Joseph."
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   He must have heard of him.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   It doesn't merely mean that he didn't know him personally.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   It doesn't mean that at all. What it means is that he really didn't know the essence of this story concerning Joseph.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   Now, I say he must have known something about it. He couldn't have been the king of Egypt without that.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   But, you see, it doesn't matter with him. He doesn't want to know about it. He dismisses it.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   "That's got nothing to do with us," he says.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   "Whatever's happened in the past, well, that's that, that."
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   Now, our business is the present, and this is what we must be concerned about.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   And that is exactly the view that is being taken by the modern men speaking generally.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   We are, I say, contemptuous of all that have gone before us and of everything that has been done before us.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   We despise the past.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   Now, I needn't elaborate on this. You're all perfectly familiar with it.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   Various terms that are used about us.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   What are we? We are squares, whatever they call us.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   We are behind the times. We don't know. We don't understand.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   People may have thought this, that, or the other.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   But we, we have arrived, the modern men.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   He's only looking at himself and his own little sector, exactly as this king did, who knew not Joseph.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   So I say that this is such a small view of history.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   And that's one of the great things, you know, about reading the Bible.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   You begin to read the Bible, and you'll soon get rid of that notion that it's only this part of history that you are in that really matters.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   We are in a very old world, my friends.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   There's a very long history behind us.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   And if you don't believe the gospel, well, get wisdom from the Bible.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   It'll cure many of your ills.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   You're not quite as modern as you think you are.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   There have been people like you before, you know, who've said exactly all you're saying, the Bible tells us about them.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   It's a great thing, I say, to stand at a point in history and to see it coming up from the past and going forward into the future.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   There is a bigness, a greatness about it.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   That is such a contrast with this little view of history that compresses it all into my day and age and generation.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   That's one thing we see.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   But there is another thing of which these people are equally guilty.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   It's clear in the case of this king.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   They not only ignore the past, but they don't look forward to the future either.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   They don't look to the end of history.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   They're only looking at this immediate present.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   They're concerned about immediate events, immediate results, immediate pleasures.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   And they don't consider the future and what's going to happen.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   This is, I suppose, one of the most prominent characteristics of the modern disease.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   People even despise saving now and preparing for the future.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   Spend the lot, have the immediate present, pleasure for the moment.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   It doesn't matter what the future, the future will look after itself.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   It's the characteristic of the whole of life today.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   But what a terrible fallacy it is.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   This king that knew not just if he looked round on his domain, he was going to do this and that.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   He didn't consider what might happen.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   He didn't consider what he was facing.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   He didn't look forward and anticipate what was going to take place.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   He doesn't do that at all.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   It's just the immediate present.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   And isn't this, I say once more, the essence of the modern trouble?
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   It's very right that you should look at life as it is today.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   But what of tomorrow?
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   What of next year?
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   What of ten years, twenty years, thirty years?
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   Have you ever done that?
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   What's happening?
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   Not only that you look at your life as you are now, it's right that you should do so.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   But why not stop and think that you're going to get older?
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   That on January the first next year or January the eighth you'll be a year older than you are now.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   And another year on top of that and on and on it goes.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   And you who are young now will be old.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   And you'll become decrepit.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   And you'll lose your health and your vigor and your power.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   And you'll be a poor old man or a poor old woman if you're alive at all.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   You may have gone before then.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   We don't know.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   But you see this is what the world refuses to do.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   It regards this as morbid.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   It regards this as unpleasant.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   But what a short-sighted view that is of life.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   What a mistake it is only to look at the immediate present, forget the past, not look to the future.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   The future is inevitable.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   It's inexorable.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   And yet you see this man doesn't do that.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   And they say the man who's not a Christian still doesn't do that.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   He foreshortens the whole of history to just this moment at which he's alive.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   It's this whole philosophy of existentialism in a sense.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   But it's wrong.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   There is a past.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   There is a future.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   And the modern world seems to be completely ignorant of that one far-off divine event
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   to which the whole creation moves.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   And it's responsible for most of its miscalculations and its misjudgments with respect to life.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   That's the second error.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   But there is a third error here revealed very plainly and fairly.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   And this perhaps is the most important of all.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   It is the error of seeing history only as the scene or the sphere, if you like, of man's activity,
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   and missing and failing to see the activity of God.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   You see, that's the essence of the trouble with this king that arose that knew not Joseph.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   He was only thinking of himself and his plans.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   Here was a people amongst them.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   They were strangers.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   They didn't belong to them.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   They were becoming very big in number.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   They were constituting a danger to his kingdom.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   They'd become a nuisance.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   Get rid of them.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   Eliminate them.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   That was all he was thinking about.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   He wasn't aware of who they were.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   He didn't understand about them.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   He wasn't interested in him, not Joseph.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   He doesn't want to hear about all that.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   Here he is.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   He's got an immediate problem.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   He's going to deal with it.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   That's how he thinks.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   He's going to do something.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   And his entire thinking is in terms of himself.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   His ability, his power, and what he's proposing to do.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   And that is why disaster finally overcame this man and all his hosts and all his power.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   He completely failed to see God in history, even in the immediate history.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   He looks at these people.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   Why doesn't he ask the right questions?
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   Why doesn't he say, "Where have they come from?
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   How have they become what they are?"
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   He doesn't do that.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   You see, he leaves out the biggest factor.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   He leaves out God.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   He thinks only in terms of men, human activity, human ability, human possibilities.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   Now this is, of all the errors, the most tragic of all.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   Because if there is one thing that is clearer than anything else, it is the activity of God in history.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   When the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworn to Abraham, this is God.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   God acting in history, the forgotten factor, the thing that men won't consider.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   But it is the most important thing of all, that God has a plan and a purpose for history.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   History simply cannot be understood at all apart from God.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   People literally cannot understand history apart from this interference of God in history.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   Now this is brought out here very plainly.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   When the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworn to Abraham.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   You remember that is dealt with earlier in the chapter.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   I read in verses 6 and 7, and God spake unto this wise, that his seed, that's to say,
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   Abraham's seed should sojourn in a strange land, and that they should bring them into bondage and entreat them.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   And this was the case in the land of Israel for a hundred years.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   Now God had said all that to Abraham, the father of Isaac, who in turn was the father of Jacob.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   Jacob was the father of these patriarchs who went down to Egypt, and there they remained for these four hundred years.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   Now this is the significant and the vital thing for us to grasp.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   That God was able to tell all that to Abraham.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   Very well, because it is God who controls it.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   God has a plan.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   Abraham is the father of a nation.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   It's God who decided that.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   This is a part of God's great plan and purpose of redemption.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   The world's history goes on and on, and mankind that doesn't believe the message of this book sees nothing but the activities of men.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   But the moment you begin to look deeply, you see there's another factor.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   There's something else interfering.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   There's another breaking in, and God produces this history.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   And here it is in this story of Abraham and the patriarchs and Jacob and all that we are going to consider about Moses.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   And you see it is a very exact history.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   When the time of the promise drew nigh, the time was fixed.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   The time is exact.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   God has purposed certain things, and they happen with a minuteness and an exactness which is amazing and astonishment.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   There is a time appointed.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   There to be down in Egypt must live only for a given length of time.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   Then something's going to happen.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   They're going to be delivered.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   God knows it all, and God reveals it.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   Now this is the great message of the Bible, that God has a plan and a purpose for this world.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   That this world is not in the hands of men.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   That's what we believe by nature, as this foolish king believed.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   He thought it was all in his power.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   He doesn't understand the people of God.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   He doesn't know who this little nation is that's such a nuisance to him.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   He thinks he can eliminate them.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   He doesn't know what he's doing.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   He only sees them as men.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   He doesn't see God.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   The whole of his trouble is due to this.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   And the calamity that overwhelmed him was entirely due to this particular failure.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   And this is still the trouble with mankind.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   You see we are so proud of ourselves for having conquered the force of gravity.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   And our ability to send men up into outer space.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   Nothing men can do.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   And all the time we forget God.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   And we don't understand our own history because we don't know God.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   We only see men's activity, but don't we see men's failure?
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   And we can't explain it.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   What is it that's wrong?
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   Can't you see this other element, this other factor?
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   It is God.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   God's great plan and his great purpose of redemption for the human race.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   The moment a man begins to see this, he's very ready to say with a troy poet when he says,
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   "Our little systems have their day, they have their day and cease to be.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   They are but broken lights of thee and thou, O God, art more than they."
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   Our little systems.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   How excited we get about them.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   Our politics.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   I'm not here to denounce these things.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   I'm not here to denounce the manifest of government and law and order,
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   but the way in which we enthuse and get excited and pin our faith in them and believe in them.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   And not only our politics, our philosophies, our little systems.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   They come and they go.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   There are fashions in philosophy as there are in music.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   Top of the pops today, but not for long.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   And that happens to all your philosophies.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   They come and go.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   Our little systems have their day.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   They cease to be.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   They are but broken lights of thee and thou, O God, art more than they.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   That's what this man didn't see.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   This is what mankind still doesn't see.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   Man is glorified.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   Even in his failure, he's glorified.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   And we consider history in terms of human activities.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   Kings, births, statesmen, marriages, deaths, wars.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   That's history, we say.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   I agree, it is a part of history.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   But you know, it's the least important part of history.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   The really important history is the history that you find in this book.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   This God who made everything, started it on its course, is controlling it, and has an end for it all.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   This is the time.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   When the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworn, had promised, had declared to Abraham.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   Now, my dear friends, are we clear about this first principle?
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   Oh, the importance of understanding history.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   What is happening in history.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   The whole meaning of time and what is taking place within it.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   It is because mankind, I say, fails to do that, that so many of its troubles have arisen.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   But there's a second principle, which is even more serious, and it's this.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   Man not only fails to detect God's plan and purpose in history.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   But he who has fully resisted, stands up against it.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   Another king arose which knew not Joseph.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   The same dealt subtly with our kindred and evil entreated our fathers,
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   so that they cast out their young children to the end that they might not live.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   This man set out to exterminate God's people.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   He set out to withstand God's plan and purpose.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   Of course, he doesn't realize it, he doesn't know what he's doing.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   He's blind to God's purpose, but in his blindness he stands up against it.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   He tries to resist it.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   And mankind is still trying to do exactly the same.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   This is what the world has been doing, you know, from the beginning.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   There's nothing new about this.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   When God sent his only son into this world, he was crucified.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   When God did the greatest thing of all, that was the reaction of the world.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   Men didn't recognize him.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   They regarded him as just a man, an imposter.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   They put him to death.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   They said, "Away with this fellow, away with him.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   Crucify him, a nuisance, get rid of him."
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   Exactly as this king, which knew not Joseph, had done with the children of Israel, God's people.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   And the Christian church has endured persecution from the very beginning.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   She's enduring sarcasm and scorn and derision at the present time.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   She's being laughed at.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   She's being ignored.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   People are trying to exterminate her today in a more polite manner, but it's exactly the same thing.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   It's by ridicule and scorn and contempt.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   It's the same old story.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   But here is the vital question for us.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   Why does the world behave like this?
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   Why do men and women resist the purpose of God?
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   And here is the first answer.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   It is due to their ignorance of God.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   They don't know him.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   They don't understand him.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   A king arose, which knew not Joseph.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   Yes, but you see, you've got to analyze that statement.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   The trouble with this man was not merely that he didn't know and didn't appreciate what Joseph had done.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   His real trouble was that he never understood the secret of Joseph.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   That's the way in which you should interpret that word, "knew not."
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   What is Joseph?
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   What was he?
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   This man must have heard that there was once a man called Joseph who had foretold that a famine was coming
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   and who made a wonderful provision and saved the Egyptians from starvation and from death.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   But the vital question is this.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   What was it that enabled this man to do so?
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   And this king knew nothing about that at all.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   For had he really inquired into it, he would have discovered this,
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   that Joseph himself had said to the then pharaoh that,
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   "It isn't my ability that enables me to interpret these dreams.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   I'm just an ordinary man.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   It's the God who is in heaven who gives me this understanding.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   He has given me dreams.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   He has given me interpretations.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   It isn't I.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   It's the God whom I serve, and without him I can do nothing."
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   That's Joseph.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   It's the God behind Joseph.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   And this king was ignorant of that.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   And the world is as it is tonight because it is ignorant of God.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   It dislikes God's purpose.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   It rejects God's purpose.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   It does its utmost to defy God's purpose.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   It tries to ridicule God's purpose.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   And it's all due to the fact that it's ignorant of the being of God.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   Look at this man in his ignorance of the power that God gave to Joseph.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   Joseph is an ordinary man, but God gives him the ability to understand a dream,
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   even to recall it and then to interpret it.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   He gives him the wisdom to know what provisions to make.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   It is all the gift of God.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   It's the power of God.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   It's the wisdom of God.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   The world knows nothing about this.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   The world looks at the cosmos.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   It looks at creation, and it sees nothing but laws of nature, events and happenings.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   Oh, the tragedy is that the world doesn't see the God who has made it all, the Creator,
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   the everlasting Creator, the God who is above all, over all, infinite in wisdom and knowledge and power and understanding.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   The fool hath said in his heart, "There is no God."
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   He is ignorant of the power of God.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   He can't explain a flower because he doesn't know God.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   He says, "This is accident.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   This is the result of forces that have just happened."
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   He doesn't see the great Creator, the great mind, the great power that made all, that sustains all.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   The world is ignorant of this.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   That is why it tries to defy God.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   But it's not only ignorant of the being of God, it's equally ignorant of what God has done.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   "A king arose which knew not Joseph."
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   Joseph had been the deliverer of Egypt.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   Joseph had saved Egypt from a terrible death as the result of famine.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   He had been the greatest benefactor that this country had known.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   But this king knows nothing about it.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   He doesn't want to hear about it.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   These people are a nuisance. They must be got rid of.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   Who is Joseph? What's it matter? That's the past.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   So he dismisses this tremendous act of God's man Joseph,
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   which had proved such a blessing to his people and to his country.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   And that is still the trouble with the world.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   These Christian preachers, the apostles on the day of Pentecost,
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   were telling people about what they called the wonderful works of God.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   And the world knows nothing about this tonight.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   It knows about people trying to break speed records.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   It knows about people doing certain things in outer space.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   And it gets excited and full of interest.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   What do you know about the wonderful works of God?
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   Look back across history. Read this history.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   Look at the judgments of God in the earth.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   Read your secular history.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   See nations, dynasties arising, attacking this little nation of Israel,
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   but being confounded and destroyed in a miraculous manner.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   It's sure fact of history.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   But the world doesn't know about this.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   It dismisses the past.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   It doesn't know what God has done.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   Above all, it doesn't know that though the world has sinned against God,
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   as it has done and deserves nothing but God's displeasure,
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   that nevertheless God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son,
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   My dear friend, that's the most important thing that's ever happened.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   What God has done for us and our redemption,
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   what God has made possible for us,
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   it's the only hope in the world tonight.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   Can the politicians save us? Can the philosophers save us?
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   Of course they can't. They've already failed.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   They're failing round and about us.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   There is only one hope in the world tonight.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   It is in this Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of God.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   He's changed the whole of history.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   Does the world know anything about the facts concerning him?
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   Can it explain him?
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   1967 rather than 1966. Why? Because of him.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   He's the center of it all. It's the distance from him.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   This is the one who has affected history in the profoundest manner.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   Put all your statesmen together. They don't come anywhere near him.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   Gather together all your seers and sages. He towers above them all.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   He is the Lord of history himself.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   And these are the things about which the world doesn't know.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   It's ignorant of the fact that God sent his only Son into this world,
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   that he was born in abject poverty in a stable,
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   that he lived a life of self-renunciation, of poverty and of suffering,
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   that he gave himself freely on a cross call, on a hill called Calvary,
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   to bear the punishment of our sins, laid down his life for us,
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   that we might be forgiven, restored to God, and have life anew.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   It doesn't know that. It doesn't know that he's conquered death in the grave,
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   he's risen in a glorious resurrection,
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   and has ascended to the right hand of glory in heaven.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   It doesn't know that.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   A king arose that knew not Joseph.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   He wasn't aware of all this. He didn't appreciate its meaning.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   He hadn't got an understanding.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   But alas, it's not only a matter of ignorance, is it?
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   There's something worse even than ignorance, and that is ingratitude.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   Look at this king.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   He wouldn't have been there at all if it were not for Joseph.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   Egypt would probably have been destroyed, but for Joseph,
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   it was the ability and wisdom God gave to Joseph that saved the whole position,
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   the country, the peoples.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   Nothing to this man. Who's Joseph?
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   Dead long ago, not interested.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   I'm interested in today. I'm interested in the...
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   He's got no sense of gratitude.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   These are the people to whom Joseph belonged,
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   the people who brought blessing to the land of Egypt.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   Ingratitude.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   And that is the whole trouble with the world still, with men in sin.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   They sin gratitude.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   Kindness is forgotten and ignored.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   Why this is always the most horrible aspect of sin, it often seems to me.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   Is there anything more despicable in human life than ingratitude?
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   You get it amongst individuals.
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   You get it amongst nations.
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   One nation saved by another.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   In less than 20 years, it turns on the nation that saved it.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   I needn't mention names. You're familiar with the facts.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   When this nation to which you and I belong, in a sense, saved the life of another nation,
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   they've forgotten it by now.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   There's no gratitude.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   It's a saying, isn't it? There's no gratitude in politics.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   There's no gratitude in public life.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   Every man's out for himself.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   You forget what a man's done for you.
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   He saved your life. He saved your position. He saved your country.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   It doesn't matter. I'm interested in the present.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   I'm not interested in what happened 20 years ago.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   This is life. That's men in sin.
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   Base ingratitude.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   The king arose that knew not Joseph.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   But that is sin, you see.
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   And you see it at its worst.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   When you see it in this way, that God so loved the world,
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   that he gave his only begotten son,
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   that whosoever believeth in him should not perish.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   He's done this.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   And the world laughs at it. It mocks at it. It jeers at it.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   It makes fun of the blood of Christ.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   It'll have none of it. It despises it all.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   Oh, the horror of men in sin.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   He's not only blind and ignorant.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   He's guilty of a base ingratitude.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   He spits into the face of a God of love.
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   The God who comes to him in spite of all his sin and shame
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   and offers him pardon and forgiveness and new life
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   and all he stands in need of.
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   Oh, I say, this terrible thing that makes men in sin
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   defy the purpose and the plan of God in history.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   And that brings me to my last principle
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   on which I say but a word.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   The real trouble with mankind is
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   that it doesn't know the end and the object of God's purpose in history.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   It doesn't understand the character of God's purpose in history.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   A king arose which knew not Joseph,
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   so he defies God through his people.
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   He is going to do what he thinks.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   He doesn't know he's defying God,
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   so he pits himself against God
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   and he's going to deal with this situation.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   Oh, the ignorance of these men concerning the character of God's purpose in history.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   When the time of the promise drew nigh
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   which God had sworn unto Abraham,
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   in which time Moses was born,
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   what's the matter with these men?
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   Well, I can tell you what's the matter with them.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   He has never understood the character, the nature
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   of God's plan and purpose in history.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   What is the character of this purpose?
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   Here's the first thing.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   It's absolute certainty.
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   It's inexorability.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   When the time of the promise drew nigh,
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   can't you see it happening?
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   It's God moving it.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   Oh, here are these little kings, pharaohs and others
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   with their plans and purposes and schemes
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   and all the activity of men.
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   But when the time, God's time is moving nearer and nearer,
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   it's drawing nigh.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   It's inevitable.
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   It's inexorable.
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   Nothing can stop it.
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   Everything is fixed in God's plan and in God's purpose.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   Because the world in its wisdom,
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   it looks on and it only looks at the present and it laughs.
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   God's purpose, it says.
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   Look at the world.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   Look at the church.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   You claim to be God's people.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   Look at yourselves in your weakness.
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   Look how everybody's scoring of you.
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   Look how everybody's laughing at you.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   That's how the world speaks.
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   It always has done.
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   Here were the children of Israel.
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   400 years in Egypt.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   What's the point of talking about God's purpose?
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   What's the point of saying that God promised to Abram
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   that he'd give them the land of Canaan?
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   400 years in Egypt, the thing is monstrous.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   It's utterly ridiculous.
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   It's nonsense.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   And that's how people are arguing today.
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   Christianity played out.
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   They say, "Look at it.
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   Ineffective.
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   Can't do anything."
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   Oh, my dear friend, learn the lesson of history.
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   Look back.
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   Look forward.
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   Read this book.
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   See the history of God moving in its inexorability to its appointed end.
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   God's plan is absolutely certain, inevitable, irresistible.
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   When the time of the promise drew nigh, the appointed hour.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   Don't be misled by present superficial appearances.
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   The mills of God grind slowly, but they grind exceeding small.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   The utter inexorability of it.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   Oh, if you learn nothing else tonight, go home with this in your mind.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   You're involved in God's plan.
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   God's purpose is being brought to pass.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   You can do nothing about it.
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   You're in it.
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   You're involved in it.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   You can't contract out of it.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   The time of the promise drew nigh.
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   It's moving steadily in the direction of God's destined, predestined goal.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   That's one of the great characteristics of this purpose.
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   But let me tell you of something more wonderful.
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   It is a purpose of deliverance and blessing for his people.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   Here they are suffering.
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   God has promised it to Abraham.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   God has spoken this wise, that his seed should sojourn in a strange land,
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   and that he should bring them into bondage and entreat them evil for a hundred years.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   And the nation to whom it shall be in bondage will I judge, said God.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   And after that, they shall come forth and serve me in this place.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   This is the great story of Moses, the deliverer.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   Children of Israel in bondage, hard taskmasters, slashing them with their whips,
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   seeing them build bricks without sufficient straw in the process.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   Oh, the tragedy of this people, the utter helplessness, the hopelessness.
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   But God acts, and he acts in deliverance and blessing for his people.
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   He leads them from Egypt to Canaan, from bondage to liberty,
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   from the groaning of Egypt to a land flowing with milk and honey.
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   These are the blessings that are offered by the gospel.
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   The world doesn't know about this.
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:14.000]   As that king that knew not Joseph didn't know what God had got in his pen
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   and his purpose for these people, he's going to bring them out of that
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   and put them into the land which he promised to Abraham,
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   the land flowing with milk and honey, the land of blessing, the Canaan of desire.
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   And this is what God still offers for his people.
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   Oh, the blessings of this Christian life.
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:36.000]   Did you know, my dear friend, that if you believe this gospel
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:41.000]   and yield yourself to it, that all your past sins will be blotted out?
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   Are there things you're ashamed of in 1966, 1965, 1964,
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   and back you go to the beginning, you can't do anything about them,
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   the blots are on the book.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   You believe this message and every blot will be erased.
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   God will cast all your past sins into the sea of his forgetfulness.
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   He will pardon you and love you freely.
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   He will look upon you and declare that he justifies you freely by his grace.
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   He will assure you that his own Son has borne you a punishment,
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   that he came in order to do it, that the books can be cleared.
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   You'll have a new life, a new start, a new nature, a new outlook, a new strength.
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   And the way ahead of you is a glory that is awaiting you that baffles description,
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   when you shall be changed into the image and likeness of the very Son of God himself
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:43.000]   and spend your eternity in the presence of God in the glory everlasting.
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   This is God's plan and purpose.
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   Blessings to his people, blessings to those who belong to him,
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   who believe in him, who rejoice in his name,
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   whatever the world may be doing to them.
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   This is a part of the characteristic of his gracious plan and purpose.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:05.000]   But there is another side to it, isn't there?
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   Judgment to and for his enemies.
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   "And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge," said God.
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:21.000]   And it happened, you know.
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   The children of Israel were delivered out of Egypt,
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:27.000]   and Pharaoh and his hosts come after them, their chariots and their horses.
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   The children of Israel hadn't a chariot, they hadn't these horses,
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:33.000]   they hadn't these armaments, they were nothing, they were nobodies.
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:36.000]   But they're led by God through his servant Moses,
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:39.000]   and Pharaoh gathers his hosts and his armies, and they come,
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:43.000]   and here we are at the Red Sea, Piaheroth, Beelzebub, Red Sea.
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:46.000]   Suddenly it opens, the children of Israel go through.
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:49.000]   Pharaoh and his hosts are saying to do the same thing.
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   He comes upon them and overwhelms them and destroys them.
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   It's God's judgment upon them.
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:00.000]   This is history, you know.
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:06.000]   This is as much a part of history as the last war and the war before it.
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:10.000]   These are simple facts of history.
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   God blesses his people, and he pronounces judgment upon his enemies.
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:22.000]   A pharaoh, a great king, one of the greatest dynasties of the ancient world,
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:25.000]   a king of those that knew not Joseph,
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:28.000]   he is going to do things in his way, in a new way.
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:30.000]   He is completely routed.
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   He is ridiculed, he is judged, he is defeated.
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:44.000]   And my dear friend, that is a part of this gospel committed to my charge and to my care.
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   Life is a big and a serious thing.
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:52.000]   There are two possibilities confronting every one of us in this chapel at this moment.
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:55.000]   This is the great lesson that history teaches us.
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   This activity of God, are you aware of this?
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:03.000]   Do you realize that you are involved in all this?
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   Don't merely consider this immediate little sector that you and I happen to be living in.
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   It's one of the smallest ages that mankind has ever known.
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:14.000]   It's a minute age.
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:18.000]   Take a grand view of history, look back, look forward,
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:24.000]   see it all under the eye of God, under the eye of eternity.
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   And you will soon come to the realization that the most important thing,
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:32.000]   indeed the only important thing for every one of us in this world,
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:35.000]   is our relationship to God.
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:39.000]   And you know every one of us at this moment is in one of two companies.
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:43.000]   We either belong to the people of God or else we belong to the people of Pharaoh,
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.000]   king of Egypt that didn't know Joseph.
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:47.000]   You're in one of these two positions.
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:49.000]   There is no other position.
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:54.000]   You're either with God, for God, or else you're against him.
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:55:01.000]   Come, my dear friend, won't you learn the lesson of history?
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   To defy God is to call disaster.
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:06.000]   Who are you?
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   What's the whole world?
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   What's the whole of mankind?
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:11.000]   What's the universe?
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   What's the cosmos?
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:16.000]   Face to face with God.
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:20.000]   Which of these two companies do you belong to?
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   I shall show you later that Moses was confronted by this tremendous choice,
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:30.000]   the possibility of advancement in Egypt,
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:34.000]   belonging to the people of God, and he didn't hesitate.
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:38.000]   He chose rather to suffer affliction with the people of God
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season.
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:47.000]   That's all.
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:51.000]   The Pharaoh's triumph for a season, but only for a season.
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.000]   The end is destruction.
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   It comes back to this.
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:56.000]   Straight is the gate.
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:00.000]   Narrow is the way which leadeth unto life.
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:01.000]   Broad is the gate.
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:06.000]   Wide is the way that leadeth to destruction.
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:10.000]   And many there'll be that go in thereat.
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:14.000]   My dear friend, have you learned wisdom?
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:16.000]   There's a prayer offered by Moses in the Old Testament,
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:21.000]   "So teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom."
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:23.000]   Have you done that?
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:26.000]   Have you seen that the one thing that matters
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:31.000]   is that you're in the plan and the purpose of God?
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:34.000]   Do you rejoice in being able to say tonight,
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:41.000]   "My times are in thy hands, my God.
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:45.000]   I wish them last."
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:48.000]   Have you learned this old lesson?
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   Is your life centered upon God
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:57.000]   and his purpose of salvation and redemption
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:00.000]   in his only begotten Son,
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:05.000]   our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ?
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:08.000]   The company is a small one.
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:12.000]   Destitute, despised, forsaken, it doesn't matter.
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:18.000]   Thou from hence my all shalt be.
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:21.000]   God open all our eyes
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:24.000]   to see the folly of this misunderstanding of history
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:27.000]   which leaves out God.
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.000]   And may we so see it
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:34.000]   as to turn to him and cast ourselves unreservedly
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:37.000]   upon his love and mercy and compassion.
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.000]   He will not refuse you.
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:44.000]   You can become a member of his kingdom, one of his people.
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:47.000]   This very moment only believe
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:54.000]   and thou shalt see that Christ is all in all to thee.
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.000]   Amen.
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:01.000]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
