[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.360]   Isaac Newton developed what we now call classical mechanics that you describe very nicely in
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.440]   your new book as you do with a lot of basic concepts in physics.
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:17.000]   So with classical mechanics I can throw a rock and can predict the trajectory of that
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   rock's flight.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.960]   But if we could put ourselves back into Newton's time, his theories worked to predict things
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.200]   but as I understand he himself thought that their interpretations of those predictions
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.120]   were absurd.
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.080]   Perhaps he just said it for religious reasons and so on.
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:43.560]   But in particular sort of a world of interaction without contact, so action at a distance,
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.840]   it didn't make sense to him on a sort of a human interpretation level.
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:54.460]   Does it make sense to you that things can affect other things at a distance?
[00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.120]   It does but you know that so that was one of Newton's worries.
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.800]   You're actually right in a slightly different way about the religious worries.
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.680]   He was smart enough, this is off the topic but still fascinating, Newton almost invented
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.120]   chaos theory as soon as he invented classical mechanics.
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.600]   He realized that in the solar system, so he was able to explain how planets move around
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.100]   the sun, but typically you would describe the orbit of the earth ignoring the effects
[00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.380]   of Jupiter and Saturn and so forth just doing the earth and the sun.
[00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.640]   He kind of knew, even though he couldn't do the math, that if you included the effects
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.560]   of Jupiter and Saturn and the other planets, the solar system would be unstable like the
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.120]   orbits of the planets would get out of whack.
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.060]   So he thought that God would intervene occasionally to sort of move the planets back into orbit
[00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.540]   which is the only way you could explain how they were there presumably forever.
[00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.520]   But the worries about classical mechanics were a little bit different, the worry about
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.520]   gravity in particular.
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.960]   It wasn't a worry about classical mechanics, it was a worry about gravity.
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.720]   How in the world does the earth know that there's something called the sun 93 million
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.240]   miles away that is exerting gravitational force on it?
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.760]   And he literally said, "I leave that for future generations to think about because
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.720]   I don't know what the answer is."
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.560]   And in fact, people underemphasized this but future generations figured it out.
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:16.120]   Pierre-Simone Laplace in circa 1800 showed that you could rewrite Newtonian gravity as
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.480]   a field theory.
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.640]   So instead of just talking about the force due to gravity, you can talk about the gravitational
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.280]   field or the gravitational potential field and then there's no action at a distance.
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.280]   It's exactly the same theory empirically, it makes exactly the same predictions.
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.920]   But what's happening is instead of the sun just reaching out across the void, there is
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.880]   a gravitational field in between the sun and the earth that obeys an equation, Laplace's
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.660]   equation, cleverly enough.
[00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.700]   And that tells us exactly what the field does.
[00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.900]   So even in Newtonian gravity, you don't need action at a distance.
[00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.880]   Now what many people say is that Einstein solved this problem because he invented general
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:52.880]   relativity.
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.380]   And in general relativity, there's certainly a field in between the earth and the sun.
[00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.080]   But also there's the speed of light as a limit in Laplace's theory, which was exactly Newton's
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.740]   theory just in a different mathematical language.
[00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.740]   There could still be instantaneous action across the universe.
[00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.540]   Whereas in general relativity, if you shake something here, its gravitational impulse
[00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.660]   radiates out at the speed of light and we call that a gravitational wave and we can
[00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.940]   detect those.
[00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.700]   But it really rubs me the wrong way to think that we should presume the answer should look
[00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.180]   one way or the other.
[00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.820]   Like if it turned out that there was action at a distance in physics and that was the
[00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.660]   best way to describe things, then I would do it that way.
[00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.940]   It's actually a very deep question because when we don't know what the right laws of
[00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.060]   physics are, when we're guessing at them, when we're hypothesizing at what they might
[00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.180]   be, we are often guided by our intuitions about what they should be.
[00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.820]   I mean, Einstein famously was very guided by his intuitions and he did not like the
[00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.740]   idea of action at a distance.
[00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.180]   We don't know whether he was right or not.
[00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.780]   It depends on your interpretation of quantum mechanics and it depends on even how you talk
[00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.900]   about quantum mechanics within any one interpretation.
[00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.680]   >>JOEY So if you see every force as a field or any
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:15.720]   other interpretation of action at a distance, just stepping back to sort of caveman thinking,
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:22.680]   do you really, can you really sort of understand what it means for a force to be a field that's
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.680]   everywhere?
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.840]   So if you look at gravity, what do you think about-
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:26.840]   >>KAUFMAN I think so.
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:36.280]   Is this something that you've been conditioned by society to think that, to map the fact
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:42.420]   that science is extremely well predictive of something to believing that you actually
[00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:49.960]   understand it, like you can intuitively, the degree that human beings can understand anything,
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:55.360]   that you actually understand it, are you just trusting the beauty and the power of the predictive
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.880]   power of science?
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.600]   >>JOEY That depends on what you mean by this idea
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.880]   of truly understanding something, right?
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.520]   I mean, can I truly understand Fermat's last theorem?
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:15.480]   It's easy to state it, but do I really appreciate what it means for incredibly large numbers?
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.720]   I think yes, I think I do understand it, but if you want to just push people on, well,
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.480]   but your intuition doesn't go to the places where Andrew Wiles needed to go to prove Fermat's
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.160]   last theorem, then I can say fine, but I still think I understand the theorem.
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:34.240]   And likewise, I think that I do have a pretty good intuitive understanding of fields pervading
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.680]   space time, whether it's the gravitational field or the electromagnetic field or whatever,
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.040]   the Higgs field.
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:46.080]   Of course, one's intuition gets worse and worse as you get trickier in the quantum field
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.980]   theory and all sorts of new phenomena that come up in quantum field theory.
[00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:52.820]   So our intuitions aren't perfect.
[00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:56.320]   But I think it's also okay to say that our intuitions get trained, right?
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.360]   Like I have different intuitions now than I had when I was a baby.
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.360]   That's okay.
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.680]   That's not, an intuition is not necessarily intrinsic to who we are.
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.160]   We can train it a little bit.
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:11.120]   So that's where I'm going to bring in Noam Chomsky for a second, who thinks that our
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.320]   cognitive abilities are sort of evolved through time.
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.320]   And so they're biologically constrained.
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.680]   And so there's a clear limit, as he puts it, to our cognitive abilities.
[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.280]   And it's a very harsh limit.
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:30.480]   But you actually kind of said something interesting in nature versus nurture thing here is we
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:36.200]   can train our intuitions to sort of build up the cognitive muscles to be able to understand
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.000]   some of these tricky concepts.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.480]   Do you think there's limits to our understanding that's deeply rooted, hard-coded into our
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.960]   biology that we can't overcome?
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:53.840]   There could be limits to things like our ability to visualize.
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:58.920]   But when someone like Ed Witten proves a theorem about 100 dimensional mathematical spaces,
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.640]   he's not visualizing it.
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:01.640]   He's doing the math.
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:05.600]   That doesn't stop him from understanding the result.
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:10.480]   I think, and I would love to understand this better, but my rough feeling, which is not
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:17.120]   very educated, is that there's some threshold that one crosses in abstraction when one becomes
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.560]   kind of like a Turing machine.
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:26.400]   One has the ability to contain in one's brain logical, formal, symbolic structures and manipulate
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:27.400]   them.
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:33.280]   And that's a leap that we can make as human beings that dogs and cats haven't made.
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:38.480]   And once you get there, I'm not sure that there are any limits to our ability to understand
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.360]   the scientific world at all.
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.360]   Maybe there are.
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:45.840]   There's certainly limits on our ability to calculate things.
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:50.440]   People are not very good at taking cube roots of million digit numbers in their head, but
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.360]   that's not an element of understanding.
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.880]   It's certainly not a limit in principle.
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:59.720]   - So of course, as a human, you would say there doesn't feel to be limits to our understanding.
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:08.260]   But sort of, have you thought that the universe is actually a lot simpler than it appears
[00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:12.920]   to us and we just will never be able to, like it's outside of our...
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:20.960]   Okay, so us, our cognitive abilities combined with our mathematical prowess and whatever
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:28.800]   kind of experimental simulation devices we can put together, is there limits to that?
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.080]   Is it possible there's limits to that?
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:35.300]   - Well, of course it's possible that there are limits to that.
[00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:40.880]   Is there any good reason to think that we're anywhere close to the limits is a harder question.
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:45.280]   Look, imagine asking this question 500 years ago to the world's greatest thinkers, right?
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:50.360]   Like are we approaching the limits of our ability to understand the natural world?
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:55.220]   And by definition, there are questions about the natural world that are most interesting
[00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:57.880]   to us that are the ones we don't quite yet understand, right?
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:01.320]   So we're always faced with these puzzles we don't yet know.
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:04.160]   And I don't know what they would have said 500 years ago, but they didn't even know about
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.840]   classical mechanics, much less quantum mechanics.
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:11.600]   So we know that they were nowhere close to how well they could do, right?
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.240]   They could do enormously better than they were doing at the time.
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.300]   I see no reason why the same thing isn't true for us today.
[00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:22.620]   So of all the worries that keep me awake at night, the human mind's inability to rationally
[00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:27.200]   comprehend the world is low on the list.
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:37.200]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
