[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.880]   I think a lot of us are thinking, I know what I'm good at, I know what I like to do, but
[00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.280]   I don't really know what I should do.
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.400]   Dharma has been called many different things.
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.100]   You'll find different definitions, but my grandfather called that your essence, right?
[00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.440]   We all have an essence.
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.280]   And the question is, are we expressing that?
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.720]   And this is where I got it wrong for a lot of years, which is I always assumed that essence
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.640]   equals job.
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.200]   Essence equals job title.
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.460]   So my essence is to be a programmer.
[00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.480]   My essence is to be a product manager or to be a lawyer.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.640]   Those are occupations, but they're not an essence.
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.300]   An essence, it's deeper than that.
[00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.840]   It's I enjoy helping people.
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.960]   I enjoy designing things from scratch.
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.200]   I enjoy assembling products or growing other people's careers.
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.460]   And the idea is that when you can come back to that essence, it opens up a universe of
[00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.560]   possibilities because there are always multiple ways to express that essence.
