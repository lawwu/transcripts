[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.800]   Our first question comes from Sajranalio,
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.560]   who asks, how do you apply deliberate practice
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.960]   and deep work to socializing?
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.720]   He goes on to elaborate, I'm currently a young architect
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.580]   working for a recognized construction firm.
[00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.380]   Although I enjoy my job and I'm good at it,
[00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.880]   I have plans to start my own firm in the near future.
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.080]   I have some clients now, and I currently work some hours
[00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.160]   outside my main job.
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.580]   The biggest constraint that I have
[00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.520]   is that my network is very small.
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.860]   I have very few contacts, friends, or potential clients,
[00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.960]   and this isolation is aggravated by my Asperger syndrome.
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.080]   How would you apply deep work and deliberate practice
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.000]   to learn to socialize, create networks, and clients?
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.320]   All right, it's a good question.
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.360]   I think networking/social life are two good topics that
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.280]   are related to cover.
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.760]   I just want to do a quick wording tweak here.
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.040]   So you say the phrase, how do I apply deep work
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.440]   to learning to socialize, create networks, and clients?
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.360]   Let's be very specific about how we actually
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.560]   use the term deep work.
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.680]   All deep work means is that you're
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.680]   doing something in the absence of context switching.
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.200]   So you're giving something your full attention,
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.880]   trying to do it at a high cognitive level.
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.120]   So probably the right word here you also
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.320]   gave is deliberate practice.
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.400]   Maybe that's better.
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.240]   That's a verb.
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.120]   Deep work is a type of work without distraction
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.340]   with concentration.
[00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.760]   Deliberate practice is what you're really talking about here
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.640]   is how do I systematically improve.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.180]   That's the verb that's relevant here.
[00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.600]   How do I systematically improve at this?
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.000]   Well, when it comes to networking,
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.960]   professional networking, that's not my specialty.
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.600]   There's a lot of books that have been written about networking.
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.960]   But the one thing I will say, the one Cal Newport take
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.680]   I'll give on networking is in almost every circumstance,
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.520]   the thing that matters more than anything else in finding
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.560]   new clients and attracting new opportunities
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.760]   is being really good.
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.480]   In a lot of fields, there's a lot
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.680]   of people with a lot of different personalities, some
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.720]   of whom are not very sociable at all,
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.640]   that you wouldn't really want to spend much time around.
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.860]   But they do what they do really well.
[00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.600]   Everything opens up from that.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.240]   You become so good you can't be ignored.
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.080]   Clients find you because they've seen the work you did.
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.360]   You get referred because you're so good.
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.080]   That snowballs on itself.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.200]   I actually talk about this in my book,
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.800]   How to Become a High School Superstar.
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.760]   It's known as the Matthew effect.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.680]   So as you start doing things that are good,
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.160]   more good things follows.
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.040]   The whole thing snowballs.
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.200]   So those who have get more.
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.160]   That's the paraphrase of the Matthew effect.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.440]   It definitely happens in the professional circumstance.
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.000]   I don't want you necessarily worrying too much
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.440]   that you're not a glad-handing, at-the-golf-club,
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.800]   shaking-hands, slapping-people-on-the-back
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.960]   type socializer.
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.560]   It's probably not necessary for what you need to do.
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.000]   What's necessary for what you want to do is to crush the work.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.360]   It's fantastic, incredibly high quality.
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.200]   You keep pushing your skills.
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.600]   Good things will follow from that.
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.280]   So I just want to take some burden off of you.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.080]   Another related question-- you didn't ask,
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.360]   but a lot of people do--
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.760]   how do I get better at socializing non-professionally?
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.680]   And there, my advice typically is,
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.600]   do not approach your non-professional socializing
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.320]   with the same systematic fervor that we often
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.560]   approach professional issues on the show.
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.760]   It shows through.
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.720]   It shows through if you have a chalkboard somewhere
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.840]   in your apartment where you have different people's names on it
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.160]   and you're trying to add up your average active monthly user
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.080]   interaction minutes and trying to hit a median target.
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.600]   That kind of shows through in the way you interact,
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.640]   and people don't like it.
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.240]   So when it comes to just socializing,
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.020]   I think the most important thing you can do
[00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:03.520]   is take to heart the chapter on conversation versus connection
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.480]   in my book, Digital Minimalism, which
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.200]   says real-world interaction, being with someone,
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.360]   sacrificing non-trivial time and attention
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.320]   on behalf of someone else that's important to you.
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.080]   This is foundational for human flourishing,
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.240]   and you should just be trying to do that.
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.920]   And if you're not doing a lot of it, try to do more.
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:24.800]   It's like exercise.
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:25.800]   It's like eating healthy.
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.480]   It's almost like oxygen. So just have
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:34.080]   a general appreciation of real sacrifice requiring interaction
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.480]   and time spent with other people.
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.240]   It's something you just feel you want to do
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.800]   and you feel uncomfortable when you don't.
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.000]   Everything else will work itself out.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.920]   So that's how I would handle the personal side.
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
