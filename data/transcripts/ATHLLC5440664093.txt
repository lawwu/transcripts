[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.700]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.880]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.940]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.200]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, Longangle.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.240]   Longangle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.060]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.620]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.460]   I'm a member of Longangle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on All The Hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.660]   Now, the majority of Longangle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.320]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.280]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.240]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.160]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.440]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.000]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out Longangle and it's totally
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.160]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.880]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.000]   You heard about it here.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.680]   Again, that's longangleangle.com.
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.560]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.720]   upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.880]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I am excited you're joining me today for a conversation
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.840]   all about points and miles with none other than Julia Menez.
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.120]   She's the host of the Point Strategy Podcast, GeoBreeze Travel, where she
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.280]   interviews travelers from all walks of life about their points and miles tactics.
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.280]   I know I've personally learned some great points hacks from her, so it
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.760]   is awesome she's here today.
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.720]   We're going to talk about using buyers groups to earn a lot of points without
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.800]   increasing your budget, stacking deals to get more points, some sweet spots to
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.800]   maximize your miles, Chase's 5/24 rule, when it makes sense to buy points,
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.320]   whether you should put your taxes on your credit card, and a lot more.
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.560]   So let's jump in.
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.120]   Julia, thank you for being here.
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.400]   Hey, I'm so excited to be here and to chat about points and miles with you.
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.720]   One of my favorite topics, Julia and I, we actually met at a conference called
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.160]   FinCon, where we were both up for the best new personal finance podcast.
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.080]   Yours for GeoBreeze Travel and All The Hacks.
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.200]   For me, both of us lost, but we both won this friendship.
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.920]   And I'm excited that we got that chance to meet because some of the things
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.680]   I want to talk about today are points and miles tactics that I had not
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.520]   learned about until following you.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.520]   So I am really excited for this conversation.
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.160]   I just want to jump in and start talking about earning points.
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.480]   One of the topics that I want to start us with is a one I get a lot of emails
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.040]   about, and after I published a post about my trip to Bora Bora, the first
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.080]   question from a dozen people was, well, that's cool, but 500,000 points to go
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.920]   on a trip is a lot, how do you get them?
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.200]   And I have my tactics, but I want to hear from you.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.080]   How do you help people think about starting to earn points on a smaller budget?
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.760]   Yeah.
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.560]   So the signup bonuses are going to be how most people are going
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.480]   to earn most of their points.
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.600]   So obviously a lot of people are familiar with the signup bonuses.
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.960]   You spent maybe $3,000 in the first three months of opening your car.
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.880]   You're going to get 50 or 60,000 points.
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.680]   That's where a lot of your points are going to come from.
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.560]   But a lot of people will react to this and be like, okay, but I don't have like
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.440]   $3,000 of stuff that I need to buy.
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.240]   We are on a pretty tight budget.
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.400]   What do I do?
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.200]   Do I just not get the signup bonus?
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.400]   But there's lots of ways around that.
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.320]   If you have a smaller budget, it's going to be really important to find some
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.440]   kind of source of reimbursable spend.
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:09.120]   And this can be as simple as you pay for dinner for a whole bunch of people
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.200]   and everybody Venmo's you back.
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.280]   That way you get the points for putting the spend on your credit card, but it
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.520]   doesn't really affect your bank account because other people are paying you back.
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.880]   You can plan parties.
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.640]   I know that we just talked on my podcast about you planned a whole bunch of
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:32.480]   bachelor parties for people in Mexico and got reimbursable spend that way.
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.480]   So you can earn a ton of points by doing that.
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:41.120]   You can put work travel on your card if your job allows it or any work related
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.200]   expenses, and then just fill out an expense report.
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.920]   You can, if you're a teacher, we have an episode, I think it's episode 56
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.680]   featuring Zach from travel freely.
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:58.200]   And he was a teacher and had a very small budget, but wanted to earn more points.
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.880]   But he was also the tennis coach at that school.
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:07.280]   So all of their team trips, he would just put it on his card and then fill out an
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.200]   expense report and get reimbursed for it.
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.880]   So finding some kind of reimbursable spend is really cool.
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:19.720]   One of the more advanced ways that people do this is through something called buying
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:27.320]   groups, which basically there are people who like to resale at scale.
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:34.200]   Think like PlayStations, Apple products, cell phones, things like that.
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:41.160]   Most of the time, if there's a really good sale on an iPhone or an iPad, you're
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.160]   going to be limited for how many you can buy.
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.840]   You can't just run into Best Buy and be like, give me all your iPads.
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.280]   I'm going to resell them right before Christmas, or give me all your
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.520]   PlayStation fives, I'm going to price gouge everybody on eBay who wants
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.600]   this for Christmas for their kid.
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:02.640]   And so since you're limited for how many you can buy, some people outsource the
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:10.720]   buying to other people where they'll say, Hey, I am wanting to resell iPads.
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:16.800]   I'm offering this much, get me an iPad, ship it to my place, and I will reimburse
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.840]   you, and so then you go out and source all of these different electronics, ship
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.360]   it to their address and they pay you back.
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.800]   So this is a way that some people in the points world get a lot of spend.
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.840]   There's lots of different channels that do this for buying groups.
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:38.480]   Some of them are like PFS, NYS Buyer's Club, Buy For Me Retail, we have a whole
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:43.200]   masterclass about like the pros and cons of each one and where you can source all
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.720]   of these different products that you then ship to these different places.
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:52.360]   But the general mechanics are they put out basically an ad that says we're buying
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:57.040]   this, here's how much we'll reimburse you for, and then you try to figure out
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:01.520]   how much they'll reimburse you for, and then you try to source that item at a
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.200]   lower cost so that you're not losing money, and then ship it directly to them
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:05.800]   and they'll pay you back.
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.240]   Do they usually pay more than it would cost?
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:12.720]   So there's different ways that can be done.
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.400]   Some of them actually pay a pretty hefty commission.
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:21.560]   So PFS mostly sources like collectible gold coins from the US Mint.
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:25.600]   If a coin is going to come out, they're not going to be able to get more than one.
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:31.400]   They're going to be by one of this coin, and we'll pay you the cost of the coin
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.040]   if it's like $3,000 for a collectible or something, plus $200 commission.
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:40.000]   These deals are super rare, but that's the one that will actually pay a lot more.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.680]   Some other ones, they pay a little bit less than you might just be able to get
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:50.600]   with a store price, but if you're using that expense to meet a minimum spend on
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:56.360]   your credit card where you're going to be getting $800 of travel vouchers or
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:03.120]   something, 60,000 points, it could be worth it if, say, "Well, I could buy
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:10.760]   these for like $3,000, they're only reimbursing me like $2,900 or something,
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.200]   but I'm going to get 50,000 points out of it."
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.520]   It could be worth it.
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:19.640]   There's also other tricks to help make it a little bit better of a return on
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:24.320]   investment for you called stacking, where if you are clicking through Rakuten and
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:28.560]   earning some more Shopping Portal points for buying this PlayStation or this
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:32.400]   electronic, then that helps to bring your costs down as well.
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.960]   So that can help make up for the gap.
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.960]   You're also putting it ideally on a credit card that earns points.
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:42.120]   And I want to come back to point stacking, but buyers groups, it sounds like there
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.840]   needs to be some trust here, right?
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:48.200]   I see an ad on the internet that says, "Send all the iPads you want to this
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:52.800]   random address in this warehouse and we'll for sure send you back money."
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:53.640]   Are they reliable?
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:54.640]   Do you trust them?
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:58.680]   How do you know that you're not buying a device that you are going to mail off
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.680]   somewhere and never get paid back?
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:06.720]   So they have tracking IDs where they say, "When you order your Amazon thing, put
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:07.920]   the tracking ID here.
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:12.480]   Make sure you add this code into the description on the Amazon so we know how
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.400]   to pay you back."
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:19.840]   They have internal tracking and some of them will pay out faster than others so
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:24.280]   that you can pay off your credit card before the 30 days.
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:28.080]   And it'll vary on which ones are better than others, which ones are more
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:28.760]   trustworthy.
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:32.600]   The ones that aren't as trustworthy will lose their credibility super fast because
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.320]   every points person who's in the buyer groups is going to start complaining
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:36.520]   about them.
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:42.080]   So that's one way is to just be in the points community and talk to other people
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:47.440]   about which buyers clubs they're using and which ones have the best payouts,
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:51.800]   which ones pay out the fastest, which ones have the best offers, and then go
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:52.800]   from there.
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.880]   - When you say be in the community, where are you learning about all these
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:56.880]   different buyers clubs?
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:02.680]   - So I have a Patreon where we have a lot of people who will ask questions on
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:03.240]   this.
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:06.240]   There's also other Patreons who will talk about buying groups.
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.640]   One is called the Points Analyst on Instagram.
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.040]   He has a Patreon.
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.400]   There's Pack Your Bag with Points.
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:16.440]   He has a Patreon or a Discord, and he talks about a lot of these tactics as
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.160]   well.
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:20.840]   And then there's just a lot of people on Instagram who advertise that, "Hey, you
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:23.760]   should use this credit card if you can't meet the minimum spend.
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.040]   I like to use buying clubs.
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.160]   Here's the ones that I use."
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:30.920]   So there's a lot of us on Instagram who talk about buying groups.
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:34.880]   - Okay, I'm going to ask for a handful of links, including to your content and your
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:37.200]   masterclass, and I'll put it all in the show notes.
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:41.640]   But this sounds like something you could do to earn a meaningful number of points
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:42.040]   each year.
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:42.640]   Is that fair?
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:44.440]   - Oh, of course.
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:50.600]   Yeah, some people are putting thousands upon thousands of dollars to earn lots of
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:55.560]   sign-up bonuses, just maxing out their 5X categories on Chase Freedom Flex, if that
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:11:00.480]   comes up, because one of the main places that people will source from is Amazon.
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:06.440]   If you are getting five points per dollar at Amazon, then you are going to meet that
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:11.240]   $1,500 cap really fast on a Chase Freedom or a Chase Freedom Flex by doing Buy Your
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.440]   Clubs.
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:18.840]   For those of you not familiar, the Freedom Flex and the Freedom Card may look like cash
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:20.680]   back cards when you look at them online.
[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:24.360]   They say we get 5% cash back on these categories each quarter.
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:28.960]   But if you also have a Sapphire Preferred or a Sapphire Reserve, you can actually use
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:33.920]   the points or the cash back you earn on these cards as points and transfer them places.
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:37.800]   So the same goes with the Freedom Unlimited, which I've talked about a lot as a good kind
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.440]   of companion card.
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:44.560]   So I'm slowly learning that in almost all of the programs, whether it's Citi or Capital
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:51.160]   One or Chase, but not Amex, that if you have cash back cards, you can usually combine the
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:57.160]   cash back perks with your rewards card and be able to transfer those points as well.
[00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:01.740]   There's one other app that's really good for meeting minimum spend and getting reimbursable
[00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:02.740]   spend.
[00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:03.740]   It's called Grabber.
[00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:07.720]   So if you travel to Latin America a lot, it's spelled G-R-A-B-R.
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:11.840]   In Latin America, a lot of the things that we have in the U.S., like iPhones, will actually
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:15.480]   cost more there because of the taxes and everything.
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:19.960]   So there will be people who are going to say, "Hey, are there any Americans traveling to
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:22.300]   this city in Brazil?
[00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:23.400]   I'd like to buy an iPhone.
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:25.440]   I'm willing to pay this much."
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.960]   So let's say price in the U.S. is $1,000.
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.000]   In Brazil, it's going to cost them $1,500.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.560]   They might say, "I'm willing to pay $1,250 for an iPhone."
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:40.780]   Then you put in your bid and then deliver it to them, meet in a hotel lobby or something
[00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:46.440]   in the daytime so that you don't meet in an alleyway, obviously, as you're turning over
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:47.440]   the phone.
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.000]   But they prepay for this.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.720]   So as soon as you do the exchange, you'll get paid that reimbursable spend as well.
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:13:00.200]   So not only do you get reimbursed, but you also get paid a commission for delivering
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:01.200]   this.
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:05.120]   And the commission should be enough to cover any kinds of custom taxes that you might have
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:10.400]   to go through or just like the time and effort for hauling stuff in a bag.
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:14.000]   Don't bring like 25 iPhones into Brazil.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:20.040]   That looks sus, but you can bring a couple iPhones, like a couple of other things that
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.560]   people are requesting.
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:25.800]   Medical devices sometimes get requested if they just don't have access to them in those
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:26.800]   hospitals.
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:30.800]   So you can bring some medical devices for people in Brazil and they'll pay you commission
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:31.800]   for it.
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:34.640]   So that's another way to get reimbursable spend as well.
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:39.000]   And really just pay for a trip to Brazil or Argentina or a lot of other South American
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.320]   countries if you were planning to travel there anyway.
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:46.300]   You talked a little bit about stacking and I think it would be good to walk through an
[00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:48.640]   extreme example of how valuable this can be.
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:53.800]   So maybe one of your own that you've had recently where you're able to stack as many points
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.320]   as you could on a purchase.
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:59.960]   Because I think sometimes we think about the most obvious way to earn points is sign up
[00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:00.960]   bonuses.
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:04.800]   There are huge bonuses for spend and then your regular day-to-day spend.
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:08.720]   If you spend a lot on travel, you spend a lot on groceries, there are cards to maximize
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:09.720]   that.
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:14.320]   But every now and then, you're making a purchase that's large enough that you're like, "Is
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.080]   there another way to maximize?"
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.400]   And there are.
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:22.580]   Talk about all the ways that you know that you could stack points together on an expense.
[00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:26.980]   What I like to do for excursions a lot is I'll go to Groupon and then find an excursion
[00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:27.980]   that I want to do.
[00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:29.920]   It'll normally be discounted.
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:34.560]   Well then, I'm going to go figure out what's the exact amount that I'm going to spend on
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:39.960]   Groupon and I'll buy a Groupon gift card through this app called Floos because they're probably
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:44.520]   going to give me an extra 5% or 6% back just for buying their gift card.
[00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:47.360]   And then I'm going to go use on Groupon.com.
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:49.560]   But I don't go directly to Groupon.com.
[00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:55.200]   I instead go through Rakuten.com because Rakuten will also give me an extra 5% to 6% usually
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.200]   for clicking through.
[00:14:56.200 --> 00:15:02.960]   I've gotten as high as 18% I think if it's beauty salons and spas and stuff.
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:05.800]   So I'm earning credit card points.
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.560]   I'm earning points through Floos.
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:10.880]   I'm earning points through Rakuten and I get a Groupon discount.
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:15.040]   So that's one example of how you can stack things.
[00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:21.240]   I try not to go super crazy with stacking like 17 steps because that's 17 steps you
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:24.160]   have to track in each one like what if one thing goes wrong.
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:28.240]   But there's a lot of different ways to automate the stacking.
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:31.660]   It's really easy to do this with restaurants.
[00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:38.260]   So you can sign up for airline dining portals, lots of different dining portals.
[00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:43.280]   So you just have to link any credit card that you want and then when you dine at a partnered
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:48.280]   restaurant with that credit card, then you're going to get extra points through this dining
[00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:49.880]   portal.
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:55.080]   So in New York, we have a lot of restaurants that are in this dining portal.
[00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:59.280]   We also have this app called Seated where you make reservations through this app.
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:05.760]   You take a picture of your receipt afterwards to make sure that your reservation is completed
[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:11.680]   and they will give you 23% back a lot of the time, sometimes up to 60% back for dining.
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:15.820]   And if you can do this on a group dinner, well, I think I made like $60 in one weekend
[00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:18.960]   because no, everybody else was from out of town.
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:19.960]   Here's the group bill.
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:24.800]   I took a picture of the full group receipt before we split it up and earned $60 from
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:26.300]   some group dinners.
[00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:30.320]   So you can stack Seated, you can do the dining portal.
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:32.360]   Can you stack different dining portals?
[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:33.360]   How does that work?
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:36.920]   And for anyone not listening, Harish, who's starting a podcast, he heard all the hacks.
[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:37.920]   He was like, I want to do this.
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:40.440]   It'll be called Hacking the American Dream.
[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:43.960]   And he was like, do you talk about dining portals?
[00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.080]   They're crazy.
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:49.960]   And so he sent me some screenshots from the Southwest Rapid Rewards Dining Portal.
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:52.340]   And he's like, there's a bunch of restaurants.
[00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:56.400]   You might not find all the restaurants you want to go to and certainly don't only eat
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:58.000]   at restaurants for points.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.360]   My advice is eat for food and go where good food is.
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:03.160]   If those intersect, that's great.
[00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:07.120]   But do you have to pick one or can you say, I'm going to do the American Dining Portal
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:10.520]   and the Rapid Rewards Dining Portal and, and, and?
[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:13.680]   Normally, you can only choose one per card.
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:19.840]   So if I'm using my MX Gold to get 4X points on dining, I can only link that to one program
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:23.480]   because most of them are going to go through like the same central place and their same
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:25.840]   restaurants are on most of the networks.
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:29.600]   So you can really just choose one, unfortunately.
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:33.880]   But you can link it with another app that's kind of like a dining portal called DOSH,
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:35.140]   where it's the same idea.
[00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:40.680]   You just have to link up your credit card and then go to a partnered restaurant or shop
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:43.880]   with a partnered store, pay with that linked credit card, and then you're going to get
[00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:46.480]   some points with DOSH as well.
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:53.840]   And for super stacks, Episode 7 of the Geo Breeze Travel Podcast features this girl named
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:55.020]   Angel Trinh.
[00:17:55.020 --> 00:18:01.880]   You can find her on Instagram @pennywisetraveler and she stacked like 15 things one time in
[00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:02.880]   a group outing.
[00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:11.320]   She did like an Uber Eats credit, DOSH, seated, dining portals.
[00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:16.160]   I think there was like a Rakuten thing because she purchased a gift card to use at the restaurant
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:17.160]   there as well.
[00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:21.920]   So she was stacking so many different tactics for one dinner.
[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:27.040]   Again, that's Episode 7 of the Geo Breeze Travel Podcast and that goes into a much more
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:29.880]   extreme example of how to stack things.
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:30.880]   Awesome.
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:34.960]   So I have slowly inched my way into stacking.
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:39.000]   And the way I often do it is I use Cashback Monitor.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.440]   So anytime Julia mentioned Rakuten, a lot of people know that formerly known as Ebates
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:47.440]   is a portal you can earn cashback when you're shopping online.
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:53.160]   Anytime I'm going to make a purchase online that costs maybe over $100, I'll go look and
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.720]   say, "Is there cashback or points?"
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:19:01.000]   And the thing Cashback Monitor does that's really cool is they'll show you what are the
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.760]   best places for cashback, transferable points, airline points.
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:07.620]   So if you're watching on video, you'll see two chairs behind me.
[00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:12.960]   But in the near future, you will see a sofa behind me because this recording studio/office
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:15.020]   will soon become a guest room as well.
[00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:16.560]   And so we needed a sofa bed.
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:19.960]   And I was like, "Okay, we found the one we liked at Crate & Barrel."
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:21.440]   And I was like, "Where can I get points?"
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:26.960]   And it turns out that, yeah, I could get half an Emirates point per dollar or a few other
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:27.960]   places.
[00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:30.880]   But I get three JetBlue points per dollar was the best deal.
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:36.680]   So before I bought the couch, I went to JetBlue, I logged in, and I ended up clicking through
[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:41.120]   their link to purchase the Crate & Barrel couch on crateandbarrel.com, earning three
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:43.160]   JetBlue points per dollar.
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:45.560]   This is a money hack, but you might like it.
[00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:51.420]   One thing that I found is there are a lot of ways online you can earn coupons for major
[00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:52.840]   retailers.
[00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:57.400]   And so one that a lot of people know about is anytime you change your address, the USPS
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:01.440]   sends you a bunch of coupons to your new address.
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:06.640]   There are websites that sell those coupons to save you the hassle of finding them.
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:12.720]   And so right before we purchased the couch on Crate & Barrel, stacking the JetBlue points,
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:20.900]   I went to this website and it's called saveindeals.com, like 7deals.com, but S-A instead of S-E.
[00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:23.860]   And I tell you, this site looks like it's illegitimate.
[00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:27.120]   It does not look like a professional website.
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:32.240]   But what they do sell are Lowe's, Home Depot, and Crate & Barrel coupons.
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:37.440]   So I went in and I found a 15% off Crate & Barrel coupon.
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:44.500]   And for the low price of $3.99, I PayPaled a random address.
[00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:48.040]   And seconds later, I had an email with a 15% off Crate & Barrel coupon.
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:49.900]   Sometimes you used to be able to find these on eBay.
[00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:51.680]   It's become harder to find them.
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:54.600]   A lot of people list them on Craigslist, which is how I found them.
[00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:59.900]   I use Search Tempest and search for coupons and it searches like all the Craigslist around
[00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:00.900]   the countries.
[00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:02.220]   You can also stack with coupon codes.
[00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:06.640]   I think most people listening have probably heard of Honey or RetailMeNot and websites
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:08.160]   you can get promo codes for.
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:12.800]   But when you want actual coupon codes with unique barcodes, yes, you can do the change
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:17.560]   your address, but you can also buy them online on sketchy websites.
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:21.840]   Being a parent can be scary, whether it's watching your toddler jump on your new couch
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:27.640]   naked during potty training, or the indescribable pain of stepping on tiny plastic dinosaurs
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:28.920]   in your bare feet.
[00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:30.720]   Both of which happened to me recently.
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:35.740]   Well, one thing that doesn't have to be scary is getting life insurance, especially when
[00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:39.800]   you do it with Fabric, who I'm excited to partner with for this episode.
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:45.640]   Fabric by Gerber Life was designed by parents for parents to help you get a high quality,
[00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:49.760]   surprisingly affordable term life insurance policy in less than 10 minutes.
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:54.680]   And when I say surprisingly affordable, I actually went online to compare prices and
[00:21:54.680 --> 00:22:00.720]   found Fabric to be highly competitive with great policies like a million dollars in coverage
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:02.560]   for less than a dollar a day.
[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:07.160]   It takes less than 10 minutes to apply and you could be offered coverage instantly with
[00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:09.100]   no health exam required.
[00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:13.680]   So protect your family today with Fabric by Gerber Life.
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:19.880]   Apply today in just 10 minutes at meetfabric.com/allthehacks.
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:28.980]   That's meetfabric.com/allthehacks, M-E-E-T, fabric.com/allthehacks.
[00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:33.720]   Policies issued by Western Southern Life Assurance Company, not available in certain states.
[00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:37.800]   Price is subject to underwriting and health questions.
[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:42.320]   So I am quite comfortable right now, which is actually true almost every day, and that's
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:46.320]   thanks to Viori, and I'm excited to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:49.880]   They make performance apparel that's incredibly versatile.
[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:53.800]   Everything is designed to work out in, but it doesn't look or feel like it at all.
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:57.320]   And it's so freaking comfortable, you will want to wear it all the time.
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:01.580]   Seriously, I am pretty sure it's more comfortable than whatever you're wearing right now, unless
[00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:04.600]   you're wearing Viori, in which case you already know what I mean.
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.240]   And it's not just for men.
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:09.060]   My wife is as obsessed with Viori as I am.
[00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:11.560]   My favorite is the Sunday Performance Joggers.
[00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:16.280]   I think I have three pairs, and they are probably the most comfortable pants I've ever owned.
[00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:20.600]   Their products can be used for just about any activity, whether it's running, training,
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:21.600]   or yoga.
[00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:25.720]   They're also great for lounging, running around town, or their MetaPants can even work for
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:26.720]   a night out.
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:31.520]   Honestly, I think Viori is an investment in your happiness, and for all The Hacks listeners,
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:36.880]   they are offering 20% off your first purchase, as well as free shipping and returns on U.S.
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:39.240]   orders over $75.
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:45.320]   So you should definitely check them out at allthehacks.com/viori or in the link in the
[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:46.320]   show notes.
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:54.360]   Again, go to allthehacks.com/v-u-o-r-i and get yourself some of the most comfortable
[00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:57.920]   and versatile clothing on the planet.
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:03.360]   One other place where you can stack so many things is in Las Vegas.
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:06.440]   There's so many different ways to get deals.
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:11.560]   One of my favorite apps is called the MyVegas app, and then you just play these free slot
[00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:12.560]   machine games.
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:15.900]   They give you free tokens every day in hopes that you get addicted to gambling and then
[00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:18.120]   put money in their app, which I've never actually done.
[00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:22.600]   But they give you all of these free tokens, and you play little slot games, and you can
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:30.520]   redeem the points that you get for free Las Vegas hotel rooms or food or show tickets.
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:33.000]   Tons of different things.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.960]   It's for the MGM network in Las Vegas, and MGM has a partnership with Hyatt.
[00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:40.820]   So here's what you do.
[00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:44.680]   Play the MyVegas app, get a whole bunch of points that you can redeem for a free room
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:49.520]   or two, and then go online, status match.
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:55.080]   If you have Hyatt Explorist or Globalist status, then you're going to have MGM Gold status,
[00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:58.440]   which means you don't have to pay any resort fees at all.
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:03.120]   So you have a free hotel room where you'd normally have to pay taxes and fees, but you
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:06.080]   don't have to do that anymore because it's waived with status.
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:12.480]   And then when you check in, you give them your Hyatt Elite ID number, your World of
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:18.280]   Hyatt ID number, so that you're going to earn Hyatt Elite Nights for staying at this free
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:21.240]   MGM hotel.
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:24.680]   And that brings you closer towards status so you don't have to stay at nearly as many
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:30.120]   different Hyatt hotels just to get the free breakfast or the free upgrades or any of those
[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:31.120]   other statuses.
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:37.400]   For people who really want Globalist status but can't afford to stay at that many Hyatts,
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:40.600]   don't want to put a whole bunch of spend on a World of Hyatt card through buying groups
[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:47.000]   or anything like that, this is a really cheap way to just get Elite status with Hyatt.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.360]   How many nights could you conceivably do this for in a year?
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:55.180]   How hard is it to actually earn these MyVegas points that get you free nights?
[00:25:55.180 --> 00:26:00.560]   Super easy to earn the points, but they limit you to one premium redemption each month.
[00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:05.200]   So you can do two nights per month because some of them are for one night free, some
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:06.840]   of them are for two nights free.
[00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:12.360]   You can conceivably get 24 Elite Nights this way, which is almost halfway to the 60 that
[00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:13.680]   you need.
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:20.200]   Also, you can just pay for the cheap Vegas hotel stays.
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:22.120]   You can, but don't have to stay there.
[00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:28.760]   If you wanted to just book the Excalibur for four nights on weeknights, it's like $20 or
[00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:29.760]   $30.
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:30.760]   And then the rest of the steps are the same.
[00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:32.120]   Your resort fees are waived.
[00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:35.000]   Make sure you give them your Hyatt ID upon check-in.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.680]   Then you just get four Hyatt Elite Nights for $20 to $30 each.
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:43.720]   So you can get status really quickly that way.
[00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:49.200]   I want to just highlight some of the crazy amounts of points stacking deals.
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.600]   I'm looking at Cashback Monitor right now.
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:54.200]   And I'm looking at the Apple Store, for example.
[00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:58.440]   If you buy an Apple product and you click through the Chase portal, if you have a Chase
[00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:01.880]   Freedom card, you're going to get two points per dollar on Apple.
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:04.320]   Nike, three points per dollar.
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:07.080]   Also through Top Cashback, 10% cashback.
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:10.000]   So this comes to a place where you're like, "What do I really want?
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.120]   Do I want to maximize my points or do I want to maximize cashback?"
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:17.280]   But some of the deals I've seen have gotten really lucrative.
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:21.800]   And I just want to make sure people know that this isn't a place where you could earn a
[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:22.960]   couple points here and there.
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:26.280]   You can earn thousands of points on a purchase you're already going to make.
[00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:31.920]   Also sometimes Rakuten will increase the amount of points that they're giving for a Marriott
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:33.940]   or an IHG or something.
[00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:39.680]   If you already have a trip booked and the price hasn't changed too much for your dates,
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:42.280]   cancel that trip and rebook it, clicking through Rakuten.
[00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:45.880]   Because then you can get 10% back on IHG or something for a trip you are going to take
[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:46.880]   already.
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:48.120]   And that's something you haven't already paid for.
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:52.360]   So that's another thing that we do with just getting more points.
[00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:56.920]   If you're on a small budget without having to spend more than you wanted to spend.
[00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:59.320]   Keep an eye on these portals if you have big purchases.
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:05.160]   I know our couch, it's not in stock because of all of the supply chain issues, but they
[00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:09.240]   told us in our email confirmation, if we have to cancel it, you're okay until it's been
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:10.840]   confirmed that it's going to ship.
[00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:12.920]   So you better believe that I was checking.
[00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:18.000]   If for some reason there was a 10% cash back, which is not unheard of on some stores.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   In fact, I think when we bought our first couch from Macy's, Macy's is notorious for
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.400]   having some of the highest cash back rates.
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:30.560]   And I believe we used like a 10% cash back link to buy the first couch.
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:35.120]   So I would certainly cancel and repurchase the couch if it ended up being 10 or 20% off
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:36.640]   because of it.
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:40.520]   Every now and then I find out there are deals to be had that I missed out on.
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:46.440]   The charity donation thing in December where people were donating money and earning crazy
[00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:47.800]   amounts of miles.
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:53.120]   I kick myself regularly for the fact that I missed out on the opportunity.
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:57.600]   I know there are certain sources that write really good content, but what are the places
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:01.840]   you go for the deals that are timely and you need to act on them quickly?
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:03.440]   Are there specific places?
[00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:04.440]   Yeah.
[00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:07.880]   So if you follow a lot of us on Instagram who post about these, I post about these and
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:11.640]   you turn on post notifications, then you'll get alerted, but you can do that with any
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:13.280]   blogs that you follow too.
[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:19.800]   So a few of my favorites, I really like frequent miler and doctor of credit to stay on top
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:20.960]   of these different deals.
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:24.760]   Those are two of the ones that I follow very closely.
[00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:26.800]   I check it every day.
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:30.760]   I aggregate all of these into an app called feedly, so I don't have to go to each individual
[00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:36.400]   blog website that I read, but you can put on notifications on your email when you're
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:40.880]   subscribed to their list as well if you really want to jump on things as soon as they hit.
[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:41.880]   That brings us to another point.
[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:43.000]   So you use the feedly app.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.880]   I know there are points all over programs and one of the things that I've accumulated
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:52.600]   over the years is small balances in lots of places, keeping track of it all.
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:54.800]   I think you have a binder with lots of credit cards.
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:57.080]   How do you organize all this information?
[00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:01.680]   Are there tools that you use to stay organized with your points or you use to book things
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:02.880]   that you prefer?
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:03.880]   Yeah.
[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:10.440]   So I have different tools for different purposes for figuring out how many points I have with
[00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:11.440]   each program.
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:12.920]   I like to use award wallet.
[00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:17.520]   So it's just one dashboard that aggregates everything into one place for you.
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:22.760]   So I don't have to go check my chase account, then my Amex account, then my Marriott account,
[00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:23.760]   then my Hyatt account.
[00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:27.040]   It's all just in one dashboard and it's free.
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:29.740]   There's a paid version where they'll actually send you alerts.
[00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:36.080]   If you have points that are expiring, I like to use this tool called travel freely to check
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:42.320]   how many cars have I opened in like the last 24 months so that I know my five over 24 status.
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:46.040]   I like it because it sends me email reminders when I have an annual fee that's going to
[00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:47.160]   come to you.
[00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:49.320]   So then I can decide, okay, should I hang onto this card?
[00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:52.800]   Am I getting enough value out of it or should I just downgrade it because I'm not getting
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:54.400]   enough out of the annual fee.
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:31:00.680]   So I like travel freely because it sends me that reminder to stay organized for which
[00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:03.060]   card to use for any given purchase.
[00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:05.840]   I like to use an app called card pointers.
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:10.460]   You just tell it what cards you have and what you're trying to buy, whether it's groceries
[00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:14.260]   or gas, online shopping, public transportation.
[00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:17.500]   And then it'll tell you, oh, based off of the cards you have, here's the one that's
[00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:20.300]   going to earn like the most points slash most value.
[00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:23.760]   So you should use this card for your dining purchase.
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:30.840]   And it just takes out so much like decision making and brain usage.
[00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:37.120]   If all of this is already calculated for me, they also track in the pro version, all of
[00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:41.320]   those like Amex credits, how did I use my dining credit this month?
[00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:43.280]   Do I have shopping credits that are left somewhere else?
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:45.560]   You can track those on card pointers.
[00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:49.040]   So those are three apps that I really like to use to stay organized.
[00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:53.080]   I want to come back to something you said, which in the miles and points world is really
[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:58.240]   well known, but I think for a lot of people listening might not be, which is the 5/24
[00:31:58.240 --> 00:31:59.240]   rule.
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:04.200]   So can you talk a little bit about the 5/24 rule and why it's important for people?
[00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:05.200]   Sure.
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:11.000]   So 5/24 rule is a rule specifically set by Chase that says if you applied for five or
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:18.120]   more personal cards across any bank, Capital One, Amex, Chase, Citi, then you will be rejected
[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:22.580]   on your application for your Chase card if you've already done five or more applications
[00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:24.840]   in the last 24 months.
[00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:29.080]   That's why a lot of points blogs will really prioritize recommending Chase cards to beginners
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:34.360]   because you can grab five Chase cards and then move on to other banks, but you can't
[00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:38.800]   grab five Capital One, Amex, and Citi cards and then move on to Chase because they'll
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:39.800]   reject you.
[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:44.360]   So that's kind of the order of operations of cards is because of this rule.
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:49.000]   This rule drives so many decisions that people make with points and miles and sometimes a
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:54.280]   good offer comes up and you're already at 4/24 and it could be worth it to just get
[00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:57.560]   the Capital One Venture X or something else.
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:01.320]   But that's what the 5/24 rule is.
[00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:05.320]   So if you're listening and you're thinking about a Chase card and you think there's any
[00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:10.200]   chance you might have opened five cards up in the last 24 months, at least is it just
[00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:12.200]   opened or is it applied?
[00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:13.200]   Opened.
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:14.200]   Okay.
[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:17.440]   So I would recommend anyone who thinks they could be in that camp to check this out before
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:22.000]   because you're going to get immediately denied from Chase if you have.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:27.280]   Is there an easy way to find out if you forget how long you've had certain cards for?
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:30.760]   I like to use Credit Karma because they're going to have my entire credit history of
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:33.560]   like when certain accounts were opened so I can use that.
[00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:38.200]   But then going forward, once you know how many you've opened, use something like Travel
[00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:42.680]   Freely because it's a lot more user-friendly rather than going through the credit history
[00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:43.680]   on Credit Karma.
[00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:47.920]   Yeah, we're still in early days with all of these Points and Miles products.
[00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:51.800]   I've talked to the founder of Card Pointers and I just wish that they all started talking
[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:53.960]   to other services more regularly.
[00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:58.320]   I don't want to track whether I've used my dining credit or Uber credit.
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:01.980]   I want you to talk to Uber, find out if I have and remind me if I haven't.
[00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:07.320]   So I'm hopeful that in the years to come, a lot of these products start to connect to
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:09.080]   some of the platforms they track.
[00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:12.640]   Like Award Wallet connects to some of the points sites so that we can get kind of like
[00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:15.120]   really real-time notifications of things.
[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:19.120]   But we've talked about the Card Pointers app before and I'm a big fan, but I just feel
[00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:23.720]   like there's so much more opportunity as a lot of these programs open up and make it
[00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:27.800]   easier to share information between each other.
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:33.080]   It is worth noting on the 5/24 rule that business cards for Chase are subject to but do not
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:36.840]   count towards 5/24, which is the most confusing thing.
[00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:43.200]   So if you are looking at any Chase business cards, if you're over 5/24, you can't get
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:44.200]   them.
[00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:47.400]   It doesn't matter if you have a separate EIN, you can't get them until you're back under
[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:48.400]   5/24.
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:57.040]   But if you're at 4/24 and then you get a business card from Chase or Amex or anyone with some
[00:34:57.040 --> 00:35:02.560]   caveats, then you're still at 4/24 afterwards because the business cards don't count towards
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:04.960]   the 5/24 score.
[00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:12.380]   There are some exceptions, TD Ameritrade, Capital One, Discover, I think, but nobody's
[00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:14.360]   really using those too often.
[00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:17.200]   So most of the time, like with Chase and Amex, you're going to be good.
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:19.080]   We didn't ask this, but I probably should.
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:21.080]   And I didn't even have it on my list.
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:23.040]   What are your go-to cards?
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:27.480]   Whatever signup bonus I'm working on is going to be Plan A. And then Plan B is whatever
[00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:29.520]   Card Pointers tells me to do.
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:33.240]   For dining, that tends to be my Amex Gold.
[00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:36.160]   For rent, obviously, it's going to be Bilt because that's the only one that's going to
[00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:37.760]   let me earn points on rent.
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:41.600]   What else do I spend a lot of money on?
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:49.680]   Otherwise, most of the time, I'm working towards a minimum spend unless there's a lot of hotel
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:53.160]   promos going on, then I'll just use a hotel card or a bare-ended card.
[00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:56.880]   Do you have a threshold for when a signup bonus is worth applying for?
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:01.600]   I think there's always a signup bonus you can find to earn 50,000 points and there's
[00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:06.280]   rarely a signup bonus that'll earn over 100,000.
[00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:10.400]   Is there a point at which you see something and you're like, "Let's jump on it"?
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:14.240]   I try not to get shiny card syndrome for seeing different promos.
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:18.840]   So what I would do instead, especially for beginners, is pick a trip that you want to
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:21.160]   take and work backwards from there.
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:26.560]   Figure out the different routes that fly into that destination, how many points those routes
[00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:30.040]   cost, what kind of points you need, and let that determine what kind of credit cards you're
[00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:31.880]   going to open.
[00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:37.280]   Don't open cards just because you saw a whole bunch of points influencers post about it
[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:40.600]   and because there's a great signup bonus, but you have no idea how you're going to use
[00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:41.600]   those points.
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:47.000]   Because let's say there's a really good Southwest promo, but you're going to be living abroad
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.080]   most of next year, do not get that Southwest promo because it's going to be completely
[00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:52.240]   useless to you.
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:57.480]   So I would say work backwards rather than chasing good signup bonuses.
[00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:58.640]   How would you recommend doing that?
[00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:02.420]   Let's take an example of someone says, "Gosh, I'm trying to think of one I just got in my
[00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:03.420]   email."
[00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:04.420]   Someone said, "I wanted to go to Italy."
[00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:06.160]   Let's work backwards on that process.
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:08.440]   How do you arrive at which card might make sense?
[00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:09.440]   Yeah.
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:10.640]   So there's a new tool that came out.
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:13.520]   It's called PointMe, point.me.
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:19.760]   And this would be the first and easiest step, is if you already live near a major airport,
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:23.940]   you just plug in your airport, you plug in wherever you're trying to fly, it will tell
[00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:28.760]   you what is the best route for points and how many points you're going to need, what
[00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:30.720]   kind of points transfer, what cards will transfer.
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:37.160]   So that's like plan A, where everything works on the happy path.
[00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:39.800]   Sometimes it's going to give you ridiculous results.
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:44.540]   Oh, I want to fly direct from Kansas City to the Philippines on business class.
[00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:46.480]   That's just not going to happen.
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:52.140]   So then you're going to need to probably do a positioning flight to a larger airport and
[00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:53.800]   look from there.
[00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:56.040]   Always be open to looking at surrounding airports.
[00:37:56.040 --> 00:38:00.500]   Or maybe if you live, I don't know, North Carolina, South Carolina, you can position
[00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:03.720]   yourself to New York and then fly to Italy from there.
[00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:08.800]   Do it in two legs and do two different searches rather than just looking straight from North
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:12.340]   Carolina into Italy and there's nothing.
[00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:17.520]   Or if you wanted to go to a specific island in Thailand, do not look for flights directly
[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:18.880]   into that island.
[00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:23.520]   Look for flights that go into Bangkok and then take a cheap Thai Airways flight once
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:24.520]   you're there.
[00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:27.000]   So the positioning flights are going to help a lot.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.880]   Another trick that's really good for figuring out who flies to certain airports is look
[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:35.120]   at that airport's Wikipedia page because it will list all of the airlines that are
[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:39.480]   serviced by that airport.
[00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:42.720]   And from there you can figure out, okay, are they mostly Star Alliance flights?
[00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:45.540]   Are they mostly One World Alliance flights?
[00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:50.400]   And you kind of learn over time who transfers to who, but you can figure that out from just
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:53.440]   looking at their Wikipedia page.
[00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:54.440]   Okay.
[00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:55.440]   I like that.
[00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:56.440]   Hey, everybody.
[00:38:56.440 --> 00:39:01.080]   I just want to interrupt because I've partnered with Point.me, my favorite award search tool,
[00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:06.080]   to give you a special offer of only $1 for your first month of their standard plan if
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:12.000]   you go to allthehacks.com/pointme and use the promo code "hacks".
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:19.520]   Again, allthehacks.com/p-o-i-n-t-m-e or find the link in the show notes.
[00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:22.560]   So definitely take advantage of that if you're planning a trip with Points.
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:28.000]   I want to talk about sweet spots for redemptions, especially maybe if you don't have a huge
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   balance.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.480]   I know you've dug into a lot of this, taken many of them yourself.
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:35.960]   What are some really amazing international redemptions?
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:42.360]   So for international or domestic redemptions, you can get anywhere in the US, including
[00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:49.360]   Alaska or Hawaii on Turkish Miles and Smiles for 7,500 points in economy or 12,500 in
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:52.400]   business class if you can find the award availability.
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:56.880]   To transfer to Turkish Miles and Smiles, you're going to need either City Points, Built Points,
[00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:58.440]   or Capital One Points.
[00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:02.520]   The booking process is a little annoying because you have to call somebody once you find the
[00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:05.040]   availability to actually get these seats.
[00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:07.960]   But if you can get them, such good outsized redemption.
[00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:14.480]   You can fly from New York to Hawaii in business class, 12,500 points one way.
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:16.480]   So that's one for domestic.
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:22.200]   There's the ANA Around the World redemption, which is one of the most popular sweet spots
[00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:24.200]   that anybody ever talks about.
[00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:30.000]   And basically, if you have Amex points, you can transfer them to ANA Airways, which is
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:37.440]   a Japanese airline, and they will let you book up to eight legs in business class around
[00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:38.720]   the world.
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:42.760]   And it depends on the physical number of miles you're flying, but it's going to be around
[00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:45.960]   125,000 points total.
[00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:48.280]   There are eight business class flights.
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:49.480]   So there are some rules around it.
[00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:53.400]   You have to be traveling continuously east or continuously west.
[00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:59.400]   You have to have at least one stop in North America, South America, one stop in Europe
[00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:04.160]   or Africa, and at least one stop in Asia or Australia.
[00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:08.120]   And you cannot cross back and forth between different continents.
[00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:12.200]   So like once you go from North America to Europe, you can't suddenly go back to North
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:16.080]   America, but you can travel around within Europe, you can crisscross back and forth
[00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:18.800]   within Europe before moving on to Asia.
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:24.800]   So this is one of the most outsized redemptions ever is the ANA Around the World.
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:27.320]   You make me feel bad not talking about it before.
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:29.240]   I'm like, you're like, "This is one of the best things."
[00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:34.640]   I'm like, "Oh man, this is why we have Julia on the show," because I remember learning
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:39.920]   about it a while ago and haven't thought to bring it up, but 120,000 miles business class
[00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:44.320]   around the world with eight legs, that is unheard of.
[00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:46.960]   So sorry, but keep going.
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:51.240]   So to book this thing, what you do is you search on ANA's website to figure out what
[00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:53.400]   the eight legs you want are.
[00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:57.680]   And you don't have to have eight, you have to have a minimum of three, maximum of eight.
[00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:00.620]   So you find the flights that you want, write down the flight numbers and the flight times
[00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:03.320]   and the city, kind of make your itinerary.
[00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:08.600]   Then you have to call ANA in order to actually book this because their website cannot handle
[00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:11.760]   an eight legged multi-leg trip.
[00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:14.280]   Also you need to transfer in your Amex points.
[00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:16.640]   However, it takes three days.
[00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:20.960]   In those three days, you have to pray that your availability does not disappear.
[00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:26.240]   So you should do this like 10 months in advance so that in case one of the legs is gone in
[00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:30.520]   those three days, you have like backup routes that you can do.
[00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:35.640]   Also if you call ahead of time, like at the beginning of those three days, if you get
[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:41.040]   a nice ANA agent, they might hold the space for you while waiting for your points to transfer
[00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:42.040]   over.
[00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:47.760]   I've never heard that hack of asking someone to hold, but be kind and maybe you'll be lucky.
[00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:52.240]   I think with ANA, they also have an incredible round trip to Japan.
[00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:57.040]   I don't know if it's still only 80,000 miles, but one of the better deals.
[00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:59.080]   What I say is it can be daunting.
[00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:03.720]   If you're transferring all the miles and points you have to ANA and relying on them for one
[00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:08.040]   specific trip that could be gone by the time three days pass.
[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:12.720]   I don't know if that's the best use case, but if you have enough points that you could
[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:17.720]   transfer 80,000 and you know you want to go to Asia, but you're totally flexible when
[00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:22.040]   you can probably make it all work, but I didn't know that you could call and ask them to hold
[00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:23.040]   it.
[00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:27.840]   And if you can get someone to do that and take away all the risk, that's the move.
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:32.160]   You can also, if you didn't want to fly all the way around the world, but you just want
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:36.320]   to experience the actual ANA plane, which is fantastic.
[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:41.140]   It's supposed to be one of the nicest first class products in the sky.
[00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:46.320]   You can travel from the U S to Japan in first class.
[00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:52.120]   I want to say it's like 120,000 points round trip, which is crazy good because these flights
[00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:58.880]   are $20,000 and sometimes you can transfer virgin.
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:03.200]   You can transfer Amex points or any kind of points that transfer into virgin Atlantic
[00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:06.520]   and then book ANA with virgin Atlantic.
[00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:11.080]   And sometimes there will be Amex transfer bonus promos.
[00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:15.600]   So you transfer 60,000 points or whatever, you get maybe like a 20% bonus.
[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:16.940]   So you can do that.
[00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:21.040]   You cannot transfer virgin points to do ANA all around the world, but you can just do
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:24.840]   it if you want it to fly to Japan and back on ANA's actual plane.
[00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:26.720]   That's great.
[00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:28.940]   Any other amazing redemptions?
[00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:33.520]   Maybe if someone's trying to go to Europe, where's the sweet spot to book that?
[00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:36.840]   So I want to talk about a sweet spot across Europe.
[00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:41.240]   You can actually do this for like 10,000 United points in business class from like France
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:43.260]   to Greece, which is crazy.
[00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:46.020]   So this is called the United excursionist perk.
[00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:49.540]   We're going to start with a small example and then go into the super hack example.
[00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:54.480]   So what this is meant for is if you're doing like a triangle itinerary, like you're flying
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:45:01.160]   from New York to London, to Paris, back to New York, if you do it all on United points,
[00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:05.560]   that middle leg is free as long as the middle leg is in the same region.
[00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:06.560]   So there are certain rules.
[00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:10.460]   We're going to assume everybody who's listening to this is based in North America because
[00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:15.900]   you can do this for other regions, but for North America, your first flight on the itinerary
[00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:22.120]   has to start in North America and your last leg has to end in North America and your free
[00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:29.080]   segment, both ends of it have to be not in North America within like another region.
[00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:31.440]   So Europe is one region.
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:37.320]   So that's why that itinerary works of New York starts in the North America region, fly
[00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:44.140]   over to London, London to Paris is both self-contained in a separate region, and then it ends back
[00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:45.140]   in New York.
[00:45:45.140 --> 00:45:47.120]   So you can do that.
[00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:49.800]   Now you can super hack this.
[00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:52.940]   It does not need to be a continuous itinerary.
[00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:56.680]   So let's say you went on to Scott's cheap flights or something, found a really good
[00:45:56.680 --> 00:46:03.640]   deal flying into Paris, and you found another really good cash deal from Greece back home,
[00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:07.320]   but you have no way to connect these two deals.
[00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:10.940]   You can actually fly across Europe for free, basically free.
[00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:11.940]   So here's what you do.
[00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:13.920]   Let's say you're in Los Angeles.
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:20.120]   You can book a United flight from Los Angeles to Las Vegas for like 5,000 points.
[00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:25.480]   Then the next thing you search for in your itinerary is from Paris to Athens.
[00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:30.560]   And then the last leg is going to be from another random flight from Los Angeles to
[00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:33.320]   Las Vegas for 5,000 points.
[00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:39.080]   That middle leg is still free because your first flight starts in North America from
[00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:42.020]   that random Los Angeles to Las Vegas flight.
[00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:48.680]   Your middle leg is completely contained in not North America, Europe to Europe.
[00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:55.520]   And your last leg, which is another Los Angeles to Las Vegas flight, still ends in North America.
[00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:59.000]   So then you just have to fill in the gaps of like find a cheap cash flight, find another
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:03.720]   way to get from the US to France, find another way to get from Greece back home.
[00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:06.400]   But that middle leg is going to be free.
[00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:09.100]   So that's just an economy thing.
[00:47:09.100 --> 00:47:14.380]   If you wanted to book Los Angeles to Las Vegas in business class United, you can get that
[00:47:14.380 --> 00:47:19.300]   middle leg for free in business class because it'll match whatever is the first leg.
[00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:24.420]   You have to take the first flight or it negates the rest of the itinerary, but the last flight
[00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:27.420]   is optional for you.
[00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:32.180]   So for people who want to just do a quick route or if you already have to take a short
[00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:38.000]   domestic flight anyway, and you can plan ahead and structure these itineraries, you can fly
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.640]   Cape Town to the Seychelles, which I don't even know how expensive that would be, but
[00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:49.400]   you could do that for free if you can structure a United excursionist itinerary correctly.
[00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:53.360]   If I understand this right, I can book a North America flight, even if it's a short distance
[00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:57.960]   like San Francisco to LA, which sometimes is only 7,500 miles.
[00:47:57.960 --> 00:48:03.860]   And then at a date after that, I can book a one-way ticket, even if it connects within
[00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:04.860]   one region.
[00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:09.700]   So like you said, Cape Town to Kenya or to the Seychelles, places where flights are really
[00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:10.700]   expensive.
[00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:15.740]   And then a date after that, just book another flight within North America, LA back to San
[00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:21.460]   Francisco, don't even have to take it, could conceivably get both your North America flights
[00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:26.100]   and the international flight for potentially 15,000 or less miles.
[00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:27.100]   Yep.
[00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:28.100]   That's amazing.
[00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:29.560]   That's a great hack.
[00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:31.640]   I'm going to brainstorm ways to use it.
[00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:35.520]   If anyone listening has creative ideas on how they could use something like that, definitely
[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:36.680]   reach out.
[00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:40.280]   Would love to see all the creative ways they wrote about it.
[00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:42.600]   You all know I love credit card points.
[00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:46.640]   So I'm excited to be partnering with Card Pointers today, which is one of my favorite
[00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:48.220]   tools for travel hacking.
[00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:52.260]   It's a free app that helps you manage all of your credit cards in one place and makes
[00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:57.800]   it easy to find the right card to maximize your category bonuses on every purchase.
[00:48:57.800 --> 00:49:03.000]   You can also load it on your partner's phone, so they always know the best cards to use.
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:08.760]   The app automatically tracks every category bonus and recurring credit from over 5,000
[00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:09.760]   cards.
[00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:14.800]   And they also track and help you use your Amex, Chase, Bank of America, or Citibank
[00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:18.160]   offers to save even more money every day.
[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:22.660]   And with their browser extension, you can actually activate every single Amex and Chase
[00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:24.860]   offer in just one click.
[00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:29.500]   And because of that massive credit card database, you can do all of this without having to give
[00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:32.360]   up any personal or banking details.
[00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:36.580]   The app is free to download, and many of the features are free as well.
[00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:39.680]   But if you want to try out the pro version, there's a free trial.
[00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:44.280]   And if you decide you want to sign up after the trial, which you probably will, you can
[00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:49.740]   go to allthehacks.com/cardpointers to get 20% off.
[00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:56.960]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/cardpointers.
[00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:59.640]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:00.640]   I get it.
[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:02.200]   Life comes at you fast.
[00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:06.240]   But trust me, your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:10.320]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:15.120]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor Drizzly, the go-to app for
[00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:17.880]   drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:20.680]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:22.520]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:26.680]   It could be your dog's birthday, that the sun finally came out, or maybe you just want
[00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:29.520]   to celebrate that you got through another week.
[00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:34.120]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:39.000]   which means you can entice your friends to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:43.040]   And since I know you like a good deal, Drizzly compares prices on their massive selection
[00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:46.200]   of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:50.120]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting family last week, not
[00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:55.440]   only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less than an hour, but I found it for $15
[00:50:55.440 --> 00:50:57.260]   less than my local liquor store.
[00:50:57.260 --> 00:51:02.280]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:06.200]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:11.240]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:14.520]   Before we get back to the episode, I just want to thank you for listening to and supporting
[00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:15.520]   the show.
[00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:19.180]   Your support of our advertisers is what keeps this show going.
[00:51:19.180 --> 00:51:25.920]   To learn more about all our partners and get links to all their deals, you can go to allthehacks.com/deals
[00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:29.580]   where the URLs, codes, and discounts are all right there.
[00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:32.440]   So please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:34.560]   A few other quick things before we go.
[00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:38.900]   I've gotten a few questions from listeners that I feel like would be a great conversation.
[00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:40.760]   And I want to get your take on some.
[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:45.120]   And one is from Eric from Cincinnati, who I won't say the city's from everyone, but
[00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:48.400]   Eric's name in his email from was Eric from Cincy.
[00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:49.400]   So it seems fun.
[00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:52.120]   Asked if buying points ever makes sense.
[00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:55.440]   And I'll give you my perspective and I want to hear yours and we can go back on a few
[00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:56.440]   of these questions.
[00:51:56.440 --> 00:52:02.420]   But in general, there are always these promotions that I've seen from airlines, from hotel
[00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:05.820]   groups to buy points and they're like, "Oh, it's 2x points.
[00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:07.420]   Everything's 50% off."
[00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:13.120]   My advice has always been, if you have a redemption in mind, it can be a really great deal.
[00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:17.200]   Or if the whole world is blowing up about how it's the best thing ever and you have
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:19.540]   to do it, great, which is rare.
[00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:25.920]   But otherwise, I see almost weekly some promotion for buying points at a huge discount.
[00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:30.060]   And I pretty much disregard all of them unless I'm about to do something.
[00:52:30.060 --> 00:52:31.060]   What do you think?
[00:52:31.060 --> 00:52:32.160]   Very similar thoughts.
[00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:37.760]   So do not speculatively buy points only buy them if you already know how you're going
[00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:43.040]   to use them and you've done the math to make sure that whatever redemption value you're
[00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:48.500]   going to get from using those points is better than the purchase price of those points.
[00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:52.000]   Don't buy points for like two cents per point and then use them on a redemption where you
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.280]   get one and a half cents per point.
[00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:58.000]   So just make sure that you know what you're going to use them for and that you've done
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.680]   the math on it and then you're good to go.
[00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:05.680]   The two exceptions I have are, it might not be a great deal to buy points, but if you
[00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:11.520]   are trying to book a flight or book a hotel and you have almost enough, you want to book
[00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:17.440]   an award that's 80,000 points and you have 78,000 and you don't have any way to transfer
[00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:22.520]   it in, it could make sense to pay an astronomical like five cents per point or whatever the
[00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:27.600]   fee is to get those last 2,000 points to get you this amazing reward.
[00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:31.360]   That's generally, I think, one of the few use cases, but it falls into exactly what
[00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:32.360]   you said.
[00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:36.000]   Make sure you have a way you want to use it in mind before you do it.
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:40.080]   Because just like Marriott's recently done some devaluation, the last thing you want
[00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:44.880]   to do is buy something that sounds like a good deal today, but the program changes and
[00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:47.720]   maybe it's not a good deal tomorrow.
[00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:49.640]   Absolutely.
[00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:53.240]   What about paying taxes on a credit card?
[00:53:53.240 --> 00:54:00.400]   I think I had always thought my whole life, it would never make sense to pay fees on a
[00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:02.080]   credit card purchase.
[00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:05.760]   So whenever someone says, "Oh, we'll charge you 3% before the built card."
[00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:09.880]   It was like, "Oh, you can pay your rent, but you have to pay fees with plastic or other
[00:54:09.880 --> 00:54:10.880]   services."
[00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:13.960]   I was always like, "It never makes sense to pay fees to earn points."
[00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:17.720]   And then I just started digging into paying taxes on a credit card this year, and I'm
[00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:21.160]   not sure I agree anymore.
[00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:27.320]   So it can be a really good way to meet minimum spend if you don't have another way to easily
[00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:28.320]   meet your minimum spend.
[00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:36.240]   So for example, the Amex Business Platinum has a $15,000 minimum spend, which is a lot.
[00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:39.920]   And so if you don't want to do buying groups or any of the other reimbursable spend things
[00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:46.160]   that we talked about earlier on in the episode, it can make sense to just pay an extra 3%
[00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:51.040]   to get that 120,000 point bonus on the Amex Business Platinum.
[00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:58.240]   So if you're going for something like that, or you have Hilton Surpass, where you get
[00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:05.480]   a free night if you are putting $15,000 on the card each year, if you're going to get
[00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:13.040]   whatever 15,000 times 3% is, at least that much value out of your free hotel night at
[00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:17.080]   some Waldorf Astoria, it could be worth it to do it for something like that.
[00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:21.000]   Or just like cap it if, "Oh, I'm like 10,000 of the way there.
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:24.360]   I have no other way of getting that 5,000."
[00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:28.840]   Then it might be worth it if you want to put your taxes on a credit card and pay that extra
[00:55:28.840 --> 00:55:29.840]   fee.
[00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:35.040]   So I started looking into this and I realized most of the places you pay for things online
[00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:40.680]   on a credit card, the fees are pretty high, 2.5%, 3%, I've seen 4%.
[00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:45.280]   What I realized was that the fees to pay your taxes on a credit card are actually lower
[00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:46.320]   than I expected.
[00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:49.560]   So there are 3 sites the IRS shows.
[00:55:49.560 --> 00:55:56.540]   The lowest one is pay1040.com and the fee is 1.87% this year.
[00:55:56.540 --> 00:56:00.560]   So I was thinking, "Gosh, I have a VentureX card."
[00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:07.720]   And at the worst case, you can redeem your points, which you earn two of at one penny,
[00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:08.760]   booking travel.
[00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:13.600]   So $0.02 per dollar spent, so 2% cash back.
[00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:17.880]   Also could do it with a Citi Double Cash or any card that pays 2% cash back, you would
[00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:21.660]   actually net a profit paying your taxes on your credit card.
[00:56:21.660 --> 00:56:25.100]   Now, I quickly thought, "Ooh, who doesn't want a free profit?"
[00:56:25.100 --> 00:56:28.040]   So I was like, "Hmm, what if I put $10,000?"
[00:56:28.040 --> 00:56:32.760]   I'm not saying I owe 10,000 or you would, but just to illustrate the example.
[00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:37.160]   And I realized if I'm going to put $10,000 on a credit card and I'm going to pay a fee
[00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:46.040]   of $187, but I'm going to earn 2%, which is $200, I'm literally going to make $13.
[00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:48.100]   And that's for a $10,000 tax bill.
[00:56:48.100 --> 00:56:51.060]   So I thought, "Okay, this is not a way to make money.
[00:56:51.060 --> 00:56:55.820]   This is not a way to rack up points at the IRS's expense.
[00:56:55.820 --> 00:56:59.540]   But what it is, is a great way to meet minimum spend."
[00:56:59.540 --> 00:57:05.620]   So if anyone's listening and they had a business and they signed up with Capital One's Spark
[00:57:05.620 --> 00:57:13.020]   Cash Plus card, it had the most egregious minimum spend, which was $50,000 in six months.
[00:57:13.020 --> 00:57:17.420]   And now all of a sudden, I'm thinking, "Maybe I should lower my deductions from work on
[00:57:17.420 --> 00:57:22.640]   my taxes so that I owe the IRS money, so that I can put some spend on this card."
[00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:28.580]   But at 1.87%, I think it could work really well for meeting minimum spend and not losing
[00:57:28.580 --> 00:57:29.580]   money.
[00:57:29.580 --> 00:57:34.540]   But it's probably not a way to generate a return.
[00:57:34.540 --> 00:57:40.340]   So if you overpay your taxes, the IRS will issue you a check back.
[00:57:40.340 --> 00:57:41.940]   It's very slow.
[00:57:41.940 --> 00:57:43.580]   They're very slow to do this.
[00:57:43.580 --> 00:57:49.860]   But if you wanted to pay them $50,000, they will probably send you a check back like six
[00:57:49.860 --> 00:57:56.480]   months later for $40,000 in this example, and then you earned your bonus.
[00:57:56.480 --> 00:57:58.100]   So that is a strategy.
[00:57:58.100 --> 00:57:59.100]   Some people do.
[00:57:59.100 --> 00:58:05.540]   I don't want to be that leveraged for $50,000 for six months, but some people do things
[00:58:05.540 --> 00:58:06.540]   like that.
[00:58:06.540 --> 00:58:11.380]   I definitely do not want to owe, especially on a card that's a charge card.
[00:58:11.380 --> 00:58:14.420]   Maybe if it was a 0% APR card, you could carry it.
[00:58:14.420 --> 00:58:20.660]   But I did realize that if you're trying to meet a minimum spend in 2022 at 1.87% on the
[00:58:20.660 --> 00:58:21.660]   right card, right?
[00:58:21.660 --> 00:58:26.620]   It has to be a card that's earning you 2% back or more, otherwise you'd be losing money.
[00:58:26.620 --> 00:58:30.760]   But I've turned my position on this a little bit, and I think it could make sense.
[00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:31.760]   Last few things.
[00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:37.380]   I got an email from a woman named Brandy who pointed out something that I didn't realize.
[00:58:37.380 --> 00:58:42.940]   I'm not in the military, nor is my spouse, but I recently learned and wanted to share
[00:58:42.940 --> 00:58:48.220]   that if you have a Chase, an Amex, or a Citi card, and you are in the military or your
[00:58:48.220 --> 00:58:53.500]   spouse is in the military, they will waive your annual fees on all the cards.
[00:58:53.500 --> 00:58:54.780]   I looked at the list.
[00:58:54.780 --> 00:58:59.660]   It's Chase Reserve, it's Amex Platinum, real cards with high annual fees.
[00:58:59.660 --> 00:59:01.940]   I know you've done an episode on a lot of these things.
[00:59:01.940 --> 00:59:07.700]   I wanted to hear your take on this and other perks that might apply to people in that situation.
[00:59:07.700 --> 00:59:09.860]   So they'll waive it on all personal cards.
[00:59:09.860 --> 00:59:13.100]   Unfortunately, they won't waive it on business cards if you're trying to get like the Chase
[00:59:13.100 --> 00:59:15.940]   Inc Business Cash or the Amex Business Gold.
[00:59:15.940 --> 00:59:22.740]   But for all of the personal ones, yes, you don't have to pay the $700 on the Amex Platinum,
[00:59:22.740 --> 00:59:23.960]   which is amazing.
[00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:27.940]   We actually have an episode that covers a lot of different military benefits.
[00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:32.180]   It's episode 67, featuring Mark White.
[00:59:32.180 --> 00:59:35.020]   And he's in the military, he talks about the waive fees.
[00:59:35.020 --> 00:59:40.840]   You can get into different lounges for free with military ID if you're traveling.
[00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:43.980]   You can get free status with Caesars.
[00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:48.500]   I don't know if they still do this because they recently changed their program, but it
[00:59:48.500 --> 00:59:54.500]   used to be that you would get automatic platinum status for both the military member and their
[00:59:54.500 --> 00:59:56.020]   spouse.
[00:59:56.020 --> 00:59:59.880]   And each of those would get you three free nights at the Atlantis in the Bahamas.
[00:59:59.880 --> 01:00:05.440]   So six free nights for an Atlantis Bahamas vacation for a couple.
[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:08.040]   So lots of different tricks like that.
[01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:12.040]   More of them in episode 67 to talk about lots of different military benefits and places
[01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:17.120]   that you can get discounts or just extra perks for military.
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:22.200]   And one thing you told me, there's a site called id.me where it's not just military.
[01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:26.800]   There are other branches of healthcare and I think education maybe where you can go link
[01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:32.000]   up your email to prove that you're in that group or even verify it in other ways and
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.800]   get access to a lot of perks.
[01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:35.480]   Yep, absolutely.
[01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:38.960]   Travel perks, different discounts with different stores, restaurant things.
[01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:44.960]   So if you're a student, a teacher, government worker, healthcare worker, military, you can
[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:49.280]   go to id.me and check for all of these different discounts.
[01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:51.320]   Awesome.
[01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:56.240]   Last thing I want to share is I've talked numerous times on the podcast and gotten so
[01:00:56.240 --> 01:01:01.220]   much great feedback from listeners getting upgraded around the world by sending a note
[01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:04.540]   into the hotel after booking directly with them.
[01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:08.080]   And people have asked me, "What is the message you send?"
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:13.900]   And I've always given really generic advice that was, "Oh, just say, 'Hey, I'm coming.
[01:01:13.900 --> 01:01:14.900]   These are my dates.
[01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:16.700]   This is what I'm doing.
[01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:21.200]   And I want to share your link," which Julia has set up.
[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:26.080]   Let us know where to go for your guide to exactly what template you should send to a
[01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:29.220]   hotel to maximize your chance for an upgrade.
[01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:30.620]   So I made you guys a special link.
[01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:34.080]   It's at geobreeztravel.com/allthehacks.
[01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:40.200]   It'll take you directly to the template that I've used to get some amazing upgrades.
[01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:44.860]   One of my favorites, I used it at the Waldorf Astoria in Maui, which we were using a Hilton
[01:01:44.860 --> 01:01:46.020]   free night certificate.
[01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:50.240]   And it's one of the most expensive hotels where you can use this free night certificate.
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:53.020]   So rooms start at like $500.
[01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:57.420]   And I used this email template asking if we could get upgraded to the $650 room if they
[01:01:57.420 --> 01:01:59.260]   had availability.
[01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:02.100]   We got upgraded to a $900 room.
[01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:04.700]   And this place was crazy.
[01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:07.300]   It was in a gated community, part of the hotel.
[01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:11.320]   I swear I could see three islands from the balcony in this room.
[01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:12.900]   It came with free breakfast.
[01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:15.820]   It came with free cocktail hour and dinner.
[01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:19.600]   So we didn't even have to buy food that much when we were in Hawaii.
[01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:24.340]   So lots of crazy upgrades that I've gotten.
[01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:28.860]   You can find all the details at geobreeztravel.com/allthehacks.
[01:02:28.860 --> 01:02:32.980]   It also walks you through like, how do you find the correct email address to where to
[01:02:32.980 --> 01:02:33.980]   send this to?
[01:02:33.980 --> 01:02:35.860]   How far in advance should you send these things?
[01:02:35.860 --> 01:02:40.740]   So check it out and always let me know if it works for you and you got a cool upgrade
[01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:44.020]   because I love hearing about the cool upgrades that people get with it.
[01:02:44.020 --> 01:02:46.940]   That's a great segue to where can people find you?
[01:02:46.940 --> 01:02:51.340]   Obviously GeoBreeze Travel, the podcast, search for it in the store, GeoBreeze Travel, the
[01:02:51.340 --> 01:02:52.340]   site.
[01:02:52.340 --> 01:02:53.340]   What about you personally?
[01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:56.180]   Where are you online and how can people get in touch?
[01:02:56.180 --> 01:02:59.720]   So I mostly hang out on Instagram @geobreeztravel.
[01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:03.280]   I try to respond to all the DMs of people who follow me.
[01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:07.260]   So give me a follow, send me all of your questions, feel free to email me.

[01:03:08.860 --> 01:03:13.300]   Awesome, Julia, thank you so much for being here.
[01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:18.100]   I look forward all the time to your Instagram stories because I never know what next deal
[01:03:18.100 --> 01:03:19.940]   or awesome perk I'm going to find.
[01:03:19.940 --> 01:03:23.260]   I look forward to more conversations like this down the road.
[01:03:23.260 --> 01:03:24.260]   Absolutely.
[01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:26.020]   Thank you so much for having me on the show.
[01:03:26.020 --> 01:03:29.980]   If anybody has any questions, I am always happy to talk about points and miles.
[01:03:29.980 --> 01:03:34.020]   So feel free to reach out, say hi and send me all your questions.
[01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:35.140]   Awesome.
[01:03:35.140 --> 01:03:37.500]   Thank you.
[01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:38.500]   Okay.
[01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:40.980]   There are going to be so many links in the show notes.
[01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:43.260]   I really hope you enjoyed this episode.
[01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:44.940]   Thank you so much for listening.
[01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:49.380]   If you plan on signing up for any of the cards we discussed or really any cards, you can
[01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:56.700]   support me and the show by doing that at allthehacks.com/cards and I would really appreciate it.
[01:03:56.700 --> 01:04:01.620]   And as I mentioned at the beginning of the show, this Sunday, May 8th marks the one year
[01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:03.580]   anniversary of this podcast.
[01:04:03.580 --> 01:04:06.240]   It is crazy to think it's almost been a year.
[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:09.740]   So thank you all so much for supporting me on this journey.
[01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:14.840]   To celebrate, I'm inviting you all to join a live recording of a Q and A episode this
