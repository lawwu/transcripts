[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.480]   One of your mantras is, you know, if you want to look like an athlete, train like an athlete.
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.880]   And I think that's something really special that sets aside what you do from what a lot
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.320]   of other very well qualified people do.
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:23.120]   And in terms of the use of weights and resistance, whether or not it's body weight or weights
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:30.040]   in the gym or pulleys versus cardio, you know, in terms of overall health, aesthetics and
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.240]   athleticism, is there a way that you could point to, you know, the idea that maybe people
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:41.240]   should be doing, you know, 50% resistance training and 50% cardio, maybe it's 70/30,
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.240]   maybe it's 30/70.
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.840]   And, and here I'm talking about the typical person who would like to maintain or maybe
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.620]   even add some muscle mass, probably in particular areas for most people, as opposed to just
[00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.620]   overall mass.
[00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.960]   Although we'll talk about that later.
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.040]   And people want to maintain a relatively low body fat percentage and being good cardiovascular
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.040]   health.
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.920]   What's the sort of contour of a basic program that anybody could think about as a starting
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.680]   place?
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.760]   I think it's like a 60/40 split, which would be leaning towards weight training, you know,
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.960]   strength and, and, and then, you know, the conditioning aspect be about 40%.
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.520]   So if you look at it over a course of a training week, I mean, five days in a gym would be
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.520]   a great task.
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.840]   And obviously not in the gym, it could be done at home, but three days strength training,
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.900]   Monday, Wednesday, Friday, conditioning, Tuesday, Thursday, you know, two days, it's a, it's
[00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:34.000]   a pretty easy roundabout way to split that up, of course, depending upon training goals.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.560]   And as you said, the aesthetic goals like that will shift dramatically.
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.680]   But if you want to see the benefits of both, that's probably the, the effective dose for
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.600]   strength training and the effective dose for conditioning at the bare minimum level, again,
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.720]   being a much better performer conditioning wise, you're gonna want to do more than that.
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.480]   And in terms of the duration of those workouts, what's your suggestion?
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:00.640]   I've been weight training for about 30 years, running for about 30 years, and mainly for
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:07.000]   health and have found that if I work hard in the gym or at resistance training for more
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.720]   than 60 minutes or so, it's very hard for me to recover, I start getting colds, I start
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.800]   getting weaker from workout to workout.
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.120]   But amazingly, at least to me, if I keep those workouts to about 10 minutes, 10 minutes of
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:24.800]   warm up and 50, five, zero minutes or so of really hard work for resistance training,
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.360]   and I keep the cardiovascular work to about 30 to 45 minutes, I feel great.
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.100]   And I seem to make some progress at least some place in the workout from workout to
[00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.100]   workout.
[00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.320]   Yeah, I mean, it's those are good numbers, because those are kind of numbers that we
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.920]   usually preach, we try to keep our workouts to an hour or less if possible.
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.360]   Now, depending upon the split that you're following, if you're on a total body split,
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.080]   there's just gonna be more that has to be done in a given amount of time that and again,
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.960]   if you're training primarily for strength, that could prolong the workout because the
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.480]   longer rest times in between sets, but in general, when you're not focused on that one
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.560]   aspect, but the overall health picture, then you can get the job done in under an under
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.560]   an hour.
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.760]   And again, I always say, on top of if you want to look like an athlete train like an
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.360]   athlete is you can either train longer, you can train hard, but you can't do both.
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.400]   And I really believe that the focus for me, I have a busy life, I have a lot of other
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.360]   things that I do, believe it or not, and it's like, I want to go hard, and I want to go
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.640]   get out.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.840]   And I find that my body also responds to that I think a lot of guys bodies respond to that.
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:31.000]   And particularly, as you start to get older, I think it's the it's the length of the workout
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.560]   that actually causes more problems than the intensity of what you're doing, particularly
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.780]   if you're warmed up properly.
[00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.840]   Like you said, I found personally that my warm up has had to become more of an integral
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.480]   part of my workout than it ever has before.
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.360]   I never I could get in the gym when I was 20.
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.280]   And I'm going right over, I'm doing the one set, two sets, I'm in, I'm ready to go, you
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.680]   know, and I never do another workout warm up set for any of the other exercises I do
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.580]   the rest of the day.
[00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.160]   That's not that's not true anymore, you know, and I found that as long as I'm willing to
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.480]   sort of give myself a little bit of a warm up, the intensity is not what bothers me,
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.680]   you know, I'm very much in control of the weights I use, and it doesn't bother me.
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.840]   But if I start to go pretty long, I start to feel achy or I start to have problems.
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.940]   So again, depending upon age, that also plays a factor in the length.
[00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:21.240]   But again, I think everybody can achieve on a standard program can achieve the results
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.480]   that they want within an hour.
