[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520]   Well, Christmas has arrived.
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.920]   Merry Christmas to each and every one of you who listen to the podcast.
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:14.240]   And today we celebrate Jesus of Nazareth, the incarnation of God in the flesh.
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.120]   Emmanuel, God with us.
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.600]   So why did Christ enter into this world?
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.880]   What was his goal?
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.480]   For the answer, I have persuaded Pastor John to read a chapter from his excellent book,
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.160]   Seeing and Savoring Jesus Christ.
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.160]   He has.
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.840]   They recorded it specifically for you, the APJ audience, and you are hearing this for
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.280]   the very first time.
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.040]   Here now is Pastor John reading chapter 10 from his wonderful book, Seeing and Savoring
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:44.040]   Jesus Christ, to answer the question, why was Christ born into the world?
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.560]   But God being rich in mercy because of the great love with which he loved us, even when
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.440]   we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ.
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.880]   Ephesians 2, verses 4 and 5.
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:03.800]   Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.080]   and find grace to help in time of need.
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.120]   Hebrews 4, verse 16.
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.440]   Chapter 10.
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:20.240]   The incarnate wealth of the compassion of God, the mercies of Christ.
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.400]   God is the wealthiest person in the universe.
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:30.800]   He not only owns more than anyone else, he owns everyone else and everything everyone
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.240]   else owns.
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.440]   When you create something, it belongs to you.
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.040]   And God created everything, including us.
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.760]   It is he who made us and not we ourselves.
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.920]   We are his people and the sheep of his pasture.
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.720]   Psalm 100, verse 3.
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.440]   There is one ultimate owner in the universe.
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.960]   God.
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.560]   All others are trustees.
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.160]   Neither we nor what we have is finally our own.
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:07.120]   It is all a trust to be used for the aims of the owner.
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.840]   In a sense, therefore, all sin is embezzling.
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.760]   But strikingly, the New Testament describes the wealth of God not mainly in terms of what
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:26.920]   he created and owns, but mainly in terms of the glory he has from all eternity.
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:35.320]   Repeatedly, we read of the riches of his glory or his riches in glory.
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.440]   For example, Ephesians 3, verse 16.
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.880]   Philippians 4, verse 19.
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.240]   Colossians 1, verse 27.
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:50.320]   If God were only rich because he made and owns all things, he would have been poor before
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.800]   creation.
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:58.640]   But that means he would have created out of need and would be dependent on his creation.
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.960]   But that is not the picture of God we find in the Bible.
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.920]   God did not create to get wealth.
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:12.760]   He created to display wealth, the wealth of his glory for the enjoyment of his people.
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.960]   Ephesians 1, verse 16, verse 12, verse 14.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:22.440]   But even more specifically, the focus of the New Testament is that the wealth of God's
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:29.240]   glory is at its apex the wealth of his mercy.
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.280]   This is something the world takes very lightly.
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.920]   The riches of God's kindness and forbearance and patience.
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.680]   Romans 2, verse 4.
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:47.160]   God created and redeemed the world so that he might make known the riches of his glory
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.560]   for the vessels of mercy which he prepared beforehand for glory.
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.480]   Romans 9, verse 23.
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:02.240]   Or to put it another way, he creates and saves his people so that in the coming ages he might
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:10.280]   show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.280]   Ephesians 2, verse 7.
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:20.400]   The universe exists primarily to display the wealth of the glory of the mercy of God for
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:27.440]   the enjoyment of his redeemed people from every tribe and tongue and people and nation.
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:35.080]   Kindness is essential among the perfections of God's glory, but mercy is paramount.
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:42.760]   He who justifies the wicked and he who condemns the righteous are both alike an abomination
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:43.760]   to the Lord.
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.040]   Proverbs 17, verse 15.
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:53.640]   Yes, therefore justice is essential, but something else is also true.
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:58.280]   It is a man's glory to overlook an offense.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.920]   Proverbs 19, verse 11.
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:07.000]   Therefore, if justice can be preserved, it is the apex of glory to show mercy.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.240]   For this reason, Jesus Christ came into the world.
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.080]   Jesus is the mercy of God incarnate and visible.
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.120]   He is also the justice of God incarnate.
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.800]   But justice was subordinate.
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:26.200]   God did not send the Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.320]   might be saved through him.
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.960]   John 3, verse 17.
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:38.720]   God the Father offered up his Son in death so that he might be just and the justifier
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.600]   of the one who has faith in Jesus.
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.960]   Romans 3, verse 26.
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:50.600]   The substitutionary death of Jesus Christ created the backdrop of justice where justifying
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.720]   mercy would shine with unparalleled glory.
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:01.480]   Therefore, the glory of God's mercy is the aim of Christ's coming.
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:06.400]   This is explicit in Romans 15, verses 8 and 9.
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:14.520]   Christ came into the world to confirm the promises given to the patriarchs and in order
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:20.280]   that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy.
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:25.760]   The aim of the incarnation was to magnify the mercy of God for the enjoyment of the
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.080]   nations.
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:32.960]   In Mary's Magnificat and in Zechariah's prophetic song at the birth of John the Baptist,
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:38.920]   the reason given for the coming of Jesus was in remembrance of God's mercy.
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.960]   Luke 1, verse 54.
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.840]   And because of the tender mercy of our God.
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.400]   Luke 1, verse 78.
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:55.120]   For as the Apostle Paul put it, the work of Christ is due to God's being rich in mercy.
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.800]   Ephesians 2, verse 4.
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.520]   It is all according to the riches of his grace.
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.120]   Ephesians 1, verse 7.
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.240]   He bestows his riches on all who call on him.
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.640]   Romans 10, verse 12.
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:16.840]   This mercy that Jesus embodies and brings is utterly free.
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.080]   Not that there was no cost.
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:23.800]   Jesus paid the price at the cost of his own life.
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:31.380]   In him, we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according
[00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:35.720]   to the riches of his grace.
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.480]   Ephesians 1, verse 7.
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:43.800]   But now to broken and needy sinners, it is absolutely free.
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:50.360]   Thus God says, "So then it depends not on human will or exertion, but on God who has
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:51.420]   mercy.
[00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:58.480]   So then he has mercy on whomever he wills, and he hardens whomever he wills."
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:02.280]   Romans 9, verses 14 to 16.
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:03.960]   Verse 18.
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.240]   We do not earn mercy.
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:10.400]   We receive it as a free gift by faith, not by works.
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.220]   He saved us.
[00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:20.320]   Not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy.
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:23.000]   Titus 3, verse 5.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:30.420]   Even the faith to receive this mercy is itself a gift of mercy.
[00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:37.320]   To you, it has been freely given for Christ's sake to believe.
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.440]   Philippians 1, verse 29.
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:41.240]   Author's translation.
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:43.080]   And what about others?
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:47.240]   Let us correct our opponents with gentleness.
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:54.280]   God may perhaps grant them repentance, leading to a knowledge of the truth.
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.460]   2 Timothy 2, verse 25.
[00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:58.440]   See also Ephesians 2, verse 8.
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.520]   John 6, verse 44.
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.720]   Acts 13, verse 48.
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:09.400]   From start to finish, God saves us not because of works, but because of his own purpose and
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:14.200]   grace which he gave us in Christ Jesus before the ages began.
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.840]   2 Timothy 1, verse 9.
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:23.360]   His triumphant mercy is utterly free.
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:30.360]   Since Christ is the incarnate display of the wealth of the mercies of God, it is not surprising
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:37.460]   that his life on earth was a lavish exhibit of mercies to all kinds of people.
[00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:45.320]   Every kind of need and pain was touched by the mercies of Jesus in his few years on earth.
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:52.820]   When the blind beggar cried out, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me," many were embarrassed
[00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:54.680]   and indignant.
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:57.960]   But Jesus said to him, "Recover your sight.
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.000]   Your faith has made you well."
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.920]   Luke 18, verse 38.
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:03.980]   Verse 42.
[00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:11.700]   When the revolting and feared lepers raised their voices and said, "Jesus, Master, have
[00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:19.360]   mercy on us," he stopped and took pity on them and said, "Go, show yourselves to the
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.040]   priests."
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:24.800]   And as they went, they were cleansed.
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.920]   Luke 17, verses 13 and 14.
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:34.360]   Even more remarkably, Mark recalls the time another dreaded leper fell on his knees pleading
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:41.880]   with Jesus to make him clean, and Jesus not only spoke to him but also touched him, moved
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.200]   with pity.
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:51.040]   He stretched out his hand and touched him and said to him, "I will be clean."
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.200]   Mark 1, verse 41.
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:11:01.560]   When Jesus saw a widow who had not only lost her husband but now her only son as well,
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:08.600]   Luke tells us Jesus had compassion on her and said to her, "Do not weep."
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:12.800]   Then he raised her son from the dead.
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:17.720]   And in this case, not a word was said about her face.
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:26.500]   It was a free and lavish overflow of divine mercy even before faith.
[00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:31.520]   Mercy also drew Jesus to those who were made miserable by demons.
[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:35.980]   One man brought his demon-possessed son to Jesus after years of sorrow.
[00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:42.200]   The boy was unable to speak and the evil spirit often threw the boy into the fire.
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:46.760]   The father pleaded with Jesus, "Have compassion on us and help us."
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:48.840]   Mark 9, verse 22.
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:54.280]   And even though the grieving father could only manage a mustard seed of faith, "I believe,
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.880]   help my unbelief."
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.160]   Mark 9, verse 24.
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:05.600]   Jesus responded to the cry for pity and rebuked the spirit and cast it out.
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:11.520]   Even when a demon-possessed man had no one to be his advocate and could not believe or
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:17.880]   submit to Jesus, as in the case of the Gerasene demoniac, the Lord delivered him and then
[00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:22.120]   explained that it is sheer mercy.
[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:28.840]   Go home to your friends and tell them how much the Lord has done for you and how he
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:32.040]   has had mercy on you.
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:34.400]   Mark 5, verse 19.
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:41.080]   And don't miss the added mercy that this man was not a Jew but a foreigner, just like the
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:45.880]   Canaanite woman who cried out, "Have mercy on me, O Lord, son of David.
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:49.240]   My daughter is severely oppressed by a demon."
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.520]   Matthew 15, verse 22.
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:59.200]   Neither the demons nor the Gentile distance from Israel stopped the mercy of Jesus.
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:05.360]   Not only was the mercy of Jesus kindled by suffering but also by sin.
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:12.120]   When Jesus ate with tax collectors and sinners, the Pharisees and scribes criticized him.
[00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:16.480]   But Jesus told three parables to explain what he was doing.
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:18.880]   One was the parable of the prodigal son.
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:26.080]   The climax of this parable pictures God filled with compassion for his sin-soaked homecoming
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:27.640]   son.
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:33.660]   While the son was still a long way off, his father saw him and felt compassion and ran
[00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:35.880]   and embraced him and kissed him.
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:38.080]   Luke 15, verse 20.
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:44.680]   In other words, Jesus ate with tax collectors and sinners because he was the incarnate display
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:48.800]   of the Father's tender compassion for sinners.
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:54.480]   Jesus showed his compassion not only for the individuals who sin and suffer but also for
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:56.540]   whole multitudes.
[00:13:56.540 --> 00:14:02.680]   He did not look on masses with contempt or with impersonal indifference.
[00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:08.880]   Once when the great crowds had followed him and had not planned well for their food, Jesus
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:14.520]   looked on them and said, "I have compassion on the crowd, because they have been with
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:17.800]   me now three days and have nothing to eat."
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:19.640]   Mark 8, verse 2.
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:25.680]   On another occasion, it was not their hunger but their spiritual need for truth that filled
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:28.080]   him with compassion for the crowds.
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:34.280]   He saw a great crowd and he felt compassion on them because they were like sheep without
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:35.480]   a shepherd.
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:40.200]   And he began to teach them many things.
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:43.280]   Mark 6, verse 34.
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:48.680]   One of the most sweeping statements about God's mercy that Jesus ever made came from
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:51.040]   Hosea 6, verse 6.
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:56.520]   It was Jesus' way of putting the whole Old Testament ceremonial law under the banner
[00:14:56.520 --> 00:15:00.320]   of mercy instead of meticulous rules.
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:05.920]   When he was criticized for going to dinner at Matthew's house with unclean tax collectors,
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:11.160]   he turned the criticism around and said, "Go and learn what this means.
[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:14.880]   I desire mercy and not sacrifice."
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:16.680]   Hosea 6, verse 6.
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:21.040]   "For I came not to call the righteous but sinners."
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:23.960]   Matthew 9, verse 13.
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:28.960]   And when his disciples were rebuked by the Pharisees for picking grain and eating it
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:34.560]   on the Sabbath, Jesus said, "If you had known what this means, 'I desire mercy and not
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:38.920]   sacrifice,' you would not have condemned the guiltless."
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:40.920]   Matthew 12, verse 7.
[00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:49.040]   In other words, Jesus' entire ministry was shaped by the insight that mercy is the ultimate
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:51.340]   meaning of God's law.
[00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:57.960]   And since Jesus came not to abolish but to fulfill that law—Matthew 5, verse 17—he
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:04.440]   was the incarnation and manifestation of the wealth of the mercy of God.
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:06.560]   The same is true of Jesus today.
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:13.320]   In this regard, Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever—Hebrews 13, verse
[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:14.520]   8.
[00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:21.140]   This is why God, who is called the Father of Mercies—2 Corinthians 1, verse 3—beckons
[00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:29.020]   us to come boldly to his throne through Jesus Christ, who can sympathize with our weaknesses—Hebrews
[00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:30.980]   4, verse 15.
[00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:35.420]   Jesus is our sinless, all-sufficient High Priest.
[00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:42.860]   He has offered himself as our substitute in perfect obedience and perfect sacrifice.
[00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:49.820]   All the Father's mercies belong to those who come to God through faith in Jesus.
[00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:59.100]   Let us with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find
[00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:03.540]   grace to help in time of need—Hebrews 4, verse 16.
[00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:09.260]   The place where mercies are kept is the throne of God.
[00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:16.580]   There is infinite wealth and infinite power and infinite wisdom, and all this stands ready
[00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:24.180]   in the service of mercy because of Jesus Christ, the mercy of God incarnate.
[00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:30.700]   Whether you learn this through pleasure or learn it through pain, like Job, whatever
[00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:33.540]   you do, learn it.
[00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:36.740]   The Lord is compassionate and merciful.
[00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:39.300]   James 5, verse 11.
[00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:40.300]   A prayer.
[00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:45.500]   O Father, how we need mercy!
[00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.060]   We sin every day.
[00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:52.580]   We fall short of your command to love you with all our heart and soul and mind and strength.
[00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:54.900]   We are lukewarm in our affections.
[00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:58.300]   All our motives, even at their best, are mixed.
[00:17:58.300 --> 00:17:59.640]   We murmur.
[00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:01.640]   We are anxious about tomorrow.
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:04.140]   We get angry too quickly.
[00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:07.180]   We desire what ought not to be desired.
[00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:13.700]   We get irritated at the very attitudes in others that we ourselves displayed five minutes
[00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:15.740]   before.
[00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:19.780]   If you do not show mercy to us, we are undone.
[00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:27.940]   O God, let us see the mercy of Christ and savor it for what it is.
[00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:35.020]   Grant us power to comprehend his love. Incline us to read and ponder the stories of the mercy
[00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:37.320]   of Jesus in the Gospels.
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:41.860]   Let us so admire what he did that we imitate him.
[00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:46.460]   But let it be much more than external imitation.
[00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:51.740]   Let it come from the heart where we have been broken for our sin and where we have come
[00:18:51.740 --> 00:19:00.180]   to cherish mercy and live by mercy and hope in mercy and long for mercy.
[00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:05.180]   Make the mercy of Jesus the greatest beauty of the Savior in our eyes.
[00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:13.780]   Let us behold and beholding become like him and bend this taste for mercy outward so that
[00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:15.440]   we show it.
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:19.580]   Make us full of his mercy that we might show mercy.
[00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:23.780]   Feel in us the command to do justice and love mercy.
[00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:27.460]   Let us love showing mercy.
[00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:32.460]   Make it so much a part of us that it is who we are.
[00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:40.980]   So unite us to Christ that his mercy is our mercy and our mercy is a presenting of Christ.
[00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:45.340]   He is all we have to give in the end.
[00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:51.540]   Identify his mercy, Father, in our faith and in our patience.
[00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:52.540]   Thank you.
[00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:58.160]   Oh, thank you for Christ and for your mercy to us in him.
[00:19:58.160 --> 00:19:59.900]   In his name we pray.
[00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:00.900]   Amen.
[00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:02.740]   Yes, amen.
[00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:06.620]   Make the mercy of Jesus the greatest beauty of the Savior in our eyes.
[00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:08.380]   That's such a good prayer.
[00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:12.380]   That was a reading from chapter 10 of Pastor John's book, Seeing and Savoring Jesus Christ.
[00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:18.760]   Thank you for listening and on behalf of the team at Desiring God and Pastor John and myself,
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:23.100]   we pray that you have a wonderful Christmas celebration with your local church, with your
[00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:24.780]   family and with friends.
[00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:25.980]   We'll see you on Friday.
[00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:26.980]   Amen.
[00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:26.980]   Amen.
[00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:31.980]   Amen.
[00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:41.980]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
