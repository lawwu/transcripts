[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.800]   All right, let's do a new feature case study listener case study. I appreciate these this comes from Diane
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.680]   She says
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.680]   This is not a new question
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.400]   Just a follow-up on a question I sent
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.080]   before
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.000]   my question at the time
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.920]   Was about the fact that i'm a writer who works at home and seem to be able
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.640]   Uh to consistently do whatever I wanted first thing in the morning, but then having trouble
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:34.160]   Ever moving on to the second thing I want to do due to the distractions of being at home while I worked well update
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:41.440]   Since then I think i've solved the problem by renting a small office near my home
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:49.280]   Now i'm exercising first thing and then I go into the office just like a normal pre-covid working person and get my writing done
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.760]   So it's up to you whether you choose to use my question or not
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.000]   But I feel like i've solved it myself and I feel good about that. So thank you for all your work
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.560]   Great case study diane
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:05.680]   Work from near home w f n h. I think it's a very important trend. I've written about this in the new yorker
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.720]   Diane is a exemplar. There are lots of things we freely spend money on
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:17.440]   Without even really thinking about it, but for some reason we have this resistance about I don't want to spend money
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.320]   On a workspace if i'm a remote worker
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.840]   If I don't have to go to an office
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.160]   I don't want to spend money on a workspace near my home because technically
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.040]   You don't need it
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.040]   You have a home office sure
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.720]   But the difference in experience about having a place to go versus not is worth quite a bit
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.640]   So let's say there's a quick thought example building on this case study
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.440]   let's say
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.440]   You had a traditional office job
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.360]   You live in a relatively expensive place. You live in suburban, washington dc
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.100]   All right. So in this thought experiment you live in kensington
[00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.040]   Relatively expensive house. All right
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.920]   You go permanently remote
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.280]   So you have a home office and your house in kensington
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.960]   But your dogs are there and and your kids come home from school and whatever right like it's it's distracting
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.700]   Your laundry is there the tv is always playing and you find yourself really distracted
[00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.040]   If you could have a office to go to near your house
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.840]   Your productivity happiness sustainability of your work might be much better. Now, let's say you're spending all your money kensington's expensive
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.000]   Well now that you're really remote
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.080]   You move out of kensington
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.320]   You move for whatever reason you've always had this dream of having land. So
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.120]   you move to
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.360]   a farm in westminster
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.960]   My local listeners know who i'm talking about here, this is actually a real person we know who's doing this
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.440]   And you have some land and a barn and and and you know, it's cheaper to live there
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.200]   and
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.360]   Then you can you go and rent a little bit of office space in the the nearby downtown
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.840]   And it's still cheaper than where you live before you kind of live in this cool place and you have this land and it's cheaper
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.960]   To live so you can spend some of that money you save into an office
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.960]   That's what you should do because you know what if you go to that office to work that works going to be much more effective
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.880]   You'll have much clearer separation between work and home. What a great investment in your money
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.440]   So what i'm trying to say here is what diane did is great
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.080]   If it is all possible to find a way to invest money in a dedicated working space
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.400]   That's not your house, but convenient to your house
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.960]   Do it
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.120]   And I think maybe we should see more of this
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.040]   If i'm remote
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.040]   I'm gonna move somewhere cheaper
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.620]   Reclaim 50 of that savings invested in a place to work
[00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:41.620]   [MUSIC]
