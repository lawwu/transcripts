[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440]   The universe doesn't care about your personal narrative.
[00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.240]   You can just have met the person
[00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.400]   that is going to be the love of your life.
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.960]   It's the culmination of your whole project for happiness,
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.320]   and you step into the street,
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.160]   and a truck hits you, and you die.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.380]   That's mortality.
[00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.720]   Mortality isn't just some far-flung event.
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.720]   It's that every moment we are subject to fate in that way.
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.880]   So you can think of lots of little deaths you experience
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.680]   whenever all the projects and the plans you make
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.280]   come up against the fact
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.380]   that the universe can just roll over them.
[00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.280]   - The following is a conversation with John Rovake,
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.360]   a psychologist and cognitive scientist
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.160]   at the University of Toronto.
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.800]   I highly recommend his lecture series
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.760]   called "Awakening from the Meaning Crisis,"
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.520]   which covers the history and future
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.840]   of humanity's search for meaning.
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.720]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:03.560]   To support it,
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.240]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.520]   And now, dear friends, here's John Rovake.
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.840]   You have an excellent 50-part lecture series online
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.960]   on the meaning crisis,
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.120]   and I think you describe in the modern times
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.180]   an increase in depression, loneliness, cynicism,
[00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.640]   and, wait for it, bullshit.
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.480]   The term used technically by Harry Frankfurt
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.720]   and adopted by you.
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.840]   So let me ask, what is meaning?
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.440]   What are we looking for
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.220]   when we engage in the search for meaning?
[00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.200]   - So when I'm talking about meaning,
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.620]   I'm talking about what's called meaning in life,
[00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.120]   not the meaning of life.
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.440]   That's some sort of metaphysical claim.
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.500]   Meaning in life are those factors
[00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.520]   that make people rate their lives as more meaningful,
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.920]   worth living, worth the suffering that they have to endure.
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.760]   And when you study that,
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.040]   what you see is it's a sense of connectedness,
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.240]   connectedness to yourself, to other people, to the world,
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.920]   and a particular kind of connectedness.
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.980]   You wanna be connected to things that have a value
[00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.520]   and an existence independent of your egocentric
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.160]   sort of preferences and concerns.
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.080]   This is why, for example,
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.960]   having a child is considered very meaningful
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.360]   because you're connecting to something
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.040]   that's gonna have a life and a value independent of you.
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.560]   Now, the question that comes up for me,
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.400]   well, there's two questions.
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.560]   One is, why is that at risk right now?
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.840]   And then secondly,
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.100]   and I think you have to answer the second question first,
[00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.080]   which is, well, yeah, but why is meaning so important?
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.360]   Why is this sense of connectedness
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.620]   so important to human beings?
[00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.520]   Why, when it is lacking,
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.080]   do they typically fall into depression,
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.280]   potentially mental illness, addiction,
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.080]   self-destructive behavior?
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.720]   And so the first answer I give you is, well,
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.440]   it's that sense of connectedness.
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.200]   And people often express it metaphorically.
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.680]   They wanna be connected to something
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.800]   larger than themselves.
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.120]   They wanna matter.
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.640]   I don't mean it literally.
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.160]   I mean, if I chained you to a mountain,
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.360]   you wouldn't thereby say,
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.040]   oh, now my life is so fulfilling, right?
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.360]   So what they're trying to convey,
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.600]   they're using this metaphor to try and say,
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.260]   they wanna be connected.
[00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.080]   They wanna be connected to something real.
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.200]   They wanna make a difference and matter to it.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.640]   And one way of asking them, well, you know,
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.600]   what's meaningful is, tell me what you would like
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.520]   to continue to exist even if you weren't around anymore.
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.960]   And how are you connected to it
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.360]   and how do you matter to it?
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.120]   - That's one way of trying to get at
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.000]   what is the source of meaning for you,
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.220]   is if you were no longer there,
[00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.960]   you would like it to continue existing.
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.240]   That's not the only part of the definition probably
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.520]   because there's probably many things
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.440]   that aren't a source of meaning for me
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.240]   that maybe I find beautiful
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.200]   that I would like to continue existing.
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.040]   - Yes.
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.680]   If it contributes to your life being meaningful,
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.400]   you are connected to it in some way
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.400]   and it matters to you and you matter to it
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.840]   in that you make some difference to it.
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.400]   That's when it goes from being just sort of
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.920]   true, good and beautiful to being a source
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.080]   of meaning for you in your life.
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.400]   - Is the meaning crisis a new thing
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.400]   or has it always been with us?
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.120]   Is it part of the human condition in general?
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.600]   - That's an excellent question.
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.080]   And part of the argument I made in Awakening
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.600]   for the Meaning Crisis is there's two aspects to it.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.800]   One is that there are perennial problems,
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.720]   perennial threats to meaning.
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.080]   And in that sense, human beings
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.760]   are always vulnerable to despair.
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.760]   You know, the book of Ecclesiastes is,
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.720]   it's all vanity, it's all meaningless.
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.040]   But there's also historical forces
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.880]   that have made those perennial problems
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.600]   more pertinent, more pressing,
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.860]   more difficult for people to deal with.
[00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.480]   And so the meaning crisis is actually
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.880]   the intersection of perennial problems,
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.680]   finding existence absurd,
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.240]   experiencing existential anxiety, feeling alienated.
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.680]   And then pressing historical factors,
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.280]   which have to do with the loss of the resources
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.680]   that human beings have typically,
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.640]   cross-historically and cross-culturally made use of
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.880]   in order to address these perennial problems.
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.360]   - Is there something potentially deeper
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.840]   than just a lack of meaning
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.840]   that speaks to the fact that we're vulnerable to despair?
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.200]   You know, Ernest Becker talked about the,
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.400]   in his book, "The Null of Death,"
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.000]   about the fear of death being an important motivator
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.440]   in our life.
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.640]   As William James said,
[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.840]   "Death is the worm at the core of the human condition."
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.880]   Is it possible that this kind of search for meaning
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:07.120]   is coupled, or can be seen from the perspective
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.560]   of trying to escape the reality,
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.100]   the thought of one's own mortality?
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.480]   - Yeah, Becker and the terror management theory
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.040]   that have come out of it.
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.120]   There's been some good work
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.200]   around sort of providing empirical support for that claim.
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.120]   Some of the work, not so good.
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.320]   - So which aspects do you find convincing?
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.880]   Can you steel man that case,
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.040]   and then can you argue against it?
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:39.640]   - So what aspects I find convincing is that human,
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.600]   being human finitude, being finite,
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.980]   being inherently limited is very problematic for us.
[00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:51.960]   - Given the extensive use of the word problematic,
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.080]   I like that you used that word
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.320]   to describe one's own mortality as problematic.
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.080]   'Cause people sort of on Twitter use the word problematic
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.800]   when they disagree with somebody.
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.440]   But this, to me, seems to be the ultimate problematic aspect
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.520]   of the human condition is that we die, and it ends.
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.080]   - I think, I'm not disagreeing with you,
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.400]   but I'm trying to get you to consider
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.840]   that your mortality is not an event in the future,
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.540]   it's a state you're in right now.
[00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:22.260]   That's what I'm trying to shift.
[00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:26.160]   So your mortality is just a,
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:30.080]   we talk about something that causes mortality fatal.
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:30.920]   - Yes.
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.600]   - But what we actually mean is it's full of fate.
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.600]   And I don't mean in the sense of things are pre-written.
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:40.840]   What I mean is the sense of the universe
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:44.440]   doesn't care about your personal narrative.
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.240]   You can just have met the person
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.400]   that is going to be the love of your life.
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:53.960]   It's the culmination of your whole project for happiness,
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:55.320]   and you step into the street,
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.160]   and a truck hits you, and you die.
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.380]   That's mortality.
[00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:02.720]   Mortality isn't just some far-flung event.
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:07.720]   It's that every moment we are subject to fate in that way.
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:13.880]   So you can think of lots of little deaths you experience
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:17.680]   whenever all the projects and the plans you make
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.280]   come up against the fact
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.320]   that the universe can just roll over them.
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:25.840]   - So death is the indifference of nature,
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.800]   of the universe to your existence.
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:32.040]   And so in that sense, it is always here with us.
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:34.460]   - Yeah, but you're vulnerable in so many ways
[00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:37.260]   other than just the ending of your biological life.
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.960]   'Cause it's interesting, if you rate what people fear most,
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.600]   death is not number one.
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:47.160]   They often put public speaking as number one,
[00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:51.400]   because the death of status or reputation
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:54.160]   can also be a profound loss for human beings.
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.360]   You can drive them into despair.
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:59.000]   - So as the terror management folks would say,
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.360]   as Ernest Becker would say,
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:03.560]   that a self-report on a survey
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.080]   is not an accurate way to capture
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.360]   what is actually at the core of the motivation
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.360]   of a human being.
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:09.200]   - Sure.
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.680]   - That we could be terrified of death.
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:14.320]   And we've, from childhood, since we realized
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:18.540]   the absurdity of the fact that the ride ends,
[00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:22.480]   we've learned to really try to forget about it,
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:26.600]   try to construct illusions that allow us
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:30.000]   to escape momentarily or for prolonged periods of time
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.080]   the realization that we die.
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.840]   - Okay, so first, I took it seriously.
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.920]   But now I wanna say why there's some empirical work
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.760]   that makes me wanna reconsider it.
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:42.760]   So terror management theory is you do things like
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.800]   you give people a list of words to read,
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:49.520]   and in those list are words associated with death,
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:50.960]   cough and funeral.
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:52.640]   And then you see what happens to people,
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.080]   and generally they start to become more rigid
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:55.920]   in their thinking.
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.920]   They tend to identify with their worldview.
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:00.560]   They lose cognitive flexibility.
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.960]   That's if you present it to them
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.880]   in that third-person perspective.
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:08.280]   But if you get them to go in the first-person perspective
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:11.120]   and imagine that they're dying,
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.840]   and that the people that they care about
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:17.740]   are there with them, they don't show those responses.
[00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:21.600]   In fact, they show us an increase in cognitive flexibility,
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.200]   an increase in openness.
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.880]   See, so I'm trying to say we might be putting
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:27.120]   the cart before the horse.
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.040]   It might not be death per se,
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.880]   but the kind of meaning that is present
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:34.640]   or absent in death that is the crucial thing for us.
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:35.760]   - By the way, to push back,
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.400]   I don't think you took it seriously.
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:40.840]   I don't think you truly steel-manned the case,
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:42.840]   because you're saying that death
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.720]   is always present with us, yes,
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.800]   but isn't there a case to be made
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.360]   that it is one of the major motivators?
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.640]   Nietzsche, will to power,
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:54.340]   Freud wanting to have sex with your mother,
[00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:55.800]   all the different explanations
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:58.620]   of what is truly motivating us human beings.
[00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:00.320]   Isn't there a strong case to be made
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:05.220]   that this death thing is a really damn good,
[00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:11.440]   if not anything, a tool to motivate the behavior of humans?
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:15.000]   - I'm not saying that the avoidance of death
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.280]   is not significant for human beings,
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:21.640]   but I'm proposing to you that human beings
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:25.360]   have a capacity for considering certain deaths meaningful
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:27.400]   and certain deaths meaningless,
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.600]   and we have lots of evidence
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:32.040]   that people are willing to sacrifice
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.880]   their biological existence
[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:36.160]   for a death they consider meaningful.
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.520]   - Are you personally afraid of your death,
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:39.880]   do you think about it?
[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:44.120]   As somebody who produces a lot of ideas,
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.880]   records them, writes them down,
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.560]   is a deep thinker, admired thinker,
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:52.760]   and as the years go on, become more and more admired,
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:56.800]   does it scare you that the ride ends?
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.640]   - No, I mean, you have to talk to me on all my levels.
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.160]   I'm a biological organism,
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.720]   so if something's thrown at my head,
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:06.080]   I'll duck and things like that.
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:11.080]   But if you're asking me, do I long to live forever?
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:14.380]   No, in the Buddhist tradition,
[00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:16.480]   there are practices that are designed
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:19.480]   to make you aware of simultaneously
[00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:22.780]   the horror of mortality and the horror of immortality.
[00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:27.600]   The thought of living forever is actually horrific to me.
[00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.780]   - Are those the only two options?
[00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:32.440]   (laughing)
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:36.160]   Like when you're sitting with a loved one
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.840]   or watching a movie you just really love
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:43.360]   or a book you really love, you don't want it to end,
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:47.280]   you don't necessarily always flip it to the other aspect,
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:49.560]   the complete opposite of the thought experiment.
[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:52.640]   What happens if the book lasts forever?
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.880]   There's gotta be a middle ground, like the snooze button.
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:56.200]   Sure, you don't wanna sleep forever,
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.280]   but maybe press the snooze button
[00:12:58.280 --> 00:12:59.840]   and get an extra 15 minutes.
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:03.320]   There's surely some kind of balance.
[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:08.320]   That fear seems to be a source
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:12.520]   of an intense appreciation of the moment, in part.
[00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:14.520]   I mean, that's what the Stoics talked about,
[00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:17.520]   to meditate on one's mortality.
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.320]   It seems to be a nice wake-up call
[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:24.320]   to that life is full of moments
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.400]   that are beautiful and then you don't get
[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:29.240]   an infinite number of them.
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:32.200]   - Right, and the Stoic response was not the project
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:35.500]   of trying to extend the duration of your life,
[00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:39.520]   but to deepen those moments so they become
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:44.280]   as satisfying as possible so that when death comes,
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.680]   it does not strike you as any kind of calamity.
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:48.200]   - Does that project ring true
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:49.820]   for your own personal feelings?
[00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:51.800]   - I think so.
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.720]   - Do you think about your mortality?
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:56.020]   - I used to, I don't so much anymore.
[00:13:56.020 --> 00:14:03.720]   Part of it, as I'm older, and your temporal horizon flips
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:05.340]   somewhere in your 30s or 40s,
[00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:09.000]   you don't live from your birth, you live towards your death.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.520]   - That's such a beautiful phrase,
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:13.000]   the temporal horizon flips.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   That's so true, that's so true.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.320]   At what point is that?
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:23.640]   The point before which the world of opportunity
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:25.720]   and possibility is infinite before you.
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:27.280]   - Yeah, it's like Peter Pan.
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:29.400]   There's all these golden possibilities
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:33.080]   and you fly around between them, yes, very much.
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:35.640]   And then when it flips, you start to look
[00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:40.640]   for a different model, the Socratic, the Stoic model.
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:44.520]   Buddhism has also influenced me, which is more about,
[00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:47.300]   wait, when I look at my desires,
[00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:50.620]   I seem to have two meta-desires.
[00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:53.700]   In addition to satisfying a particular desire,
[00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:57.620]   I want whatever satisfies my desire to be real.
[00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:59.920]   And whatever is satisfying my desire
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:03.120]   to not cause internal conflict,
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:05.420]   but bring something like peace of mind.
[00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:08.620]   And so I'm more and more moved towards,
[00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:12.060]   how can I live such that those two meta-desires
[00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:15.900]   are a constant frame within which I'm trying
[00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:17.920]   to satisfy my specific desires?
[00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:22.140]   - What do you think happens after we die?
[00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:27.140]   - I think mind and life go away completely when we die.
[00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:33.500]   And I think that's actually significantly important
[00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:36.260]   for the kind of beings that we are.
[00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:41.320]   We are the kinds of beings that can come to that awareness
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:45.100]   and then we have a responsibility to decide
[00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:47.340]   how we're gonna comport ourselves towards it.
[00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:51.420]   - Can you linger on what that means, the mind goes away?
[00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:55.940]   - Like when you're playing music
[00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:58.980]   and the last instrument is put down, the song is over.
[00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:02.140]   Doesn't mean the song wasn't beautiful.
[00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:04.320]   Doesn't mean the song wasn't complex.
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:07.800]   Doesn't mean the song didn't add to the value
[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:11.020]   of the universe and its existence, but it came to an end.
[00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:15.340]   - Is there some aspect in which some part of mind
[00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:19.780]   was there before the human and remains after?
[00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:23.620]   Something like panpsychism, or is it too much for us
[00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:26.100]   limited cognitive beings to understand?
[00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:29.580]   - Something like panpsychism, I take it seriously.
[00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:31.220]   I don't think it's a ridiculous proposal,
[00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:35.140]   but I think it has insoluble problems that make me doubt it.
[00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:40.180]   Any idea that the mind is some kind of ultimately
[00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:43.260]   immaterial substance also has, for me,
[00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:46.460]   just devastating problems.
[00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:48.420]   Those are the two kinds of framework
[00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:52.060]   that people usually propose in order to support
[00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:53.920]   some kind of idea of immortality.
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:56.320]   I find both very problematic.
[00:16:56.320 --> 00:17:00.800]   The fact that we participate in distributed cognition,
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:03.500]   that most of our problem solving is not done as individuals,
[00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:05.900]   but in groups, this is something I work on.
[00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.340]   I've published on that, I think that's important.
[00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:13.700]   But most of the people who do work on systems
[00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:15.780]   of distributed cognition think that while there's
[00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:18.380]   such a thing as collective intelligence,
[00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:19.900]   there's no good evidence that there's
[00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:21.380]   collective consciousness.
[00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:24.980]   In fact, it's often called zombie agency for that reason.
[00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:29.860]   And so, while I think it's very clear that no one person
[00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:32.940]   runs an airline, and there's a collective intelligence
[00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:35.140]   that solves that problem, I do not think that collective
[00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:38.760]   intelligence supports any kind of consciousness.
[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:42.500]   And so, therefore, I don't think the fact that I participate,
[00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:46.080]   which I regularly and reliably do in distributed cognition,
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:49.380]   gives me any reason to believe that that participation
[00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:51.140]   grounds some kind of consciousness.
[00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:54.480]   - Okay, there's so many things to mention there.
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.720]   First of all, distributed cognition,
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:59.760]   maybe that's a synonym for collective intelligence.
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:03.780]   So that means a bunch of humans individually
[00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:07.120]   are able to think, have cognitive machines,
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:11.560]   and are somehow able to interact in a process of dialogue,
[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:16.560]   as you talk about, to morph different ideas together,
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:20.180]   like this idea landscape together.
[00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:22.540]   It's so interesting to think about, okay,
[00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:26.500]   well, you do have these fascinating
[00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:29.180]   distributed cognition systems,
[00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:33.100]   but consciousness does not propagate
[00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:34.920]   in the same way as intelligence.
[00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:40.040]   But isn't there a case, if you just look at intelligence,
[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:42.460]   if we look at us humans as a collection
[00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:44.920]   of smaller organisms, which we are,
[00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:50.680]   and so there's like a hierarchy of organisms,
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:55.640]   tiny ones work together to form tiny villages
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:58.120]   that you can then start to see as individual organisms
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:02.160]   that are then also forming bigger villages
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.800]   and interacting different ways,
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.900]   and function becomes more and more complex,
[00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:08.260]   and eventually we get to us humans,
[00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:10.300]   to where we start to think, well, we're an individual,
[00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:11.520]   but really we're not.
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:14.820]   There's billions of organisms inside us,
[00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:16.960]   both domestic and foreign.
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:18.460]   (laughing)
[00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:23.460]   So isn't that building up consciousnesses,
[00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:27.700]   like turtles, all the way up to our consciousness?
[00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:29.580]   Why does it have to stop with us humans?
[00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:32.900]   Are we the only, like is this the phase transition
[00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:37.900]   when it becomes a zombie-like, giant, hierarchical village
[00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:43.780]   that first, like, ah, there's like a singing angels,
[00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:47.460]   and it's consciousness is born in just us humans?
[00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:49.380]   Do bacteria have consciousness?
[00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:51.960]   Not bacteria, but maybe you could say bacteria does,
[00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:54.960]   but like the interesting, complicated organisms
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.480]   that are within us have consciousness.
[00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:01.100]   - I think it's proper to argue, and I have,
[00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:03.820]   that like a paramecium, or bacteria,
[00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:08.420]   has a kind of agency, and even a kind of intelligence,
[00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:10.140]   kind of sense-making ability,
[00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:14.100]   but I do not think that we can attribute consciousness,
[00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:15.740]   at least what we mean by consciousness,
[00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:19.940]   this kind of self-awareness, this ability to introspect,
[00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:23.980]   et cetera, et cetera, to bacteria.
[00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:26.640]   Now, the reason why distributed cognition
[00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:28.140]   doesn't have consciousness,
[00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:29.940]   I think is a little bit more tricky.
[00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:35.140]   And I think there's no reason in principle
[00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:38.060]   why there couldn't be a consciousness
[00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:42.460]   for distributed cognition, collective intelligence.
[00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:45.540]   In fact, many philosophers would agree with me
[00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:46.360]   on that point.
[00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:51.360]   I think it's more an issue of certain empirical facts,
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:54.660]   bandwidth, density of connections,
[00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:57.300]   speed of information transfer, et cetera.
[00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:00.740]   It's conceivable that if we got
[00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:03.340]   some horrible Frankensteinian neural link,
[00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:07.140]   and we linked our brains, and we had the right density,
[00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:10.060]   and dynamics, and bandwidth, and speed,
[00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:12.620]   that a group consciousness could take shape.
[00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:15.100]   I don't have any argument in principle against that.
[00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:19.140]   I'm just saying those contingent facts do not yet exist,
[00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:22.280]   and therefore, it is implausible that consciousness exists
[00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:24.660]   at the level of collective intelligence.
[00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:26.500]   - So you talk about consciousness quite a bit,
[00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:30.800]   so let's step back and try to sneak up to a definition.
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:33.380]   What is consciousness?
[00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:38.380]   - For me, there are two aspects to answering that question.
[00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:40.860]   One is, what's the nature of consciousness?
[00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:43.060]   How does something like consciousness exist
[00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:46.340]   in an otherwise apparently non-conscious universe?
[00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:47.660]   And then there's a function question,
[00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:49.020]   which is equally important,
[00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:50.860]   which is, what does consciousness do?
[00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:56.300]   The first one is obviously problematic for most people.
[00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:58.980]   Like, yeah, consciousness seems to be so different
[00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:01.920]   from the rest of the non-conscious universe.
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:03.620]   But I put it to you that the function question
[00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:08.620]   is also very hard, because you are clearly capable
[00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:13.180]   of very sophisticated, intelligent behavior
[00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:15.180]   without consciousness.
[00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:18.620]   You are turning the noises coming out of my face hole
[00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:23.020]   into ideas in your mind, and you have no conscious awareness
[00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:24.760]   of how that process is occurring.
[00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:30.000]   So why do we have consciousness at all?
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.760]   Now, here's the thing.
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:34.060]   There's an extra question you need to ask.
[00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:37.480]   Should we attempt to answer those questions separately,
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:39.000]   or should we attempt to answer them
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.360]   in an integrated fashion?
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:44.440]   I make the case that you actually have to answer them
[00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:45.760]   in an integrated fashion.
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:50.520]   What consciousness does and what it is.
[00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:52.480]   We should be able to give a unified answer
[00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:53.640]   to both of those.
[00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:57.840]   Can you try to elucidate the difference
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:01.800]   between what consciousness is and what it does,
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:05.680]   both of which are mysteries, as you say?
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:08.320]   State versus action.
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:11.160]   Can you try to explain the difference that's interesting,
[00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:14.120]   that's useful, that's important to understand?
[00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:16.000]   - So that's putting me in a bit of a difficult position,
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.100]   because I actually argue that trying to answer them
[00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:21.520]   separately is ultimately incoherent.
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:26.760]   But what I can point to are many published articles
[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:29.720]   in which only one of these problems is addressed
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:31.280]   and the other is left unaddressed.
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:34.240]   So people will try and explain what qualia are,
[00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:35.500]   how they potentially emerge,
[00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:37.880]   without saying what do they do,
[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:40.160]   what problems do they help to solve,
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:42.600]   how do they make the organism more adaptive.
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.200]   And then you'll have other people who'll say,
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.760]   oh no, this is what the function of consciousness is,
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:50.320]   but I can't tell you, I can't solve the hard problem.
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:52.360]   I don't know how qualia exist.
[00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:54.880]   So what I'm saying is many people
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:56.800]   treat these problems separately,
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:59.940]   although I think that's ultimately an incoherent way
[00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:01.160]   to approach the problem.
[00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:05.360]   - So the hard problem is focusing on what it is.
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:06.200]   - Yes.
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:09.120]   - So the qualia, it feels like something
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:11.360]   to experience a thing, that's what consciousness is.
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:14.720]   And does is more about the functional usefulness
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:15.540]   of the thing.
[00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:16.380]   - Yes, yes.
[00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:20.040]   - To the whole beautiful mix of cognition
[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:23.680]   and just function in everyday life.
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:28.680]   Okay, you've also said that you can do
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:33.960]   very intelligent things without consciousness.
[00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:35.720]   - Yes, clearly.
[00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:37.040]   - Is that obvious to you?
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:37.880]   - Yes.
[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:42.320]   I don't know what I'm doing to access my memory.
[00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:44.200]   It just comes up.
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:47.440]   And it comes up really intelligently.
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:52.960]   - But the mechanisms that create consciousness
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:56.720]   could be deeply interlinked with whatever is doing
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:00.080]   the memory access, is doing the--
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:02.720]   - Oh, I think so, in fact, yes.
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:04.960]   - So I guess what I'm trying to say in this,
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:09.600]   we'll probably sneak up to this question a few times,
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:13.500]   which is whether we can build machines that are conscious.
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:19.120]   Or machines that are intelligent, human level intelligent
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:22.160]   or beyond without building the consciousness.
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:23.560]   I mean, ultimately, that's one of the ways
[00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:25.840]   to understand what consciousness is,
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:28.220]   is to build the thing.
[00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:31.540]   We can either sort of from the Chomsky way,
[00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:34.400]   try to construct models, like he thinks about language
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:36.440]   in this way, try to construct models and theories
[00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:39.920]   of how the thing works, or we can just build the damn thing.
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:43.880]   - Exactly, and that's a methodological principle
[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:45.680]   in cognitive science.
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:48.760]   In fact, one of the things that sort of distinguishes
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:52.480]   cognitive science from other disciplines
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:56.000]   dealing with the nature of cognition in the mind
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.480]   is that cognitive science takes the design stance.
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:03.040]   It asks, well, could we build a machine
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:05.680]   that would not only simulate it,
[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:08.960]   but serve as a bona fide explanation of the phenomena?
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:13.000]   - Do you find any efforts in cognitive science
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.320]   compelling in this direction?
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:17.120]   In terms of how far we are,
[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:21.260]   there's on the computational side of things,
[00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:22.840]   something called cognitive modeling.
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:24.300]   There's all these kinds of packages
[00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:27.040]   that you can construct simplified models
[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:28.060]   of how the brain does things
[00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:31.620]   and see if complex behaviors emerge.
[00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:34.400]   Do you find any efforts in cognitive,
[00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:36.480]   or what efforts in cognitive science
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:41.320]   do you find most inspiring and productive?
[00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:44.920]   - I think the project of trying to create AGI,
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:46.840]   artificial general intelligence,
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:50.840]   is where I place my hope of artificial intelligence
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:53.280]   being of scientific significance.
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:55.880]   This is independent of technological,
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:57.400]   socioeconomic significance,
[00:26:57.400 --> 00:27:00.760]   which is already well established.
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:04.780]   But being able to say because of the work in AI,
[00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:09.060]   we now have a good theory of cognition, intelligence,
[00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:10.480]   perhaps consciousness,
[00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:13.160]   I think that's where I place my bets,
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:14.600]   is in the current endeavors
[00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:17.160]   around artificial general intelligence.
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:21.280]   And so tackling that problem head on,
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:24.340]   which has now become central,
[00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:26.760]   at least to a group of cognitive scientists,
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:28.620]   is I think what needs to be done.
[00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:33.400]   - And when you think about AGI,
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:36.920]   do you think about systems that have consciousness?
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:40.760]   - Let's go back to what I think is at the core
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:42.720]   of your general intelligence.
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:47.440]   So right now, compared to even our best machines,
[00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:49.360]   you are a general problem solver.
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:51.080]   You can solve a wide variety of problems
[00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:53.080]   in a wide variety of domains.
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:54.720]   And some of our best machines
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:56.160]   have a little bit of transfer.
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:58.340]   They can learn this game and play a few other
[00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:00.560]   well-designed rule-bound games,
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:02.360]   but they couldn't learn how to swim,
[00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:05.340]   et cetera, things like that.
[00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:10.340]   And so what's interesting is what seems to come up,
[00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:12.640]   and this is some of my published work,
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:15.240]   in all these different domains of cognition,
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:19.640]   across all these different problem types,
[00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:22.000]   is a central problem.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.600]   And since we do have good sort of psychometric evidence
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:26.400]   that we do have some general ability
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:29.960]   that's a significant component of our intelligence,
[00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:31.920]   I made an argument as to what I think
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:34.080]   that general ability is.
[00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:38.840]   And so it's happening right now.
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:41.420]   The amount of information in this room
[00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:43.080]   that you could actually pay attention to
[00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:44.620]   is combinatorially explosive.
[00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:48.220]   The amount of information you have in your memory,
[00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:51.060]   long-term memory, and all the ways you could combine it,
[00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:54.140]   combinatorially explosive.
[00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:56.160]   The number of possibilities you can consider,
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:57.980]   also combinatorially explosive.
[00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:00.300]   The sequences of behavior you can generate,
[00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:02.940]   also combinatorially explosive.
[00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:06.680]   And yet somehow, you're zeroing in.
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:07.940]   The right memories are coming up,
[00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:09.600]   the right possibilities are opening up,
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:11.000]   the right sequences of behavior,
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.720]   you're paying attention to the right thing.
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:16.840]   Not infallibly so, but so much so
[00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:20.920]   that you reliably find obvious what you should interact with
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:23.040]   in order to solve the problem at hand.
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:28.040]   That's an ability that is still not well understood
[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:30.640]   within AGI.
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:35.640]   So filtering out the gigantic waterfall of data.
[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:37.620]   - Right, it's almost like a Zen koan.
[00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:40.020]   What makes you intelligent
[00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:44.500]   is your ability to ignore so much information
[00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:46.300]   and do it in such a way
[00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:49.540]   that it's somewhere between arbitrary guessing
[00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:51.240]   and algorithmic search.
[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:54.800]   - And to a fault sometimes, of course,
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:58.520]   that you, based on the models you construct,
[00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:01.460]   you forget, you ignore things
[00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:03.420]   that you should probably not ignore.
[00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:06.400]   - And that, hopefully we can circle back to it, Lex,
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:09.900]   is related to the meaning issue.
[00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:11.900]   Because the very processes
[00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:14.580]   that make us adaptively intelligent
[00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:18.100]   make us perennially susceptible to self-deceptive,
[00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:19.700]   self-destructive behavior
[00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:22.820]   because of the way we misframe the environment
[00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:24.860]   in fundamental ways.
[00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:29.400]   - So to you, meaning is also
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:36.440]   connected to ideas of wisdom and truth
[00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:39.520]   and how we interpret and understand
[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:42.020]   and interact intellectually with the environment.
[00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:42.860]   - Yes.
[00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:45.000]   - So what is wisdom?
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.760]   Why do we long for it?
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:48.840]   How do we and where do we find it?
[00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:49.680]   What is it?
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:52.000]   - Intelligence is what you use to solve your problems,
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.300]   as I was just describing.
[00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:58.460]   Rationality is how you use your intelligence
[00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:01.920]   to overcome the problems of self-deception
[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:04.200]   that emerge when you're trying to solve your problems.
[00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:06.320]   So it's that matter problem.
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:08.120]   And then the issue is,
[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:12.080]   do you have just one kind of knowing?
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:14.600]   I think you have multiple ways of knowing
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:17.160]   and therefore you have multiple rationalities.
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:21.240]   And so wisdom is to coordinate those rationalities
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:23.420]   so that they are optimally constraining
[00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:25.380]   and affording each other.
[00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:27.860]   So in that way, wisdom is rationally
[00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:29.760]   self-transcending rationality.
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:34.240]   - Right, so life is a kind of process
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:38.500]   where you jump from rationality to rationality
[00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:42.160]   and pick up a village of rationalities along the way
[00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:44.420]   that then turns into wisdom.
[00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:46.260]   - Yes, if properly coordinated.
[00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:47.660]   - You mentioned framing.
[00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:48.580]   - Yes.
[00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:52.640]   - So what is framing?
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:55.040]   Is it a set of assumptions you bring to the table
[00:31:55.040 --> 00:32:00.040]   in how you see the world, how you reason about the world?
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:03.560]   Yeah, how you understand the world?
[00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:06.240]   - So it depends what you mean by assumptions.
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:08.520]   If by assumption you mean a proposition,
[00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:10.320]   representational or rule,
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:12.960]   I think that's much more downstream
[00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:14.640]   from relevance realization.
[00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:17.920]   I think relevance realization refers to
[00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:23.740]   again, constraints on how you are paying attention.
[00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:28.940]   And so for me, talking about framing
[00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:32.900]   is talking about this process you're doing right now
[00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:34.340]   of salience landscaping.
[00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:36.360]   What's salient to you?
[00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:40.860]   And how is what's salient constantly shifting
[00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:43.140]   in a sort of a dynamic tapestry?
[00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:48.920]   And how are you shaping yourself
[00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:50.840]   to the way that salience landscaping
[00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:52.520]   is aspectualizing the world,
[00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:55.840]   shaping it into aspects for interaction?
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:59.200]   For me, that is a much more primordial process
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:02.520]   than any sort of a belief we have.
[00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:03.420]   And here's why.
[00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:09.000]   If we mean by beliefs, a representational proposition,
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.240]   then we're in this very problematic position
[00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:15.860]   because then we're trying to say that
[00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:18.100]   propositions are ultimately responsible
[00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:20.220]   for how we do relevance realization.
[00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:23.580]   And that's problematic because representations
[00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:26.080]   presuppose relevance realization.
[00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:29.440]   So I represent this as a cup.
[00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:32.820]   The number of properties it actually has
[00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:34.740]   and that I even have epistemic access to
[00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:36.740]   is combinatorial explosive.
[00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:39.000]   I select from those a subset
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.780]   and how they are relevant to each other
[00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:43.540]   insofar as they are relevant for me.
[00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:45.080]   This doesn't have to be a cup.
[00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:46.640]   I could be using it as a hat.
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:49.520]   I could use it to stand for the letter V,
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:50.660]   all kinds of different things.
[00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:53.480]   I could say this was the 10th billion object
[00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:54.800]   made in North America.
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:59.800]   Representations presuppose relevance realization.
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:03.800]   They are therefore dependent on it,
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:06.780]   which means relevance realization isn't bound
[00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:09.020]   to our representational structures.
[00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:10.840]   It can be influenced by them,
[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:12.600]   but they are ultimately dependent
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:14.400]   on relevance realization.
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:16.360]   - Let's define stuff.
[00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:18.320]   Relevance realization.
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:19.160]   - Yes.
[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:21.240]   - What are the inputs and the outputs of this thing?
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:22.120]   What is it?
[00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:23.960]   What are we talking about?
[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:27.600]   - What we're talking about is how you are doing
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:31.680]   something very analogous to evolution.
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:34.760]   So if you think about the adaptivity
[00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:37.600]   isn't in the organism or in the environment
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:40.000]   but in a dynamical relation,
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.880]   and then what does evolution do?
[00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:45.160]   It creates variation and then it puts selective pressure.
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:48.280]   And what that does is that changes the niche constructions
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:49.640]   that are available to a species.
[00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:50.980]   It changes the morphology.
[00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:53.940]   You also have a loop.
[00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:55.740]   It's your sensory motor loop.
[00:34:55.740 --> 00:34:58.880]   And what's constantly happening is there are processes
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:01.880]   within you that are opening up variation
[00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:04.360]   and also processes that are putting selection on it.
[00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:07.480]   And you're constantly evolving that sensory motor loop.
[00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:10.840]   So you might call your cognitive fittedness
[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:12.760]   which is how you're framing the world
[00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:14.880]   is constantly evolving and changing.
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:17.040]   I can give you two clear examples of that.
[00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:20.920]   One, your autonomic nervous system,
[00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:22.400]   parasympathetic and sympathetic.
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:27.040]   The sympathetic system is biased to trying to interpret
[00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:30.080]   as much of reality as threat or opportunity.
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:34.240]   The parasympathetic is biased to trying to interpret
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:38.000]   as much of the environment as safe and relaxing.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.400]   And they are constantly doing opponent processing.
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:43.080]   There's no little man in you
[00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:46.800]   calculating your level of arousal.
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:48.480]   There's this dynamic coupling,
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:50.220]   opponent processing between them
[00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:52.660]   that is constantly evolving your arousal.
[00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:54.580]   Similarly, your attention.
[00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:57.240]   You have the default mode network, task network.
[00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:59.460]   The default mode network is putting pressure
[00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:04.040]   on you right now to mind wander, to go off, to drift.
[00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:06.760]   And then the task focus network is selecting
[00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:10.160]   out of those possibilities the ones that will survive
[00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:11.320]   and go into.
[00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:14.480]   And so you're constantly evolving your attention.
[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:16.700]   - Okay, so there's a natural selection of ideas
[00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:19.480]   that a bunch of systems within you are generating.
[00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:22.320]   And then you use the natural selection.
[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:23.560]   What is the selector,
[00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:26.520]   the object that you're interacting with, the glass?
[00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:29.120]   Relevance realization, once again,
[00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:31.560]   you just described how it happens.
[00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:32.400]   - Yes.
[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:34.720]   - You didn't describe what the hell it is.
[00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:36.240]   So what's the goal?
[00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:37.160]   What are we talking about?
[00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:40.960]   So relevance realization is how you interact
[00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:44.000]   with things in the world to make sense of--
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:44.840]   - Yes.
[00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:46.120]   - Make sense of why they matter,
[00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:48.160]   what they mean to you, to your life.
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:49.800]   - Yes, and notice the language you just used.
[00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:51.720]   You're starting to use the meaning in life language.
[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:52.620]   - Good or bad?
[00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:53.460]   - That's good.
[00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:54.480]   - Okay. - That's good.
[00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:59.480]   So what does that evolution of your sensory motor loop do?
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:05.480]   It gives you, and here I'll use a term from Marlaponte,
[00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:10.280]   it gives you an optimal grip on the world.
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:13.760]   So let's use your visual attention again.
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:16.360]   Okay, here's an object.
[00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:18.800]   How close should I be to it?
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:21.320]   Is there a right--
[00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:22.240]   - That's what you wanna do with it.
[00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:24.720]   - Exactly, exactly.
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:29.380]   So you have to evolve your sensory motor loop
[00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:31.480]   in order to get the optimal grip
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:33.320]   that actually creates the affordance
[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:36.160]   of you getting to a goal that you're trying to get to.
[00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:39.160]   - Yeah, but you're describing physical goals
[00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:43.080]   of manipulating objects, so this applies,
[00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:47.080]   the task, the process of relevance realization
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:50.040]   is not just about getting a glass of water
[00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:51.080]   and taking a drink.
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:51.920]   - No.
[00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:55.000]   - It's about falling in love.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:55.960]   - Of course.
[00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:57.160]   - What else is there?
[00:37:57.160 --> 00:38:00.120]   - Well, there's obvious--
[00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:01.900]   - Between those two options.
[00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:03.900]   - I can show you how you're optimally gripping
[00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:07.700]   in an abstract cognitive domain, okay?
[00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:10.900]   So a mammal goes by and most people will say,
[00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:12.000]   "There's a dog."
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.580]   Now why don't they say, they might,
[00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:17.980]   but typically, probabilistically,
[00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:19.340]   they'll say, "There's a dog."
[00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:21.100]   They could say, "There's a German shepherd,
[00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:23.380]   "there's a mammal, there's a living organism,
[00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:25.260]   "there's a police dog."
[00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:27.240]   Why that, why there?
[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:31.080]   Why do they stop, Eleanor Rush called these basic level?
[00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:33.120]   Well, what you find is that's an optimal grip
[00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:36.280]   because it's getting you the best overall balance
[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:39.040]   between similarity within your category
[00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:41.240]   and difference between the other categories.
[00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:44.880]   It's allowing you to properly fit to that object
[00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:47.560]   insofar as you're setting yourself up to,
[00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:50.320]   well, I'm getting as many of the similarities
[00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:52.800]   and differences I can on balance
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:54.560]   'cause they're in a trade-off relationship
[00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:58.100]   that I need in order to probably interact with this mammal.
[00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:01.300]   That's optimal grip, right?
[00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:04.460]   It's at the level of your categorization.
[00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:09.460]   - You evolve these models of the world around you
[00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:13.180]   and on top of them, you do stuff.
[00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:15.180]   Like you build representations, like you said.
[00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:16.460]   - Yes.
[00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:18.520]   - What's the salience landscape?
[00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:22.880]   Salience meaning attention landscape.
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:26.480]   So salience is what grabs your attention
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:30.100]   or what results from you directing your attention.
[00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:32.740]   So I clap my hands, that's salient,
[00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:34.220]   it grabs your attention.
[00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:37.060]   Your attention is drawn to it as bottom up.
[00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:39.700]   But I can also say you left big toe
[00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:40.900]   and now it's salient to you
[00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:42.620]   because you directed your attention towards it.
[00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:43.740]   That's top down.
[00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:46.900]   And again, opponent processing going on there.
[00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:50.500]   So whatever stands out to you, what grabs your attention,
[00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:53.440]   what arouses you, what triggers at least momentarily
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:57.240]   some affect towards it, that's how things are salient.
[00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:59.080]   What salience, I would argue, is,
[00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:02.560]   is how a lot of unconscious relevance realization
[00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:06.440]   makes information relevant to working memory.
[00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:10.760]   That's when it now becomes online
[00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:13.360]   for direct sensory motor interaction with the world.
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:16.680]   - So you think the salience landscape,
[00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:19.980]   the ocean of salience extends into the subconscious mind?
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:22.720]   - I think relevance does,
[00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:26.480]   but I think when relevance is recursively processed,
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:30.720]   relevance realization, such that it passes through
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:33.940]   sort of this higher filter of working memory
[00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:37.560]   and has these properties of being globally accessible
[00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:39.280]   and globally broadcast,
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:41.740]   then it becomes the thing we call salience.
[00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:44.180]   Look, that's really good evidence.
[00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:47.200]   There's really good evidence from my colleague at U of T,
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:49.240]   University of Toronto, Lynn Hasher,
[00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:50.800]   that that's what working memory is.
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:52.760]   It's a higher order relevance filter.
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:56.540]   That's why things like chunking will get way more information
[00:40:56.540 --> 00:40:59.960]   through working memory, 'cause it's basically making,
[00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:03.400]   it's basically monitoring how much relevance realization
[00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:05.680]   has gone into this information.
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:07.560]   Usually you have to do an additional kind
[00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:09.120]   of recursive processing.
[00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:10.920]   And that tells you, by the way,
[00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:13.240]   when do you need consciousness?
[00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:16.920]   When do you need that working memory
[00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:18.840]   and that salience landscaping?
[00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:22.160]   It's when you're facing situations that are highly novel,
[00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:24.840]   highly complex, and very ill-defined
[00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:27.500]   that require you to engage working memory.
[00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:29.320]   - Okay, got it.
[00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:32.640]   So relevance realization is in part the thing
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:35.480]   that constructs that basic level thing of a dog.
[00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:38.440]   When you see a dog, you call it a dog,
[00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:41.480]   not a German shepherd, not a mammal,
[00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:45.520]   not a biological meat bag, it's a dog.
[00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:46.880]   Wisdom.
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:47.720]   - Yes.
[00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:48.800]   - So what is wisdom?
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:52.840]   If we return, I think as part of that,
[00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:55.400]   we got to relevance realization.
[00:41:55.400 --> 00:42:00.400]   And then wisdom is an accumulation of rationalities.
[00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:07.040]   You described a rationality as a kind of,
[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:10.000]   starting from intelligence, much of puzzle solving,
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.160]   and then rationalities like the meta problem
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:14.040]   of puzzle solving, and then what,
[00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:16.780]   wisdom is the meta meta problem of puzzle solving?
[00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:20.840]   - Yes, in the sense that the meta problem you have
[00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:22.640]   when you're solving your puzzles
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:25.760]   is that you can often fall into self-deception.
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:26.600]   You can misframe.
[00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:27.440]   - Self-deception, right.
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:32.400]   - Right, so whereas knowledge overcomes ignorance,
[00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:34.700]   wisdom is about overcoming foolishness.
[00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:37.840]   If what we mean by foolishness is self-deceptive,
[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:39.880]   self-destructive behavior, which I think
[00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:41.720]   is a good definition of foolishness.
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:47.580]   And so what you're doing is you're doing
[00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:49.620]   this recursive relevance realization.
[00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:51.460]   You're using your intelligence to improve
[00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:53.260]   the use of your intelligence.
[00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:54.940]   And then you're using your rationality
[00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:57.320]   to improve the use of your rationality.
[00:42:57.320 --> 00:42:59.260]   That's that recursive relevance realization
[00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:01.240]   I was talking about a few minutes ago.
[00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:03.180]   Think about a wise person.
[00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:06.820]   They come into highly, often messy,
[00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:08.920]   ill-defined, complex situations,
[00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:11.500]   usually where there's some significant novelty.
[00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:12.980]   And what can they do?
[00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:16.020]   They can zero in on what really matters,
[00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:18.860]   what's relevant, and then they can shape themselves,
[00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:23.420]   salience landscaping, to intervene most appropriately
[00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:26.260]   to that situation as they have framed it.
[00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:28.580]   That's what we mean by a wise person.
[00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:30.620]   And that's how it follows out of the model
[00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:31.780]   I've been presenting to you.
[00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:33.140]   - So when we say self-deception,
[00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:37.220]   I mean, part of that implies that it's intentional.
[00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:39.500]   Part of the mechanism of cognition,
[00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:44.500]   you're modifying what you should know for some purpose.
[00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:48.060]   Is that how you see the word self-deception?
[00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:50.980]   - No, 'cause I belong to a group of people
[00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:53.220]   that think the model of self-deception
[00:43:53.220 --> 00:43:57.700]   as lying to oneself ultimately makes no sense.
[00:43:57.700 --> 00:43:59.700]   Because in order to lie to you,
[00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:00.980]   I have to know something you don't,
[00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:04.340]   and I have to depend on your commitment to the truth
[00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:06.720]   in order to modify your behavior.
[00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:09.900]   I don't think that's what we do to ourselves.
[00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:12.060]   I think, and I'm gonna use it in a technical term,
[00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:14.740]   and thank you for making space for that earlier on,
[00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:16.580]   I think we can bullshit ourselves,
[00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:18.780]   which is a very different thing than lying.
[00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:23.620]   - So what is bullshit,
[00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:27.100]   and how do we bullshit ourselves, technically speaking?
[00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:29.980]   - Yeah, Frankfurt, and this is inspired by Frankfurt
[00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:32.660]   and other people's work based on Frankfurt's work.
[00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:33.580]   - On bullshit.
[00:44:33.580 --> 00:44:35.940]   - Yeah, classic essay.
[00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:37.380]   It's a pretty good title.
[00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:38.980]   - I think it's one of the best things he wrote.
[00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:40.460]   He wrote a lot of good things.
[00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:41.940]   - The title or the essay?
[00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:43.500]   - The essay.
[00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:44.620]   Title's good, too.
[00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:47.780]   It's always an icebreaker in certain academic settings.
[00:44:47.780 --> 00:44:54.280]   So let's contrast the bullshit artist from the liar.
[00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:57.560]   The liar depends on your commitment to the truth.
[00:44:57.560 --> 00:45:01.260]   The bullshit artist is actually trying to make you
[00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:04.740]   indifferent to the question of truth
[00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:09.700]   and modify your behavior by making things salient to you
[00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:11.800]   so that they are catchy to you.
[00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:17.700]   So a prototypical example of bullshit is a commercial,
[00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:21.280]   television commercial.
[00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:25.180]   You watch these people at a bar
[00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:27.380]   getting some particular kind of alcohol,
[00:45:27.380 --> 00:45:30.260]   and they're gorgeous, and they're laughing,
[00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:32.620]   and they're smiling, and they're clear-eyed.
[00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:36.220]   You know that's not true.
[00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:38.200]   And they know you know it's not true,
[00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:39.740]   but here's the point.
[00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:43.740]   You don't care because there's gorgeous people smiling,
[00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:45.980]   and they're happy, and that's salient to you,
[00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:47.540]   and that catches your attention.
[00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:50.140]   And so you know, go into a bar,
[00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:53.100]   you know that won't happen when you drink this alcohol.
[00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:56.620]   You know it, but you buy the product
[00:45:56.620 --> 00:45:58.780]   because it was made salient to you.
[00:45:58.780 --> 00:46:02.700]   Now, you can't lie to yourself, Lex.
[00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:04.340]   Salience can catch attention,
[00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:06.460]   but attention can drive salience.
[00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:08.180]   So this is what I can do.
[00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:12.960]   I can make something salient by paying attention to it,
[00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:16.460]   and then that will tend to draw me back to it again,
[00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:18.300]   which, and you see what happens?
[00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:20.980]   Which means it tends to catch my attention more
[00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:22.620]   so that when I go into the store,
[00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:27.300]   that bottle of liquor catches my attention, and I buy it.
[00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:31.380]   - And that's, why is that bullshit?
[00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:35.860]   Because what you're doing is being caught up
[00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:38.860]   in the salience of things,
[00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:40.900]   independent from whether or not
[00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:44.340]   that salience is tracking reality.
[00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:48.000]   - Is it independent, or is it loosely connected?
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.120]   Because it's not so obvious to me
[00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:52.500]   when I see happy people at a bar
[00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:54.740]   that I don't in part believe that,
[00:46:54.740 --> 00:46:58.620]   well, my experience has been maybe different.
[00:46:58.620 --> 00:47:00.300]   Logically, I can understand,
[00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:02.900]   but maybe there is a bar out there
[00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:06.660]   where it's all happy people dancing.
[00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:09.300]   In fact, most of the bars I go to these days in Texas
[00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:11.420]   is pretty, lots of happy people.
[00:47:11.420 --> 00:47:15.060]   - I think you can, I mean, there's probably variation,
[00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:17.580]   although I think it's very, the truth-seeking in there.
[00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:20.260]   Let's say the intent is at least to try
[00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:22.660]   and shut off your truth-seeking.
[00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:25.620]   It might not completely succeed, but that's the intent.
[00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:27.420]   At times, it can completely succeed
[00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:32.140]   because I can give you pretty much gibberish
[00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:34.300]   and never let it motivate your behavior.
[00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:37.500]   There's an episode from the classic "Simpsons,"
[00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:39.540]   not the modern "Simpsons," the classic "Simpsons,"
[00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:41.100]   where there's aliens,
[00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:44.000]   and they're running for office in the United States.
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.340]   Now, I'm a Canadian, so this doesn't quite work for me,
[00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:48.940]   but, right, and the speech goes like this.
[00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:51.120]   My fellow Americans, when I was young,
[00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:53.140]   I dreamt of being a baseball,
[00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:55.660]   but we must move forward, not backward,
[00:47:55.660 --> 00:47:59.380]   upward, not forward, twirling, twirling towards freedom.
[00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:01.540]   And people go, and there's a rush.
[00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:03.940]   Nothing, there's nothing there,
[00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:06.500]   and yet it's great satire
[00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:10.140]   because a lot of political speech is exactly like that.
[00:48:10.140 --> 00:48:12.460]   There's nothing there, right?
[00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:14.460]   - Well, so--
[00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:17.020]   - I'm not saying all political speech, I said a lot.
[00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:19.540]   - No, but there is a fundamental difference between,
[00:48:19.540 --> 00:48:22.660]   and this is so hilarious, I remember that episode.
[00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:23.840]   There is a fundamental difference
[00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:27.620]   between that absurd, sort of non-secular speech
[00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:30.920]   and political speech, 'cause one of the things is,
[00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:35.460]   political speech is grounded in some sense of truth.
[00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:39.980]   - And so if that requires you talking about alternative facts
[00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:45.820]   and weird, self-destructive, oxymoronic phrases,
[00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:50.080]   isn't that approaching pure bullshit?
[00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:54.100]   - No, I think pure bullshit,
[00:48:54.100 --> 00:49:00.460]   like the vacuum, is very difficult to get to,
[00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:01.660]   but I get the point.
[00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:06.140]   So what exactly is truth?
[00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:09.380]   Is it possible to know?
[00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:11.700]   - I think Spinoza's right about truth,
[00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:14.620]   that truth is only known by its own standard,
[00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:16.040]   which sounds circular.
[00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:18.460]   There's a way in which he didn't mean that circularly,
[00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:21.000]   and I think this is also convergent with Plato.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.120]   These are two huge influences on me.
[00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:28.060]   I think we only know the truth retrospectively
[00:49:28.060 --> 00:49:32.160]   when we go through some process of self-transcendence,
[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:36.200]   when we move from a frame to a more encompassing frame
[00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:39.180]   so that we can see the limitations and the distortions
[00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:40.820]   of the earlier frame.
[00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:42.860]   You have this when you have a moment of insight.
[00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:47.620]   Insight is you doing, you are re-realizing what is relevant.
[00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:53.540]   You go, oh, oh, I thought she was aggressive and angry.
[00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:57.680]   She's actually really afraid.
[00:49:57.680 --> 00:49:59.260]   I was mis-framing this.
[00:49:59.260 --> 00:50:02.720]   And you change what you find relevant.
[00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:04.500]   You have those aha moments.
[00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:07.260]   - So do you think it's possible
[00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:13.500]   to get a sense of objective reality?
[00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:17.180]   So is it possible to have,
[00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:19.160]   to get to the ground level of what,
[00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:21.520]   something that you can call objective truth?
[00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:24.560]   Or are we always on shaky ground?
[00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:29.440]   - I think those moments of transcendence
[00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:33.360]   can never get us to an absolute view from nowhere.
[00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:37.040]   And so this is Drew Heinlein's notion
[00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:38.240]   of finite transcendence.
[00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:40.880]   We are capable of self-transcendence,
[00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:42.800]   and therefore we are creatures who can actually
[00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:45.980]   raise the question of truth, or goodness, or beauty,
[00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:48.980]   'cause I think they all share this feature.
[00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:52.900]   But that doesn't mean we can transcend to a godhood,
[00:50:52.900 --> 00:50:55.940]   to some absolute view from nowhere
[00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:58.820]   that takes in all information
[00:50:58.820 --> 00:51:02.320]   and organizes it in a comprehensive whole.
[00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:03.860]   But that doesn't mean that truth
[00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:06.020]   is thereby rendered valueless.
[00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:12.620]   I think a better term is real.
[00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:18.500]   And real and illusory are comparative terms.
[00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:21.680]   You only know that something's an illusion
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:23.740]   by taking something else to be real.
[00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:27.940]   And so we're always in a comparative task.
[00:51:27.940 --> 00:51:29.860]   But that doesn't mean that we can somehow
[00:51:29.860 --> 00:51:34.480]   jump outside of our framing in some final manner
[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:39.020]   and say this is how it is from a God's eye point of view.
[00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:41.320]   - So what do you think, if I may ask,
[00:51:42.460 --> 00:51:46.800]   of somebody like Ayn Rand and her philosophy of objectivism?
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:48.480]   So where the core principle is that
[00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:50.940]   reality exists independently of consciousness
[00:51:50.940 --> 00:51:53.280]   and that human beings have direct contact
[00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:54.900]   with reality through sense perception.
[00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:59.900]   So they have that, you do have that ability to know reality.
[00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:01.240]   - There's two things.
[00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:03.640]   Knowing that there's an independent reality
[00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:06.840]   is not knowing that independent reality.
[00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:08.520]   Those are not the same thing.
[00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:11.920]   - Yeah, but I think objectivism would probably
[00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:16.920]   say that our human reason is able to have contact with that.
[00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:18.800]   - Then I would respond and say,
[00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:23.200]   you have to, I believe, in fact, ultimately,
[00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:25.480]   in a conformity theory of knowing that
[00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:31.760]   the deepest kind of knowing is when there's a contact,
[00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:34.120]   a conformity between the mind,
[00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:36.600]   with the embodied mind, and reality.
[00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:40.840]   But, and here's where I guess I'd push back on Rand.
[00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:44.120]   I would say, you have to acknowledge
[00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:46.880]   parceral knowledge as real knowledge.
[00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:48.720]   Because if you don't, you're gonna fall prey
[00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:50.640]   to Mino's paradox.
[00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:53.840]   Mino's paradox is, you know, this is in Plato, right?
[00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:55.960]   To know P.
[00:52:55.960 --> 00:53:00.680]   Well, if I don't know P, I'm gonna go looking for it.
[00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:03.200]   But if I don't know P, how could I possibly recognize it
[00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:04.720]   when I found it?
[00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:05.960]   I have no way of recognizing it.
[00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:09.000]   I have no way of knowing that I've found it.
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:10.280]   So I must know P.
[00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:13.160]   But if I know P, then I don't need to learn about it.
[00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:14.600]   I don't need to go searching.
[00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:17.760]   So learning doesn't exist.
[00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:19.720]   Knowledge is impossible.
[00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:21.880]   The way you break out of that paradox is saying,
[00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:26.600]   no, no, no, it is possible to partially know something.
[00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:29.600]   I can know it enough that it will guide me
[00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:31.680]   to recognizing it, but that's not the same
[00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:33.400]   as having a complete grasp of it,
[00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:35.440]   'cause I still have to search and find
[00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:37.880]   what I don't yet possess in my knowledge.
[00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:43.280]   If we, so partial knowledge has to be real knowledge.
[00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:45.200]   - Right, partial knowledge is still knowledge.
[00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:46.400]   - Yes.
[00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:49.880]   - What do you think about somebody like Donald Hoffman,
[00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:52.680]   who thinks the reality is an illusion,
[00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:57.200]   so complete illusion, that we're given this,
[00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:59.720]   actually, really nice definition or idea
[00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:01.400]   that you talked about, that there's a tension
[00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:05.280]   between the illusory and what is real.
[00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:08.960]   He says that basically we've taken that
[00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:11.760]   and we've ran with the real to the point
[00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:16.080]   where the real is not at all connected
[00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:18.680]   to some kind of physical reality.
[00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:20.040]   - Well, I hope to talk to him at some point.
[00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:21.400]   We were supposed to talk at one point,
[00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:23.800]   and so I have to talk in his absence.
[00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:28.880]   I think that, first of all, I think saying
[00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:30.720]   that everything is illusion is like saying
[00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:31.720]   everything is tall.
[00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:32.640]   It doesn't make any sense.
[00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:34.440]   It's a comparative term.
[00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:38.800]   Something you have to say against this standard
[00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:41.200]   of realness, this is an illusion.
[00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:47.160]   And he uses arguments from evolution,
[00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:51.040]   which are problematic to me, because it's like,
[00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:56.040]   well, you seem to be saying that evolution is true,
[00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:58.640]   that it really exists.
[00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:03.640]   And then some of our cognition and our perception
[00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:06.280]   has access to reality.
[00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:10.160]   Math and presumably some science has access to reality.
[00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:12.640]   And then what he seems to be saying is,
[00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:17.640]   well, a lot of your everyday experience is illusory,
[00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:22.040]   but we do have some contact with reality
[00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:23.860]   whereby we can make the arguments
[00:55:23.860 --> 00:55:26.320]   as to why most of your experience,
[00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:28.800]   most of your everyday experience is an illusion.
[00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:31.360]   But to me, that's not a novel thing.
[00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:33.400]   That's Descartes.
[00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:35.520]   That's the idea that most of our sense experience
[00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:38.560]   is untrustworthy, but the math is what connects us
[00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:39.400]   to reality.
[00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:41.960]   That's how he interpreted the Copernican Revolution.
[00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:45.060]   Oh, look, we're all seeing the sun rise and move over
[00:55:45.060 --> 00:55:46.560]   and set, and it's all an illusion.
[00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:49.720]   But the math, the math gets us to the reality.
[00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:52.040]   - Well, I think he makes a deeper point
[00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:56.360]   that most of cognition is just, is evolved
[00:55:56.360 --> 00:55:59.480]   and operates in the illusory world.
[00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:01.360]   - How does he know that things like cognition
[00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:02.780]   and evolution exist?
[00:56:03.620 --> 00:56:05.900]   - I think there's an important distinction
[00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:09.620]   between evolution and cognition, right?
[00:56:09.620 --> 00:56:11.740]   - No, no, I'm just saying, that's not the point I'm making.
[00:56:11.740 --> 00:56:13.260]   I'm making a point that he's claiming
[00:56:13.260 --> 00:56:15.460]   that there are two things that really exist.
[00:56:15.460 --> 00:56:18.580]   Why are they privileged?
[00:56:18.580 --> 00:56:23.020]   - He basically says that, look,
[00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:25.420]   the process of evolution makes sense.
[00:56:25.420 --> 00:56:26.540]   - Yes. - Right?
[00:56:26.540 --> 00:56:28.900]   Like it makes sense that you get complex organisms
[00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:32.140]   from simple organisms through the natural selection process.
[00:56:32.140 --> 00:56:34.500]   Here's how you get to transfer information
[00:56:34.500 --> 00:56:36.180]   from generation to generation.
[00:56:36.180 --> 00:56:37.220]   It makes sense.
[00:56:37.220 --> 00:56:41.700]   And then he says that there's no requirement
[00:56:41.700 --> 00:56:44.420]   for the cognition to evolve in a way
[00:56:44.420 --> 00:56:47.860]   that it would actually perceive and have direct contact
[00:56:47.860 --> 00:56:49.620]   with the physical reality.
[00:56:49.620 --> 00:56:51.860]   - Except that cognition evolved in such a way
[00:56:51.860 --> 00:56:54.300]   that it could perceive the truth of evolution.
[00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:57.740]   And you can't treat evolution like an isolated thing.
[00:56:57.740 --> 00:57:00.980]   Evolution depends on Darwinian theory, genetics.
[00:57:00.980 --> 00:57:03.380]   It depends on understanding plate tectonics,
[00:57:03.380 --> 00:57:05.220]   the way the environment changes.
[00:57:05.220 --> 00:57:08.660]   It depends on how chromosomes are structured.
[00:57:08.660 --> 00:57:10.820]   - Actually, that's an interesting question to him
[00:57:10.820 --> 00:57:15.060]   where I don't know if he actually would push back on this
[00:57:15.060 --> 00:57:17.540]   is how do you know evolution is real?
[00:57:17.540 --> 00:57:18.380]   - Yes.
[00:57:18.380 --> 00:57:23.100]   - I think he would be open to the idea
[00:57:23.100 --> 00:57:25.660]   that it is part of the illusion that we constructed,
[00:57:25.660 --> 00:57:29.460]   that there's some, in some sense,
[00:57:29.460 --> 00:57:31.900]   it is connected to reality,
[00:57:31.900 --> 00:57:34.220]   but we don't have a clear picture of it.
[00:57:34.220 --> 00:57:38.940]   I mean, that's an intellectually honest statement then.
[00:57:38.940 --> 00:57:43.220]   If most of our cognition as thinking beings
[00:57:43.220 --> 00:57:48.220]   is operating at every level in an illusory world,
[00:57:48.220 --> 00:57:50.660]   then it makes sense that this,
[00:57:50.660 --> 00:57:54.300]   one of the main theories of science, that's evolution,
[00:57:54.300 --> 00:57:58.640]   is also a complete part of this illusory world.
[00:57:58.640 --> 00:58:00.740]   - Right, but then what happens to the premise
[00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:03.500]   for his argument leading to the conclusion
[00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:04.740]   that cognition is illusory?
[00:58:04.740 --> 00:58:06.980]   - I think he makes a very specific argument
[00:58:06.980 --> 00:58:10.660]   about evolution as an explanation of why the world is,
[00:58:10.660 --> 00:58:13.260]   of our cognition operating in an illusory world,
[00:58:13.260 --> 00:58:17.100]   but that's just one of the explanations.
[00:58:17.100 --> 00:58:20.220]   I think the deeper question is
[00:58:20.220 --> 00:58:23.380]   why do we think we have contact with reality,
[00:58:23.380 --> 00:58:24.620]   with physical reality?
[00:58:25.500 --> 00:58:30.500]   We could be very well living in a virtual world
[00:58:30.500 --> 00:58:33.680]   constructed by our minds
[00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:36.160]   in a way that makes that world
[00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:37.780]   deeply interesting in some ways,
[00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:39.920]   whether it's somebody playing a video game
[00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:41.800]   or we're trying to,
[00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:44.340]   through the process of distributed cognition,
[00:58:44.340 --> 00:58:47.640]   construct more and more complex objects.
[00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:49.640]   Like, why do we have to,
[00:58:49.640 --> 00:58:54.280]   why does it have to be connected to physics and planets
[00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:55.240]   and all that kind of stuff?
[00:58:55.240 --> 00:58:56.840]   - Okay, so if we're gonna say,
[00:58:56.840 --> 00:58:59.860]   we're now considering it as a possibility
[00:58:59.860 --> 00:59:02.660]   rather than it's a conclusion based on arguments,
[00:59:02.660 --> 00:59:04.260]   because the arguments, again,
[00:59:04.260 --> 00:59:06.140]   will always rely on stipulating
[00:59:06.140 --> 00:59:08.580]   that there is something that is known.
[00:59:08.580 --> 00:59:10.420]   These are the features of cognition.
[00:59:10.420 --> 00:59:12.340]   Cognition is capable of illusion.
[00:59:12.340 --> 00:59:13.660]   That's a true statement.
[00:59:13.660 --> 00:59:15.840]   You're somehow in contact with the mind.
[00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:18.100]   Why does the mind have this privileged contact
[00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:21.140]   and other aspects like my body do not?
[00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:23.060]   But let's put that aside,
[00:59:23.060 --> 00:59:25.580]   and now let's just consider it.
[00:59:25.580 --> 00:59:27.740]   Now, when we put it that way,
[00:59:27.740 --> 00:59:29.460]   it's not an epistemic question anymore.
[00:59:29.460 --> 00:59:30.620]   It's an existential question,
[00:59:30.620 --> 00:59:32.100]   and here's my reply to you.
[00:59:32.100 --> 00:59:33.740]   There's two possibilities.
[00:59:33.740 --> 00:59:38.420]   Either the illusion is one that I cannot discover,
[00:59:38.420 --> 00:59:42.180]   sort of the matrix on steroids or something.
[00:59:42.180 --> 00:59:44.160]   There's no way, no matter what I do,
[00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:46.640]   I can't find out that it's an illusion.
[00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:50.700]   Or it's an illusion,
[00:59:50.700 --> 00:59:52.740]   but I can find out that it's an illusion.
[00:59:53.580 --> 00:59:56.380]   Those are the two possibilities.
[00:59:56.380 --> 00:59:59.140]   Nothing changes for me if those are the two possibilities,
[00:59:59.140 --> 01:00:02.380]   'cause if I could not possibly find out,
[01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:05.420]   it is irrational for me to pay any attention
[01:00:05.420 --> 01:00:06.580]   to that possibility.
[01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:11.380]   So I should keep doing the science as I'm doing it.
[01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:14.560]   If there's a way of finding out,
[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:16.860]   science is my best bet, I believe,
[01:00:16.860 --> 01:00:20.300]   for finding out what's true and what's an illusion,
[01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:21.840]   so I keep doing what I'm doing.
[01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:23.980]   So it's an argument, if you move it to that,
[01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:26.200]   that makes no existential difference to me.
[01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:31.220]   - Oh man, that is such a deeply philosophical argument.
[01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:32.620]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:00:32.620 --> 01:00:38.160]   Nobody's saying science doesn't work.
[01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:40.100]   It's an interesting question.
[01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:43.300]   Just like before humans were able to fly,
[01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:44.820]   they would ask a question.
[01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:47.340]   Can we build a machine that makes us fly?
[01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:49.500]   In that same way, we're asking a question
[01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:51.180]   to which we don't know an answer,
[01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:52.760]   but we may know in the future
[01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:56.740]   how much of this whole thing is an illusion.
[01:00:56.740 --> 01:00:59.760]   And I think in a second category,
[01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:01.320]   the first category, I forgot which one,
[01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:04.640]   yes, science will be able to help us discover this.
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:08.000]   Otherwise, yes, for sure, it doesn't matter.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.320]   If we're living in a simulation,
[01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:13.000]   we can't find out at all, then it doesn't matter.
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.240]   But yes, the whole point is,
[01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:17.080]   as we get deeper and deeper understanding
[01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:20.440]   of our mind, of cognition,
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:22.080]   we might be able to discover
[01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:26.120]   how much of this is a big charade constructed by our mind
[01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:28.460]   to keep us fed or something like that.
[01:01:28.460 --> 01:01:32.920]   Some weird, very simplistic explanation
[01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:36.360]   that will ultimately in its simplicity be beautiful.
[01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:41.160]   Or as we try to build robots and instill them,
[01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:44.620]   instill them with consciousness,
[01:01:44.620 --> 01:01:49.620]   with ability to feel, those kinds of things,
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:54.560]   we'll discover, well, let's just trick them
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:57.320]   into thinking they feel and have consciousness,
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:58.600]   and they'll believe it.
[01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:00.400]   And then they'll have a deeply fulfilling
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:01.660]   and meaningful lives.
[01:02:01.660 --> 01:02:04.220]   And on top of that, they will interact with us
[01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:06.240]   in a way that will make our lives more meaningful.
[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:07.540]   And then all of a sudden,
[01:02:07.540 --> 01:02:09.120]   it's like at the end of Animal Farm,
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:11.520]   you look at pigs and humans,
[01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:12.960]   and you look at robots and humans,
[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:14.920]   and you can't tell the difference between either.
[01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:17.080]   And we, in that way, start to understand
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:22.080]   that much of this existence could be an illusion.
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:24.840]   - Okay, well, I have two responses to that.
[01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:29.320]   First is the progress that's being made on AGI
[01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:36.980]   is about making whatever the system is
[01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:39.760]   that's going to be the source of intelligence
[01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:43.720]   more and more dynamically and recursively self-correcting.
[01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:46.380]   That's part of what's happening.
[01:02:47.380 --> 01:02:50.580]   Extrapolating from that, you get a system
[01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:52.420]   that gets better and better at self-correcting.
[01:02:52.420 --> 01:02:55.020]   But that's exactly what I was describing before
[01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:56.920]   as the transformative theory of truth.
[01:02:56.920 --> 01:03:03.380]   The other response to that is science,
[01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:07.340]   like people think of science just as, right,
[01:03:07.340 --> 01:03:09.220]   sort of end proposition.
[01:03:09.220 --> 01:03:12.660]   But let me just use the evolutionary example again, right?
[01:03:12.660 --> 01:03:17.540]   Like, I need, if I'm gathering the evidence,
[01:03:17.540 --> 01:03:19.100]   I need to know a lot of geology,
[01:03:19.100 --> 01:03:20.540]   I need to know plate tectonics,
[01:03:20.540 --> 01:03:22.780]   I need to know about radioactive decay,
[01:03:22.780 --> 01:03:24.260]   I need to know about genetics.
[01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:26.620]   And then in order to measure all those things,
[01:03:26.620 --> 01:03:28.980]   I need to know how microscopes work.
[01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:31.500]   I need to know how pencils and paper work.
[01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:33.140]   I need to know how rulers work.
[01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:34.580]   I need to know how English,
[01:03:34.580 --> 01:03:39.020]   like, you can't isolate knowledge that way.
[01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:41.060]   And if you say, well, most of that's an illusion,
[01:03:41.060 --> 01:03:43.260]   then you're in a weird position of saying
[01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:47.440]   somehow all of these illusions get to this truth claim.
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:50.520]   I think it goes in reverse.
[01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:53.540]   If you think this is the truth claim, right,
[01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:55.500]   the measuring and all the things
[01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:57.500]   that scientists would do to gather
[01:03:57.500 --> 01:04:00.540]   on all the ways the theories are converging together,
[01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:03.140]   that also has to be fundamentally right.
[01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:08.140]   Because it's not like Lego, it is an interwoven whole.
[01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:09.900]   - Yes, it definitely is interwoven,
[01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:12.980]   but I love how I'm playing the devil advocate
[01:04:12.980 --> 01:04:14.420]   for the illusion world.
[01:04:14.420 --> 01:04:19.420]   But there's an aspect to truth that has to be consistent,
[01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:23.220]   deeply consistent across an entire system.
[01:04:23.220 --> 01:04:24.420]   But inside a video game,
[01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:28.340]   that's some same kind of consistency evolves.
[01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:30.140]   There's rules about interactions,
[01:04:30.140 --> 01:04:32.540]   there's game theoretic patterns
[01:04:32.540 --> 01:04:35.260]   about what's good and bad and so on.
[01:04:35.260 --> 01:04:38.060]   And there's sources of joy and fear and anger.
[01:04:38.060 --> 01:04:40.300]   And then understanding about a world,
[01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:42.860]   what happens in different dynamics of a video game,
[01:04:42.860 --> 01:04:44.380]   even simple video games.
[01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:49.380]   So there's no, even inside an illusion,
[01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:51.140]   you can have consistency
[01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:53.820]   and develop truths inside that illusion
[01:04:53.820 --> 01:04:58.820]   and iteratively evolve your truth with the illusion.
[01:04:58.820 --> 01:05:01.260]   - Okay, but that comes back.
[01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:04.020]   Does that, is that process genuinely self-correcting
[01:05:04.020 --> 01:05:05.940]   or are you in the simulation
[01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:08.340]   in which there is no possible doorway out?
[01:05:08.340 --> 01:05:10.300]   Because if my argument is,
[01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:13.300]   if you find one or two doorways, that feeds back.
[01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:14.420]   In fact, you can't just say,
[01:05:14.420 --> 01:05:17.460]   "This is the little tiny island where we have the truth."
[01:05:17.460 --> 01:05:18.820]   That's the point I'm making.
[01:05:18.820 --> 01:05:21.180]   - Right, but what if you find that,
[01:05:21.180 --> 01:05:24.100]   I think there is doorways if that's the case.
[01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:27.740]   And what if you find a doorway and you step out,
[01:05:27.740 --> 01:05:30.420]   but you're yet in another simulation?
[01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:31.660]   I mean, that's the point.
[01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:33.980]   That's so self-correcting.
[01:05:33.980 --> 01:05:36.860]   When you fix the self-deception,
[01:05:36.860 --> 01:05:40.660]   you don't know if there's other bigger self-deceptions
[01:05:40.660 --> 01:05:41.500]   you're operating on.
[01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:43.580]   - Of course, in one sense, that's right.
[01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:44.900]   But again, we're back to,
[01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:47.580]   when I step into the second simulation,
[01:05:47.580 --> 01:05:51.380]   is it, can I get the doorway out of that?
[01:05:51.380 --> 01:05:53.860]   Because if you just make the infinite regress of simulations,
[01:05:53.860 --> 01:05:55.060]   you've basically said,
[01:05:55.060 --> 01:05:57.540]   "I have a simulation that I can never get out of."
[01:05:57.540 --> 01:05:59.660]   - Yeah, I think there's always a bigger pile of bullshit
[01:05:59.660 --> 01:06:02.100]   is the claim I'm trying to make here.
[01:06:02.100 --> 01:06:02.940]   - Okay.
[01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:09.580]   Let me dance around meaning once more.
[01:06:09.580 --> 01:06:13.140]   I often ask people on this podcast or at a bar
[01:06:13.140 --> 01:06:16.580]   or to imaginary people I talk to in a room
[01:06:16.580 --> 01:06:18.220]   when I'm all by myself,
[01:06:18.220 --> 01:06:20.760]   the question of the meaning of life.
[01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:24.740]   Do you think this is a useful question?
[01:06:24.740 --> 01:06:29.700]   You drew a line between meaning in life and meaning of life.
[01:06:29.700 --> 01:06:31.980]   Do you think this is a useful question?
[01:06:31.980 --> 01:06:33.300]   - No, I think it's like the question,
[01:06:33.300 --> 01:06:35.020]   what's north of the North Pole?
[01:06:35.020 --> 01:06:36.300]   Or what time is it on the sun?
[01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:37.380]   It sounds like a question,
[01:06:37.380 --> 01:06:39.980]   but it's actually not really a question.
[01:06:39.980 --> 01:06:41.860]   Because it has a presupposition in it
[01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:43.900]   that I think is fundamentally flawed.
[01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:47.580]   If I understand what people mean by it,
[01:06:47.580 --> 01:06:50.100]   and it's actually often not that clear,
[01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:51.620]   but when they talk about the meaning of life,
[01:06:51.620 --> 01:06:56.620]   they are talking about there are some feature of the universe
[01:06:56.620 --> 01:06:59.580]   in and of itself that I have to discover
[01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:01.700]   and enter into a relationship with.
[01:07:01.700 --> 01:07:05.420]   And there's in that sense a plan for me or something.
[01:07:05.420 --> 01:07:09.500]   And so that's a property of the universe.
[01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:12.740]   That's a very deep, serious,
[01:07:12.740 --> 01:07:14.820]   metaphysical ontological claim.
[01:07:14.820 --> 01:07:16.900]   You're claiming to know something fundamental
[01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:18.220]   about the structure of reality.
[01:07:18.220 --> 01:07:20.340]   There were times when people thought
[01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:22.260]   they had a worldview that legitimated it.
[01:07:22.260 --> 01:07:24.500]   Like God is running the universe
[01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:26.260]   and therefore God cares about you
[01:07:26.260 --> 01:07:28.500]   and there's a plan, et cetera.
[01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:33.500]   But I think a better way of understanding meaning is not,
[01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:37.660]   meaning is like the graspability.
[01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:39.020]   Remember I talked about optimal grip?
[01:07:39.020 --> 01:07:41.100]   It's like the graspability of that cup.
[01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:42.840]   Is that in me?
[01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:44.060]   No.
[01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:45.100]   Is it in the cup?
[01:07:45.100 --> 01:07:47.200]   No, because the fly can't grasp it.
[01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:50.020]   Well, graspability is in my hand.
[01:07:50.020 --> 01:07:52.180]   Well, I can't grasp Africa.
[01:07:52.180 --> 01:07:55.340]   No, no, there is a real relation,
[01:07:55.340 --> 01:07:58.140]   fittedness between me and this cup.
[01:07:58.140 --> 01:08:00.340]   Same thing with the adaptivity of an organism.
[01:08:00.340 --> 01:08:02.140]   Is the adaptivity of a great white shark
[01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:03.200]   in the great white shark?
[01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:04.940]   Drop it in the Sahara, does.
[01:08:04.940 --> 01:08:10.240]   Meaning isn't in me.
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:11.780]   I think that's romantic bullshit.
[01:08:11.780 --> 01:08:14.740]   And it isn't in the universe.
[01:08:14.740 --> 01:08:17.300]   It is a proper relationship.
[01:08:17.300 --> 01:08:19.220]   I've coined the phrase transjective.
[01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:20.940]   It is the binding relationship
[01:08:20.940 --> 01:08:22.980]   between the subjective and the objective.
[01:08:22.980 --> 01:08:27.220]   And therefore when you're asking the question
[01:08:27.220 --> 01:08:28.820]   about the meaning of life,
[01:08:28.820 --> 01:08:33.360]   you are, I think, misrepresenting the nature of meaning.
[01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:36.340]   Just like when you ask what time is it on the sun,
[01:08:36.340 --> 01:08:39.740]   you're misrepresenting how we derive clock time.
[01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:42.820]   - At the risk of disagreeing with a man
[01:08:42.820 --> 01:08:45.260]   who did 50 lectures on the meaning crisis,
[01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:47.700]   let me hard disagree.
[01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:49.380]   But I think we probably agree.
[01:08:49.380 --> 01:08:51.740]   But it's just like a dance, like any dialogue.
[01:08:51.740 --> 01:08:54.620]   I think meaning of life
[01:08:55.740 --> 01:08:58.020]   gets at the same kind of relationship
[01:08:58.020 --> 01:09:00.140]   between you and the glass of water,
[01:09:00.140 --> 01:09:06.420]   between whatever the forces of the universe that created,
[01:09:06.420 --> 01:09:13.060]   the planets, the proteins, the multi-cell organisms,
[01:09:13.060 --> 01:09:19.700]   the intelligent early humans,
[01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:21.700]   the beautiful human civilizations
[01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:24.280]   and the technologies that will overtake them.
[01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:28.400]   It's trying to understand
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:36.240]   the relevance realization of the Big Bang
[01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:40.720]   to the feeling of love you have for another human being.
[01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:43.760]   It's reaching for that
[01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:46.240]   even though it's hopeless to understand.
[01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:47.480]   It's the question,
[01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:50.280]   the asking of the question is the reaching.
[01:09:50.280 --> 01:09:52.680]   Now it is, in fact,
[01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:56.740]   romantic bullshit, technically speaking.
[01:09:56.740 --> 01:10:02.840]   But it could be that romantic bullshit
[01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:06.040]   is actually the essence of life
[01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:09.020]   and the source of its deepest meaning.
[01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:11.720]   - Well, I hope not.
[01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:15.080]   - Technically speaking, romantic bullshit.
[01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:17.360]   Meaning romantic--
[01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:19.120]   - In the philosophical sense, yes.
[01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:23.480]   - So I mean, what is poetry?
[01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:24.320]   What is music?
[01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:25.760]   What is the magic you feel
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:27.720]   when you hear a beautiful piece of music?
[01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:28.560]   What is that?
[01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:31.120]   - Oh, but that's exactly to my point.
[01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:34.640]   Is music inside you or is it outside you?
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:35.960]   It's both and neither.
[01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:39.080]   And that's precisely why you find it so meaningful.
[01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:40.840]   In fact, it can be so meaningful,
[01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:42.320]   you can regard it as sacred.
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:45.520]   What you said, I don't think,
[01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:48.000]   and you prefaced that we might not be in disagreement.
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.920]   What you said is, no, no, no,
[01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:54.880]   there's a way in which reality is realizing itself.
[01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:58.640]   And I want my relevance realization
[01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:03.640]   to be in the best possible relationship,
[01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:07.000]   the sort of meta-optimal grip to what is most real.
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.360]   I totally agree.
[01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:10.160]   I totally think that's one of the things,
[01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:12.200]   I said this earlier, one of our meta-desires
[01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:15.660]   is whatever is satisfying our desires is also real.
[01:11:15.660 --> 01:11:18.000]   I do this with my students.
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.640]   I'll say, 'cause romantic relationships
[01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:23.600]   sort of take the role of God and religion
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:25.120]   and history and culture for us right now.
[01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:27.720]   We put everything on them and that's why they break.
[01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:29.000]   But, right?
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.600]   - Strong words, got it.
[01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:33.480]   - But I'll say to them, okay,
[01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:35.600]   how many of you are in really satisfying
[01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:36.560]   romantic relationships?
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:37.400]   Put up your hands.
[01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:40.080]   Then I'll say, okay, I'm now only talking to these people.
[01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:42.680]   Of those people, how many of you would wanna know
[01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:43.960]   your partner's cheating on you
[01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:46.160]   even if it means the destruction of the relationship?
[01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:47.860]   95% of them put up their hands.
[01:11:47.860 --> 01:11:50.560]   And I say, but why?
[01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:53.800]   And here's my students who are usually all sort of
[01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:56.120]   bitten with cynicism and post-modernism
[01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:57.640]   and they'll just say spontaneously,
[01:11:57.640 --> 01:11:59.040]   well, because it's not real.
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:01.120]   Because it's not real.
[01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:06.380]   Right, so I think what you're pointing to is actually,
[01:12:06.380 --> 01:12:13.560]   you're pointing not to an objective or a subjective thing.
[01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:15.320]   Romanticism says it's subjective.
[01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:17.920]   There's some sort of, I guess, like positivism
[01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:20.040]   or Lockean empiricism says it's objective.
[01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:22.720]   But you're saying, no, no, no, there's reality realization
[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:27.100]   and can I get relevance realization to be optimally gripping
[01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:29.480]   in the best right relationship with it?
[01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:32.460]   And there's good reason you can because think about it.
[01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:35.600]   Your relevance realization isn't just representing
[01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:38.000]   properties of the world, it's instantiating it.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.040]   There's something very similar to biological evolution
[01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:43.480]   which is at the guts of life, if I'm right,
[01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:44.700]   running your cognition.
[01:12:44.700 --> 01:12:47.920]   It's not just that you have ideas,
[01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:51.160]   you actually instantiate, that's what I mean by conformity,
[01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:52.600]   the same principles.
[01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:53.840]   They're within and without.
[01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:55.500]   They don't belong to you subjectively.
[01:12:55.500 --> 01:12:56.540]   They're not just out there.
[01:12:56.540 --> 01:12:58.160]   They're in both at the same time.
[01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:01.900]   And they help to explain how you are actually bound
[01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:04.040]   to the evolutionary world.
[01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:07.160]   - Yeah, so it comes from both inside and from the outside.
[01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:10.660]   But there's still the question of the meaning of life.
[01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:14.880]   First of all, the big benefit of that question
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:19.800]   is that it shakes you out of your hamster in a wheel
[01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:23.520]   that is daily life, the mundane process of daily life
[01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:25.880]   where you have a schedule, you wake up,
[01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:28.080]   you have kids, you have to take them to school,
[01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:30.240]   then you go to work and da, da, da, da, da,
[01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:32.000]   and repeats over and over and over and over
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.480]   and then you get increased salary
[01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:37.120]   and then you upgrade the home and that whole process.
[01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:41.960]   Asking about the meaning of life
[01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:45.680]   is so full of romantic bullshit
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:49.240]   that if you just allow yourself
[01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:51.960]   to take it seriously for a second,
[01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:55.240]   it forces you to pause and think,
[01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:58.360]   like, what's going on here?
[01:13:58.360 --> 01:13:59.800]   And then it ultimately, I think,
[01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:02.080]   does return to the question of meaning
[01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:04.080]   in those mundane things.
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:07.080]   What gives my life joy?
[01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:12.080]   What gives it lasting deliciousness?
[01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:13.640]   Where do I notice the magic
[01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:16.360]   and how can I have that magic return again and again?
[01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:17.520]   Beauty.
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:20.120]   And that ultimately what it returns to.
[01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:23.200]   But it's the same thing you do when you look up to the sky.
[01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:25.600]   You spend most of your day hurrying around,
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:27.120]   looking at things on the surface,
[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:29.960]   but when you look up to the sky and you see the stars,
[01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:32.920]   it fills you with the feeling of awe
[01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:36.660]   that forces you to pause and think in full context
[01:14:36.660 --> 01:14:39.560]   of, like, what the hell is going on here?
[01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:43.200]   That, but also I think there is a...
[01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:50.240]   When you think too much about the meaning of a glass
[01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:53.600]   and relevance realization of a glass,
[01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:56.240]   you don't necessarily get at the core
[01:14:56.240 --> 01:14:58.640]   of what makes music beautiful.
[01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:02.160]   So sometimes you have to start at the biggest picture first.
[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:03.960]   And I think meaning of life forces you
[01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:06.360]   to really go to the big bang
[01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:11.320]   and go to the universe and the whole thing,
[01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:12.280]   the origin of life.
[01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:16.220]   And I think sometimes you have to start there
[01:15:16.220 --> 01:15:20.000]   to discover the meaning in the day-to-day, I think.
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:23.220]   But perhaps you would disagree.
[01:15:23.220 --> 01:15:27.520]   - Insofar as the question makes you ask about
[01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:31.360]   the whole of your life
[01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:34.400]   and how much meaning is in the whole of your life,
[01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:37.080]   and insofar as it asks how much
[01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:39.640]   that is connected to reality, it's a good question.
[01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:44.560]   But it's a bad question in that it also makes you look
[01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:47.000]   for the answers in the wrong way.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:50.320]   Now you said, and I agree with what you said,
[01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:51.880]   how we really answer this question
[01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:54.160]   is we come back to the meaning in life
[01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:55.820]   and we see how much that meaning in life
[01:15:55.820 --> 01:15:57.200]   is connected to reality.
[01:15:57.200 --> 01:15:59.100]   We pursue wisdom.
[01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:04.560]   And so for me, I don't need that question
[01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:06.940]   in order to provoke me into that stance.
[01:16:06.940 --> 01:16:10.920]   - So let's return to the meaning crisis.
[01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:12.600]   - Yes.
[01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:17.600]   - What is the nature of the meaning crisis in modern times?
[01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:18.900]   What's its origin?
[01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:20.640]   What's its explanation?
[01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:23.000]   - Well, remember what I said, what I argued,
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:26.320]   that the very processes that make us adaptively intelligent
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:29.000]   subject us to perennial problems of self-deception,
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.260]   self-destruction, creating bullshit for ourselves,
[01:16:31.260 --> 01:16:33.080]   for other people, all of that.
[01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:38.080]   And that can cause anxiety, existential anxiety.
[01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:39.840]   It can cause despair.
[01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:43.620]   It can cause a sense of absurdity.
[01:16:43.620 --> 01:16:46.440]   These are perennial problems.
[01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:52.100]   And across cultures and across historical periods,
[01:16:52.100 --> 01:16:55.540]   human beings have come up with ecologies of practices.
[01:16:55.540 --> 01:16:57.620]   There's no one practice, there's no panacea practice.
[01:16:57.620 --> 01:17:00.000]   They've come up with ecologies of practices
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.240]   for ameliorating that self-deception
[01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:06.400]   and enhancing that fittedness, that connectedness
[01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:08.980]   that's at the core of meaning in life.
[01:17:08.980 --> 01:17:12.580]   That's prototypically what we call wisdom.
[01:17:12.580 --> 01:17:17.080]   And here's how I can show you one clear instance
[01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:22.080]   of the meaning crisis is it's a wisdom famine.
[01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:25.580]   I do this regularly with my students.
[01:17:26.660 --> 01:17:28.780]   In the classroom I'll say, where do you go for information?
[01:17:28.780 --> 01:17:30.040]   They hold up their phone.
[01:17:30.040 --> 01:17:32.560]   Where do you go for knowledge?
[01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:33.840]   They're a little bit slower
[01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:35.040]   and probably 'cause they're in my class,
[01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:38.080]   they'll say, well, science, the university.
[01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:39.800]   I'll say, where do you go for wisdom?
[01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:42.980]   There's a silence.
[01:17:42.980 --> 01:17:46.540]   Wisdom isn't optional.
[01:17:46.540 --> 01:17:49.040]   That's why it is perennial, cross-cultural,
[01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:51.400]   cross-historical 'cause of the perennial problems.
[01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:56.400]   But we do not have homes for ecologies of practices
[01:17:57.220 --> 01:18:00.940]   that fit into our scientific technological worldview
[01:18:00.940 --> 01:18:02.940]   so that they are considered legitimate.
[01:18:02.940 --> 01:18:05.660]   The fastest growing demographic group are the nuns,
[01:18:05.660 --> 01:18:06.780]   N-O-N-E-S's.
[01:18:06.780 --> 01:18:08.500]   They have no religious allegiance,
[01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:11.620]   but they are not primarily atheistic.
[01:18:11.620 --> 01:18:16.220]   They most frequently describe themselves with this very,
[01:18:16.220 --> 01:18:18.940]   this has become almost everybody now describes,
[01:18:18.940 --> 01:18:21.340]   I'm spiritual but not religious.
[01:18:21.340 --> 01:18:25.380]   Which means they are trying to find a way
[01:18:25.380 --> 01:18:28.900]   of reducing the bullshit and enhancing the connectedness,
[01:18:28.900 --> 01:18:32.380]   but they don't want to turn to any of the legacy
[01:18:32.380 --> 01:18:34.620]   established religions by and large.
[01:18:34.620 --> 01:18:40.020]   - Well, isn't, both religion and the nuns,
[01:18:40.020 --> 01:18:45.220]   isn't wisdom a process, not a destination?
[01:18:45.220 --> 01:18:49.300]   So trying to find, if you're a deeply faithful,
[01:18:49.300 --> 01:18:52.860]   a religious person, you're also trying to find, right?
[01:18:52.860 --> 01:18:57.820]   So just because you have a place where you're looking
[01:18:57.820 --> 01:19:01.460]   or a set of traditions around which you're constructing
[01:19:01.460 --> 01:19:04.020]   the search, it's nevertheless a search.
[01:19:04.020 --> 01:19:07.620]   So I guess, is there a case to be made
[01:19:07.620 --> 01:19:10.720]   that this is just the usual human condition?
[01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:15.460]   How do you answer, if you ask five centuries ago,
[01:19:15.460 --> 01:19:17.420]   where do you look for wisdom?
[01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:19.560]   I mean, I suppose people would be more inclined
[01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:24.560]   to answer, well, the Bible or a religious text.
[01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:27.920]   - Right, and they had a worldview that was considered
[01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:31.320]   not just religious, but also rational.
[01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:34.540]   So we now have these two things,
[01:19:34.540 --> 01:19:38.280]   orthogonal or often oppositional,
[01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:40.400]   spirituality and rationality.
[01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:42.640]   But if you go before a particular historical period,
[01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:44.800]   you look back in the Neoplatonic tradition,
[01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:47.520]   like before the Scientific Revolution,
[01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:49.760]   those two are not in opposition,
[01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:53.960]   they are deeply interwoven so that you can have a sense
[01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:57.800]   of legitimacy and deep realness and grounding
[01:19:57.800 --> 01:19:59.680]   in your practices.
[01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:01.000]   We don't have that anymore.
[01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:02.480]   And I'm not advocating for religion,
[01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:04.500]   neither am I an enemy of religion.
[01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:06.800]   I'll strengthen your case, by the way.
[01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:11.120]   So one of my RAs did research and you get people
[01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:14.800]   who have committed themselves to cultivating wisdom.
[01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:18.280]   And you can look at people within religious traditions
[01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:21.700]   and people who are doing it in a purely secular framework.
[01:20:21.700 --> 01:20:25.560]   By many of the measures we use to try to study
[01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:29.480]   wisdom scientifically, the people in the religious paths
[01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:31.840]   do better than the secular.
[01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:34.360]   But here's the important point.
[01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:35.740]   There's no significant difference
[01:20:35.740 --> 01:20:38.380]   between the religious paths.
[01:20:38.380 --> 01:20:41.960]   So it's not like if you're following the path of Judaism,
[01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:44.000]   you're more likely to end up wiser
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:45.880]   than if you follow Buddhism.
[01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:47.240]   - By the way, I don't know if that's my case.
[01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:48.640]   I was making the case that you don't need
[01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:51.840]   to have a religious affiliation to search for wisdom.
[01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:56.240]   It's that I thought along to the point you just made
[01:20:56.240 --> 01:20:59.720]   that it doesn't matter which religious affiliation or none.
[01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:01.600]   - But that's what I'm saying.
[01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:04.280]   Okay, so this is the tricky thing we're in.
[01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:06.200]   It does matter if you're in one,
[01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:09.560]   but it doesn't matter sort of the propositional creeds
[01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:12.520]   of that, there's something else at work.
[01:21:12.520 --> 01:21:13.740]   If you'll allow me this,
[01:21:13.740 --> 01:21:17.420]   there's a functionality to religion that we lost
[01:21:17.420 --> 01:21:20.340]   when we rejected all the propositional dogma.
[01:21:20.340 --> 01:21:22.160]   But there's a functionality there
[01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:25.040]   that we don't know how to recreate.
[01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:25.880]   - Yeah, what is that?
[01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:26.800]   Can you try to speak to that?
[01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:28.680]   What is that functionality?
[01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:29.520]   What is that?
[01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:31.260]   Why is that so useful?
[01:21:31.260 --> 01:21:32.960]   A bunch of stories, a bunch of myths,
[01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:34.000]   a bunch of narratives--
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:34.840]   - Yeah, but I see it.
[01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:35.680]   I don't think--
[01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:40.240]   - That are drenched in deep lessons about morality
[01:21:40.240 --> 01:21:41.280]   and all those kinds of things.
[01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:44.460]   What is the functional thing there
[01:21:44.460 --> 01:21:47.680]   that can't be replaced without a religious text
[01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:49.540]   by a non-religious text?
[01:21:49.540 --> 01:21:52.340]   - This is, for me, the golden question, so thank you.
[01:21:52.340 --> 01:21:54.740]   - Do you have an answer?
[01:21:54.740 --> 01:21:58.860]   - Yeah, I think I have a significant answer.
[01:21:58.860 --> 01:22:01.980]   I don't think it's complete, but I think it's important.
[01:22:01.980 --> 01:22:06.940]   And this is to step before the Cartesian Revolution
[01:22:06.940 --> 01:22:10.460]   and think about many different kinds of knowing.
[01:22:10.460 --> 01:22:13.080]   And this is now something that is prominent
[01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:15.340]   within what's called 4E cognitive science,
[01:22:15.340 --> 01:22:17.260]   the kind of cognitive science I practice.
[01:22:17.260 --> 01:22:18.860]   And there's a lot of converging evidence
[01:22:18.860 --> 01:22:22.020]   for these different ways of knowing.
[01:22:22.020 --> 01:22:23.380]   There's propositional knowing.
[01:22:23.380 --> 01:22:25.020]   This is what we are most familiar with.
[01:22:25.020 --> 01:22:28.520]   In fact, it almost has a tyrannical status.
[01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:31.900]   This is knowing that something is the case,
[01:22:31.900 --> 01:22:33.280]   like that cats are mammals
[01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:35.280]   and it's stored in semantic memory,
[01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:36.960]   and we have tests of coherence
[01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:38.780]   and correspondence and conviction.
[01:22:40.380 --> 01:22:41.500]   There's procedural knowing.
[01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:43.660]   This is knowing how to do something.
[01:22:43.660 --> 01:22:47.780]   Skills are not theories.
[01:22:47.780 --> 01:22:48.600]   They're not beliefs.
[01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:49.640]   They're not true or false.
[01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:53.020]   They engage the world or they don't.
[01:22:53.020 --> 01:22:55.380]   And they are stored in a different kind of memory,
[01:22:55.380 --> 01:22:56.940]   procedural memory.
[01:22:56.940 --> 01:22:59.480]   Semantic memory can be damaged
[01:22:59.480 --> 01:23:01.880]   without any damage to procedural memory.
[01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:04.240]   That's why you have the prototypical story
[01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:05.780]   of somebody suffering Alzheimer's
[01:23:05.780 --> 01:23:07.740]   and they're losing all kinds of facts,
[01:23:07.740 --> 01:23:11.020]   but they can still sit down and play the piano flawlessly.
[01:23:11.020 --> 01:23:12.780]   Same kind of argument.
[01:23:12.780 --> 01:23:15.300]   There's perspectival knowing.
[01:23:15.300 --> 01:23:17.940]   This is knowing what it's like to be you here now
[01:23:17.940 --> 01:23:20.140]   in this situation, in this state of mind,
[01:23:20.140 --> 01:23:22.400]   the whole field of your salience landscaping,
[01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:24.580]   what it's like to be you here now.
[01:23:24.580 --> 01:23:27.700]   And you have a specific kind of memory around that,
[01:23:27.700 --> 01:23:29.180]   episodic memory.
[01:23:29.180 --> 01:23:30.540]   And you have a different sense,
[01:23:30.540 --> 01:23:33.120]   you have a different criterion of realness.
[01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:35.660]   So you can get this by,
[01:23:35.660 --> 01:23:37.580]   well, my friend Dan Sciappia and I,
[01:23:37.580 --> 01:23:40.700]   we studied the scientists using moving the rovers around,
[01:23:40.700 --> 01:23:43.540]   or you can take a look at people who are doing VR.
[01:23:43.540 --> 01:23:44.560]   People talk about,
[01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:48.140]   they wanna really be in the game.
[01:23:48.140 --> 01:23:49.580]   That makes it real.
[01:23:49.580 --> 01:23:51.580]   They don't mean verisimilitude.
[01:23:51.580 --> 01:23:53.500]   You can get that, right?
[01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:55.760]   Sense of being in the game with something like Tetris,
[01:23:55.760 --> 01:23:59.200]   which doesn't look like the real world.
[01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:02.380]   And you can fail to have it in a video game
[01:24:02.380 --> 01:24:04.460]   that has a lot of verisimilitude.
[01:24:04.460 --> 01:24:06.300]   It's something else, it's about, again,
[01:24:06.300 --> 01:24:09.220]   this kind of connectedness that we're talking about.
[01:24:09.220 --> 01:24:10.620]   - If I may interrupt,
[01:24:10.620 --> 01:24:13.460]   is that connected to the hard problem of consciousness,
[01:24:13.460 --> 01:24:16.360]   the subject, the qualia, or is that a different,
[01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:17.340]   that kind of knowing,
[01:24:17.340 --> 01:24:19.420]   is that different from the qualia of consciousness?
[01:24:19.420 --> 01:24:20.700]   - I think it has to do with,
[01:24:20.700 --> 01:24:22.540]   well, I make a distinction between the adjectival
[01:24:22.540 --> 01:24:23.700]   and the adverbial qualia.
[01:24:23.700 --> 01:24:25.780]   So I think it has to do with the adverbial qualia
[01:24:25.780 --> 01:24:27.700]   much more than with the adjectival.
[01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:31.460]   So the adjectival qualia are like the greenness of green
[01:24:31.460 --> 01:24:32.820]   and the blueness of blue.
[01:24:32.820 --> 01:24:37.820]   The adverbial qualia are the here-ness,
[01:24:37.820 --> 01:24:41.460]   the now-ness, the together-ness.
[01:24:41.460 --> 01:24:42.900]   And I think the perspectival knowing
[01:24:42.900 --> 01:24:45.300]   has a lot to do with the adverbial qualia.
[01:24:45.300 --> 01:24:48.420]   - Adjectival qualia and adverbial qualia.
[01:24:48.420 --> 01:24:50.540]   I'm learning so many new things today.
[01:24:50.540 --> 01:24:53.860]   Okay, so that's another way of knowing.
[01:24:53.860 --> 01:24:56.520]   - Right, the perspectival, and then there's a deeper one.
[01:24:56.520 --> 01:24:57.900]   And this is a philosophical point,
[01:24:57.900 --> 01:25:01.380]   and I don't wanna, we can go through the argument,
[01:25:01.380 --> 01:25:03.940]   but you don't have to know that you know in order to know,
[01:25:03.940 --> 01:25:05.580]   because if you start doing that,
[01:25:05.580 --> 01:25:06.940]   you get an infinite regress.
[01:25:06.940 --> 01:25:08.000]   There has to be kinds of knowing
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.100]   that doesn't mean you know that you know that.
[01:25:10.100 --> 01:25:14.820]   - Yeah, of course. - Okay, great, okay, good.
[01:25:14.820 --> 01:25:18.140]   Well, there was a lot of ink spilled over that
[01:25:18.140 --> 01:25:19.500]   over a 40-year period, so--
[01:25:19.500 --> 01:25:21.860]   - By philosophers, they spill, this is what they do.
[01:25:21.860 --> 01:25:23.460]   They spill ink. - Yeah.
[01:25:23.460 --> 01:25:24.420]   But I wanna talk-- - They get paid
[01:25:24.420 --> 01:25:25.500]   for ink spillage.
[01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:29.300]   - So I wanna talk about what I call participatory knowing.
[01:25:29.300 --> 01:25:32.780]   This is the idea that you and the world
[01:25:32.780 --> 01:25:35.020]   are co-participating in things,
[01:25:35.020 --> 01:25:38.420]   and such that real affordances exist between you.
[01:25:38.420 --> 01:25:42.660]   So both me and this environment are shaped by gravity,
[01:25:42.660 --> 01:25:46.460]   so the affordance of walking becomes available to me.
[01:25:46.460 --> 01:25:49.820]   Both me and a lot of this environment
[01:25:49.820 --> 01:25:51.540]   are shaped by my biology,
[01:25:51.540 --> 01:25:54.600]   and so affordances for that are here.
[01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:56.520]   Look at this cup.
[01:25:57.540 --> 01:26:01.940]   Shared physics, shared sort of biological factors.
[01:26:01.940 --> 01:26:04.460]   Look at my hand, I'm bipedal.
[01:26:04.460 --> 01:26:06.880]   Also, culture is shaping me and shaping this.
[01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:10.380]   I had to learn how to use that and treat it as a cup.
[01:26:10.380 --> 01:26:14.620]   So this is an agent-arena relationship, right?
[01:26:14.620 --> 01:26:18.900]   There's identities being created in your agency,
[01:26:18.900 --> 01:26:22.300]   identities being created in the world as an arena,
[01:26:22.300 --> 01:26:24.280]   so you and the world fit together.
[01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:27.920]   You know when that's missing, when you're really lonely,
[01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:31.320]   or you're homesick, or you're suffering culture shock.
[01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:33.780]   So this is participatory knowing,
[01:26:33.780 --> 01:26:37.480]   and it comes with a sense of belonging.
[01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:39.920]   - At every level.
[01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:43.760]   So the ability to walk is a kind of knowing.
[01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:45.600]   - Yes, yes, yes.
[01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:47.360]   - That there's a dance between the physics
[01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:50.280]   that enables this process,
[01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:52.960]   and just participating in the process
[01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:54.600]   is the act of knowing.
[01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:57.680]   - Right, and there's a really weird form of memory
[01:26:57.680 --> 01:26:59.480]   you have for this kind of knowing.
[01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:00.520]   It's called yourself.
[01:27:00.520 --> 01:27:02.320]   - What?
[01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:03.280]   Can you elaborate?
[01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:08.080]   - Well, you do, so we talked about how all the different
[01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:10.680]   other kinds of knowing had specific kinds of memory.
[01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:13.680]   Semantic memory for propositional, procedural, right?
[01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:15.420]   Episodic for perspectival.
[01:27:15.420 --> 01:27:20.600]   What's the kind of memory that is the coordinated storehouse
[01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:23.280]   of all of your agent arena relationships?
[01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:25.080]   All the roles you can take,
[01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:26.960]   all the identities you can assume,
[01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:28.800]   all the identities you can assign.
[01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:29.680]   - What's the self?
[01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:31.040]   Do you mean like consciousness?
[01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:33.160]   - No, I mean your sense of self.
[01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:36.000]   - Sense of self in this world.
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:37.760]   That's not consciousness.
[01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:40.680]   That's like an agency or something.
[01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:43.160]   - Right, it's an agent arena relationship.
[01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:45.640]   - And so in an agent arena relationship,
[01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:48.060]   it's the sense of the agent.
[01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:52.600]   - And that the agent belongs in that arena.
[01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:54.840]   - Whatever the agent is, whatever the arena is,
[01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:59.480]   'cause it's probably a bunch of different framings
[01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:01.680]   of how you experience that.
[01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:03.960]   - Yeah, and you do.
[01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:07.820]   Within your identity as a self, you have all kinds of roles
[01:28:07.820 --> 01:28:10.320]   that are somehow contributing to that identity,
[01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:12.920]   but are not equivalent to that identity.
[01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:14.480]   - Yeah.
[01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:16.720]   I wonder if my two hands have different,
[01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:20.080]   'cause there's a different experience
[01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:22.320]   in me picking up something with my right hand
[01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:23.660]   and then my left hand.
[01:28:23.660 --> 01:28:26.320]   Are those like--
[01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:30.080]   - That's a really cool question, Lex.
[01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:32.800]   - They certainly feel like their own things.
[01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:37.680]   But that could be just anthropomorphization
[01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:39.440]   based on cultural narratives and so on.
[01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:41.680]   - It could, it could, but I think it's a legitimate
[01:28:41.680 --> 01:28:43.320]   empirical question 'cause it also could be
[01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:44.920]   sort of Ian McGill-Christoph.
[01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:48.000]   It could be you're using different hemispheres
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:51.240]   and they sort of have different agent arena relationships
[01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:52.080]   to the environment.
[01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:53.200]   This is a really important question
[01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:55.040]   in the cognitive science of the self.
[01:28:55.040 --> 01:28:58.440]   Does that hemispheric difference mean you're multiple
[01:28:58.440 --> 01:29:00.160]   or you actually have a singular self?
[01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:01.600]   - Oh, so it's important to understand
[01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:03.760]   how many selves are there.
[01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:05.240]   - Yes, I think so.
[01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:07.440]   - But that's just like a quirk of evolution.
[01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:11.880]   Surely it can't be fundamental to cognition,
[01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:14.440]   having multiple selves or a singular self.
[01:29:14.440 --> 01:29:19.440]   - It depends, again, because we're getting far
[01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:23.000]   from the answer to the question you originally asked me.
[01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.120]   Do you want me to go back to that first or answer this one?
[01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:25.960]   - Which question?
[01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:26.840]   I already forgot everything.
[01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:28.720]   - What's the functionality of religion?
[01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:29.560]   - Yes.
[01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:30.400]   - Okay.
[01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:31.220]   - Let us return.
[01:29:31.220 --> 01:29:33.500]   - Okay, and then we can return to the self.
[01:29:33.500 --> 01:29:37.120]   Okay, so you said you have all these propositions
[01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:38.800]   and et cetera, et cetera, and they differ
[01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:40.960]   from the religions and they're not,
[01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:44.460]   they don't seem to be considered legitimate by many people.
[01:29:44.460 --> 01:29:48.760]   But yet there's something functioning in the religions
[01:29:48.760 --> 01:29:52.440]   that is transforming people and making them wiser.
[01:29:52.440 --> 01:29:55.520]   And I put it to you that the transformations
[01:29:55.520 --> 01:29:58.420]   are largely occurring at those non-propositional levels,
[01:29:58.420 --> 01:30:03.960]   the procedural, the perspectival, and the participatory.
[01:30:03.960 --> 01:30:05.720]   And those are the ones, by the way,
[01:30:05.720 --> 01:30:08.600]   that are more fundamentally connected to meaning making
[01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:11.360]   'cause remember the propositions are representational
[01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:14.160]   and they're dependent on the non-propositional,
[01:30:14.160 --> 01:30:17.240]   non-representational processes of connectedness
[01:30:17.240 --> 01:30:18.540]   and relevance realization.
[01:30:18.540 --> 01:30:21.360]   So religion goes down deep to the non-propositional
[01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:22.240]   and works there.
[01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:24.680]   That's the functionality we need to grasp.
[01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:27.960]   - Well, you talk about tools, essentially,
[01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:31.080]   that humans are able to incorporate into their cognition.
[01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:33.960]   Psychotechnologies, like language is one, I suppose.
[01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:39.720]   Isn't religion then a psychotechnology?
[01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:43.200]   - It would be a, yeah, an ecology of psychotechnologies, yes.
[01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:47.040]   - And the question is that Nietzsche ruined everything
[01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:48.440]   by saying God is dead.
[01:30:48.440 --> 01:30:52.720]   Do we have to invent the new thing?
[01:30:52.720 --> 01:30:55.160]   Go from the old phone, create the iPhone,
[01:30:55.160 --> 01:30:58.000]   invent the new psychotechnology that takes place
[01:30:58.000 --> 01:30:58.920]   of religion. - Okay.
[01:30:58.920 --> 01:31:01.640]   And so when the madman in Nietzsche's text
[01:31:01.640 --> 01:31:04.400]   goes into the marketplace, who's he talking to?
[01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:06.320]   He's not talking to the believers.
[01:31:06.320 --> 01:31:08.160]   He's talking to the atheists.
[01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:11.680]   And he says, do you not realize what we have done?
[01:31:11.680 --> 01:31:14.920]   We have taken a sponge and wiped away the sky.
[01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:16.400]   We are now forever falling.
[01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:18.000]   We are unchained from the sun.
[01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.520]   We have to become worthy of this.
[01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:23.600]   - Yeah, well, Nietzsche is full of romantic bullshit.
[01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:25.600]   - No, no, no, no, but there's a point there.
[01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:30.260]   The point is, there's one thing to rejecting
[01:31:30.260 --> 01:31:32.760]   the proposition, there's another project
[01:31:32.760 --> 01:31:36.520]   of replacing the functionality that we lost
[01:31:36.520 --> 01:31:37.840]   when we reject the religion.
[01:31:37.840 --> 01:31:40.680]   - So his worry that as nihilism takes hold,
[01:31:40.680 --> 01:31:45.680]   you don't ever replace the thing that religion,
[01:31:45.680 --> 01:31:49.360]   the role that religion played in our world.
[01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:51.600]   - Maybe, it's hard to tell what he actually,
[01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:53.240]   'cause he's so multivocal.
[01:31:53.240 --> 01:31:57.400]   I'll speak for me rather than for Nietzsche.
[01:31:57.400 --> 01:32:02.080]   I think it is possible to, using the best cognitive science
[01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:04.800]   and respectfully exacting what we can
[01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:09.360]   from the best religion and philosophical traditions,
[01:32:09.360 --> 01:32:11.080]   'cause there's things like Stoicism
[01:32:11.080 --> 01:32:14.020]   that are in the gray line between philosophy and religion.
[01:32:14.020 --> 01:32:15.340]   Buddhism is the same.
[01:32:15.340 --> 01:32:19.700]   Doing that best cog sci, that best exactation,
[01:32:19.700 --> 01:32:23.720]   we can come up with that functionality
[01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:27.480]   without having to buy into the particular
[01:32:27.480 --> 01:32:30.520]   propositional sets of the legacy religions.
[01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:31.720]   That's my proposal.
[01:32:31.720 --> 01:32:34.000]   I call that the religion that's not a religion.
[01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.680]   - So things like Stoicism or Modern Stoicism,
[01:32:36.680 --> 01:32:39.840]   those things, don't you think in some sense
[01:32:39.840 --> 01:32:42.400]   they naturally emerge?
[01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:46.360]   Don't you think there's a longing for meaning?
[01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:50.640]   - So Stoicism arises during the Hellenistic period
[01:32:50.640 --> 01:32:53.080]   when there was a significant meaning crisis
[01:32:53.080 --> 01:32:56.480]   in the ancient world because of what had happened
[01:32:56.480 --> 01:33:00.440]   after the breakup of Alexander the Great's empire.
[01:33:00.440 --> 01:33:03.560]   So if you compare Aristotle to people
[01:33:03.560 --> 01:33:06.720]   who are living after Alexander,
[01:33:06.720 --> 01:33:08.400]   so Aristotle grows up in a place
[01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:10.840]   where everybody speaks the same,
[01:33:10.840 --> 01:33:13.000]   has the same language, has the same religion.
[01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:14.840]   His ancestors have been there for years.
[01:33:14.840 --> 01:33:16.280]   He knows everybody.
[01:33:16.280 --> 01:33:19.720]   After Alexander the Great's empire is broken up,
[01:33:19.720 --> 01:33:23.960]   people are now thousands of miles away from the government.
[01:33:23.960 --> 01:33:26.760]   They're surrounded by people because of the Diasporas,
[01:33:26.760 --> 01:33:28.720]   the Diasporas, I should say.
[01:33:28.720 --> 01:33:29.620]   They're surrounded by people
[01:33:29.620 --> 01:33:30.880]   that don't speak their language,
[01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:32.300]   don't share their religion.
[01:33:32.300 --> 01:33:34.920]   That's why you get all these other religions emerging,
[01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:38.000]   universal muddled religions like ISIS, et cetera.
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.680]   So there is what's called domicile.
[01:33:40.680 --> 01:33:42.240]   There's the killing of home.
[01:33:42.240 --> 01:33:45.340]   There's a loss of a sense of home and belonging
[01:33:45.340 --> 01:33:48.040]   and fittedness during the Hellenistic period
[01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:52.560]   and Stoicism arose specifically to address that.
[01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:55.800]   And because it was designed to address a meaning crisis,
[01:33:55.800 --> 01:33:58.480]   it is no coincidence that it is coming back
[01:33:58.480 --> 01:34:00.680]   into prominence right now.
[01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:03.360]   - Well, there could be a lot of other variations.
[01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:04.640]   - Oh, totally.
[01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:07.000]   - It feels like, I think when you speak
[01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:11.060]   of the meaning crisis, you're in part describing,
[01:34:11.060 --> 01:34:12.760]   not prescribing.
[01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:14.580]   You're describing something that is happening,
[01:34:14.580 --> 01:34:19.580]   but I would venture to say that if we just leave things be,
[01:34:19.580 --> 01:34:24.580]   the meaning crisis dissipates because we long
[01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:29.160]   to create institutions, to create collective ideas.
[01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:31.960]   So there's a distributed cognition process
[01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:33.720]   that give us meaning.
[01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:38.600]   So if religion loses power, we'll find other institutions
[01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:40.680]   that are sources of meaning.
[01:34:40.680 --> 01:34:41.520]   - I don't--
[01:34:41.520 --> 01:34:44.320]   - Is that your intuition as well?
[01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:46.960]   - I think we are already doing that.
[01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:51.960]   I am involved with and do participant observation
[01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:55.220]   of many of these emerging communities
[01:34:55.220 --> 01:34:57.360]   that are creating ecologies of practice
[01:34:57.360 --> 01:34:59.860]   that are specifically about trying
[01:34:59.860 --> 01:35:01.280]   to address the meaning crisis.
[01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:04.840]   I just, in late July, I went to Washington State
[01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:06.880]   and did Rafe Kelly's Evolve, Move, Play,
[01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:10.280]   Return to the Source, and wow,
[01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:12.440]   one of the most challenging things I've ever done.
[01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:13.640]   - That guy is awesome, by the way.
[01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:16.560]   I got to interact with him a long, long time ago.
[01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:17.400]   He's--
[01:35:17.400 --> 01:35:18.320]   - He said to say hi to you, by the way.
[01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:20.160]   - Yeah, it's from another world.
[01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:21.720]   It feels like a different world
[01:35:22.860 --> 01:35:26.060]   because I interacted with him, not directly,
[01:35:26.060 --> 01:35:27.420]   but so this is somebody,
[01:35:27.420 --> 01:35:29.220]   maybe you can speak to what he works on,
[01:35:29.220 --> 01:35:32.460]   but he makes movement and play,
[01:35:32.460 --> 01:35:36.660]   and he encourages people to make that a part of their life,
[01:35:36.660 --> 01:35:39.140]   like how you move about the world,
[01:35:39.140 --> 01:35:42.140]   whether that's as part of sort of athletic endeavors
[01:35:42.140 --> 01:35:45.500]   or actually just like walking around a city.
[01:35:45.500 --> 01:35:49.440]   And I think the reason I ran into him
[01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:51.840]   is because there was a lot of interest in that
[01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:54.460]   in the athletic world, in the grappling world,
[01:35:54.460 --> 01:35:56.380]   in the Brazilian jiu-jitsu world,
[01:35:56.380 --> 01:35:57.620]   people who study movement,
[01:35:57.620 --> 01:35:58.920]   who make movement part of their life
[01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:02.220]   to see how can we integrate play and fun
[01:36:02.220 --> 01:36:07.220]   and just the basic humanness that's natural to our movement.
[01:36:07.220 --> 01:36:11.460]   How do we integrate that into our daily practice?
[01:36:11.460 --> 01:36:15.100]   So this is yet another way to find meaning.
[01:36:15.100 --> 01:36:16.940]   - I think it's actually an exemplar
[01:36:16.940 --> 01:36:18.300]   of what I was talking about
[01:36:18.300 --> 01:36:20.940]   because what's going on with Rafe's integration
[01:36:20.940 --> 01:36:23.420]   of parkour in nature, right?
[01:36:23.420 --> 01:36:28.420]   And martial arts and mindfulness practices
[01:36:28.420 --> 01:36:32.180]   and dialogical practices is exactly,
[01:36:32.180 --> 01:36:33.820]   and explicitly so by the way,
[01:36:33.820 --> 01:36:37.260]   he will tell you he's been very influenced by my work.
[01:36:37.260 --> 01:36:41.100]   He's trying to get at the non-propositional kinds of knowing
[01:36:41.100 --> 01:36:44.660]   that make meaning by evolving our sensory motor loop
[01:36:44.660 --> 01:36:46.800]   and enhancing our relevance realization
[01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:49.380]   because that gives people profound improved sense
[01:36:49.380 --> 01:36:51.100]   of connectedness to themselves,
[01:36:51.100 --> 01:36:52.840]   to each other and the world.
[01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:56.900]   And I'll tell you Lex, I don't wanna say the,
[01:36:56.900 --> 01:36:59.620]   I don't wanna say too specifically the final thing
[01:36:59.620 --> 01:37:02.380]   that people did because it's part of his secret sauce.
[01:37:02.380 --> 01:37:03.620]   - Sure, sure, sure.
[01:37:03.620 --> 01:37:06.700]   - But what I can say is when it was done,
[01:37:06.700 --> 01:37:07.860]   I said to them all, I said,
[01:37:07.860 --> 01:37:10.860]   "As far as I can tell, none of you are religious, right?"
[01:37:10.860 --> 01:37:12.180]   And they go, "Yeah, yeah."
[01:37:12.180 --> 01:37:13.380]   And I said, "But what you just did
[01:37:13.380 --> 01:37:15.500]   was a religious act, wasn't it?"
[01:37:15.500 --> 01:37:18.020]   And they all went, "Yeah, it was."
[01:37:18.020 --> 01:37:19.180]   - Yeah.
[01:37:19.180 --> 01:37:20.940]   So that same magic was there.
[01:37:20.940 --> 01:37:21.780]   - Yes.
[01:37:21.780 --> 01:37:23.820]   - Bathroom break?
[01:37:23.820 --> 01:37:25.220]   - Sure.
[01:37:25.220 --> 01:37:29.100]   - What's your take on atheism in general?
[01:37:29.100 --> 01:37:35.220]   Is it closer to truth than a,
[01:37:35.220 --> 01:37:37.140]   maybe is an atheist closer to truth
[01:37:37.140 --> 01:37:38.960]   than a person who believes in God?
[01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:43.300]   - So I'm a non-theist, which means I think
[01:37:43.300 --> 01:37:45.100]   the shared set of presuppositions
[01:37:45.100 --> 01:37:47.140]   between the theist and the atheist
[01:37:47.140 --> 01:37:49.140]   are actually what needs to be rejected.
[01:37:49.140 --> 01:37:53.020]   - Can you explain that further?
[01:37:53.020 --> 01:37:55.340]   - Yes, I can.
[01:37:55.340 --> 01:37:57.380]   And I wanna point out, by the way,
[01:37:57.380 --> 01:38:02.380]   that there are lots of non-theistic religious traditions.
[01:38:02.380 --> 01:38:08.340]   So I'm not coming up with a sort of airy-fairy category.
[01:38:08.340 --> 01:38:09.300]   - Yeah, and what's the difference
[01:38:09.300 --> 01:38:13.900]   between non-theism, agnosticism, and atheism?
[01:38:13.900 --> 01:38:18.780]   - So non-theists think that the theist and the atheist
[01:38:18.780 --> 01:38:21.660]   share a bunch of presuppositions.
[01:38:21.660 --> 01:38:26.660]   For example, it's that sacredness is to be understood
[01:38:26.660 --> 01:38:30.820]   in terms of a personal being
[01:38:30.820 --> 01:38:33.220]   that is in some sense the supreme being,
[01:38:33.220 --> 01:38:36.140]   and that the right relationship to that being
[01:38:36.140 --> 01:38:38.420]   is to have a correct set of beliefs.
[01:38:38.420 --> 01:38:41.540]   I reject all of those claims.
[01:38:41.540 --> 01:38:43.660]   - So both the theist and the atheist?
[01:38:43.660 --> 01:38:46.820]   - In their modern version, yes, yes.
[01:38:46.820 --> 01:38:50.540]   - In which, do you reject it in the sense
[01:38:50.540 --> 01:38:52.900]   that you don't know, or do you reject it
[01:38:52.900 --> 01:38:56.420]   in the sense that you believe
[01:38:56.420 --> 01:39:00.100]   that each one of those presuppositions
[01:39:00.100 --> 01:39:02.860]   is likely to be not true?
[01:39:02.860 --> 01:39:04.260]   - The latter.
[01:39:04.260 --> 01:39:06.340]   Both on reflection, argument,
[01:39:06.340 --> 01:39:11.340]   and personal experimentation and experience,
[01:39:11.660 --> 01:39:14.820]   I've come to the conclusion that those shared propositions
[01:39:14.820 --> 01:39:16.180]   are probably not true.
[01:39:16.180 --> 01:39:18.980]   - Which one is the most troublesome to you?
[01:39:18.980 --> 01:39:23.420]   The personal being, the kind of accumulation
[01:39:23.420 --> 01:39:27.720]   of everything into one being that ultimately created stuff?
[01:39:27.720 --> 01:39:29.780]   - So for me, there's two, and they're interlocked together.
[01:39:29.780 --> 01:39:31.480]   I'm not trying to dodge your question.
[01:39:31.480 --> 01:39:36.480]   It's that the idea that the ground of being
[01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:40.660]   is some kind of being, I think is a fundamental mistake.
[01:39:40.660 --> 01:39:42.100]   - It's void of being?
[01:39:42.100 --> 01:39:42.940]   - No, no, no.
[01:39:42.940 --> 01:39:47.060]   The ground of being is some kind of being.
[01:39:47.060 --> 01:39:47.900]   - No, no, no.
[01:39:47.900 --> 01:39:48.720]   - So it's turtles all the way down.
[01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:50.660]   - The ground of being is not itself any kind of being.
[01:39:50.660 --> 01:39:53.060]   Being is not a being.
[01:39:53.060 --> 01:39:56.660]   It is the ability for things to be,
[01:39:56.660 --> 01:39:59.060]   which is not the same thing as a being.
[01:39:59.060 --> 01:40:01.940]   - Are humans beings?
[01:40:01.940 --> 01:40:02.820]   - We are beings.
[01:40:02.820 --> 01:40:03.820]   This glass is a being.
[01:40:03.820 --> 01:40:05.700]   This table is a being.
[01:40:05.700 --> 01:40:10.580]   But when I ask you, how are they all in being,
[01:40:10.580 --> 01:40:14.100]   you don't say by being a glass, or by being a table,
[01:40:14.100 --> 01:40:15.540]   or by being a human.
[01:40:15.540 --> 01:40:18.380]   You wanna say, no, no, there's something, ah,
[01:40:18.380 --> 01:40:20.060]   underneath it all, and then you realize
[01:40:20.060 --> 01:40:21.820]   it can't be any thing.
[01:40:21.820 --> 01:40:25.140]   This is why many mystical traditions converge on the idea
[01:40:25.140 --> 01:40:29.520]   that the ground of being is no thingness,
[01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:32.060]   which is, you know, which is normally pronounced
[01:40:32.060 --> 01:40:35.140]   as nothingness, but if you put the hyphen back in,
[01:40:35.140 --> 01:40:37.960]   you get the original intent, no thingness.
[01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:42.960]   And that is bound up with, okay, what I need to do
[01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:46.180]   in order to be in relationship with,
[01:40:46.180 --> 01:40:48.500]   so it's a misconstruing of ultimate reality
[01:40:48.500 --> 01:40:53.220]   as a supreme being, which is a category mistake to my mind,
[01:40:53.220 --> 01:40:55.860]   and then my relationship to it,
[01:40:55.860 --> 01:40:58.260]   that sacredness is a function of belief,
[01:40:58.260 --> 01:41:00.420]   and I have been presenting you an argument
[01:41:00.420 --> 01:41:03.500]   through most of our discussion that meaning is
[01:41:03.500 --> 01:41:07.700]   at a deeper level than beliefs and propositions.
[01:41:07.700 --> 01:41:10.500]   And so that is a misunderstanding of sacredness,
[01:41:10.500 --> 01:41:13.240]   'cause I take sacredness to be that which is
[01:41:13.240 --> 01:41:16.740]   most meaningful and connected to what is most real.
[01:41:16.740 --> 01:41:22.820]   - And theists think of what, of sacredness as what?
[01:41:22.820 --> 01:41:27.000]   - They think of sacredness as a property
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:32.000]   of a particular being, God, and that the way
[01:41:33.340 --> 01:41:38.260]   that is meaningful to them is by asserting a set
[01:41:38.260 --> 01:41:39.980]   of propositions or beliefs.
[01:41:39.980 --> 01:41:42.500]   Now, I wanna point out that this is what I would now
[01:41:42.500 --> 01:41:45.700]   call modern or common theism.
[01:41:45.700 --> 01:41:50.500]   You go back into the classical periods of Christianity,
[01:41:50.500 --> 01:41:52.780]   you get a view that's really radically different
[01:41:52.780 --> 01:41:55.700]   from how most people understand theism today.
[01:41:55.700 --> 01:41:58.620]   - Okay, so let me, this is an interesting question
[01:41:58.620 --> 01:42:01.580]   that I usually think about in the form of mathematics,
[01:42:01.580 --> 01:42:04.860]   but so in that case, if meaning is sacred
[01:42:04.860 --> 01:42:09.860]   in your non-theist view, is meaning created
[01:42:09.860 --> 01:42:14.100]   or is it discovered?
[01:42:14.100 --> 01:42:16.980]   - So there's a Latin word that doesn't separate them
[01:42:16.980 --> 01:42:20.900]   called inventio, and I would say that,
[01:42:20.900 --> 01:42:23.980]   and before you say, oh, well, give me a chance,
[01:42:23.980 --> 01:42:25.520]   because you participate in it.
[01:42:25.520 --> 01:42:29.660]   You've experienced an insight, yes?
[01:42:29.660 --> 01:42:30.820]   Did you make it happen?
[01:42:31.820 --> 01:42:35.100]   - The insight?
[01:42:35.100 --> 01:42:38.140]   - Did you make it happen or did, did you do,
[01:42:38.140 --> 01:42:38.980]   like, can you do that?
[01:42:38.980 --> 01:42:40.780]   I'm gonna have, I needed insight.
[01:42:40.780 --> 01:42:41.980]   This is what I do to make an insight.
[01:42:41.980 --> 01:42:43.380]   - Oh, I see.
[01:42:43.380 --> 01:42:46.540]   Yeah, in some sense, it came from elsewhere.
[01:42:46.540 --> 01:42:48.860]   - Right, but you didn't just passively receive it either.
[01:42:48.860 --> 01:42:50.900]   You're engaged and involved in it.
[01:42:50.900 --> 01:42:52.260]   That's why you get, right?
[01:42:52.260 --> 01:42:54.500]   So that's what I mean by you participate in it.
[01:42:54.500 --> 01:42:55.900]   You participate in meaning.
[01:42:55.900 --> 01:42:58.500]   - So you do think that it's both?
[01:42:58.500 --> 01:42:59.340]   - Yes.
[01:42:59.340 --> 01:43:00.180]   - You do think it's both?
[01:43:00.180 --> 01:43:04.020]   - I mean, that's not a trivial thing to understand,
[01:43:04.020 --> 01:43:08.380]   'cause a lot of time we think,
[01:43:08.380 --> 01:43:11.260]   when you think about a search for meaning,
[01:43:11.260 --> 01:43:16.100]   you think it's like you're going through a big house
[01:43:16.100 --> 01:43:19.060]   and you open each door and look if it's there and so on,
[01:43:19.060 --> 01:43:21.540]   as if there is going to be a glowing orb
[01:43:21.540 --> 01:43:23.140]   that you discover. - Yes, yeah.
[01:43:23.140 --> 01:43:28.620]   - But at the same time, I'm somebody that,
[01:43:29.620 --> 01:43:33.340]   based on the chemistry of my brain,
[01:43:33.340 --> 01:43:34.900]   have been extremely fortunate
[01:43:34.900 --> 01:43:37.380]   to be able to discover beauty in everything,
[01:43:37.380 --> 01:43:40.540]   in the most mundane and boring of things.
[01:43:40.540 --> 01:43:44.380]   I am, as David Foster Wallace said, unboreable.
[01:43:44.380 --> 01:43:49.020]   I could just sit in a room,
[01:43:49.020 --> 01:43:51.100]   just like playing with a tennis ball or something
[01:43:51.100 --> 01:43:56.100]   and be excited, basically like a dog, I think, endlessly.
[01:43:56.580 --> 01:44:01.580]   So to me, meaning is created,
[01:44:01.580 --> 01:44:05.300]   because I could create meaning out of everything.
[01:44:05.300 --> 01:44:08.540]   But of course, it doesn't require a partner.
[01:44:08.540 --> 01:44:12.300]   It does require dance partners, whatever.
[01:44:12.300 --> 01:44:13.860]   It does require the tennis ball.
[01:44:13.860 --> 01:44:16.260]   But honestly, that's what a lot of people
[01:44:16.260 --> 01:44:18.620]   that I don't necessarily, and we'll talk about it,
[01:44:18.620 --> 01:44:20.380]   I don't practice meditation,
[01:44:20.380 --> 01:44:22.980]   but people who meditate very seriously,
[01:44:22.980 --> 01:44:27.340]   like the entire days for months kind of thing,
[01:44:27.340 --> 01:44:30.740]   they talk about being able to discover meaning
[01:44:30.740 --> 01:44:34.220]   in just the wind or something.
[01:44:34.220 --> 01:44:36.940]   The breath and everything,
[01:44:36.940 --> 01:44:41.940]   just subtle sensory experiences give you deep fulfillment.
[01:44:41.940 --> 01:44:47.860]   So that's, again, it's interaction.
[01:44:47.860 --> 01:44:48.780]   Actually, I do want to say,
[01:44:48.780 --> 01:44:53.020]   because the interesting difference that you've drawn
[01:44:53.020 --> 01:44:56.220]   between non-theism, theism, and atheism,
[01:44:56.220 --> 01:45:00.140]   where's the agreement or disagreement
[01:45:00.140 --> 01:45:01.820]   between you and Jordan Peterson on this?
[01:45:01.820 --> 01:45:03.620]   I just talked to Jordan about this.
[01:45:03.620 --> 01:45:04.780]   (Luke laughs)
[01:45:04.780 --> 01:45:06.500]   Because you're very clear.
[01:45:06.500 --> 01:45:09.220]   It's kind of beautiful in the clarity
[01:45:09.220 --> 01:45:10.620]   in which you lay this out.
[01:45:10.620 --> 01:45:13.140]   I wonder if Jordan has arrived
[01:45:13.140 --> 01:45:15.260]   at a similar kind of clarity.
[01:45:15.260 --> 01:45:18.020]   Have you been able to draw any kind of lines
[01:45:18.020 --> 01:45:22.100]   between the way the two of you see religion?
[01:45:22.100 --> 01:45:24.700]   - Yeah, so there was a video released,
[01:45:24.700 --> 01:45:26.420]   I think like two or three weeks ago,
[01:45:26.420 --> 01:45:29.580]   with Jordan and myself and Jonathan Pageot.
[01:45:29.580 --> 01:45:30.820]   - Ooh, I haven't watched that one yet, yeah.
[01:45:30.820 --> 01:45:33.060]   - And it's around this question, Lex.
[01:45:33.060 --> 01:45:35.060]   He's basically sort of making,
[01:45:35.060 --> 01:45:39.380]   he's putting together an argument for God.
[01:45:39.380 --> 01:45:40.660]   I mean, I think that's a fair way.
[01:45:40.660 --> 01:45:42.940]   I don't think he would object to me saying that.
[01:45:44.300 --> 01:45:46.820]   And Jonathan Pageot is also a,
[01:45:46.820 --> 01:45:49.380]   well, Jonathan is a Christian.
[01:45:49.380 --> 01:45:51.260]   It's unclear what Jordan is.
[01:45:51.260 --> 01:45:54.580]   - And Jonathan's work is on symbolism
[01:45:54.580 --> 01:45:57.020]   and different mythologies and Christianity.
[01:45:57.020 --> 01:45:59.500]   - Yes, especially Neoplatonic Christianity,
[01:45:59.500 --> 01:46:00.740]   which is very important.
[01:46:00.740 --> 01:46:02.820]   I have a lot of respect,
[01:46:02.820 --> 01:46:04.300]   well, I have a lot of respect for both of them,
[01:46:04.300 --> 01:46:05.860]   but I have a lot of respect for Jonathan.
[01:46:05.860 --> 01:46:10.060]   But in my participation in that dialogue,
[01:46:10.060 --> 01:46:14.180]   you could see me, well, repeatedly,
[01:46:14.180 --> 01:46:16.820]   but I think everybody, including Jordan,
[01:46:16.820 --> 01:46:19.260]   thought constructively challenging
[01:46:19.260 --> 01:46:21.180]   sort of the attempt to build a theistic model,
[01:46:21.180 --> 01:46:23.900]   and I was challenging it from a non-theistic perspective.
[01:46:23.900 --> 01:46:25.660]   So I think we don't
[01:46:25.660 --> 01:46:32.260]   agree on certain sets of propositions,
[01:46:32.260 --> 01:46:34.740]   but there was a lot of,
[01:46:34.740 --> 01:46:37.180]   there was also a lot of acknowledgement,
[01:46:37.180 --> 01:46:39.820]   and I think genuine appreciation on his part,
[01:46:39.820 --> 01:46:42.940]   and Jonathan's part of the arguments I was making.
[01:46:42.940 --> 01:46:47.020]   - So they believe in maybe the presupposition
[01:46:47.020 --> 01:46:48.660]   of like a supreme being.
[01:46:48.660 --> 01:46:51.740]   Not believe, but the, not believe,
[01:46:51.740 --> 01:46:55.620]   but they see the power of that particular presupposition
[01:46:55.620 --> 01:46:58.220]   in being a source of meaning.
[01:46:58.220 --> 01:47:01.340]   - I think that's relatively clear for me with Jordan.
[01:47:01.340 --> 01:47:02.500]   Jordan's a really complex guy,
[01:47:02.500 --> 01:47:05.260]   so it's very hard to just pin.
[01:47:05.260 --> 01:47:09.100]   To my best sort of understanding, yes.
[01:47:09.100 --> 01:47:11.980]   I think that's clearly the case for Jordan.
[01:47:11.980 --> 01:47:14.020]   It's not the case for Jonathan.
[01:47:14.020 --> 01:47:16.060]   Jonathan is, remember I said,
[01:47:16.060 --> 01:47:18.340]   I was talking about modern atheism and theism.
[01:47:18.340 --> 01:47:23.340]   Jonathan is a guy who somehow went into icon carving
[01:47:23.340 --> 01:47:27.780]   and Maximus the Confessor and Eastern Orthodoxy,
[01:47:27.780 --> 01:47:29.420]   and has come out of it, the other end,
[01:47:29.420 --> 01:47:31.580]   as a fifth century church father
[01:47:31.580 --> 01:47:35.100]   that is nevertheless being, rightfully so,
[01:47:35.100 --> 01:47:38.340]   found to be increasingly relevant to many people.
[01:47:38.340 --> 01:47:40.340]   I think-- - So he's deeply old school.
[01:47:40.340 --> 01:47:42.780]   - Yeah, I think he has, he and I,
[01:47:42.780 --> 01:47:44.500]   especially because Neoplatonism
[01:47:44.500 --> 01:47:47.780]   is a non-theistic philosophical spirituality,
[01:47:47.780 --> 01:47:49.780]   and it's a big part of Eastern Orthodoxy.
[01:47:49.780 --> 01:47:53.420]   He and I, I think, he would say things like,
[01:47:53.420 --> 01:47:55.660]   "God doesn't exist."
[01:47:55.660 --> 01:47:57.260]   What, you're a Christian, right?
[01:47:57.260 --> 01:47:59.860]   And then, and he's being coy, but he'll say,
[01:47:59.860 --> 01:48:02.220]   "Well, God doesn't exist the way the cup exists
[01:48:02.220 --> 01:48:03.660]   "or the table exists."
[01:48:03.660 --> 01:48:06.020]   The same kind of move I was making a few minutes ago.
[01:48:06.020 --> 01:48:08.140]   He'll say things like that.
[01:48:08.140 --> 01:48:10.820]   I think he will emphasize the no-thingness
[01:48:10.820 --> 01:48:13.940]   of ultimate reality, the no-thingness of God,
[01:48:13.940 --> 01:48:18.860]   because he's from that version of Christianity,
[01:48:18.860 --> 01:48:21.620]   what you might call classical theism.
[01:48:21.620 --> 01:48:24.740]   But classical theism looks a lot more like non-theism
[01:48:24.740 --> 01:48:26.980]   than it looks like modern theism.
[01:48:26.980 --> 01:48:28.180]   - That's so interesting.
[01:48:28.180 --> 01:48:30.740]   Yeah, that's really interesting.
[01:48:30.740 --> 01:48:33.780]   What about, is there a line to be drawn
[01:48:33.780 --> 01:48:38.740]   between myth and religion in terms of its usefulness
[01:48:38.740 --> 01:48:42.020]   in man's search for meaning?
[01:48:42.020 --> 01:48:44.740]   - So here's where Jordan and I are in much more,
[01:48:44.740 --> 01:48:47.440]   actually all three of us are in significant agreement.
[01:48:47.440 --> 01:48:51.780]   I said this in my series, but I wanna say it again here.
[01:48:51.780 --> 01:48:55.660]   Myths aren't stories about things that happened
[01:48:55.660 --> 01:48:58.260]   in the deep past that are largely irrelevant.
[01:48:58.260 --> 01:49:03.100]   Myths are stories about perennial or pertinent patterns
[01:49:03.100 --> 01:49:05.540]   that need to be brought into awareness.
[01:49:05.540 --> 01:49:07.580]   And they need to be brought into an awareness
[01:49:07.580 --> 01:49:11.740]   not just or primarily at the propositional level,
[01:49:11.740 --> 01:49:13.940]   but at those non-propositional levels.
[01:49:13.940 --> 01:49:16.860]   And I think that is what good mythos does.
[01:49:16.860 --> 01:49:18.780]   I prefer to use the Greek word
[01:49:18.780 --> 01:49:20.940]   because we've now turned the English word
[01:49:20.940 --> 01:49:25.540]   into a synonym for a widely believed falsehood.
[01:49:25.540 --> 01:49:27.980]   And I don't think, again, if you go back
[01:49:27.980 --> 01:49:31.140]   even to the church fathers, I'm not a Christian,
[01:49:31.140 --> 01:49:32.980]   I'm not advocating for Christianity, right?
[01:49:32.980 --> 01:49:36.620]   But neither am I here to attack it, right?
[01:49:36.620 --> 01:49:40.220]   But when they talk about reading these stories,
[01:49:40.220 --> 01:49:45.460]   they think the literal interpretation is the weakest
[01:49:45.460 --> 01:49:47.060]   and the least important.
[01:49:47.060 --> 01:49:50.380]   You move to the allegorical or the symbolic,
[01:49:50.380 --> 01:49:53.980]   to the moral, to the spiritual, the mystical,
[01:49:53.980 --> 01:49:56.240]   and that's where, right?
[01:49:56.240 --> 01:49:58.000]   So they would say to you,
[01:50:00.060 --> 01:50:05.060]   but how is the story of Adam and Eve true for you now?
[01:50:05.060 --> 01:50:06.060]   And I don't mean true for you
[01:50:06.060 --> 01:50:07.940]   in that relativistic sense, I mean,
[01:50:07.940 --> 01:50:12.060]   how is it pointing to a pattern in your life right now?
[01:50:12.060 --> 01:50:14.080]   - So there is some sense in which the telling
[01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:19.080]   of this mythos becomes real in connecting to the patterns
[01:50:19.080 --> 01:50:23.980]   that kind of captivate the public today.
[01:50:23.980 --> 01:50:25.020]   - Sure, so for--
[01:50:25.020 --> 01:50:26.700]   - So you just keep telling the story.
[01:50:26.700 --> 01:50:29.460]   I mean, there's something about some of these stories
[01:50:29.460 --> 01:50:31.700]   that are just really good at being sticky
[01:50:31.700 --> 01:50:35.260]   to the patterns of each generation.
[01:50:35.260 --> 01:50:37.800]   And they'll stick to different patterns throughout time.
[01:50:37.800 --> 01:50:41.380]   They're just sticky in powerful ways.
[01:50:41.380 --> 01:50:44.820]   - Yes, and so we keep returning back to them
[01:50:44.820 --> 01:50:46.420]   again and again and again.
[01:50:46.420 --> 01:50:51.420]   And it's important to see that some of these stories
[01:50:51.420 --> 01:50:58.220]   are recursive, they're myths about one particular set
[01:50:58.220 --> 01:51:01.620]   of patterns, they're myths about, right,
[01:51:01.620 --> 01:51:04.220]   not just the important pattern.
[01:51:04.220 --> 01:51:08.900]   Like you get the Jordan stuff about there's heroes
[01:51:08.900 --> 01:51:13.380]   and myths are trying to make us understand
[01:51:13.380 --> 01:51:16.700]   the need for being heroic in our own lives.
[01:51:16.700 --> 01:51:18.780]   One of the things I like to put in counterbalance
[01:51:18.780 --> 01:51:22.040]   to that is the Greek also have myths of hubris, right?
[01:51:22.040 --> 01:51:25.440]   That counterbalance the heroic, right?
[01:51:25.440 --> 01:51:30.440]   But then there are myths that are not about
[01:51:30.440 --> 01:51:33.540]   those deeply important patterns,
[01:51:33.540 --> 01:51:37.660]   but they're myths about religio itself,
[01:51:37.660 --> 01:51:40.820]   that the way we're, religio means to bind, to connect,
[01:51:40.820 --> 01:51:43.160]   the way relevance realization connects us.
[01:51:43.160 --> 01:51:45.500]   And so the point of the myth is not notice that pattern
[01:51:45.500 --> 01:51:47.660]   or notice that pattern and notice that pattern.
[01:51:47.660 --> 01:51:52.660]   It's notice how all of these patterns are emerging
[01:51:54.540 --> 01:51:57.280]   and what does that say about us and reality.
[01:51:57.280 --> 01:52:02.180]   And those myths, those myths, I think,
[01:52:02.180 --> 01:52:04.480]   are genuinely profound.
[01:52:04.480 --> 01:52:08.520]   - And how much of the myths, how much of the power
[01:52:08.520 --> 01:52:10.680]   of those myths is about the dialogues?
[01:52:10.680 --> 01:52:12.400]   You talk about this quite a bit,
[01:52:12.400 --> 01:52:14.080]   I think in the first conversation with Jordan,
[01:52:14.080 --> 01:52:17.560]   you guys, I'm not sure you've gotten really into it,
[01:52:17.560 --> 01:52:20.040]   you scratched the surface a little bit,
[01:52:20.040 --> 01:52:21.960]   but the role of, as you say,
[01:52:21.960 --> 01:52:24.600]   dialogue in distributed cognition.
[01:52:24.600 --> 01:52:25.440]   - Yes.
[01:52:25.440 --> 01:52:26.260]   - What is that?
[01:52:26.260 --> 01:52:27.340]   The thing we're doing right now,
[01:52:27.340 --> 01:52:31.380]   talking with our mouth holes, what is that?
[01:52:31.380 --> 01:52:33.800]   And actually, can I ask you this question?
[01:52:33.800 --> 01:52:34.740]   - Yep.
[01:52:34.740 --> 01:52:38.820]   - If aliens came to Earth and were observing humans,
[01:52:38.820 --> 01:52:44.660]   would they notice our distributed cognition first
[01:52:44.660 --> 01:52:47.460]   or our individual cognition first?
[01:52:47.460 --> 01:52:50.860]   What is the most notable thing about us humans?
[01:52:50.860 --> 01:52:53.060]   Is it our ability to individually do well
[01:52:53.060 --> 01:52:54.780]   in IQ tests or whatever?
[01:52:54.780 --> 01:52:55.780]   - Yeah.
[01:52:55.780 --> 01:52:59.660]   - Or puzzle solve, or is it this thing we're doing together?
[01:52:59.660 --> 01:53:01.260]   - I think most of our problem solving
[01:53:01.260 --> 01:53:03.380]   is done in distributed cognition.
[01:53:03.380 --> 01:53:07.820]   Like, look around, you didn't make this equipment,
[01:53:07.820 --> 01:53:09.820]   you didn't build this place, you didn't invent this language
[01:53:09.820 --> 01:53:12.540]   that we're both sharing, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:53:12.540 --> 01:53:15.500]   And now there's more specific and precise
[01:53:15.500 --> 01:53:17.240]   experimental evidence coming out.
[01:53:19.100 --> 01:53:22.820]   Let's take a standard task that people,
[01:53:22.820 --> 01:53:25.100]   reasoning task, I won't even do the details,
[01:53:25.100 --> 01:53:27.300]   it's called the Weissen Selection Task,
[01:53:27.300 --> 01:53:30.580]   and you give it to people, highly educated,
[01:53:30.580 --> 01:53:34.860]   psychology students, premier universities across the world.
[01:53:34.860 --> 01:53:36.300]   We've been doing it since the '60s,
[01:53:36.300 --> 01:53:38.820]   it replicates and replicates,
[01:53:38.820 --> 01:53:40.860]   and only 10% of the people get it right.
[01:53:40.860 --> 01:53:45.700]   You put them in a group of four,
[01:53:45.700 --> 01:53:48.340]   and you allow them to talk to each other,
[01:53:48.340 --> 01:53:50.900]   the success rate goes to 80%.
[01:53:50.900 --> 01:53:53.980]   That's just one example of a phenomenon
[01:53:53.980 --> 01:53:55.860]   that's coming to the fore.
[01:53:55.860 --> 01:53:57.540]   - By the way, do you know if a similar experiment
[01:53:57.540 --> 01:53:59.740]   has been done on a group of engineering students
[01:53:59.740 --> 01:54:01.100]   versus psychology students?
[01:54:01.100 --> 01:54:04.540]   Is there a major group difference in IQ between those two?
[01:54:04.540 --> 01:54:07.140]   Just kidding. (laughing)
[01:54:07.140 --> 01:54:08.540]   Let's move on.
[01:54:08.540 --> 01:54:10.460]   All right, so there is a lot of evidence
[01:54:10.460 --> 01:54:12.780]   that there's power to this distributed cognition.
[01:54:12.780 --> 01:54:15.860]   Now what about this mechanism, this fascinating mechanism
[01:54:15.860 --> 01:54:18.180]   of the ants interacting with each other?
[01:54:18.180 --> 01:54:19.260]   The dialogue.
[01:54:19.260 --> 01:54:21.820]   - Yeah, I use the word discourse or dialogue
[01:54:21.820 --> 01:54:23.740]   for just people having a conversation.
[01:54:23.740 --> 01:54:29.740]   But, and this is deeply inspired by Socrates and Plato,
[01:54:29.740 --> 01:54:32.180]   especially the platonic dialogues.
[01:54:32.180 --> 01:54:34.980]   And I'm sure we've all had this,
[01:54:34.980 --> 01:54:35.940]   and so give me a moment,
[01:54:35.940 --> 01:54:37.820]   'cause I wanna build onto something here.
[01:54:37.820 --> 01:54:39.740]   We've participated in conversations
[01:54:39.740 --> 01:54:42.960]   that took on a life of their own,
[01:54:42.960 --> 01:54:46.340]   and took us both in directions we did not anticipate,
[01:54:46.340 --> 01:54:49.180]   afforded us insights that we could not have had on our own.
[01:54:49.180 --> 01:54:51.420]   And we don't have to have come to an agreement,
[01:54:51.420 --> 01:54:54.940]   but we were both moved, and we were both drawn into insight,
[01:54:54.940 --> 01:54:56.340]   and we feel like, wow,
[01:54:56.340 --> 01:54:58.900]   that was one of the best moments of my life,
[01:54:58.900 --> 01:55:03.900]   because we feel how that introduced us to a capacity
[01:55:03.900 --> 01:55:09.060]   for tapping into a flow state within distributed cognition
[01:55:09.060 --> 01:55:13.620]   that puts us into a deeper relationship with ourselves,
[01:55:13.620 --> 01:55:16.940]   with another person, and potentially with the world.
[01:55:16.940 --> 01:55:19.100]   That's what I mean by dialogos.
[01:55:19.100 --> 01:55:24.100]   And so for me, I think dialogos is more important.
[01:55:24.100 --> 01:55:29.740]   Huh, boy, I could just hear,
[01:55:29.740 --> 01:55:31.380]   I'm sorry, I can hear Jordan and Jonathan
[01:55:31.380 --> 01:55:32.620]   in my head right now.
[01:55:32.620 --> 01:55:33.460]   But I think it's more--
[01:55:33.460 --> 01:55:35.260]   - I hear them all the time.
[01:55:35.260 --> 01:55:38.680]   I just wish they would shut up in my head sometimes.
[01:55:38.680 --> 01:55:41.940]   So what are they saying to you in your head?
[01:55:41.940 --> 01:55:43.220]   - What they're saying, well,
[01:55:43.220 --> 01:55:45.980]   see, that's what the most recent conversation was about.
[01:55:45.980 --> 01:55:50.980]   I was trying to say that I don't think mythos is,
[01:55:50.980 --> 01:55:54.240]   I think mythos is really important.
[01:55:54.240 --> 01:55:58.820]   I think these kinds of narratives are really important.
[01:55:58.820 --> 01:56:02.660]   But I think this ability to connect together
[01:56:02.660 --> 01:56:06.420]   in distributed cognition, collective intelligence,
[01:56:06.420 --> 01:56:10.300]   and cultivate a shared flow state
[01:56:10.300 --> 01:56:11.580]   within that collective intelligence,
[01:56:11.580 --> 01:56:13.380]   so it starts to ramp up, perhaps,
[01:56:13.380 --> 01:56:17.380]   towards collective wisdom, I think that's more important,
[01:56:17.380 --> 01:56:19.580]   because I think that's the basin
[01:56:19.580 --> 01:56:22.020]   within which the myths and the rituals
[01:56:22.020 --> 01:56:24.560]   are ultimately created and when they function.
[01:56:24.560 --> 01:56:28.120]   Like, a myth is like a public dream.
[01:56:28.120 --> 01:56:30.380]   It depends on distributed cognition,
[01:56:30.380 --> 01:56:32.780]   and it depends on people enacting it
[01:56:32.780 --> 01:56:35.080]   and getting into mutual flow states.
[01:56:35.080 --> 01:56:38.700]   - So the highest form of dialogos,
[01:56:38.700 --> 01:56:41.740]   of conversation is this flow state,
[01:56:41.740 --> 01:56:46.660]   and that it forms the foundation for myth-building.
[01:56:46.660 --> 01:56:48.700]   - I think so, I think so.
[01:56:48.700 --> 01:56:51.020]   So that communitas, that's Victor Turner's phrase,
[01:56:51.020 --> 01:56:53.460]   and he specifically linked it to flow,
[01:56:53.460 --> 01:56:55.300]   and I study flow scientifically,
[01:56:55.300 --> 01:56:58.820]   that that, within distributed cognition,
[01:56:58.820 --> 01:57:03.820]   as the home, as the generator of mythos and ritual,
[01:57:03.820 --> 01:57:06.720]   and those are bound together as well,
[01:57:06.720 --> 01:57:08.740]   I think that's fundamentally correct.
[01:57:08.740 --> 01:57:10.500]   - You know what's the cool thing here?
[01:57:10.500 --> 01:57:13.620]   Because I'm a huge fan of podcasts and audio books,
[01:57:13.620 --> 01:57:16.660]   but a podcast in particular is relevant here,
[01:57:16.660 --> 01:57:20.180]   is there's a third person in this room listening now,
[01:57:20.180 --> 01:57:23.420]   and they're also in the flow state.
[01:57:23.420 --> 01:57:25.180]   - Yes, yes.
[01:57:25.180 --> 01:57:28.780]   - Like, I'm close friends with a lot of podcasters,
[01:57:28.780 --> 01:57:31.700]   they don't know I exist, I just listen to them,
[01:57:31.700 --> 01:57:33.820]   'cause I've been in so many flow states with them.
[01:57:33.820 --> 01:57:36.580]   'Cause I was like, yes, yes, this is good.
[01:57:36.580 --> 01:57:37.960]   But they don't know I exist,
[01:57:37.960 --> 01:57:40.260]   but they are in conversation with me, ultimately.
[01:57:40.260 --> 01:57:42.980]   - And think, Lex, of what that's doing.
[01:57:42.980 --> 01:57:46.120]   You've got dialogues, and then you've got this meta-dialogue
[01:57:46.120 --> 01:57:47.100]   like you're describing.
[01:57:47.100 --> 01:57:51.500]   And think about how things like podcasts and YouTube,
[01:57:51.500 --> 01:57:54.140]   they break down old boundaries
[01:57:54.140 --> 01:57:56.120]   between the private and the public,
[01:57:56.120 --> 01:57:58.180]   between writing and oral speech.
[01:57:58.180 --> 01:58:01.380]   So we have the dynamics of living oral speech,
[01:58:01.380 --> 01:58:03.740]   but it has the permanency of writing.
[01:58:03.740 --> 01:58:08.740]   Like, we're in the midst of creating a vehicle, right,
[01:58:08.740 --> 01:58:12.300]   and a medium for distributed cognition
[01:58:12.300 --> 01:58:16.040]   that breaks down a lot of the categories
[01:58:16.040 --> 01:58:18.140]   by which we organized our cognition.
[01:58:18.140 --> 01:58:20.540]   - I mean, because of the tools of YouTube and so on,
[01:58:20.540 --> 01:58:24.480]   just the network, the graph of how quickly
[01:58:24.480 --> 01:58:27.460]   the distributed cognition can spread is really powerful.
[01:58:27.460 --> 01:58:29.060]   And just a huge amount of people
[01:58:29.060 --> 01:58:30.620]   have listened to your lectures.
[01:58:30.620 --> 01:58:31.820]   I've listened to your lectures,
[01:58:31.820 --> 01:58:36.060]   but I've experienced them, at least in your style,
[01:58:36.060 --> 01:58:38.180]   there's something about your style,
[01:58:38.180 --> 01:58:40.540]   it felt like a conversation.
[01:58:40.540 --> 01:58:42.220]   Like, it felt like at any moment
[01:58:42.220 --> 01:58:44.580]   I could interrupt you and say something.
[01:58:44.580 --> 01:58:46.180]   And I was just listening.
[01:58:46.180 --> 01:58:47.220]   - Thank you for saying that,
[01:58:47.220 --> 01:58:52.220]   because I aspire to being genuinely as Socratic as I can
[01:58:52.220 --> 01:58:54.260]   when I'm doing this.
[01:58:54.260 --> 01:58:55.420]   - Yeah, there was that sense, actually,
[01:58:55.420 --> 01:58:56.780]   as I'm saying it now.
[01:58:56.780 --> 01:58:57.740]   Why was that?
[01:58:57.740 --> 01:59:00.300]   It didn't feel like, sometimes lectures are kinda,
[01:59:01.300 --> 01:59:04.260]   you know, you come down with the commandments
[01:59:04.260 --> 01:59:05.780]   and you just want to listen.
[01:59:05.780 --> 01:59:07.180]   But there was a sense, like,
[01:59:07.180 --> 01:59:09.180]   I mean, I think it was the excitement that you have.
[01:59:09.180 --> 01:59:10.260]   Like, you have to understand.
[01:59:10.260 --> 01:59:14.060]   And also the fact that you were kind of, I think,
[01:59:14.060 --> 01:59:16.500]   thinking off the top of your head sometimes.
[01:59:16.500 --> 01:59:19.860]   There was a, you were interrupting yourself with thoughts.
[01:59:19.860 --> 01:59:20.980]   You were playing with thoughts.
[01:59:20.980 --> 01:59:23.420]   Like, you're reasoning through things often.
[01:59:23.420 --> 01:59:26.820]   Like, you had, you referenced a lot of books,
[01:59:26.820 --> 01:59:30.060]   so surely you were extremely well-prepared
[01:59:30.060 --> 01:59:31.660]   and you were referencing a lot of ideas,
[01:59:31.660 --> 01:59:32.820]   but then you were also struggling
[01:59:32.820 --> 01:59:34.180]   in the way to present those ideas.
[01:59:34.180 --> 01:59:36.660]   - Yes, there was, and so the jazz.
[01:59:36.660 --> 01:59:37.500]   - The jazz, all right, yeah.
[01:59:37.500 --> 01:59:39.740]   - The jazz and getting into the flow state
[01:59:39.740 --> 01:59:43.860]   and trying to share in a participatory
[01:59:43.860 --> 01:59:47.060]   and perspectival fashion the learning with the people
[01:59:47.060 --> 01:59:49.560]   rather than just pronouncing at them, yes.
[01:59:49.560 --> 01:59:51.580]   - What's mindfulness?
[01:59:51.580 --> 01:59:55.180]   - So, published on that as well.
[01:59:55.180 --> 01:59:56.060]   And I practice.
[01:59:56.060 --> 01:59:58.540]   I've been practicing many forms of mindfulness
[01:59:58.540 --> 02:00:01.460]   and ecology of practices since 1991.
[02:00:01.460 --> 02:00:04.340]   So I both have practitioner's knowledge
[02:00:04.340 --> 02:00:05.780]   and I also study it scientifically.
[02:00:05.780 --> 02:00:09.280]   I think, I'm pretty sure I was the first person
[02:00:09.280 --> 02:00:11.820]   to academically talk about mindfulness
[02:00:11.820 --> 02:00:14.580]   at the University of Toronto within a classroom setting,
[02:00:14.580 --> 02:00:15.780]   like lecturing on it.
[02:00:15.780 --> 02:00:18.460]   - So this is a topic that a lot of people
[02:00:18.460 --> 02:00:21.900]   have recently become very interested in, think about.
[02:00:21.900 --> 02:00:25.160]   So from that, from the early days,
[02:00:25.160 --> 02:00:27.420]   how do you think about what it is?
[02:00:27.420 --> 02:00:30.140]   I've critiqued the sort of standard definitions,
[02:00:30.140 --> 02:00:33.420]   being aware of the present moment without judgment,
[02:00:33.420 --> 02:00:35.560]   'cause I think they're flawed.
[02:00:35.560 --> 02:00:38.580]   And if you wanna get into the detail of why, we can,
[02:00:38.580 --> 02:00:41.140]   but this is how I wanna explain it to you.
[02:00:41.140 --> 02:00:44.380]   And it also points to the fact of why you need
[02:00:44.380 --> 02:00:46.660]   an ecology of mindfulness practices.
[02:00:46.660 --> 02:00:49.380]   You shouldn't equate mindfulness with meditation.
[02:00:49.380 --> 02:00:50.660]   I think that's a primary mistake.
[02:00:50.660 --> 02:00:52.700]   - When you say ecology, what do you mean, by the way?
[02:00:52.700 --> 02:00:55.540]   So lots of many different variants?
[02:00:55.540 --> 02:00:56.860]   - No, so what I mean by an ecology
[02:00:56.860 --> 02:00:58.340]   is exactly what you have in an ecology.
[02:00:58.340 --> 02:01:00.380]   You have a dynamical system in which there are checks
[02:01:00.380 --> 02:01:02.700]   and balances on each other, right?
[02:01:02.700 --> 02:01:05.820]   And I'll get to that with this about mindfulness.
[02:01:05.820 --> 02:01:08.260]   So I'll make that connection if you allow me.
[02:01:08.260 --> 02:01:09.660]   So we're always framing.
[02:01:09.660 --> 02:01:11.300]   We've been talking about that, right?
[02:01:11.300 --> 02:01:14.260]   And for those of you who are not on YouTube,
[02:01:14.260 --> 02:01:16.320]   this podcast, I wear glasses,
[02:01:16.320 --> 02:01:19.500]   and I'm now sort of putting my fingers and thumb
[02:01:19.500 --> 02:01:21.900]   around the frames of my glasses.
[02:01:21.900 --> 02:01:23.300]   So this is my frame.
[02:01:23.780 --> 02:01:26.660]   And my lenses, right, and that frame,
[02:01:26.660 --> 02:01:30.420]   the frame holds a lens, and I'm seeing through it
[02:01:30.420 --> 02:01:33.660]   in both senses, beyond and by means of it.
[02:01:33.660 --> 02:01:36.260]   So right now, my glasses are transparent to me.
[02:01:36.260 --> 02:01:38.660]   I wanna use that as a strong analogy
[02:01:38.660 --> 02:01:41.000]   for my mental framing, okay?
[02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.760]   Now, this is what you do in meditation, I would argue.
[02:01:43.760 --> 02:01:48.060]   You step back from looking through your frame,
[02:01:48.060 --> 02:01:48.900]   and you look at it.
[02:01:48.900 --> 02:01:50.740]   I'm taking my glasses off right now,
[02:01:50.740 --> 02:01:51.580]   and I'm looking at them.
[02:01:51.580 --> 02:01:52.900]   Why might I do that?
[02:01:52.900 --> 02:01:55.760]   To see if there's something in the lenses
[02:01:55.760 --> 02:01:57.500]   that is distorting.
[02:01:57.500 --> 02:01:58.340]   - Right.
[02:01:58.340 --> 02:01:59.460]   - Causing me to, right?
[02:01:59.460 --> 02:02:02.820]   Now, if I just did that, that could be helpful.
[02:02:02.820 --> 02:02:06.620]   But how do I know if I've actually corrected
[02:02:06.620 --> 02:02:08.860]   the change I made to my lenses?
[02:02:08.860 --> 02:02:09.780]   What do I need to do?
[02:02:09.780 --> 02:02:13.220]   I need to put my glasses on and see if I can now
[02:02:13.220 --> 02:02:16.620]   see more clearly and deeply than I could before.
[02:02:16.620 --> 02:02:20.540]   Meditation is this, stepping back and looking at.
[02:02:20.540 --> 02:02:24.260]   Contemplation is that looking through,
[02:02:24.260 --> 02:02:25.900]   and there are different kinds of practices.
[02:02:25.900 --> 02:02:28.900]   The fact that we treat them as synonyms is a deep mistake.
[02:02:28.900 --> 02:02:31.500]   The word contemplation has temple in it, in Latin.
[02:02:31.500 --> 02:02:34.580]   Contemplatio means to look up to the sky.
[02:02:34.580 --> 02:02:37.740]   It's a translation of the Greek word theoria,
[02:02:37.740 --> 02:02:39.140]   which we get our word theory from.
[02:02:39.140 --> 02:02:41.300]   It's to look deeply into things.
[02:02:41.300 --> 02:02:45.940]   Meditation is more about having to do with reflecting upon,
[02:02:45.940 --> 02:02:47.940]   standing back and looking at.
[02:02:47.940 --> 02:02:50.500]   Mindfulness includes both.
[02:02:50.500 --> 02:02:53.100]   It includes your ability to break away
[02:02:53.100 --> 02:02:54.660]   from an inappropriate frame
[02:02:54.660 --> 02:02:58.820]   and the ability to make a new frame.
[02:02:58.820 --> 02:03:00.740]   That's what actually happens in insight.
[02:03:00.740 --> 02:03:04.020]   You have to both break an inappropriate frame
[02:03:04.020 --> 02:03:07.980]   and make, see, realize a new frame.
[02:03:07.980 --> 02:03:10.020]   This is why mindfulness enhances insight,
[02:03:10.020 --> 02:03:11.700]   both ways, by the way.
[02:03:11.700 --> 02:03:15.980]   Meditative practices and also contemplative practices.
[02:03:17.100 --> 02:03:21.020]   So mindfulness is frame awareness
[02:03:21.020 --> 02:03:25.820]   that can be appropriated in order to improve your capacities
[02:03:25.820 --> 02:03:28.260]   for insight and self-regulation.
[02:03:28.260 --> 02:03:31.940]   - Now, I am inexperienced with meditation,
[02:03:31.940 --> 02:03:36.220]   sort of the rigorous practice and the science of meditation,
[02:03:36.220 --> 02:03:39.220]   but I've talked to people who
[02:03:39.220 --> 02:03:43.620]   seriously, as a science study, psychedelics,
[02:03:43.620 --> 02:03:47.140]   and they often talk about the really important thing
[02:03:47.140 --> 02:03:49.780]   is the sort of the integration back,
[02:03:49.780 --> 02:03:51.980]   so the contemplation step.
[02:03:51.980 --> 02:03:54.540]   So if you, it's not just the actual things
[02:03:54.540 --> 02:03:57.100]   you see on psychedelics or the actual journey
[02:03:57.100 --> 02:03:59.540]   of where your mind goes on psychedelics.
[02:03:59.540 --> 02:04:04.020]   It's also the integrating that into the new perspective
[02:04:04.020 --> 02:04:05.860]   that you take on life, right?
[02:04:05.860 --> 02:04:06.700]   - Exactly.
[02:04:06.700 --> 02:04:08.180]   - You really nicely described.
[02:04:08.180 --> 02:04:10.500]   So meditation is the, in that metaphor,
[02:04:10.980 --> 02:04:14.100]   is the psychedelic journey to a different mind state,
[02:04:14.100 --> 02:04:17.540]   and then contemplation is the return back to reality,
[02:04:17.540 --> 02:04:20.900]   how you integrate that into a new worldview.
[02:04:20.900 --> 02:04:23.140]   And mindfulness is the whole process, those things together.
[02:04:23.140 --> 02:04:27.220]   - Right, so if you just did contemplation,
[02:04:27.220 --> 02:04:30.740]   you could suffer from inflation and projective fantasy.
[02:04:30.740 --> 02:04:34.380]   If you just do meditation, you can suffer from withdrawal,
[02:04:34.380 --> 02:04:36.820]   spiritual bypassing, avoiding reality.
[02:04:36.820 --> 02:04:39.180]   They act, they need each other.
[02:04:39.180 --> 02:04:40.660]   You have to cycle between them.
[02:04:40.660 --> 02:04:42.460]   It's like what I talked about earlier
[02:04:42.460 --> 02:04:44.940]   when I talked about the opponent processing
[02:04:44.940 --> 02:04:46.940]   within the autonomic nervous system
[02:04:46.940 --> 02:04:49.300]   or the opponent processing at work and attention.
[02:04:49.300 --> 02:04:52.580]   And that's what I mean by an ecology of practices.
[02:04:52.580 --> 02:04:53.820]   You need both.
[02:04:53.820 --> 02:04:55.380]   Neither one is a panacea.
[02:04:55.380 --> 02:04:57.700]   You need them in this opponent processing,
[02:04:57.700 --> 02:05:00.460]   acting as checks and balance on each other.
[02:05:00.460 --> 02:05:03.420]   - Is there sort of practical advice you can give to people
[02:05:03.420 --> 02:05:08.420]   on how to meditate or how to be mindful in this full way?
[02:05:09.420 --> 02:05:12.820]   - Yes, I would tell them to do at least three things.
[02:05:12.820 --> 02:05:16.580]   And I was, I lucked into this.
[02:05:16.580 --> 02:05:19.620]   When I started meditation, I went down the street
[02:05:19.620 --> 02:05:22.500]   and there was a place that taught Vipassana meditation,
[02:05:22.500 --> 02:05:26.700]   metta contemplation, and Tai Chi Chuan for flow induction.
[02:05:26.700 --> 02:05:30.180]   And you should get, you should have a meditative practice.
[02:05:30.180 --> 02:05:33.780]   You should find a contemplative practice,
[02:05:33.780 --> 02:05:36.100]   and you should find a moving mindfulness practice,
[02:05:36.100 --> 02:05:38.460]   especially one that is conducive to the flow state,
[02:05:38.460 --> 02:05:40.820]   and practice them in an integrated fashion.
[02:05:40.820 --> 02:05:45.660]   - Can you elaborate what those practices might look like?
[02:05:45.660 --> 02:05:48.620]   So generally speaking.
[02:05:48.620 --> 02:05:50.700]   - Meditative practice like Vipassana.
[02:05:50.700 --> 02:05:56.100]   So what's the primary thing I look through
[02:05:56.100 --> 02:05:56.940]   rather than look at?
[02:05:56.940 --> 02:05:58.420]   It's my sensations.
[02:05:58.420 --> 02:06:01.860]   So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna focus on my sensations
[02:06:01.860 --> 02:06:04.580]   rather than focusing on the world through my sensations.
[02:06:04.580 --> 02:06:07.140]   So I'm gonna follow, for example,
[02:06:07.140 --> 02:06:12.140]   the sensations in this area of my abdomen,
[02:06:12.140 --> 02:06:13.180]   where my breathing is.
[02:06:13.180 --> 02:06:16.220]   So I can feel, as my abdomen is expanding,
[02:06:16.220 --> 02:06:18.380]   I can feel those sensations,
[02:06:18.380 --> 02:06:21.260]   and then I can feel the sensations as it's contracting.
[02:06:21.260 --> 02:06:24.460]   And what'll happen is my mind will leap back
[02:06:24.460 --> 02:06:29.180]   to try to look through and look at the world again.
[02:06:29.180 --> 02:06:31.140]   I'll start thinking about, I need to do my laundry,
[02:06:31.140 --> 02:06:32.580]   or what was that noise?
[02:06:32.580 --> 02:06:33.900]   And so what do I do?
[02:06:33.900 --> 02:06:36.500]   I don't get involved with the content.
[02:06:36.500 --> 02:06:40.580]   I step back and label the process with an -ing word,
[02:06:40.580 --> 02:06:43.780]   listening, imagining, planning,
[02:06:43.780 --> 02:06:45.980]   and then I return my attention to the breath.
[02:06:45.980 --> 02:06:49.300]   And I have to return my attention in the correct way.
[02:06:49.300 --> 02:06:50.900]   The part of your mind that jumps around,
[02:06:50.900 --> 02:06:52.580]   in the Buddhist tradition, this is called your monkey mind.
[02:06:52.580 --> 02:06:55.380]   It's like a monkey leaping for branches and chattering.
[02:06:55.380 --> 02:07:00.260]   If I was trying to train that monkey mind to stay,
[02:07:00.260 --> 02:07:02.940]   or as Jack Kornfield said, train a puppy dog,
[02:07:03.860 --> 02:07:07.020]   and stay puppy dog, and if it goes and I get really angry,
[02:07:07.020 --> 02:07:08.100]   (Jack grunting)
[02:07:08.100 --> 02:07:09.980]   and I bring it back and I'm yelling at it,
[02:07:09.980 --> 02:07:12.380]   I'm gonna train it to fight and fear me.
[02:07:12.380 --> 02:07:16.820]   But if I just indulge it, if I just feed its whims,
[02:07:16.820 --> 02:07:19.100]   oh, well, look, the puppy dog went there.
[02:07:19.100 --> 02:07:20.540]   Oh, now it's there.
[02:07:20.540 --> 02:07:21.740]   Puppy dog never learns to stay.
[02:07:21.740 --> 02:07:23.140]   What do I need to do?
[02:07:23.140 --> 02:07:25.660]   I have to neither fight it nor feed it.
[02:07:25.660 --> 02:07:27.100]   I have to have this centered attitude.
[02:07:27.100 --> 02:07:28.980]   I have to befriend it.
[02:07:28.980 --> 02:07:33.500]   So you step back and look at your sensations.
[02:07:33.500 --> 02:07:37.140]   You step back and look at your distracting processes.
[02:07:37.140 --> 02:07:39.340]   You return your attention to the breath,
[02:07:39.340 --> 02:07:40.540]   and you do it with the right attitude.
[02:07:40.540 --> 02:07:44.540]   That's the core of a good meditative practice.
[02:07:44.540 --> 02:07:47.580]   - Okay, then what's a good contemplative practice?
[02:07:47.580 --> 02:07:52.100]   - A good contemplative practice is to try and meta,
[02:07:52.100 --> 02:07:56.700]   it's actually apropos, because we talked about
[02:07:56.700 --> 02:07:57.900]   that participatory knowing,
[02:07:57.900 --> 02:08:00.300]   the way you're situated in the world.
[02:08:00.300 --> 02:08:02.700]   So what, this is a long thing,
[02:08:02.700 --> 02:08:05.180]   because there's different interpretations of meta,
[02:08:05.180 --> 02:08:07.700]   and I go for what's called an existential interpretation
[02:08:07.700 --> 02:08:09.860]   over an emotional one.
[02:08:09.860 --> 02:08:12.860]   But so what I'm doing in meta, right,
[02:08:12.860 --> 02:08:17.700]   is I'm trying to become, I'm trying to awaken in two ways.
[02:08:17.700 --> 02:08:20.380]   I'm trying to awaken to the fact
[02:08:20.380 --> 02:08:23.380]   that I am constantly assuming an identity
[02:08:23.380 --> 02:08:24.580]   and assigning an identity.
[02:08:24.580 --> 02:08:27.740]   So I'm looking at that.
[02:08:27.740 --> 02:08:29.420]   I'm trying to awaken to that.
[02:08:29.420 --> 02:08:33.260]   And then I'm trying to awake from the modal confusion
[02:08:33.260 --> 02:08:35.620]   that I can get into around that.
[02:08:35.620 --> 02:08:38.900]   And so I'm looking out onto the world,
[02:08:38.900 --> 02:08:43.620]   and I'm trying to see you
[02:08:43.620 --> 02:08:46.500]   in a fundamentally different way than I have before.
[02:08:46.500 --> 02:08:51.100]   - You know, like you go to the gym and you do bicep curls.
[02:08:51.100 --> 02:08:52.220]   - Yeah, yes, yes.
[02:08:52.220 --> 02:08:54.700]   - Is it possible to reduce it to those things that,
[02:08:54.700 --> 02:08:56.500]   I mean, you don't need to speak to the specifics,
[02:08:56.500 --> 02:08:58.980]   but is there actual practice you can do,
[02:08:58.980 --> 02:09:01.140]   or is it really personal?
[02:09:01.140 --> 02:09:03.220]   - No, I teach people how to do the meta practice.
[02:09:03.220 --> 02:09:05.500]   I also teach them how to do a neoplatonic contemplative
[02:09:05.500 --> 02:09:07.300]   practice, how to do a stoic one.
[02:09:07.300 --> 02:09:09.900]   Another one you can do is the view from above.
[02:09:09.900 --> 02:09:11.460]   This is classic stoicism.
[02:09:11.460 --> 02:09:14.060]   I get you to imagine that you're in this room,
[02:09:14.060 --> 02:09:16.740]   and then imagine that you're floating above the room,
[02:09:16.740 --> 02:09:19.580]   then above Austin, then above Texas,
[02:09:19.580 --> 02:09:21.940]   then above the United States, then the earth.
[02:09:21.940 --> 02:09:24.340]   And you have to really imagine it.
[02:09:24.340 --> 02:09:26.060]   Don't just think it, but really imagine.
[02:09:26.060 --> 02:09:29.300]   And then what you notice is, as you're pulling out
[02:09:29.300 --> 02:09:33.060]   to a wider and wider contemplation of reality,
[02:09:33.060 --> 02:09:34.980]   your sense of self and what you find relevant
[02:09:34.980 --> 02:09:36.620]   and important also changes.
[02:09:36.620 --> 02:09:39.060]   No, for all of these, there's a specific
[02:09:39.060 --> 02:09:40.820]   step-by-step methodology.
[02:09:40.820 --> 02:09:42.820]   - So like in that one, you could just literally
[02:09:42.820 --> 02:09:46.020]   imagine yourself floating farther and farther out.
[02:09:46.020 --> 02:09:47.780]   - But you have to go through the steps,
[02:09:47.780 --> 02:09:50.100]   because the stepping matters.
[02:09:50.100 --> 02:09:52.500]   Because if you just jump, it doesn't work.
[02:09:52.500 --> 02:09:54.780]   - Do you have any of this stuff online, by the way?
[02:09:54.780 --> 02:09:58.900]   - I do, because during COVID, I decided,
[02:09:58.900 --> 02:10:03.860]   at the advice of a good friend, to do a daily course.
[02:10:03.860 --> 02:10:06.260]   I taught meditating with John Vervecke.
[02:10:06.260 --> 02:10:08.660]   I did all the way through meditation, contemplation,
[02:10:08.660 --> 02:10:10.420]   even some of the movement practices.
[02:10:10.420 --> 02:10:12.060]   That's all there, it's all available.
[02:10:12.060 --> 02:10:15.020]   That was largely inspired by Buddhism and Taoism.
[02:10:15.020 --> 02:10:17.060]   And then I went into the Western tradition
[02:10:17.060 --> 02:10:20.060]   and went through things like stoicism and neoplatonism,
[02:10:20.060 --> 02:10:21.500]   cultivating wisdom with John Vervecke.
[02:10:21.500 --> 02:10:23.700]   That's all there, all free.
[02:10:23.700 --> 02:10:25.060]   - On your website?
[02:10:25.060 --> 02:10:26.540]   - Yeah, it's on my YouTube channel, yeah.
[02:10:26.540 --> 02:10:28.140]   - On your YouTube channel, okay.
[02:10:28.140 --> 02:10:29.380]   (laughs)
[02:10:29.380 --> 02:10:30.980]   That's exciting.
[02:10:30.980 --> 02:10:34.140]   I mean, your Meaning Crisis lectures is just incredible.
[02:10:34.140 --> 02:10:36.180]   Everything around it, including the notes,
[02:10:36.180 --> 02:10:37.860]   and the notes that people took.
[02:10:37.860 --> 02:10:41.780]   There's a, it created this tree of conversations.
[02:10:41.780 --> 02:10:43.700]   It's really, really, really well done.
[02:10:43.700 --> 02:10:47.420]   What about flow induction?
[02:10:47.420 --> 02:10:49.300]   - You wanna flow wisely.
[02:10:49.300 --> 02:10:53.300]   And first of all, you need to understand what flow is,
[02:10:53.300 --> 02:10:56.100]   and then you need to confront a particular issue,
[02:10:56.100 --> 02:10:57.380]   a practical problem around flow.
[02:10:57.380 --> 02:10:59.780]   - Let's go there, because a lot of those words
[02:10:59.780 --> 02:11:02.340]   seem like synonyms to people sometimes.
[02:11:02.340 --> 02:11:04.540]   So, the state of flow.
[02:11:04.540 --> 02:11:07.380]   What is it?
[02:11:07.380 --> 02:11:10.660]   - All right, so, and he just died last year,
[02:11:10.660 --> 02:11:11.620]   Chik Santhamahai.
[02:11:11.620 --> 02:11:13.340]   - I admire him very much.
[02:11:13.340 --> 02:11:17.380]   We've exchanged a bunch of messages over the past few years,
[02:11:17.380 --> 02:11:20.860]   and he wanted to do the podcast several times.
[02:11:20.860 --> 02:11:22.500]   - Oh, that would have been wonderful.
[02:11:22.500 --> 02:11:26.660]   - But he said his, he struggled with his health,
[02:11:26.660 --> 02:11:29.380]   and I never knew in those situations.
[02:11:29.380 --> 02:11:33.980]   I deeply regret several cases like this
[02:11:33.980 --> 02:11:40.460]   that I had, like with Conway,
[02:11:40.460 --> 02:11:42.400]   that I should have pushed him on it.
[02:11:42.400 --> 02:11:46.060]   'Cause yeah, as you get later in life,
[02:11:46.060 --> 02:11:48.740]   things, the simple things become more difficult,
[02:11:48.740 --> 02:11:52.420]   but a voice, especially one that hasn't been really heard,
[02:11:52.420 --> 02:11:54.260]   is important to hear.
[02:11:54.260 --> 02:11:56.900]   So, anyway, I apologize, but yeah.
[02:11:56.900 --> 02:11:58.700]   - No, no, I share that.
[02:11:58.700 --> 02:12:02.820]   I mean, I can tell you that within my area,
[02:12:02.820 --> 02:12:07.620]   he is important, and he's famous in academics, in a sense.
[02:12:07.620 --> 02:12:10.980]   So, the flow state, two important sets of conditions,
[02:12:10.980 --> 02:12:13.420]   and very often people only talk about one,
[02:12:13.420 --> 02:12:16.420]   and that's a little bit of a misrepresentation.
[02:12:16.420 --> 02:12:19.740]   So, the flow state is in situations
[02:12:19.740 --> 02:12:22.180]   in which the demand of the situation
[02:12:22.180 --> 02:12:24.880]   is slightly beyond your skills.
[02:12:24.880 --> 02:12:28.260]   So, you both have to apply all the skills you can
[02:12:28.260 --> 02:12:31.540]   with as much sort of attention and concentration
[02:12:31.540 --> 02:12:33.780]   as you possibly can,
[02:12:33.780 --> 02:12:36.340]   and you have to actually be stretching your skills.
[02:12:36.340 --> 02:12:39.360]   Now, in this circumstance,
[02:12:39.360 --> 02:12:43.900]   people report optimal experience, optimal in two ways.
[02:12:43.900 --> 02:12:46.220]   Optimal in that this is one of the best experiences
[02:12:46.220 --> 02:12:47.220]   I've had in my life.
[02:12:47.220 --> 02:12:48.860]   It's distinct from pleasure,
[02:12:48.860 --> 02:12:51.340]   and yet it explains why people do very bizarre things
[02:12:51.340 --> 02:12:54.900]   like rock climbing, because it's a good flow induction.
[02:12:54.900 --> 02:12:57.220]   But they also mean optimal in a second sense,
[02:12:57.220 --> 02:12:58.500]   my best performance.
[02:12:58.500 --> 02:13:01.840]   So, it's both the best experience and the best performance.
[02:13:01.840 --> 02:13:05.820]   So, Csikszentmihalyi also talked about
[02:13:05.820 --> 02:13:09.540]   the information flow conditions you need, right,
[02:13:09.540 --> 02:13:12.060]   in order for there to be this state of flow.
[02:13:12.060 --> 02:13:13.120]   And then I'll talk about what it's like
[02:13:13.120 --> 02:13:14.280]   to be in flow in a sec.
[02:13:14.280 --> 02:13:16.740]   What you need is three things.
[02:13:16.740 --> 02:13:18.620]   You need the information that you're getting to be clear.
[02:13:18.620 --> 02:13:20.620]   It can't be ambiguous or vague.
[02:13:20.620 --> 02:13:21.580]   Think about a rock climber.
[02:13:21.580 --> 02:13:24.420]   If it's ambiguous and vague, you're in trouble, right?
[02:13:24.420 --> 02:13:27.960]   There has to be tightly coupled feedback
[02:13:27.960 --> 02:13:31.020]   between what you do and how the environment responds.
[02:13:31.020 --> 02:13:33.480]   So, when you act, there's an immediate response.
[02:13:33.480 --> 02:13:36.260]   There isn't a big time lag between your action
[02:13:36.260 --> 02:13:39.720]   and your ability to detect the response from the environment.
[02:13:39.720 --> 02:13:43.220]   Third, failure has to matter.
[02:13:43.220 --> 02:13:44.960]   Error really matters.
[02:13:44.960 --> 02:13:47.900]   - So, there should be some anxiety about failure.
[02:13:47.900 --> 02:13:49.740]   - And failure matters.
[02:13:49.740 --> 02:13:51.460]   So, that, yeah, because--
[02:13:51.460 --> 02:13:53.180]   - Like to you, the person that participates.
[02:13:53.180 --> 02:13:55.100]   - Yes, yes, yes.
[02:13:55.100 --> 02:13:56.860]   Now, when you're in the flow state,
[02:13:56.860 --> 02:14:00.280]   notice how this sits on the boundary
[02:14:00.280 --> 02:14:02.900]   between the secular and the sacred.
[02:14:02.900 --> 02:14:04.960]   When you're in the flow state,
[02:14:04.960 --> 02:14:08.980]   people report a tremendous sense of at-one-ment
[02:14:08.980 --> 02:14:10.700]   with the environment.
[02:14:10.700 --> 02:14:13.280]   They report a loss of a particular kind
[02:14:13.280 --> 02:14:17.220]   of self-consciousness, that narrative-naturing nanny
[02:14:17.220 --> 02:14:19.020]   in your head, that how do I look?
[02:14:19.020 --> 02:14:20.020]   Do people like me?
[02:14:20.020 --> 02:14:20.860]   How do I look?
[02:14:20.860 --> 02:14:21.680]   How's my hair?
[02:14:21.680 --> 02:14:22.520]   Do people like me?
[02:14:22.520 --> 02:14:23.340]   Should I have said that?
[02:14:23.340 --> 02:14:25.180]   That all goes away.
[02:14:25.180 --> 02:14:26.100]   You're free from that.
[02:14:26.100 --> 02:14:29.340]   You're free from the most sadistic, super-ego self-critic
[02:14:29.340 --> 02:14:32.100]   you could possibly have, at least for a while.
[02:14:32.100 --> 02:14:34.180]   The world is vivid.
[02:14:34.180 --> 02:14:35.820]   It's super salient to you.
[02:14:35.820 --> 02:14:38.060]   There's an ongoing sense of discovery.
[02:14:38.060 --> 02:14:41.940]   Although often you know you're exerting
[02:14:41.940 --> 02:14:46.940]   a lot of metabolical effort, it feels effortless.
[02:14:47.180 --> 02:14:50.460]   So in the flow state when you're sparring,
[02:14:50.460 --> 02:14:52.260]   your hand just goes up for the block
[02:14:52.260 --> 02:14:56.100]   and your strike just goes through the empty space.
[02:14:56.100 --> 02:14:58.040]   Or if you're a goalie in hockey,
[02:14:58.040 --> 02:15:00.620]   I gotta mention hockey once, I'm a Canadian, right?
[02:15:00.620 --> 02:15:05.620]   You put out your glove hand and the puck's there, right?
[02:15:05.620 --> 02:15:10.820]   So there's this tremendous sense of grace,
[02:15:10.820 --> 02:15:16.140]   at-one-ment, super salience, discovery,
[02:15:16.140 --> 02:15:18.380]   and realness.
[02:15:18.380 --> 02:15:20.820]   People don't, when they're in the flow state,
[02:15:20.820 --> 02:15:23.540]   they don't go, I bet this is an illusion.
[02:15:23.540 --> 02:15:26.780]   The interesting question for me and my co-authors
[02:15:26.780 --> 02:15:31.780]   in the article we published in the Oxford Handbook,
[02:15:31.780 --> 02:15:34.660]   A Spontaneous Thought with Arianne Haribennett
[02:15:34.660 --> 02:15:39.340]   and Leo Ferraro, is that's a descriptive account of flow.
[02:15:39.340 --> 02:15:40.700]   We wanted an explanatory account.
[02:15:40.700 --> 02:15:43.580]   What are the causal mechanisms at work in flow?
[02:15:45.180 --> 02:15:48.380]   And so we actually proposed
[02:15:48.380 --> 02:15:51.700]   to interlocking cognitive processes.
[02:15:51.700 --> 02:15:55.060]   The first thing we said is, well, what's going on in flow?
[02:15:55.060 --> 02:15:57.220]   Well, think about it.
[02:15:57.220 --> 02:15:59.300]   Think about the rock climber.
[02:15:59.300 --> 02:16:01.660]   The rock climber, and I talked about this earlier,
[02:16:01.660 --> 02:16:04.220]   they're constantly restructuring
[02:16:04.220 --> 02:16:06.860]   how they're seeing the rock face.
[02:16:06.860 --> 02:16:09.740]   They're constantly doing something like insight.
[02:16:09.740 --> 02:16:12.420]   And if they fail to do it, they impasse,
[02:16:12.420 --> 02:16:14.060]   and that starts to get dangerous.
[02:16:14.060 --> 02:16:16.580]   So they got to do an insight that primes an insight
[02:16:16.580 --> 02:16:17.660]   that primes an insight.
[02:16:17.660 --> 02:16:22.460]   So imagine the aha experience, that flash in that moment,
[02:16:22.460 --> 02:16:24.020]   and imagine it cascading.
[02:16:24.020 --> 02:16:26.700]   So you're getting the extended aha.
[02:16:26.700 --> 02:16:28.340]   That's why things are super salient.
[02:16:28.340 --> 02:16:29.860]   There's a sense of discovery.
[02:16:29.860 --> 02:16:31.260]   There's a sense of at-one-ment,
[02:16:31.260 --> 02:16:34.260]   of deep participation, of grace.
[02:16:34.260 --> 02:16:36.260]   But there's something else going on too.
[02:16:36.260 --> 02:16:40.740]   So there's a phenomenon called implicit learning.
[02:16:40.740 --> 02:16:42.940]   Also very well replicated.
[02:16:42.940 --> 02:16:45.580]   Starts way back in the '60s with Reber.
[02:16:45.580 --> 02:16:48.140]   You can give people complex patterns
[02:16:48.140 --> 02:16:51.820]   like number and letter strings, right?
[02:16:51.820 --> 02:16:55.500]   And they can learn about those patterns
[02:16:55.500 --> 02:16:59.260]   outside of deliberate focal awareness.
[02:16:59.260 --> 02:17:01.580]   That's what's called implicit learning.
[02:17:01.580 --> 02:17:04.460]   And what's interesting is if you try and change that task
[02:17:04.460 --> 02:17:07.980]   into, you know, tell me the pattern,
[02:17:07.980 --> 02:17:11.500]   but explicitly try to figure it out,
[02:17:11.500 --> 02:17:13.220]   their performance degrades.
[02:17:13.220 --> 02:17:14.220]   So here's the idea.
[02:17:14.220 --> 02:17:18.220]   You have this adaptive capacity for implicit learning,
[02:17:18.220 --> 02:17:20.340]   and what it does is it results in you
[02:17:20.340 --> 02:17:23.820]   being able to track complex variables in a way,
[02:17:23.820 --> 02:17:26.460]   but you don't know how you came up with that knowledge.
[02:17:26.460 --> 02:17:28.900]   Right, so you get, and this is Hogarth's proposal
[02:17:28.900 --> 02:17:30.500]   in educating intuition.
[02:17:30.500 --> 02:17:32.940]   Intuition is actually the result of implicit learning.
[02:17:32.940 --> 02:17:34.340]   So an example I use is,
[02:17:34.340 --> 02:17:37.940]   how far do you stand away from somebody at a funeral?
[02:17:41.420 --> 02:17:43.460]   There's a lot of complex variables.
[02:17:43.460 --> 02:17:46.220]   There's status, closeness to the person,
[02:17:46.220 --> 02:17:48.980]   your relationship to them, past history,
[02:17:48.980 --> 02:17:52.500]   all kinds of stuff, and yet you know how to do it,
[02:17:52.500 --> 02:17:55.220]   and you didn't have to go to funeral school.
[02:17:55.220 --> 02:17:56.860]   I'm just using that as an example.
[02:17:56.860 --> 02:17:58.780]   So you have these powerful intuitions.
[02:17:58.780 --> 02:18:00.900]   Now, here's Hogarth's great point.
[02:18:00.900 --> 02:18:04.460]   Implicit learning, and remember I said before,
[02:18:04.460 --> 02:18:05.980]   the things that make it adaptive
[02:18:05.980 --> 02:18:07.580]   make us subject to self-deception.
[02:18:07.580 --> 02:18:09.220]   Here's another example.
[02:18:09.220 --> 02:18:11.060]   Implicit learning is powerful
[02:18:11.060 --> 02:18:13.300]   at picking up on complex patterns,
[02:18:13.300 --> 02:18:15.700]   but it doesn't care what kind of pattern it is.
[02:18:15.700 --> 02:18:19.180]   It doesn't distinguish causal patterns
[02:18:19.180 --> 02:18:21.140]   from merely correlational patterns.
[02:18:21.140 --> 02:18:24.300]   So implicit learning, when we like it, it's intuition.
[02:18:24.300 --> 02:18:25.800]   When it's picking up on stuff that's bogus,
[02:18:25.800 --> 02:18:28.620]   we call it prejudice or all kinds of other names
[02:18:28.620 --> 02:18:31.180]   for intuition that's going wrong.
[02:18:31.180 --> 02:18:33.580]   Now, he said, okay, what do we do?
[02:18:33.580 --> 02:18:34.420]   What do we do about this?
[02:18:34.420 --> 02:18:36.260]   And this, we'll get back to Flo.
[02:18:36.260 --> 02:18:37.100]   What do we do about this?
[02:18:37.100 --> 02:18:38.940]   Well, we can't try to replace implicit learning
[02:18:38.940 --> 02:18:40.220]   with explicit learning
[02:18:40.220 --> 02:18:42.740]   'cause we'll lose all the adaptiveness to it.
[02:18:42.740 --> 02:18:44.460]   So what can we do explicitly?
[02:18:44.460 --> 02:18:47.380]   What we can do is take care of the environment
[02:18:47.380 --> 02:18:49.980]   in which we're doing the implicit learning.
[02:18:49.980 --> 02:18:51.060]   How do we do that?
[02:18:51.060 --> 02:18:53.820]   We try to make sure the environment has features
[02:18:53.820 --> 02:18:57.120]   that help us distinguish causation from correlation.
[02:18:57.120 --> 02:19:00.140]   What kind of environments have we created
[02:19:00.140 --> 02:19:03.540]   that are good at distinguishing causation from correlation?
[02:19:03.540 --> 02:19:05.780]   Experimental environments.
[02:19:05.780 --> 02:19:07.540]   What do you do in an experiment?
[02:19:07.540 --> 02:19:09.980]   You make sure that the variables are clear,
[02:19:09.980 --> 02:19:12.380]   no confound, no ambiguity, no vagueness.
[02:19:12.380 --> 02:19:13.900]   You make sure there's a tight coupling
[02:19:13.900 --> 02:19:16.300]   between the independent and the dependent variable
[02:19:16.300 --> 02:19:20.060]   and your hypothesis can be falsified, error matters.
[02:19:20.060 --> 02:19:21.380]   Now look at those three lex.
[02:19:21.380 --> 02:19:23.860]   Those are exactly the three conditions
[02:19:23.860 --> 02:19:25.940]   that you need for Flo.
[02:19:25.940 --> 02:19:29.780]   Clear information, tightly coupled feedback
[02:19:29.780 --> 02:19:31.540]   and error matters.
[02:19:31.540 --> 02:19:34.480]   So Flo is not only an insight cascade,
[02:19:34.480 --> 02:19:37.180]   improving your insight capacity,
[02:19:37.180 --> 02:19:41.420]   it's also a marker that you're cultivating
[02:19:41.420 --> 02:19:43.380]   the best kind of intuitions,
[02:19:43.380 --> 02:19:46.140]   the ones that fit you best
[02:19:46.140 --> 02:19:48.340]   to the causal patterns in your environment.
[02:19:48.340 --> 02:19:52.620]   - But it's hard to achieve that kind of environment
[02:19:52.620 --> 02:19:54.020]   where there's a clear distinction
[02:19:54.020 --> 02:19:55.860]   between causality and correlation
[02:19:55.860 --> 02:20:00.860]   and it has the rigor of a scientific experiment.
[02:20:00.860 --> 02:20:02.660]   - Fair enough.
[02:20:02.660 --> 02:20:04.360]   And I don't think Hogarth was saying
[02:20:04.360 --> 02:20:06.760]   it's gonna be epistemically as rigorous
[02:20:06.760 --> 02:20:08.180]   as a scientific experiment,
[02:20:08.180 --> 02:20:11.860]   but he's saying, right, if you structure that,
[02:20:11.860 --> 02:20:14.980]   it will tend to do what that scientific method does,
[02:20:14.980 --> 02:20:17.660]   which is find causal, think of the rock climber.
[02:20:17.660 --> 02:20:18.740]   All of those things are the case.
[02:20:18.740 --> 02:20:20.820]   They need clear information, right?
[02:20:20.820 --> 02:20:23.100]   It's tightly coupled and error matters.
[02:20:23.100 --> 02:20:25.900]   And they think what they're doing is very real
[02:20:25.900 --> 02:20:28.820]   because if they're not, you know,
[02:20:28.820 --> 02:20:31.500]   conforming to the real causal patterns
[02:20:31.500 --> 02:20:35.340]   of the rock face and the physiology of their body,
[02:20:35.340 --> 02:20:36.240]   they will fall.
[02:20:36.240 --> 02:20:40.160]   - Is there something to be said
[02:20:40.160 --> 02:20:42.800]   about the power of discovering meaning
[02:20:42.800 --> 02:20:46.700]   and having this deep relationship with the moment?
[02:20:46.700 --> 02:20:51.880]   There's something about flow that's really,
[02:20:51.880 --> 02:20:54.240]   if it gets the past, then the future,
[02:20:54.240 --> 02:20:55.940]   and is really focused on the moment.
[02:20:55.940 --> 02:20:58.040]   - I think that's part of the phenomenology,
[02:20:58.040 --> 02:21:00.960]   but I think the functionality has to do with the fact
[02:21:00.960 --> 02:21:05.200]   that what's happening in flow is that dynamic,
[02:21:05.200 --> 02:21:07.520]   non-propositional connectedness
[02:21:07.520 --> 02:21:12.260]   that is so central to meaning is being optimized.
[02:21:12.260 --> 02:21:15.780]   This is why flow is a good predictor
[02:21:15.780 --> 02:21:18.980]   of how well you rate your life,
[02:21:18.980 --> 02:21:21.820]   how much wellbeing you think you have,
[02:21:21.820 --> 02:21:23.700]   which of course is itself also predictive
[02:21:23.700 --> 02:21:26.360]   and interrelated with how meaningful you find your life.
[02:21:26.360 --> 02:21:28.660]   One of the things that you can do,
[02:21:28.660 --> 02:21:30.580]   but there's an important caveat,
[02:21:30.580 --> 02:21:32.980]   to increase your sense of meaning in life
[02:21:32.980 --> 02:21:36.320]   is to get into the flow state more frequently.
[02:21:36.320 --> 02:21:38.620]   That's why I said you want a moving practice
[02:21:38.620 --> 02:21:40.100]   that's conducive to the flow state.
[02:21:40.100 --> 02:21:43.100]   But there's one important caveat,
[02:21:43.100 --> 02:21:47.640]   which is we of course have figured out,
[02:21:47.640 --> 02:21:49.180]   and I'm playing with words here,
[02:21:49.180 --> 02:21:52.000]   how to game this and how to hijack it
[02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.720]   by creating things like video games.
[02:21:54.720 --> 02:21:57.180]   I'm not saying this is the case for all video games,
[02:21:57.180 --> 02:21:59.080]   or this is the case for all people,
[02:21:59.080 --> 02:22:03.220]   but the WHO now acknowledges this as a real thing,
[02:22:03.220 --> 02:22:05.760]   that you can get into the flow state
[02:22:05.760 --> 02:22:08.820]   within the video game world
[02:22:08.820 --> 02:22:10.620]   to the detriment of your ability
[02:22:10.620 --> 02:22:13.860]   to get into the flow state in the real world.
[02:22:13.860 --> 02:22:16.060]   What's the opposite of flow?
[02:22:16.060 --> 02:22:16.900]   Depression.
[02:22:16.900 --> 02:22:19.640]   In fact, depression has been called anti-flow.
[02:22:19.640 --> 02:22:23.000]   So you get these people that are flowing
[02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:25.900]   in this non-real world,
[02:22:25.900 --> 02:22:29.900]   and they can't transfer it to the real world,
[02:22:29.900 --> 02:22:32.200]   and it's actually costing them flow in the real world.
[02:22:32.200 --> 02:22:35.800]   So they tend to suffer depression and all kinds of things.
[02:22:35.800 --> 02:22:38.800]   - Oh, your ability, your habit,
[02:22:38.800 --> 02:22:43.800]   and just skill at attaining flow in the video game world
[02:22:43.800 --> 02:22:47.900]   basically makes you less effective,
[02:22:47.900 --> 02:22:52.040]   or maybe shocks you at how difficult it is
[02:22:52.040 --> 02:22:54.120]   to achieve flow in the physical world.
[02:22:54.120 --> 02:22:54.960]   - Yeah, I'm not sure about the--
[02:22:54.960 --> 02:22:57.880]   - I just, I don't wanna push back
[02:22:57.880 --> 02:23:01.920]   against the implied challenge of transferability,
[02:23:01.920 --> 02:23:06.000]   because there's a lot of,
[02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.840]   I have a lot of friends that play video games,
[02:23:08.840 --> 02:23:12.120]   a very large percent of young folks play video games,
[02:23:12.120 --> 02:23:17.120]   and I'm hesitant to build up models
[02:23:17.120 --> 02:23:20.480]   of how that affects behavior.
[02:23:20.480 --> 02:23:22.080]   My intuition is weak there.
[02:23:22.080 --> 02:23:26.360]   Oftentimes, people that have PhDs are of a certain age
[02:23:26.360 --> 02:23:28.640]   that they came up when video games
[02:23:28.640 --> 02:23:31.440]   weren't a deep part of their life development.
[02:23:31.440 --> 02:23:36.440]   I would venture to say people who have developed their brain
[02:23:36.440 --> 02:23:39.960]   with video games being a large part of that world
[02:23:39.960 --> 02:23:43.940]   are in some sense different humans,
[02:23:43.940 --> 02:23:47.240]   and it's possible that they can transfer more effectively
[02:23:47.240 --> 02:23:48.760]   some of the lessons,
[02:23:50.480 --> 02:23:52.880]   some of the ability to attain flow
[02:23:52.880 --> 02:23:55.320]   from the virtual world to the physical world.
[02:23:55.320 --> 02:23:57.720]   They're also more, I would venture to say,
[02:23:57.720 --> 02:24:01.120]   resilient to the negative effects of,
[02:24:01.120 --> 02:24:04.160]   for example, social media or video games.
[02:24:04.160 --> 02:24:08.400]   They have, maybe the objectification
[02:24:08.400 --> 02:24:12.280]   or the over-sexualized or violent aspect of video games.
[02:24:12.280 --> 02:24:13.680]   They're able to turn that off
[02:24:13.680 --> 02:24:15.000]   when they go to the physical world
[02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:18.040]   and turn it back on when they're playing the video games,
[02:24:18.040 --> 02:24:23.000]   probably more effectively than the old-timers.
[02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:25.920]   So I just wanna say this, I'm not sure.
[02:24:25.920 --> 02:24:27.200]   It's a really interesting question
[02:24:27.200 --> 02:24:29.800]   how transferable the flow state is.
[02:24:29.800 --> 02:24:31.720]   I don't know if you wanna comment on that.
[02:24:31.720 --> 02:24:32.800]   - I do, I do.
[02:24:32.800 --> 02:24:34.240]   First of all, I did qualify, and I'm saying
[02:24:34.240 --> 02:24:37.200]   it's not the case for all video games or for all people.
[02:24:37.200 --> 02:24:38.800]   I'm holding out the possibility,
[02:24:38.800 --> 02:24:42.320]   and I know this possibility 'cause I've had students
[02:24:42.320 --> 02:24:44.280]   who actually suffer from this
[02:24:44.280 --> 02:24:47.740]   and have done work around it with me.
[02:24:48.420 --> 02:24:50.260]   - Oh, the ability to achieve--
[02:24:50.260 --> 02:24:52.500]   - They couldn't transfer, yeah.
[02:24:52.500 --> 02:24:56.820]   And then they were able to step back from that
[02:24:56.820 --> 02:24:58.860]   and then take up the cognitive science
[02:24:58.860 --> 02:25:00.700]   and write about it and work on it.
[02:25:00.700 --> 02:25:05.100]   Also, I'm not so sure about the resiliency claim
[02:25:05.100 --> 02:25:10.100]   because there seems to be mounting evidence.
[02:25:10.100 --> 02:25:14.900]   It's not consensus, but it's certainly not regarded
[02:25:14.900 --> 02:25:17.980]   as fringe that the increase in social media
[02:25:17.980 --> 02:25:21.940]   is pretty strongly correlated with increase in depression,
[02:25:21.940 --> 02:25:24.580]   self-destructive behavior, things like this.
[02:25:24.580 --> 02:25:26.220]   - I would like to see that evidence because--
[02:25:26.220 --> 02:25:27.220]   - Sure, I can find it.
[02:25:27.220 --> 02:25:28.220]   - No, no, no, no.
[02:25:28.220 --> 02:25:38.380]   I'm always hesitant to too eagerly kind of agree
[02:25:38.380 --> 02:25:42.660]   with things that I want to agree with.
[02:25:42.660 --> 02:25:44.660]   That there's a public perception,
[02:25:44.660 --> 02:25:46.620]   everyone seems to hate on social media.
[02:25:46.620 --> 02:25:51.380]   I wonder, as always with these things,
[02:25:51.380 --> 02:25:56.380]   does it reveal depression or does it create depression?
[02:25:56.380 --> 02:25:57.580]   This is always the question.
[02:25:57.580 --> 02:26:00.500]   It's like whenever you talk about any political
[02:26:00.500 --> 02:26:04.260]   or ideological movement, does it create hate
[02:26:04.260 --> 02:26:05.900]   or does it reveal hate?
[02:26:05.900 --> 02:26:07.380]   - And that's a good thing to ask,
[02:26:07.380 --> 02:26:09.280]   and you should always challenge the things
[02:26:09.280 --> 02:26:11.380]   that you intuitively want to believe.
[02:26:11.380 --> 02:26:12.480]   - I agree with that.
[02:26:12.480 --> 02:26:15.540]   - Like aliens.
[02:26:15.540 --> 02:26:18.180]   - So one of the ways you address this,
[02:26:18.180 --> 02:26:20.180]   and it's not sufficient, and I did say
[02:26:20.180 --> 02:26:23.540]   that work is preliminary, but if I can give you
[02:26:23.540 --> 02:26:26.900]   a plausible mechanism that's new,
[02:26:26.900 --> 02:26:28.620]   and then that lends credence.
[02:26:28.620 --> 02:26:33.380]   And part of what happens is illusory social comparison.
[02:26:33.380 --> 02:26:36.060]   Think of Instagram, people are posting things
[02:26:36.060 --> 02:26:38.540]   that are not accurate representation of their life
[02:26:38.540 --> 02:26:39.540]   or life events.
[02:26:39.540 --> 02:26:41.420]   In fact, they will stage things,
[02:26:41.420 --> 02:26:45.460]   but the people that are looking at these,
[02:26:45.460 --> 02:26:47.580]   they take it often as real,
[02:26:47.580 --> 02:26:51.220]   and so they get downward social comparison.
[02:26:51.220 --> 02:26:56.940]   Compared to how you and I probably live,
[02:26:56.940 --> 02:27:00.060]   where we may get one or two of those events a week,
[02:27:00.060 --> 02:27:02.260]   they're getting them moment by moment.
[02:27:02.260 --> 02:27:04.080]   And so it's a plausible mechanism
[02:27:04.080 --> 02:27:06.520]   that why it might be driving people
[02:27:06.520 --> 02:27:07.740]   into a more depressed state.
[02:27:07.740 --> 02:27:10.620]   - So okay, the flip side of that is
[02:27:10.620 --> 02:27:12.960]   because there's a greater, greater gap
[02:27:12.960 --> 02:27:15.720]   going from real world to Instagram world,
[02:27:15.720 --> 02:27:17.460]   you start to be able to laugh at it
[02:27:17.460 --> 02:27:19.840]   and realize that it's artificial.
[02:27:19.840 --> 02:27:22.660]   So for example, even just artificial filters.
[02:27:22.660 --> 02:27:24.440]   People start to realize like,
[02:27:24.440 --> 02:27:28.300]   it's the same kind of gap as there is
[02:27:28.300 --> 02:27:31.420]   between the video game world and the real world.
[02:27:31.420 --> 02:27:32.420]   In the video game world,
[02:27:32.420 --> 02:27:34.980]   you can do all kinds of wild things.
[02:27:34.980 --> 02:27:37.220]   Grand Theft Auto, you can shoot people up,
[02:27:37.220 --> 02:27:38.660]   you can do whatever the heck you want.
[02:27:38.660 --> 02:27:39.780]   In the real world, you can't.
[02:27:39.780 --> 02:27:42.500]   And you start to develop an understanding
[02:27:42.500 --> 02:27:44.540]   of how to have fun in the virtual world
[02:27:44.540 --> 02:27:46.020]   and in the physical world.
[02:27:46.020 --> 02:27:48.460]   And I think, just as a pushback,
[02:27:48.460 --> 02:27:49.940]   I'm not saying either is true, though.
[02:27:49.940 --> 02:27:51.620]   Those are very interesting claims.
[02:27:51.620 --> 02:27:55.240]   The more ridiculously out of touch Instagram becomes,
[02:27:55.240 --> 02:27:58.580]   the easier you can laugh it off, potentially,
[02:27:58.580 --> 02:28:00.580]   in terms of the effect it has on your psyche.
[02:28:00.580 --> 02:28:01.660]   - I'll respond to that,
[02:28:01.660 --> 02:28:04.220]   but at some point we should get back to Flo.
[02:28:06.220 --> 02:28:07.420]   As we engage in Flo.
[02:28:07.420 --> 02:28:11.340]   - You laugh at the shampoo commercial,
[02:28:11.340 --> 02:28:12.740]   and yet you buy the shampoo.
[02:28:12.740 --> 02:28:16.200]   - Yeah.
[02:28:16.200 --> 02:28:18.060]   - There's a capacity for tremendous bullshitting
[02:28:18.060 --> 02:28:21.500]   because of the way these machines are designed
[02:28:21.500 --> 02:28:22.900]   to trigger salience,
[02:28:22.900 --> 02:28:27.140]   without triggering reflective truth-seeking.
[02:28:27.140 --> 02:28:35.260]   - I'm thinking of Connor examples,
[02:28:35.260 --> 02:28:40.260]   because sometimes you can laugh all the way to the bank.
[02:28:40.260 --> 02:28:44.740]   So you can laugh and not buy the shampoo.
[02:28:44.740 --> 02:28:45.580]   - Right.
[02:28:45.580 --> 02:28:46.400]   - There's many cases.
[02:28:46.400 --> 02:28:49.060]   So I think you have to laugh hard enough.
[02:28:49.060 --> 02:28:50.380]   - You do have to laugh hard enough.
[02:28:50.380 --> 02:28:54.380]   But the advertisers get millions of dollars
[02:28:54.380 --> 02:28:56.780]   precisely because, for many, many people,
[02:28:56.780 --> 02:28:58.820]   it does make you buy the shampoo.
[02:28:58.820 --> 02:29:00.100]   And that's the concern.
[02:29:00.100 --> 02:29:02.300]   - And maybe the machine of social media
[02:29:02.300 --> 02:29:04.740]   is such that it optimizes the shampoo buying.
[02:29:04.740 --> 02:29:05.580]   - Yes.
[02:29:05.580 --> 02:29:07.100]   The point I was trying to make is
[02:29:07.100 --> 02:29:13.180]   whether or not that particular example is ultimately right,
[02:29:13.180 --> 02:29:17.420]   the possibility of transfer failure is a real thing.
[02:29:17.420 --> 02:29:21.820]   And I wanna contrast that to an experience I had
[02:29:21.820 --> 02:29:22.660]   when I was in grad school.
[02:29:22.660 --> 02:29:25.540]   I had been doing Tai Chi Chuan about three or four years,
[02:29:25.540 --> 02:29:27.780]   very religiously, in both senses of the word,
[02:29:27.780 --> 02:29:29.540]   like three or four hours a day,
[02:29:29.540 --> 02:29:31.220]   and reading all the literature.
[02:29:31.220 --> 02:29:34.420]   I was having all the weird experiences,
[02:29:34.420 --> 02:29:37.220]   cold as ice, hot as lava, all that stuff.
[02:29:37.220 --> 02:29:38.480]   And it's ooh, right?
[02:29:38.480 --> 02:29:41.340]   But my friends in grad school,
[02:29:41.340 --> 02:29:45.220]   they said to me, "What's going on?
[02:29:45.220 --> 02:29:46.700]   "You're different."
[02:29:46.700 --> 02:29:48.400]   And I said, "What do you mean?"
[02:29:48.400 --> 02:29:51.400]   And they said, "Well, you're a lot more balanced
[02:29:51.400 --> 02:29:55.120]   "in your interactions, and you're a lot more flowing,
[02:29:55.120 --> 02:29:57.100]   "and you're a lot more sort of flexible,
[02:29:57.100 --> 02:29:58.700]   "and you adjust more."
[02:29:58.700 --> 02:29:59.920]   And I realized, oh.
[02:29:59.920 --> 02:30:03.620]   And this was the sort of Taoist claim
[02:30:03.620 --> 02:30:07.700]   around Tai Chi Chuan, that it actually transfers
[02:30:07.700 --> 02:30:10.100]   in ways that you might not expect.
[02:30:10.100 --> 02:30:12.940]   You start to be able, and I've now noticed that.
[02:30:12.940 --> 02:30:15.620]   I now notice how I'm doing Tai Chi,
[02:30:15.620 --> 02:30:17.260]   even in this interaction,
[02:30:17.260 --> 02:30:20.100]   and how it can facilitate and afford.
[02:30:20.100 --> 02:30:22.300]   And so there's a powerful transfer.
[02:30:22.300 --> 02:30:25.180]   And that's what I meant by flow wisely.
[02:30:25.180 --> 02:30:28.660]   Not only flow in a way that's making sure
[02:30:28.660 --> 02:30:31.340]   that you're distinguishing causation from correlation,
[02:30:31.340 --> 02:30:32.940]   which flow can do.
[02:30:32.940 --> 02:30:36.480]   But find how to situate it, home it,
[02:30:36.480 --> 02:30:38.580]   so that it will percolate through your psyche
[02:30:38.580 --> 02:30:40.980]   and permeate through many domains of your life.
[02:30:40.980 --> 02:30:44.900]   - Is there something you could say
[02:30:44.900 --> 02:30:48.460]   similar to our discussion about mindfulness and meditation
[02:30:48.460 --> 02:30:51.500]   and contemplation about the world
[02:30:51.500 --> 02:30:54.820]   that psychedelics take our mind?
[02:30:54.820 --> 02:30:58.380]   Where does the mind go
[02:31:00.740 --> 02:31:03.340]   when it's on psychedelics?
[02:31:03.340 --> 02:31:07.760]   - I want to remind you of something you said,
[02:31:07.760 --> 02:31:10.660]   which is a gem.
[02:31:10.660 --> 02:31:12.120]   It's not so much the experience,
[02:31:12.120 --> 02:31:14.660]   but the degree to which it can be integrated back.
[02:31:14.660 --> 02:31:19.900]   So here's a proposal, it comes from Woodward and others.
[02:31:19.900 --> 02:31:21.340]   A lot of convergence around this.
[02:31:21.340 --> 02:31:23.480]   Carhart Harris is talking about it similarly
[02:31:23.480 --> 02:31:25.100]   in the entropic brain.
[02:31:25.100 --> 02:31:26.880]   But I'm not gonna talk first about psychedelics.
[02:31:26.880 --> 02:31:29.060]   I'm gonna talk about neural networks.
[02:31:29.060 --> 02:31:31.540]   And I'm gonna talk about a classic problem
[02:31:31.540 --> 02:31:32.380]   in neural networks.
[02:31:32.380 --> 02:31:35.060]   So neural networks, like us with intuition
[02:31:35.060 --> 02:31:36.820]   and implicit learning, are fantastic
[02:31:36.820 --> 02:31:39.920]   at picking up on complex patterns.
[02:31:39.920 --> 02:31:41.620]   - Which neural networks are we talking about?
[02:31:41.620 --> 02:31:43.900]   - I'm talking about a general, just general--
[02:31:43.900 --> 02:31:45.180]   - Both artificial and biological?
[02:31:45.180 --> 02:31:47.300]   - Yes, yes, yes.
[02:31:47.300 --> 02:31:52.080]   I think at this point, there is no relevant difference.
[02:31:52.080 --> 02:31:55.260]   So one of the classic problems, because of their power,
[02:31:55.260 --> 02:31:57.860]   is they suffer from overfitting to the data.
[02:31:57.860 --> 02:32:00.300]   Or for those of you who are, you know,
[02:32:00.300 --> 02:32:02.480]   with statistical orientation,
[02:32:02.480 --> 02:32:05.380]   they pick up patterns in the sample
[02:32:05.380 --> 02:32:09.160]   that aren't actually present in the population, right?
[02:32:09.160 --> 02:32:13.860]   And so what you do is, there's various strategies.
[02:32:13.860 --> 02:32:17.140]   You can do dropout, where you periodically turn off
[02:32:17.140 --> 02:32:19.220]   half of the nodes in a network.
[02:32:19.220 --> 02:32:22.300]   You can drop noise into the network.
[02:32:22.300 --> 02:32:26.780]   And what that does is it prevents overfitting to the data
[02:32:26.780 --> 02:32:28.460]   and allows the network to generalize
[02:32:28.460 --> 02:32:30.220]   more powerfully to the environment.
[02:32:30.220 --> 02:32:36.800]   I propose to you that that's basically what psychedelics do.
[02:32:36.800 --> 02:32:39.580]   They do that.
[02:32:39.580 --> 02:32:44.000]   They basically do significant constraint reduction.
[02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:48.420]   And so you get areas of the brain talking to each other
[02:32:48.420 --> 02:32:50.700]   that don't normally talk to each other,
[02:32:50.700 --> 02:32:53.140]   areas that do talk to each other not talking to each other,
[02:32:53.140 --> 02:32:55.540]   down-regulation of areas that are very dominant,
[02:32:55.540 --> 02:32:57.900]   like the default mode network, et cetera.
[02:32:57.900 --> 02:33:01.460]   And what that does is exactly something strongly analogous,
[02:33:01.460 --> 02:33:04.120]   sorry, to what's happening in dropout
[02:33:04.120 --> 02:33:05.860]   or putting noise into the data.
[02:33:05.860 --> 02:33:06.700]   It opens up.
[02:33:06.700 --> 02:33:08.380]   By the way, if you give people,
[02:33:08.380 --> 02:33:10.680]   if you give human beings an insight problem
[02:33:10.680 --> 02:33:13.980]   that they're trying to solve and you throw in some noise,
[02:33:13.980 --> 02:33:15.740]   like literally static on the screen,
[02:33:15.740 --> 02:33:17.500]   you can trigger an insight in them.
[02:33:17.500 --> 02:33:22.060]   - So like literally a very simplistic kind of noise
[02:33:22.060 --> 02:33:23.220]   to the perception system.
[02:33:23.220 --> 02:33:26.380]   - Right, it can break it out of overfitting to the data
[02:33:26.380 --> 02:33:27.700]   and open you up.
[02:33:27.700 --> 02:33:32.700]   Now that means though that just doing that, right,
[02:33:32.700 --> 02:33:37.980]   in and of itself is not the answer
[02:33:37.980 --> 02:33:41.940]   because you also have to make sure
[02:33:41.940 --> 02:33:44.580]   that the system can go back to exploring
[02:33:44.580 --> 02:33:46.460]   that new space properly.
[02:33:46.460 --> 02:33:48.260]   This isn't a problem with neural networks.
[02:33:48.260 --> 02:33:50.020]   You turn off dropout and they just go back
[02:33:50.020 --> 02:33:51.620]   to being powerful neural networks.
[02:33:51.700 --> 02:33:53.220]   And now they explore the state space
[02:33:53.220 --> 02:33:55.140]   that they couldn't explore before.
[02:33:55.140 --> 02:33:58.460]   Human beings are a little bit more messy around this.
[02:33:58.460 --> 02:34:01.900]   And this is where the analogy does get a little bit strained.
[02:34:01.900 --> 02:34:06.900]   So they need practices that help them integrate
[02:34:06.900 --> 02:34:10.620]   that opening up to the new state space
[02:34:10.620 --> 02:34:12.420]   so they can properly integrate it.
[02:34:12.420 --> 02:34:17.420]   So beyond Leary's state set and setting,
[02:34:17.420 --> 02:34:20.180]   I think you need another S.
[02:34:20.180 --> 02:34:21.620]   I think you need sacred.
[02:34:21.620 --> 02:34:26.540]   You need, psychedelics need to be practiced
[02:34:26.540 --> 02:34:28.540]   within a sapiential framework,
[02:34:28.540 --> 02:34:31.740]   a framework in which people are independently
[02:34:31.740 --> 02:34:34.660]   and beforehand improving their abilities
[02:34:34.660 --> 02:34:36.420]   to deal with self-deception
[02:34:36.420 --> 02:34:38.680]   and afford insight and self-regulate.
[02:34:38.680 --> 02:34:41.400]   This is of course the overwhelming way
[02:34:41.400 --> 02:34:44.540]   in which psychedelics are used by indigenous cultures.
[02:34:44.540 --> 02:34:47.780]   And I think if we put them into that context,
[02:34:47.780 --> 02:34:52.780]   then they can help the project of people
[02:34:52.780 --> 02:34:55.700]   self-transcending, cultivating meaning
[02:34:55.700 --> 02:34:56.820]   and increasing wisdom.
[02:34:56.820 --> 02:35:00.260]   But if I think we remove them out of that context
[02:35:00.260 --> 02:35:03.540]   and put them in the context of commodities
[02:35:03.540 --> 02:35:07.600]   taken just to have certain phenomenological changes,
[02:35:07.600 --> 02:35:10.500]   we run certain important risks.
[02:35:10.500 --> 02:35:14.220]   - So using the term of higher states of consciousness.
[02:35:14.220 --> 02:35:15.060]   - Yes.
[02:35:16.060 --> 02:35:18.940]   - Is consciousness an important part of that word?
[02:35:18.940 --> 02:35:20.640]   Why higher?
[02:35:20.640 --> 02:35:24.580]   Is it a higher state?
[02:35:24.580 --> 02:35:27.260]   - So-- - Or is it a detour,
[02:35:27.260 --> 02:35:30.580]   a side road on the main road of consciousness?
[02:35:30.580 --> 02:35:32.940]   - So I think-- - Where do we go here?
[02:35:32.940 --> 02:35:37.580]   - I think the psychedelic state is on a continuum.
[02:35:37.580 --> 02:35:40.840]   There's insight and then flow is an insight cascade.
[02:35:40.840 --> 02:35:42.740]   There's flow and then you can have
[02:35:42.740 --> 02:35:44.040]   sort of psychedelic experiences,
[02:35:44.040 --> 02:35:45.940]   mind-revealing experiences.
[02:35:45.940 --> 02:35:49.340]   And then, but they overlap with mystical experiences
[02:35:49.340 --> 02:35:50.580]   and they aren't the same.
[02:35:50.580 --> 02:35:54.340]   So for example, in the Griffiths Lab,
[02:35:54.340 --> 02:35:56.060]   they gave people psilocybin
[02:35:56.060 --> 02:35:58.420]   and they taught them ahead of time
[02:35:58.420 --> 02:36:01.940]   how like sort of the features of a mystical experience.
[02:36:01.940 --> 02:36:03.940]   And only a certain proportion of the people
[02:36:03.940 --> 02:36:06.820]   that took the psilocybin went from a psychedelic
[02:36:06.820 --> 02:36:08.120]   into a mystical experience.
[02:36:08.120 --> 02:36:09.860]   What was interesting is the people
[02:36:09.860 --> 02:36:11.620]   that had the mystical experience
[02:36:11.620 --> 02:36:14.640]   had measurable and longstanding change
[02:36:14.640 --> 02:36:16.940]   to one of the big five factors of personality.
[02:36:16.940 --> 02:36:18.260]   They had increased openness.
[02:36:18.260 --> 02:36:20.620]   Openness is supposed to actually go down over time.
[02:36:20.620 --> 02:36:22.740]   And these traits aren't supposed to be that malleable
[02:36:22.740 --> 02:36:27.060]   and it was significantly like altered, right?
[02:36:27.060 --> 02:36:31.400]   But imagine if you just created more openness in a person,
[02:36:31.400 --> 02:36:35.180]   and they're now open to a lot more
[02:36:35.180 --> 02:36:36.540]   and they wanna explore a lot more,
[02:36:36.540 --> 02:36:39.340]   but you don't give them the tools of discernment.
[02:36:39.340 --> 02:36:42.900]   That could be problematic for them in important ways.
[02:36:42.900 --> 02:36:44.020]   That could be very problematic.
[02:36:44.020 --> 02:36:45.380]   - Yes, I got it.
[02:36:45.380 --> 02:36:49.140]   But you know, so you have to land the plane
[02:36:49.140 --> 02:36:53.260]   in a productive way somehow,
[02:36:53.260 --> 02:36:54.720]   integrate it back into your life
[02:36:54.720 --> 02:36:55.700]   and how you see the world
[02:36:55.700 --> 02:36:58.220]   and how you frame your perception of that world.
[02:36:58.220 --> 02:37:00.220]   - And when people do that,
[02:37:00.220 --> 02:37:03.420]   that's when I call it a transformative experience.
[02:37:03.420 --> 02:37:05.060]   Now, the higher states of consciousness
[02:37:05.060 --> 02:37:07.340]   are really interesting because they tend to move people
[02:37:07.340 --> 02:37:11.500]   from a mystical experience into a transformative experience.
[02:37:11.500 --> 02:37:13.560]   'Cause what happens in these experiences
[02:37:13.560 --> 02:37:15.920]   is something really, really interesting.
[02:37:15.920 --> 02:37:17.340]   They get to a state that's ineffable.
[02:37:17.340 --> 02:37:20.260]   They can't put it into words, they can't describe it,
[02:37:20.260 --> 02:37:24.020]   but they do this, they're in this state temporarily
[02:37:24.020 --> 02:37:25.920]   and then they come back and they do this.
[02:37:25.920 --> 02:37:27.940]   They say, "That was really real.
[02:37:27.940 --> 02:37:30.620]   "And this in comparison is less real."
[02:37:30.620 --> 02:37:32.860]   So I remember that platonic metadesire.
[02:37:32.860 --> 02:37:35.020]   I wanna change my life myself
[02:37:35.020 --> 02:37:37.900]   so that I'm more in conformity with that really real.
[02:37:37.900 --> 02:37:39.940]   And that is really odd, Lex,
[02:37:39.940 --> 02:37:42.920]   because normally when we go outside
[02:37:42.920 --> 02:37:46.720]   of our consensus intelligibility, like a dream state,
[02:37:46.720 --> 02:37:48.560]   we come back from it, we say,
[02:37:48.560 --> 02:37:51.480]   "That doesn't fit into everything, therefore it's unreal."
[02:37:51.480 --> 02:37:53.380]   They do the exact opposite.
[02:37:53.380 --> 02:37:54.740]   They come out of these states and they say,
[02:37:54.740 --> 02:37:57.760]   "That doesn't fit into this," right?
[02:37:57.760 --> 02:37:59.900]   Consensus, right, intelligibility.
[02:37:59.900 --> 02:38:01.500]   And that means this is less real.
[02:38:01.500 --> 02:38:03.200]   They do the exact opposite.
[02:38:03.200 --> 02:38:04.720]   And that fascinates me.
[02:38:04.720 --> 02:38:09.560]   Why do they flip our normal procedure
[02:38:09.560 --> 02:38:12.120]   about evaluating alternative states?
[02:38:12.120 --> 02:38:14.520]   And the thing is, those higher states of consciousness,
[02:38:14.520 --> 02:38:17.440]   precisely because they have that ontonormativity,
[02:38:17.440 --> 02:38:20.140]   the realness that demands that you make
[02:38:20.140 --> 02:38:21.180]   a change in your life,
[02:38:21.180 --> 02:38:25.300]   they serve to bridge between mystical experiences
[02:38:25.300 --> 02:38:26.640]   and genuine transformative experiences.
[02:38:26.640 --> 02:38:29.800]   - So you do think seeing those as more real is productive,
[02:38:29.800 --> 02:38:31.200]   'cause then you reach for them.
[02:38:31.200 --> 02:38:32.680]   - So Yadin's done work on it.
[02:38:32.680 --> 02:38:37.760]   Again, all of this stuff is recent,
[02:38:37.760 --> 02:38:39.360]   so we have to take it with a grain of salt,
[02:38:39.360 --> 02:38:42.760]   but by a lot of objective measure,
[02:38:42.760 --> 02:38:44.160]   people who do this,
[02:38:44.160 --> 02:38:46.080]   who have these higher states of consciousness
[02:38:46.080 --> 02:38:49.140]   and undertake the transformative process,
[02:38:49.140 --> 02:38:49.980]   their lives get better.
[02:38:49.980 --> 02:38:52.040]   Their relationships improve, right?
[02:38:52.040 --> 02:38:53.440]   Their sense of self improves.
[02:38:53.440 --> 02:38:56.040]   Their anxieties go down, depression.
[02:38:56.040 --> 02:38:58.120]   Like all of these other measures,
[02:38:58.120 --> 02:39:00.440]   the needles are moved on these measures
[02:39:00.440 --> 02:39:03.140]   by people undergoing this transformative experience.
[02:39:03.140 --> 02:39:05.580]   Their lives, by many of the criteria
[02:39:05.580 --> 02:39:07.940]   that we judge our lives to be good, get better.
[02:39:08.780 --> 02:39:11.020]   (sighs)
[02:39:11.020 --> 02:39:13.620]   - I have to ask you about this fascinating
[02:39:13.620 --> 02:39:15.140]   distributed cognition process
[02:39:15.140 --> 02:39:19.220]   that leads to mass formation of ideologies
[02:39:19.220 --> 02:39:22.500]   that have had an impact on our world.
[02:39:22.500 --> 02:39:23.860]   So you spoke about the clash
[02:39:23.860 --> 02:39:27.000]   of the two great pseudo-religious ideologies
[02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:29.460]   of Marxism and Nazism.
[02:39:29.460 --> 02:39:30.340]   - Yes.
[02:39:30.340 --> 02:39:33.020]   - Especially their clash on the Eastern Front.
[02:39:33.020 --> 02:39:34.740]   - Battle of Kursk.
[02:39:34.740 --> 02:39:37.720]   - Can you explain the origin of each of these?
[02:39:37.720 --> 02:39:40.940]   Marxism and Nazism,
[02:39:40.940 --> 02:39:44.100]   in a kind of way that we have been talking about,
[02:39:44.100 --> 02:39:45.720]   the formation of ideas.
[02:39:45.720 --> 02:39:49.200]   - Hegel is to Protestantism
[02:39:49.200 --> 02:39:51.220]   what Thomas Aquinas is to Catholicism.
[02:39:51.220 --> 02:39:55.780]   He was like the philosopher who took German Protestantism
[02:39:55.780 --> 02:40:00.780]   and also Kant and Fichte and Schelling,
[02:40:00.780 --> 02:40:06.060]   and he built a philosophical system.
[02:40:07.380 --> 02:40:08.860]   He explicitly said this, by the way.
[02:40:08.860 --> 02:40:11.980]   He wanted to bridge between philosophy and religion.
[02:40:11.980 --> 02:40:13.320]   He explicitly said that.
[02:40:13.320 --> 02:40:14.780]   I'm not foisting that on him.
[02:40:14.780 --> 02:40:18.180]   He said it repeatedly in many different places.
[02:40:18.180 --> 02:40:20.620]   So he was trying to create a philosophical system
[02:40:20.620 --> 02:40:24.100]   that gathered to it, I think,
[02:40:24.100 --> 02:40:27.180]   the core mythos of Christianity.
[02:40:27.180 --> 02:40:30.140]   Core mythos of Christianity is this idea
[02:40:30.140 --> 02:40:32.940]   of a narrative structure to reality
[02:40:32.940 --> 02:40:35.260]   in which progress is real,
[02:40:35.260 --> 02:40:38.780]   in which our actions now can change the future.
[02:40:38.780 --> 02:40:41.320]   We can co-participate with God
[02:40:41.320 --> 02:40:43.140]   in the creation of the future,
[02:40:43.140 --> 02:40:44.540]   and that future can be better.
[02:40:44.540 --> 02:40:46.700]   It can reach something like a utopia
[02:40:46.700 --> 02:40:49.160]   or the promised land or whatever.
[02:40:49.160 --> 02:40:51.620]   He created a philosophical system of brilliance,
[02:40:51.620 --> 02:40:52.460]   by the way.
[02:40:52.460 --> 02:40:53.300]   He's a genius.
[02:40:53.300 --> 02:40:57.500]   But basically what it did was it took that religious vision
[02:40:57.500 --> 02:41:01.820]   and gave it the air of philosophical intelligibility
[02:41:01.820 --> 02:41:02.920]   and respect.
[02:41:04.140 --> 02:41:06.940]   And then Marx takes that and says,
[02:41:06.940 --> 02:41:09.660]   you know that process by which the narrative
[02:41:09.660 --> 02:41:12.380]   is working itself out that Hegel called dialectic?
[02:41:12.380 --> 02:41:14.820]   I don't think it's primarily happening in ideas.
[02:41:14.820 --> 02:41:17.700]   I think it's happening primarily between classes
[02:41:17.700 --> 02:41:20.740]   within socioeconomic factors, but it's the same story.
[02:41:20.740 --> 02:41:22.940]   Here's this mechanism of history.
[02:41:22.940 --> 02:41:24.420]   It's teleological.
[02:41:24.420 --> 02:41:26.200]   It's gonna move this way.
[02:41:26.200 --> 02:41:27.820]   It can move towards a utopia.
[02:41:27.820 --> 02:41:31.580]   We can either participate in furthering it,
[02:41:31.580 --> 02:41:33.940]   like participating in the work of God,
[02:41:33.940 --> 02:41:37.060]   or we can thwart it and be against it.
[02:41:37.060 --> 02:41:40.960]   And so you have a pseudo-religious vision.
[02:41:40.960 --> 02:41:42.540]   It's all-encompassing.
[02:41:42.540 --> 02:41:44.380]   Think about how Marxism is not
[02:41:44.380 --> 02:41:45.780]   just a philosophical position.
[02:41:45.780 --> 02:41:47.900]   It's not just an economic position.
[02:41:47.900 --> 02:41:52.900]   It's an entire worldview, an entire account of history
[02:41:52.900 --> 02:41:57.940]   and a demanding account of what human excellence is.
[02:41:57.940 --> 02:42:01.300]   And it has all these things about participating,
[02:42:01.300 --> 02:42:03.860]   belonging, fitting to.
[02:42:03.860 --> 02:42:08.100]   But it's very, in Marx's case, it's very pragmatic
[02:42:08.100 --> 02:42:13.540]   or directly applicable to society
[02:42:13.540 --> 02:42:17.300]   to where it leads to, it more naturally leads
[02:42:17.300 --> 02:42:18.700]   to political ideologies.
[02:42:18.700 --> 02:42:22.640]   - It does, but I think Marx, to a very significant degree,
[02:42:22.640 --> 02:42:26.140]   inherits one of Hegel's main flaws.
[02:42:26.140 --> 02:42:27.780]   Hegel is talking about all this,
[02:42:27.780 --> 02:42:32.740]   and he's trying to fit it into post-Kantian philosophy.
[02:42:32.740 --> 02:42:37.740]   So for him, it's ultimately propositional, conceptual.
[02:42:37.740 --> 02:42:40.140]   He, like everybody after Descartes,
[02:42:40.140 --> 02:42:42.940]   is very focused on the propositional level,
[02:42:42.940 --> 02:42:45.980]   and he's not paying deep attention
[02:42:45.980 --> 02:42:48.220]   to the non-propositional.
[02:42:48.220 --> 02:42:51.820]   This is why the two great critics of Hegel,
[02:42:51.820 --> 02:42:52.860]   Nietzsche and Kierkegaard,
[02:42:52.860 --> 02:42:54.700]   they're trying to put their finger
[02:42:54.700 --> 02:42:57.300]   on the non-propositional, the non-conceptual,
[02:42:57.300 --> 02:43:00.060]   the will to power or faith in Kierkegaard,
[02:43:00.060 --> 02:43:03.060]   and they're trying to bring out all these other kinds
[02:43:03.060 --> 02:43:04.540]   of knowing as being inadequate.
[02:43:04.540 --> 02:43:06.020]   That's why Kierkegaard meant when he said,
[02:43:06.020 --> 02:43:08.980]   Hegel made a system and then he sat down beside it.
[02:43:08.980 --> 02:43:16.100]   And so Marxism is very much, it is activist.
[02:43:16.100 --> 02:43:18.620]   It's about reorganizing society,
[02:43:18.620 --> 02:43:21.220]   but the transformation in individuals
[02:43:21.220 --> 02:43:24.940]   is largely ideological, meaning it's largely
[02:43:24.940 --> 02:43:29.220]   about these significant propositional changes
[02:43:29.220 --> 02:43:31.300]   and adopting a set of beliefs.
[02:43:31.300 --> 02:43:34.540]   - When it came in contact with the Soviet Union,
[02:43:34.540 --> 02:43:37.340]   or with what became the Soviet Union,
[02:43:37.340 --> 02:43:40.060]   why do you think it had such a powerful hold
[02:43:40.060 --> 02:43:41.820]   on such a large number of people?
[02:43:41.820 --> 02:43:45.860]   Not Marxism, but implementation of Marxism
[02:43:45.860 --> 02:43:47.820]   in the name of communism?
[02:43:47.820 --> 02:43:49.840]   - Because it offered people,
[02:43:49.840 --> 02:43:55.060]   I mean, it offered people something
[02:43:55.060 --> 02:43:57.940]   that typically only religions had offered,
[02:43:57.940 --> 02:44:02.940]   and it offered people the hope of making a new man,
[02:44:02.940 --> 02:44:07.500]   a new kind of human being in a new world.
[02:44:07.500 --> 02:44:09.920]   And when you've been living in Russia,
[02:44:09.920 --> 02:44:16.420]   in which things seem to be locked in a system
[02:44:16.420 --> 02:44:18.700]   that is crushing most people,
[02:44:18.700 --> 02:44:23.700]   getting the promise in the air of scientific legitimacy,
[02:44:25.080 --> 02:44:29.560]   that we can make new human beings in a new world,
[02:44:29.560 --> 02:44:32.140]   and in which happiness will ensue,
[02:44:32.140 --> 02:44:34.480]   that's an intoxicating proposal.
[02:44:34.480 --> 02:44:35.880]   You get sort of, like I said,
[02:44:35.880 --> 02:44:40.760]   you get all of the intoxication of a religious utopia,
[02:44:40.760 --> 02:44:43.280]   but you get all the seeming legitimacy
[02:44:43.280 --> 02:44:47.400]   of claiming that it's a scientific understanding
[02:44:47.400 --> 02:44:49.600]   of history and economics.
[02:44:49.600 --> 02:44:51.880]   - It's very popular to criticize communism,
[02:44:51.880 --> 02:44:53.720]   Marxism these days.
[02:44:53.720 --> 02:44:56.920]   And I often put myself in the place
[02:44:56.920 --> 02:44:59.740]   before any of the implementations came to be.
[02:44:59.740 --> 02:45:04.640]   I tried to think if I would be able to predict
[02:45:04.640 --> 02:45:10.000]   what the implementations of Marxism and communism
[02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:12.120]   would result in in the 20th century.
[02:45:12.120 --> 02:45:16.180]   And I'm not sure I'm smart enough to make that prediction,
[02:45:16.180 --> 02:45:21.180]   because at the core of the ideas are respecting,
[02:45:21.400 --> 02:45:24.800]   and with Marx, it's very economics type theory,
[02:45:24.800 --> 02:45:28.080]   so it's basically respecting the value of the worker
[02:45:28.080 --> 02:45:32.360]   and the regular man in society
[02:45:32.360 --> 02:45:35.320]   for making a contribution to that society.
[02:45:35.320 --> 02:45:39.620]   And to me, that seems like a powerful idea,
[02:45:39.620 --> 02:45:42.780]   and it's not clear to me how it goes wrong.
[02:45:42.780 --> 02:45:46.040]   In fact, it's still not clear to me
[02:45:46.040 --> 02:45:50.520]   why the hell did this, like, would Stalin happen,
[02:45:50.520 --> 02:45:51.760]   or Mao happen?
[02:45:51.760 --> 02:45:54.800]   There's something very interesting and complex
[02:45:54.800 --> 02:45:57.440]   about human nature in hierarchies,
[02:45:57.440 --> 02:45:59.760]   about distributed cognition, the results in that.
[02:45:59.760 --> 02:46:01.840]   And it's not trivial to understand.
[02:46:01.840 --> 02:46:02.920]   - No, no.
[02:46:02.920 --> 02:46:06.080]   - So I wonder if you could put a finger on it.
[02:46:06.080 --> 02:46:08.680]   Why did it go so wrong?
[02:46:08.680 --> 02:46:11.720]   - So I think what O'Hanna talks about
[02:46:11.720 --> 02:46:15.360]   in The Intellectual History of Modernity,
[02:46:17.320 --> 02:46:21.960]   talks about the Promethean spirit,
[02:46:21.960 --> 02:46:27.640]   the idea, the really radical proposal,
[02:46:27.640 --> 02:46:30.160]   and think about how it's not so radical to us.
[02:46:30.160 --> 02:46:33.480]   And in that sense, Marxism has succeeded.
[02:46:33.480 --> 02:46:35.480]   The radical proposal that you see,
[02:46:35.480 --> 02:46:37.080]   even in the French Revolution,
[02:46:37.080 --> 02:46:39.200]   and don't forget the terror comes
[02:46:39.200 --> 02:46:40.700]   in the French Revolution, too,
[02:46:40.700 --> 02:46:46.120]   that we can make ourselves into godlike beings.
[02:46:46.120 --> 02:46:47.720]   Think of the hubris in that.
[02:46:47.720 --> 02:46:51.960]   And think of the overconfidence to think
[02:46:51.960 --> 02:46:54.120]   that we so understand human nature
[02:46:54.120 --> 02:46:56.480]   and all of its complexities and human history,
[02:46:56.480 --> 02:46:59.800]   and how religion functioned,
[02:46:59.800 --> 02:47:03.820]   that we can just come in with a plan and make it run.
[02:47:03.820 --> 02:47:07.720]   To my mind, that Promethean spirit
[02:47:07.720 --> 02:47:11.200]   is part of why it's doomed to fail,
[02:47:11.200 --> 02:47:15.320]   and it's doomed to fail in a kind of terrorizing way
[02:47:15.320 --> 02:47:20.320]   because the Promethean spirit really licenses you
[02:47:20.320 --> 02:47:25.480]   to do anything 'cause the ends justify the means.
[02:47:25.480 --> 02:47:28.680]   - Does the end justify the means really free you
[02:47:28.680 --> 02:47:32.000]   to do some of basically,
[02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:36.600]   well, commit atrocities at any scale?
[02:47:36.600 --> 02:47:39.720]   - Ground Zero with Pol Pot and the Camarouge, right?
[02:47:39.720 --> 02:47:44.000]   Exactly, and you can only believe
[02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:46.160]   in an ends that can justify any means.
[02:47:46.160 --> 02:47:48.240]   If you believe in a utopia,
[02:47:48.240 --> 02:47:49.800]   and you can only believe in the utopia
[02:47:49.800 --> 02:47:52.480]   if you really buy into the Promethean spirit.
[02:47:52.480 --> 02:47:55.320]   - So is that what explains Nazism?
[02:47:55.320 --> 02:47:58.080]   - So Nazism is part of that, too.
[02:47:58.080 --> 02:48:00.800]   The Promethean spirit that we can make ourselves
[02:48:00.800 --> 02:48:05.280]   into supermen, ubermench, right?
[02:48:05.280 --> 02:48:10.280]   And Nazism is fueled very much
[02:48:11.680 --> 02:48:16.680]   by appropriating and twisting sort of Gnostic themes
[02:48:16.680 --> 02:48:20.160]   that are very prevalent.
[02:48:20.160 --> 02:48:23.440]   Gnosticism tends to come to the fore
[02:48:23.440 --> 02:48:27.440]   when people are experiencing increased meaning crisis.
[02:48:27.440 --> 02:48:29.280]   And don't forget, the Weimar Republic
[02:48:29.280 --> 02:48:33.360]   is like a meaning crisis gone crazy on all levels.
[02:48:33.360 --> 02:48:35.000]   Everybody's suffering domicile.
[02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:38.000]   Everybody's home and way of life and identity
[02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:40.560]   and culture and relationship to religion and science.
[02:48:40.560 --> 02:48:43.040]   All of that, right?
[02:48:43.040 --> 02:48:48.040]   And so Nazism comes along and offers a kind of Gnosticism.
[02:48:48.040 --> 02:48:50.360]   Again, twisted, perverted.
[02:48:50.360 --> 02:48:55.360]   I'm not saying that all Gnostics are Nazis,
[02:48:55.360 --> 02:48:59.680]   but there is this Gnostic mythology, mythos,
[02:48:59.680 --> 02:49:01.800]   and it comes to the fore.
[02:49:01.800 --> 02:49:04.160]   I remember, and this stuck with me.
[02:49:04.160 --> 02:49:06.800]   In undergrad, I was taking political science,
[02:49:08.840 --> 02:49:11.480]   and the professor extended lecture on this,
[02:49:11.480 --> 02:49:13.320]   and it still rings true for me.
[02:49:13.320 --> 02:49:14.920]   Says, "If you understand Nazism
[02:49:14.920 --> 02:49:17.980]   "as just a political movement, you have misunderstood it.
[02:49:17.980 --> 02:49:22.980]   "It is much more a religious phenomenon in many ways."
[02:49:22.980 --> 02:49:27.480]   - Is it religious in that the loss of religion,
[02:49:27.480 --> 02:49:32.480]   so is it a meaning crisis, or is it out of a meaning crisis
[02:49:32.480 --> 02:49:38.660]   every discovery of religion in a Promethean type of,
[02:49:39.180 --> 02:49:40.260]   - I think it's the latter.
[02:49:40.260 --> 02:49:43.580]   I think there's this vacuum created.
[02:49:43.580 --> 02:49:48.300]   - In that context, is Hitler the central religious figure?
[02:49:48.300 --> 02:49:49.140]   - Yes.
[02:49:49.140 --> 02:49:53.100]   - And also, did Nazi Germany create Hitler,
[02:49:53.100 --> 02:49:56.220]   or did Hitler create Nazi Germany?
[02:49:56.220 --> 02:49:58.300]   So in this distributed cognition
[02:49:58.300 --> 02:50:00.140]   where everyone's having a dialogue,
[02:50:00.140 --> 02:50:02.660]   what's the role of a charismatic leader?
[02:50:02.660 --> 02:50:06.900]   Is it an emergent phenomena, or do you need one of those
[02:50:06.900 --> 02:50:10.260]   to kind of guide the populace?
[02:50:10.260 --> 02:50:13.540]   - I hope it's not a necessary requirement.
[02:50:13.540 --> 02:50:15.820]   I hope that the next Buddha can be the Sangha
[02:50:15.820 --> 02:50:17.640]   rather than a specific individual.
[02:50:17.640 --> 02:50:21.700]   But I think in that situation,
[02:50:21.700 --> 02:50:26.420]   Hitler's charisma allowed him to take on a mythological,
[02:50:26.420 --> 02:50:29.340]   in the proper sense, archetypal,
[02:50:29.340 --> 02:50:31.180]   he became deeply symbolic,
[02:50:31.180 --> 02:50:34.500]   and he instituted all kinds of rituals,
[02:50:34.500 --> 02:50:38.460]   all kinds of rituals and all kinds of mythos.
[02:50:38.460 --> 02:50:41.580]   There's all this mythos about the master race,
[02:50:41.580 --> 02:50:43.700]   and there's all these rituals.
[02:50:43.700 --> 02:50:47.660]   The swastika is, of course, itself a religious symbol.
[02:50:47.660 --> 02:50:50.140]   There's all of this going on because
[02:50:50.140 --> 02:50:56.340]   he was tapping into the fact that
[02:50:56.340 --> 02:51:00.940]   when you put people into deeper and deeper meaning scarcity,
[02:51:00.940 --> 02:51:04.780]   they will fall back on more and more mythological ways
[02:51:04.780 --> 02:51:07.180]   of thinking in order to try and come up
[02:51:07.180 --> 02:51:11.220]   with a generative source to give them new meaning-making,
[02:51:11.220 --> 02:51:14.240]   I should say, meaning-participating behavior.
[02:51:14.240 --> 02:51:17.180]   - What is evil?
[02:51:17.180 --> 02:51:21.140]   Is this a word you avoid?
[02:51:21.140 --> 02:51:25.820]   - No, I don't, because I think part of
[02:51:25.820 --> 02:51:29.120]   what we're wrestling with here
[02:51:29.120 --> 02:51:31.620]   is resisting the Enlightenment,
[02:51:31.620 --> 02:51:34.420]   I mean the historical period in Europe,
[02:51:34.420 --> 02:51:39.420]   the idea that evil and sin can just be reduced to immorality,
[02:51:39.420 --> 02:51:42.660]   individual human immorality.
[02:51:42.660 --> 02:51:47.760]   I think there's something deeper in the idea of sin
[02:51:47.760 --> 02:51:49.260]   than just immoral.
[02:51:49.260 --> 02:51:53.100]   I think sin is a much more comprehensive category.
[02:51:53.100 --> 02:51:56.580]   I think sin is a failure to love wisely
[02:51:56.580 --> 02:52:01.320]   so that you ultimately engage in a kind of idolatry.
[02:52:01.320 --> 02:52:04.980]   You take something as ultimate, which is not.
[02:52:04.980 --> 02:52:07.540]   And that can tend to constellate
[02:52:07.540 --> 02:52:13.360]   these collective agents, I call them hyperagents,
[02:52:13.360 --> 02:52:17.040]   within distributed cognition that have a capacity
[02:52:17.040 --> 02:52:21.000]   to wreak havoc on the world that is not just due
[02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:25.080]   to a sort of a sum total of immoral decisions.
[02:52:25.080 --> 02:52:27.900]   You know, this goes to Hannah Arendt's thing, right?
[02:52:27.900 --> 02:52:30.140]   And the banality of Eichmann.
[02:52:30.140 --> 02:52:31.420]   She was really wrestling with it.
[02:52:31.420 --> 02:52:33.740]   And I think she's close to something,
[02:52:33.740 --> 02:52:35.560]   but I think she's slightly off.
[02:52:35.560 --> 02:52:37.160]   You know, Eichmann is just making a whole bunch
[02:52:37.160 --> 02:52:40.940]   of immoral decisions, but it doesn't seem to capture
[02:52:40.940 --> 02:52:43.740]   the gravity of what the Nazis did,
[02:52:43.740 --> 02:52:45.660]   the genocide and the warfare.
[02:52:45.660 --> 02:52:49.100]   And she's right, because you're not gonna get
[02:52:49.100 --> 02:52:51.280]   just the summation of a lot of individual,
[02:52:51.280 --> 02:52:54.400]   rather banal, immoral choices adding up
[02:52:54.400 --> 02:52:55.880]   to what was going on.
[02:52:55.880 --> 02:53:00.320]   You're getting a comprehensive parasitic process
[02:53:00.320 --> 02:53:02.700]   within massive distributed cognition
[02:53:02.700 --> 02:53:07.080]   that has the power to confront the world
[02:53:07.080 --> 02:53:10.320]   and confront aspects of the world that individuals can't.
[02:53:10.320 --> 02:53:13.040]   And I think when we're talking about evil,
[02:53:13.040 --> 02:53:14.400]   that's what we're trying to point to.
[02:53:14.400 --> 02:53:16.200]   This is a point of convergence
[02:53:16.200 --> 02:53:18.160]   between me and Jonathan Pajot.
[02:53:18.160 --> 02:53:19.880]   We've been talking about this.
[02:53:19.880 --> 02:53:21.640]   - So the word sin is interesting.
[02:53:21.640 --> 02:53:22.480]   - Yes.
[02:53:22.480 --> 02:53:24.120]   - Are you comfortable using the word sin?
[02:53:24.120 --> 02:53:24.960]   - I'm comfortable.
[02:53:24.960 --> 02:53:27.240]   - Because it's so deeply rooted in religious texts.
[02:53:27.240 --> 02:53:28.080]   - It is, it is.
[02:53:28.080 --> 02:53:31.360]   And in part, and I struggle around this,
[02:53:31.360 --> 02:53:35.240]   because I was brought up as a fundamentalist Christian.
[02:53:35.240 --> 02:53:38.680]   And so that is still there within me.
[02:53:38.680 --> 02:53:41.000]   There's trauma associated with that.
[02:53:41.000 --> 02:53:45.800]   - Probably layers of self-deception mechanisms.
[02:53:45.800 --> 02:53:47.120]   - No doubt, no doubt.
[02:53:47.120 --> 02:53:49.300]   - That you're slowly escaping.
[02:53:49.300 --> 02:53:51.320]   - Trying to, and trying to come into
[02:53:51.320 --> 02:53:56.320]   a proper respectful relationship with Christianity
[02:53:56.320 --> 02:54:00.080]   via a detour through Buddhism, Taoism,
[02:54:00.080 --> 02:54:01.800]   and pagan neoplatonism.
[02:54:01.800 --> 02:54:04.120]   - Trying to find a way how to love wisely.
[02:54:04.120 --> 02:54:05.320]   - Yes, exactly.
[02:54:05.320 --> 02:54:09.240]   And so I think the term sin is good
[02:54:09.240 --> 02:54:14.100]   because somebody may not be doing something
[02:54:14.100 --> 02:54:17.140]   that we would prototypically call immoral,
[02:54:18.080 --> 02:54:21.160]   but if they're failing to love wisely,
[02:54:21.160 --> 02:54:26.160]   they are disconnecting themselves
[02:54:26.160 --> 02:54:30.260]   in some important way from the structures of reality.
[02:54:30.260 --> 02:54:34.740]   And I think it was Hume, I may be wrong.
[02:54:34.740 --> 02:54:37.560]   Hume says, "People don't do things
[02:54:37.560 --> 02:54:39.140]   "because they think it's wrong.
[02:54:39.140 --> 02:54:42.240]   "They do a lesser good in place of a greater good."
[02:54:42.240 --> 02:54:46.020]   And that's a different thing than being immoral.
[02:54:46.020 --> 02:54:46.980]   Immoral, we're saying,
[02:54:46.980 --> 02:54:48.220]   "Oh, you're doing something that's wrong."
[02:54:48.220 --> 02:54:51.680]   It's like, "Well, no, no, I'm loving my wife.
[02:54:51.680 --> 02:54:54.140]   "That's a great thing, isn't it?"
[02:54:54.140 --> 02:54:55.500]   Yeah, but if you love your wife
[02:54:55.500 --> 02:54:57.100]   at the expense of your kids,
[02:54:57.100 --> 02:55:01.560]   like, "Ah, maybe something's going awry here.
[02:55:01.560 --> 02:55:03.860]   "Well, I love my country, great."
[02:55:03.860 --> 02:55:05.400]   But should you love your country
[02:55:05.400 --> 02:55:08.520]   at the expense of your commitment
[02:55:08.520 --> 02:55:10.340]   to the religion you belong to?
[02:55:10.340 --> 02:55:13.620]   Like, people should wrestle with these questions.
[02:55:13.620 --> 02:55:15.060]   And I think sin is a failure
[02:55:15.060 --> 02:55:17.980]   to wrestle with these questions properly.
[02:55:17.980 --> 02:55:20.660]   - Yeah, to be content with the choices you've made
[02:55:20.660 --> 02:55:21.900]   without considering,
[02:55:21.900 --> 02:55:25.940]   is there a greater good that could be done?
[02:55:25.940 --> 02:55:27.420]   - Yeah.
[02:55:27.420 --> 02:55:29.820]   - Your lecture series on the meaning crisis
[02:55:29.820 --> 02:55:33.780]   puts us in dialogue in the same way as with the podcast
[02:55:33.780 --> 02:55:37.980]   with a bunch of fascinating thinkers throughout history.
[02:55:37.980 --> 02:55:42.980]   Heidegger, Corbyn, the man Carl Jung, Tillich, Barfield.
[02:55:44.700 --> 02:55:46.780]   Can you describe, this might be challenging,
[02:55:46.780 --> 02:55:51.780]   but one powerful idea from each that jumps to mind?
[02:55:51.780 --> 02:55:54.820]   - Yes. - Maybe Heidegger.
[02:55:54.820 --> 02:55:59.060]   - So for Heidegger, one real powerful idea
[02:55:59.060 --> 02:56:01.540]   that has had a huge influence on me,
[02:56:01.540 --> 02:56:03.980]   he's had a huge influence on me in many ways.
[02:56:03.980 --> 02:56:05.700]   He's a big influence on what's called
[02:56:05.700 --> 02:56:07.140]   4E cognitive science,
[02:56:07.140 --> 02:56:09.480]   and this whole idea about the non-propositional.
[02:56:09.480 --> 02:56:13.880]   That was deeply afforded by Heidegger and Marlowe Ponty.
[02:56:13.880 --> 02:56:16.820]   But I guess maybe the one idea, if I had to pick one,
[02:56:16.820 --> 02:56:19.300]   is his critique of ontotheology,
[02:56:19.300 --> 02:56:22.660]   his critique of the attempt to understand being
[02:56:22.660 --> 02:56:24.980]   in terms of a supreme being, something like that,
[02:56:24.980 --> 02:56:27.540]   and how that gets us fundamentally messed up,
[02:56:27.540 --> 02:56:30.580]   and we get disconnected from being
[02:56:30.580 --> 02:56:33.220]   because we are over-focused on particular beings.
[02:56:33.220 --> 02:56:34.820]   We're failing to love wisely.
[02:56:34.820 --> 02:56:36.780]   We're loving the individual things,
[02:56:36.780 --> 02:56:40.100]   and we're not loving the ground from which they spring.
[02:56:40.100 --> 02:56:42.100]   - Can you explain that a little more?
[02:56:42.100 --> 02:56:43.340]   What's the difference between the being
[02:56:43.340 --> 02:56:45.860]   and the supreme being, and why that gets us into trouble?
[02:56:45.860 --> 02:56:48.500]   - Okay, so, well, we talked about this before.
[02:56:48.500 --> 02:56:51.100]   The supreme being is a particular being,
[02:56:51.100 --> 02:56:52.740]   whereas being is no thing.
[02:56:52.740 --> 02:56:54.580]   It's not any particular kind of thing.
[02:56:54.580 --> 02:56:58.380]   And so if you're thinking of being as a being,
[02:56:58.380 --> 02:57:00.220]   you're thinking of it in a thingy way
[02:57:00.220 --> 02:57:02.980]   about something that is fundamentally no thingness.
[02:57:02.980 --> 02:57:05.340]   And so then you're disconnecting yourself
[02:57:05.340 --> 02:57:08.240]   from presumably ultimate reality.
[02:57:08.240 --> 02:57:10.280]   This takes me to Tillich.
[02:57:10.280 --> 02:57:12.940]   Tillich's great idea is understanding faith
[02:57:12.940 --> 02:57:17.940]   as ultimate concern, rather than a set of propositions
[02:57:17.940 --> 02:57:20.420]   that you're asserting, right?
[02:57:20.420 --> 02:57:25.020]   So what are you ultimately concerned about?
[02:57:25.020 --> 02:57:26.440]   What do you want to have,
[02:57:26.440 --> 02:57:28.980]   what do you want to be in right relationship to?
[02:57:28.980 --> 02:57:33.900]   Ratio religio, what, and is that ultimate?
[02:57:33.900 --> 02:57:36.300]   Is that the ultimate reality that you conceive of?
[02:57:36.300 --> 02:57:38.780]   Are those two things in sync?
[02:57:38.780 --> 02:57:42.420]   This has had a profound influence on me,
[02:57:42.420 --> 02:57:44.220]   and I think it's a brilliant idea.
[02:57:44.220 --> 02:57:47.260]   - So some of the others, how do they integrate?
[02:57:47.260 --> 02:57:53.560]   Maybe the psychos, so Carl Jung and Freud.
[02:57:53.560 --> 02:57:55.340]   Which team are you on?
[02:57:55.340 --> 02:57:56.860]   - I'm on Jung.
[02:57:56.860 --> 02:57:58.980]   Freud is the better writer,
[02:57:58.980 --> 02:58:02.340]   but Jung has, I think, a model of the psyche
[02:58:02.340 --> 02:58:05.660]   that is closer to where cognitive science is heading.
[02:58:05.660 --> 02:58:07.060]   He's more prescient.
[02:58:07.060 --> 02:58:09.140]   - Which aspect of his model of the psyche?
[02:58:09.140 --> 02:58:11.520]   - Directly, so Freud has a hydraulic model,
[02:58:11.520 --> 02:58:12.900]   the psyche's like a steam engine,
[02:58:12.900 --> 02:58:14.340]   things are under pressure,
[02:58:14.340 --> 02:58:16.300]   and there's a fluid that's moving around,
[02:58:16.300 --> 02:58:17.420]   it's like, (imitates explosion)
[02:58:17.420 --> 02:58:19.740]   like this is, Record noted this.
[02:58:19.740 --> 02:58:21.740]   Jung has an organic model.
[02:58:21.740 --> 02:58:23.980]   The psyche is like a living being.
[02:58:23.980 --> 02:58:26.320]   It's doing all this opponent processing,
[02:58:26.320 --> 02:58:30.660]   it's doing all of this self-transcending and growing,
[02:58:30.660 --> 02:58:33.420]   and I think that's a much better model of the psyche
[02:58:33.420 --> 02:58:36.940]   than the sort of steam engine model.
[02:58:36.940 --> 02:58:38.300]   - What do you think about their view
[02:58:38.300 --> 02:58:40.820]   of the subconscious mind?
[02:58:40.820 --> 02:58:43.740]   What do you think their view and your own view
[02:58:43.740 --> 02:58:46.340]   of what's going on there in the shadow?
[02:58:46.340 --> 02:58:49.260]   - So-- - All bad stuff?
[02:58:49.260 --> 02:58:50.420]   Some good stuff?
[02:58:50.420 --> 02:58:53.500]   Any stuff at all?
[02:58:53.500 --> 02:58:56.340]   - Well, I mean, both Freud and Jung
[02:58:56.340 --> 02:59:00.140]   are only talking about the psychodynamic unconscious,
[02:59:00.140 --> 02:59:02.380]   which is only a small part of the unconscious.
[02:59:02.380 --> 02:59:03.940]   - Can you elaborate?
[02:59:03.940 --> 02:59:05.100]   - They're talking about-- - The psychodynamic?
[02:59:05.100 --> 02:59:08.860]   - They're talking about the aspects of the unconscious
[02:59:08.860 --> 02:59:12.820]   that have to do with your sort of ego development
[02:59:12.820 --> 02:59:17.740]   and how you are understanding and interpreting yourself.
[02:59:17.740 --> 02:59:19.460]   - Yeah, what else is there?
[02:59:19.460 --> 02:59:21.420]   - There's the unconscious that allows you
[02:59:21.420 --> 02:59:24.420]   to turn the noise coming out of my face hole into ideas.
[02:59:24.420 --> 02:59:25.860]   - Also-- - There's the unconscious--
[02:59:25.860 --> 02:59:27.700]   - The face, memory access, all that.
[02:59:27.700 --> 02:59:31.100]   - All that stuff, which is huge and powerful.
[02:59:31.100 --> 02:59:33.100]   - And they didn't think about that.
[02:59:33.100 --> 02:59:35.380]   They were focused on the big romantic stuff
[02:59:35.380 --> 02:59:37.280]   that you have to deal with through psychotherapy,
[02:59:37.280 --> 02:59:38.440]   that kind of stuff.
[02:59:38.440 --> 02:59:39.780]   Which is relevant and important.
[02:59:39.780 --> 02:59:41.560]   I'm not dismissing, I'm not saying it doesn't exist,
[02:59:41.560 --> 02:59:44.180]   but it's certainly not all of the unconscious.
[02:59:44.180 --> 02:59:46.020]   A lot of work that's going on,
[02:59:46.020 --> 02:59:49.380]   my colleague and deep friend Anderson Todd,
[02:59:49.380 --> 02:59:51.940]   is about can we take the Jungian stuff
[02:59:51.940 --> 02:59:52.780]   and the cognitive science stuff
[02:59:52.780 --> 02:59:55.340]   and can we integrate it together, theoretically?
[02:59:55.340 --> 02:59:58.200]   And so he's working on that, exactly that project.
[02:59:58.200 --> 03:00:02.300]   - But nevertheless, your sense is there is a subconscious.
[03:00:02.300 --> 03:00:03.340]   - Or at least an unconscious.
[03:00:03.340 --> 03:00:05.060]   I like the term unconscious.
[03:00:05.060 --> 03:00:07.380]   And Jung continually reminded people
[03:00:07.380 --> 03:00:09.740]   that the unconscious is unconscious,
[03:00:09.740 --> 03:00:11.220]   that we're not conscious of it.
[03:00:11.220 --> 03:00:13.580]   And that's its fundamental property.
[03:00:13.580 --> 03:00:17.660]   - Yeah, and then isn't the task of therapy then
[03:00:17.660 --> 03:00:21.260]   to make the unconscious conscious?
[03:00:21.260 --> 03:00:23.420]   - Yeah, to a degree, right?
[03:00:23.420 --> 03:00:28.420]   But also, I mean, yeah, to bring consciousness
[03:00:28.420 --> 03:00:32.620]   where there was unconscious is part of Jung's mythos.
[03:00:32.620 --> 03:00:36.460]   But it's also not the thought that that can be completed.
[03:00:36.460 --> 03:00:40.220]   Part of why you're extending the reach of the conscious mind
[03:00:40.220 --> 03:00:43.220]   is so it can enter into more proper
[03:00:43.220 --> 03:00:47.660]   dialogical relationship with the self-organizing system
[03:00:47.660 --> 03:00:48.940]   of the unconscious mind.
[03:00:48.940 --> 03:00:50.980]   - What did they have to say
[03:00:50.980 --> 03:00:53.100]   about the motivations of humans?
[03:00:53.100 --> 03:00:56.700]   So for Freud, jokingly, I said, you know, sex.
[03:00:56.700 --> 03:01:00.860]   So much of our mind is developed in our young age,
[03:01:00.860 --> 03:01:03.520]   sexual interactions with the world or whatever.
[03:01:04.420 --> 03:01:07.820]   Hence the thing about the edible complex
[03:01:07.820 --> 03:01:10.660]   and all, you know, I wanted to have sex with your mother.
[03:01:10.660 --> 03:01:14.060]   What do you think about their description
[03:01:14.060 --> 03:01:16.020]   about what motivates humans?
[03:01:16.020 --> 03:01:21.020]   And what do you think about the will to power from Nietzsche?
[03:01:21.020 --> 03:01:23.980]   Which camp are you in there?
[03:01:23.980 --> 03:01:25.680]   What motivates humans?
[03:01:25.680 --> 03:01:29.020]   Sex or power?
[03:01:29.020 --> 03:01:30.660]   - I think Plato's right.
[03:01:30.660 --> 03:01:33.140]   And I think there's a connection for me.
[03:01:33.140 --> 03:01:35.700]   Plato's my first philosopher, Jung's my first psychologist,
[03:01:35.700 --> 03:01:37.660]   and Jung is very much the Plato of the psyche.
[03:01:37.660 --> 03:01:38.820]   - You never forget your first.
[03:01:38.820 --> 03:01:40.860]   - Yep, you never do, you never do.
[03:01:40.860 --> 03:01:45.860]   And I think we have, I reject the monological mind,
[03:01:45.860 --> 03:01:50.060]   I reject the monophasic mind model.
[03:01:50.060 --> 03:01:51.740]   I think we are multi-centered.
[03:01:51.740 --> 03:01:54.500]   I think we have different centers of motivation
[03:01:54.500 --> 03:01:57.220]   that operate according to different principles
[03:01:57.220 --> 03:01:59.460]   to satisfy different problems.
[03:02:01.500 --> 03:02:04.940]   And that part of the task of our humanity
[03:02:04.940 --> 03:02:09.940]   is to get those different centers into some internal culture
[03:02:09.940 --> 03:02:13.980]   by which they are optimally cooperating
[03:02:13.980 --> 03:02:16.060]   rather than in conflict with each other.
[03:02:16.060 --> 03:02:22.660]   - What advice would you give to young people today?
[03:02:22.660 --> 03:02:24.660]   They're in high school, trying to figure out
[03:02:24.660 --> 03:02:25.780]   what they're gonna do with their life,
[03:02:25.780 --> 03:02:27.020]   maybe they're in college.
[03:02:27.020 --> 03:02:30.520]   What advice would you give how to have a career
[03:02:30.520 --> 03:02:32.740]   they can be proud of or how to have a life
[03:02:32.740 --> 03:02:33.840]   they can be proud of?
[03:02:33.840 --> 03:02:39.860]   - So the first thing is,
[03:02:39.860 --> 03:02:45.220]   find an ecology of practices
[03:02:45.220 --> 03:02:47.620]   and a community that supports them
[03:02:47.620 --> 03:02:50.100]   without involving you in believing things
[03:02:50.100 --> 03:02:53.100]   that contravene our best understood science
[03:02:53.100 --> 03:02:55.740]   so that wisdom and virtue,
[03:02:55.740 --> 03:03:00.300]   and especially how they show up in relationships,
[03:03:00.300 --> 03:03:02.040]   are primary to you.
[03:03:02.040 --> 03:03:03.820]   This will sound ridiculous,
[03:03:03.820 --> 03:03:06.980]   but if you take care of that,
[03:03:06.980 --> 03:03:10.800]   the other things you want are more likely to occur.
[03:03:10.800 --> 03:03:12.660]   Because what you most want,
[03:03:12.660 --> 03:03:18.900]   is what you want at when you're approaching your death,
[03:03:18.900 --> 03:03:23.620]   is what were the relationships you cultivated
[03:03:23.620 --> 03:03:26.260]   to yourself, to other people, to the world,
[03:03:26.260 --> 03:03:28.260]   and what did you do to improve the chance
[03:03:28.260 --> 03:03:33.260]   of them being deep and profound relationships?
[03:03:33.260 --> 03:03:35.780]   - That's an interesting, so ecology of practice,
[03:03:35.780 --> 03:03:38.500]   so like finding a place where a lot of people
[03:03:38.500 --> 03:03:41.540]   are doing different things that are interesting,
[03:03:41.540 --> 03:03:42.900]   interplay with each other,
[03:03:42.900 --> 03:03:45.300]   but at the same time is not a cult.
[03:03:45.300 --> 03:03:48.980]   Where ideas can flourish.
[03:03:48.980 --> 03:03:51.140]   Now how the hell do you know?
[03:03:51.140 --> 03:03:56.380]   Because in a place where people are really excited
[03:03:56.380 --> 03:04:00.540]   about doing stuff, that's very ripe for cult formation.
[03:04:00.540 --> 03:04:02.820]   - Especially if they're awash in a culture
[03:04:02.820 --> 03:04:05.540]   in which we have ever expanding waves of bullshit.
[03:04:05.540 --> 03:04:07.660]   Yes, precisely.
[03:04:07.660 --> 03:04:08.740]   So--
[03:04:08.740 --> 03:04:10.900]   - Try to keep away from the bullshit is the advice.
[03:04:10.900 --> 03:04:11.740]   - Yes.
[03:04:11.740 --> 03:04:13.420]   No, I mean I take this very seriously,
[03:04:13.420 --> 03:04:16.480]   and I was with a bunch of people in Vermont
[03:04:16.480 --> 03:04:20.100]   at the Respawn Retreat, people, Rafe Kelly was there,
[03:04:20.100 --> 03:04:23.660]   bunch of people who have set up ecologies of practices
[03:04:23.660 --> 03:04:25.000]   and created communities.
[03:04:25.760 --> 03:04:30.760]   And I have good reason to find all of these people
[03:04:30.760 --> 03:04:33.100]   trustworthy, and so we gathered together
[03:04:33.100 --> 03:04:35.600]   to try and generate real dialogos,
[03:04:35.600 --> 03:04:37.660]   flow in distributed cognition,
[03:04:37.660 --> 03:04:41.000]   exercise the collective intelligence,
[03:04:41.000 --> 03:04:43.320]   and try and address that problem,
[03:04:43.320 --> 03:04:48.080]   both in terms of meta-curriculum that we can offer
[03:04:48.080 --> 03:04:51.840]   emerging communities, in terms of practices of vetting,
[03:04:51.840 --> 03:04:54.640]   how we will self-govern the federation we're forming
[03:04:54.640 --> 03:04:57.400]   so that we can resist gurufication.
[03:04:57.400 --> 03:05:00.400]   - Gurufication of people or ideas?
[03:05:00.400 --> 03:05:01.840]   - Both, both.
[03:05:01.840 --> 03:05:03.160]   - Some of us just get unlucky.
[03:05:03.160 --> 03:05:08.160]   - Some of us get unlucky, and we all at Respawn,
[03:05:08.160 --> 03:05:12.240]   we all had a tremendous sense of urgency around this,
[03:05:12.240 --> 03:05:16.400]   but we were trying to balance it about not being premature,
[03:05:16.400 --> 03:05:19.400]   but there is going to, I mean there's,
[03:05:19.400 --> 03:05:20.800]   we're gonna produce a meta-curriculum
[03:05:20.800 --> 03:05:22.440]   that's coming in months.
[03:05:22.440 --> 03:05:23.760]   There's gonna be a scientific paper
[03:05:23.760 --> 03:05:26.800]   about integrating the scientific work on wisdom
[03:05:26.800 --> 03:05:28.960]   with this practitioner-based ideas
[03:05:28.960 --> 03:05:30.920]   about the cultivation of wisdom.
[03:05:30.920 --> 03:05:35.360]   There's going to be projects about how we can create
[03:05:35.360 --> 03:05:38.520]   a self-correcting vetting system,
[03:05:38.520 --> 03:05:42.840]   so we can say to people, we think this ecology is legit,
[03:05:42.840 --> 03:05:46.880]   it's in good fellowship with all these other legit ecologies.
[03:05:46.880 --> 03:05:49.360]   We don't know about that one, we're hesitant about that one,
[03:05:49.360 --> 03:05:52.360]   it's not in good fellowship, we have concerns,
[03:05:52.360 --> 03:05:54.880]   here's why we have our concerns, et cetera.
[03:05:54.880 --> 03:05:56.800]   And you may say, well, who are you to do that?
[03:05:56.800 --> 03:06:00.320]   It's like, nobody, but somebody's gotta do it, right?
[03:06:00.320 --> 03:06:01.560]   And that's what it comes down to,
[03:06:01.560 --> 03:06:04.080]   and so we're gonna give it our best effort.
[03:06:04.080 --> 03:06:05.240]   - It's worth a try.
[03:06:05.240 --> 03:06:11.440]   You talked about the meaning crisis in human civilization,
[03:06:11.440 --> 03:06:14.860]   but in your own personal life,
[03:06:14.860 --> 03:06:20.480]   what has been a dark place you've ever gone in your mind?
[03:06:20.480 --> 03:06:22.880]   Has there been difficult times in your life
[03:06:22.880 --> 03:06:24.240]   where you really struggled?
[03:06:24.240 --> 03:06:25.080]   - Yes.
[03:06:25.080 --> 03:06:30.340]   So when I left fundamentalist Christianity,
[03:06:30.340 --> 03:06:36.040]   and for a while I was just sort of a hard-bitten atheist,
[03:06:36.040 --> 03:06:41.720]   the problem with leaving the belief structure
[03:06:41.720 --> 03:06:46.320]   was that I didn't deal with all the non-propositional things
[03:06:46.320 --> 03:06:50.240]   that had gotten into me, all the procedures and habits
[03:06:50.240 --> 03:06:52.920]   and all the perspectives and all the identities
[03:06:52.920 --> 03:06:55.000]   and the trauma associated with that.
[03:06:55.000 --> 03:06:57.080]   So it required therapy,
[03:06:57.080 --> 03:07:00.760]   it required years of meditation and Tai Chi,
[03:07:00.760 --> 03:07:02.200]   and I'm still wrestling with it.
[03:07:02.200 --> 03:07:06.360]   But for the first four or five years,
[03:07:06.360 --> 03:07:13.460]   I described it like this, I called it the black burning.
[03:07:13.460 --> 03:07:15.880]   I felt like there was a blackness
[03:07:15.880 --> 03:07:17.960]   that was on fire inside of me,
[03:07:17.960 --> 03:07:21.400]   precisely because the religion had left a taste
[03:07:21.400 --> 03:07:22.800]   for the transcended in my mouth,
[03:07:22.800 --> 03:07:26.560]   but the food it had given me, food in square quotes,
[03:07:26.560 --> 03:07:29.040]   had soured in my stomach and made me nauseous.
[03:07:29.040 --> 03:07:32.760]   And the juxtaposition of those
[03:07:32.760 --> 03:07:35.540]   seemed like an irresolvable problem for me.
[03:07:35.540 --> 03:07:38.600]   That was a very, very dark time for me.
[03:07:38.600 --> 03:07:41.600]   - Did it feel lonely?
[03:07:41.600 --> 03:07:44.280]   - When it was very bad, it felt extremely lonely.
[03:07:45.680 --> 03:07:50.680]   And deeply alienating, the universe seemed absurd.
[03:07:50.680 --> 03:07:53.680]   And there was also existential anxiety.
[03:07:53.680 --> 03:07:55.480]   I talk about these things for a reason.
[03:07:55.480 --> 03:07:57.880]   I don't just talk about them as things I'm pointing to,
[03:07:57.880 --> 03:08:00.320]   I'm talking about them as seeing in myself
[03:08:00.320 --> 03:08:04.200]   and in people I care, having undergone them,
[03:08:04.200 --> 03:08:09.200]   and how they can bring you close to self-destructive.
[03:08:09.200 --> 03:08:13.500]   I started engaging in kinds of self-destructive behavior.
[03:08:13.500 --> 03:08:15.820]   - So the meaning crisis to you is not just
[03:08:15.820 --> 03:08:20.820]   the thing you look outside and see many people struggling,
[03:08:20.820 --> 03:08:22.640]   you yourself are struggling.
[03:08:22.640 --> 03:08:25.480]   - But that's, in fact, the narrative,
[03:08:25.480 --> 03:08:29.240]   is I struggled with it, thinking it was a purely
[03:08:29.240 --> 03:08:31.400]   personal, idiosyncratic thing.
[03:08:31.400 --> 03:08:33.440]   I started learning the Cog Psy,
[03:08:33.440 --> 03:08:35.280]   I started doing the Tai Chi and the meditation,
[03:08:35.280 --> 03:08:38.600]   I started doing all this Socratic philosophy.
[03:08:38.600 --> 03:08:42.620]   And when I started to talk about these pieces,
[03:08:43.320 --> 03:08:46.120]   I saw my students' eyes light up,
[03:08:46.120 --> 03:08:50.240]   and I realized, oh wait, maybe this isn't just
[03:08:50.240 --> 03:08:52.400]   something I'm going through.
[03:08:52.400 --> 03:08:55.600]   And then talking to them and then doing the research
[03:08:55.600 --> 03:08:57.440]   and expanding it out, it's like, oh,
[03:08:57.440 --> 03:09:01.600]   many people in a shared fashion,
[03:09:01.600 --> 03:09:04.480]   and also in an individual, lonely fashion,
[03:09:04.480 --> 03:09:06.560]   are going through meaning crisis.
[03:09:06.560 --> 03:09:09.520]   - Well, we talked a lot about wisdom and meaning,
[03:09:09.520 --> 03:09:12.360]   and you said that the goal is to love wisely,
[03:09:12.360 --> 03:09:14.360]   so let me ask about love.
[03:09:14.360 --> 03:09:17.760]   What's the role of love in the human condition?
[03:09:17.760 --> 03:09:18.680]   - It's central.
[03:09:18.680 --> 03:09:23.180]   I mean, it's even central to reason and rationality.
[03:09:23.180 --> 03:09:26.160]   This is Plato, but Spinoza,
[03:09:26.160 --> 03:09:29.100]   the most logical of the rationalists.
[03:09:29.100 --> 03:09:33.380]   The ethics is written like Euclid's geometry.
[03:09:33.380 --> 03:09:35.380]   But he calls it the ethics for a reason,
[03:09:35.380 --> 03:09:38.700]   because he wants to talk about the blessed life.
[03:09:38.700 --> 03:09:40.280]   And what does he say?
[03:09:40.280 --> 03:09:43.800]   He says that ultimately, reason needs love,
[03:09:43.800 --> 03:09:48.320]   because love is what brings reason out of being entrapped
[03:09:48.320 --> 03:09:50.780]   in the gravity well of egocentrism.
[03:09:50.780 --> 03:09:55.680]   And Murdoch, Iris Murdoch, said, I think really beautifully,
[03:09:55.680 --> 03:09:57.560]   "Love is when you painfully realize
[03:09:57.560 --> 03:09:59.860]   "that something other than yourself is real."
[03:09:59.860 --> 03:10:02.760]   (Lex laughing)
[03:10:02.760 --> 03:10:06.320]   - Escaping the gravity well of egocentrism.
[03:10:06.320 --> 03:10:09.480]   Beautifully put, a beautiful way to end it, John.
[03:10:09.480 --> 03:10:11.040]   You're a beautiful human being.
[03:10:11.040 --> 03:10:13.040]   Thank you for struggling in your own mind
[03:10:13.040 --> 03:10:15.920]   with the search for meaning
[03:10:15.920 --> 03:10:19.500]   and encouraging others to do the same,
[03:10:19.500 --> 03:10:21.760]   and ultimately to learn how to love wisely.
[03:10:21.760 --> 03:10:23.520]   Thank you so much for talking today.
[03:10:23.520 --> 03:10:24.800]   - It's been a great pleasure, Lex.
[03:10:24.800 --> 03:10:25.980]   I really enjoyed it a lot.
[03:10:25.980 --> 03:10:26.920]   Thank you so much.
[03:10:26.920 --> 03:10:29.280]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[03:10:29.280 --> 03:10:30.680]   with John Verveche.
[03:10:30.680 --> 03:10:31.920]   To support this podcast,
[03:10:31.920 --> 03:10:34.600]   please check out our sponsors in the description.
[03:10:34.600 --> 03:10:36.280]   And now, let me leave you with some words
[03:10:36.280 --> 03:10:38.600]   from Herman Hesse and Siddhartha.
[03:10:38.600 --> 03:10:41.400]   I've always believed, and I still believe,
[03:10:41.400 --> 03:10:44.640]   that whatever good or bad fortune may come our way,
[03:10:44.640 --> 03:10:45.800]   we can always give it meaning
[03:10:45.800 --> 03:10:48.500]   and transform it into something of value.
[03:10:48.500 --> 03:10:52.360]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
[03:10:52.360 --> 03:10:54.940]   (upbeat music)
[03:10:54.940 --> 03:10:57.520]   (upbeat music)
