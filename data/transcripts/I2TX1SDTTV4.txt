[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.860]   The research paper I'd like to discuss briefly
[00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.760]   that beautifully embodies the runway
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.720]   that led to the discovery of growth mindset
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.960]   is a paper from Dr. Carol Dweck
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.360]   as well as her colleague, Claudia Mueller.
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.440]   And the title of the paper essentially says it all.
[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.880]   The title is "Praise for Intelligence
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.540]   Can Undermine Children's Motivation and Performance."
[00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.160]   That should be surprising
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.760]   that praise for intelligence can undermine motivation
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.120]   and performance.
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.960]   I would have thought,
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.800]   and I think many people probably believe
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.480]   that if you tell a child or an adult
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.840]   that they're really good at something
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.880]   and you're genuine about that feedback,
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.000]   meaning they're performing well,
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.520]   and you say, "Great, you're doing really well.
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.920]   You're so smart, you're so talented,"
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.100]   that their performance would continue to improve,
[00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.520]   that it would bolster their motivation
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.120]   to engage in that activity, which hopefully they enjoy.
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.880]   But regardless, provided that it's a safe activity,
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.160]   it's educational, or what have you,
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.120]   that it would serve to encourage them, right?
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.320]   The kid thinks, "Not only am I engaging in this activity,
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.700]   but I'm getting positive feedback,
[00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.260]   presumably from people that I care about
[00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260]   or whose opinion I care about.
[00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.240]   Wouldn't that serve to elevate performance?"
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.080]   It does not.
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.800]   In fact, the exact opposite happens.
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.320]   So I'll just give you a few of the key takeaways
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.200]   from this study.
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.620]   The way it was done is very interesting.
[00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.860]   They essentially gave feedback about performance
[00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.820]   that was linked up with a child's intelligence,
[00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.940]   telling kid they're smart, they're talented,
[00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.900]   that they can learn things really easily,
[00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.940]   or that they're very good at learning, this sort of thing.
[00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.440]   And they called that intelligence feedback.
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.380]   Or they gave them what was called effort feedback.
[00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.060]   The simple way to think about effort feedback
[00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.800]   is that it's more attached to verbs as opposed to labels.
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.380]   So effort feedback consists of things like,
[00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.380]   "You tried really hard on that problem.
[00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.700]   It was great the way that you applied effort.
[00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.420]   It was great the way that you persisted.
[00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.420]   It was great the way that,
[00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.180]   even when you got the wrong answer,
[00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.920]   you spent 10 minutes thinking about it,
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.820]   and then you tried again and again."
[00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:06.980]   Or in some cases,
[00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.160]   even if they didn't get the right answer, telling them,
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.820]   "Well, even though you didn't get the right answer,
[00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.860]   it's really terrific that you continue to try."
[00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.900]   Okay, so intelligence feedback
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.760]   was the sort of feedback that was tied
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.020]   to labels of identity, things like smart, talented, et cetera,
[00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.840]   whereas effort feedback was tied to verbs,
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.260]   choices, behavioral and cognitive choices
[00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.000]   that children made in an effort
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.600]   to learn or get better at something.
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.320]   So in this study, which included over a hundred children,
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.480]   they either got the intelligence type feedback
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.640]   or the effort type feedback,
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.600]   or there was a control group
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.440]   that didn't get either the intelligence
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.280]   or the effort type feedback.
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.940]   And then they looked at a number of different outcomes.
[00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.580]   So I'll just highlight a few examples of what they found.
[00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:48.420]   First of all,
[00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.700]   the kids that got the intelligence-based feedback,
[00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.480]   when they were then later offered problem sets
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.540]   that were either challenging
[00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.620]   or were of the sort that they knew
[00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.060]   they could perform well on,
[00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.700]   they tended to select problems
[00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.500]   that they knew they could perform well on.
[00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.020]   These were what were referred to as performance goals.
[00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.800]   In other words, they picked problems
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.300]   that allowed them to continue to get the praise
[00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.940]   that they had received previously
[00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.220]   about being smart or talented.
[00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.500]   Whereas the kids that got feedback about their strong effort
[00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.340]   when later presented with problems
[00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.140]   that were either easy or hard,
[00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.580]   more often than not, they picked the harder problems
[00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.600]   that stood to teach them more.
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.520]   So that's striking.
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.900]   It says that if you tell a kid
[00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.180]   that they're smart or talented,
[00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.780]   and that's the reason why they perform well,
[00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.220]   when they encounter challenges,
[00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.100]   they are likely to go with the least amount of challenge
[00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.620]   so that they can continue to receive that praise or feedback.
[00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.100]   Whereas if you receive praise and feedback
[00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.060]   for your strong effort,
[00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.020]   then later you tend to pick environments,
[00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.260]   problem sets, et cetera,
[00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.580]   that allow you to exert the very effort
[00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.540]   that got you the praise in the first place.
[00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:54.900]   So in both cases,
[00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.020]   these children are essentially attached to the praise,
[00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.100]   right, in some sense.
[00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.140]   I mean, we like to think that they enjoy these activities
[00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.300]   and they're benefiting from them as well.
[00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.580]   But in both cases,
[00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.860]   the praise really serves to reinforce
[00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.580]   a certain pattern of behavior.
[00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.100]   But in the case of giving intelligence feedback,
[00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.820]   the kids are really just trying to reinforce
[00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.660]   being told that they're smart or talented
[00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.220]   as opposed to reinforcing the engagement in the activity
[00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.860]   that got them the praise in the first place.
[00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:22.300]   And the converse is also true.
[00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.300]   When kids are told,
[00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.700]   hey, you really tried hard and that's great,
[00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.260]   or I like how you persisted,
[00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.620]   or you're so persistent,
[00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.660]   I can really see how persistent you are
[00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.460]   in trying to get the right answer,
[00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.220]   even if you don't get the right answer.
[00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:35.580]   Well, then when you present those kids
[00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:36.980]   with additional challenges,
[00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.760]   they work very hard to stay in challenge.
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:40.600]   And guess what?
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.940]   No surprise.
[00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.780]   The kids that are rewarded for effort
[00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.220]   and that continue to pick harder problems
[00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.040]   outperform the kids that are given the intelligence praise
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.000]   and feedback by a large margin.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.900]   So what does this tell us?
[00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.340]   This tells us that the narratives that we hear from others,
[00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.180]   of course, reinforce certain patterns of behavior.
[00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.300]   What else does this tell us?
[00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.860]   This tells us that if you're a parent or teacher,
[00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.820]   you have to be very careful
[00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.020]   about giving feedback to a child
[00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.940]   that is attached to their identity around an endeavor,
[00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.020]   especially if they're performing well at that endeavor.
[00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.220]   Now, of course, if a child
[00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.200]   is not performing well at something,
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.820]   you also don't want to tell them that they're stupid.
[00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.620]   You don't want to tell them that they're deficient.
[00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.940]   But that's a rare occurrence in the classroom,
[00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:26.960]   one would hope.
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.600]   That's a rare occurrence on the field, one would hope.
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.260]   But what's very common, very, very common,
[00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.180]   is that when we see children or adults performing well,
[00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.860]   we tend to give them identity labels
[00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.300]   as a way to try and reinforce
[00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.140]   whatever behavior we observe and we like.
[00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:43.700]   Now, the other thing they looked at in this study,
[00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.100]   besides whether or not these kids
[00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.780]   would pick hard or easier challenges down the line,
[00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:53.780]   were the actual raw performance on cognitive problems.
[00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.600]   And these data, I must say, are just so interesting.
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.700]   They took the kids
[00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.340]   and they gave them all the same problem sets.
[00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.200]   And all the kids across the board,
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.480]   whether or not they were getting intelligence praise
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.700]   or effort praise, or they were in the control group,
[00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.080]   were performing more or less the same way.
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.620]   They were getting some of these questions right,
[00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.540]   some of these questions wrong.
[00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.500]   Then they gave them praise
[00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.400]   after they completed those problems.
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.180]   They either got intelligence praise,
[00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.580]   you're so smart, you're so talented,
[00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:22.620]   or they got effort praise.
[00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.700]   You tried so hard, you really persisted, that's fantastic.
[00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.940]   Then later, they gave them another set of problems
[00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:28.900]   and they looked at performance.
[00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.640]   Now, remember, the first time around,
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.460]   all the kids got some of the questions right
[00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:33.880]   and some of the questions wrong.
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.540]   So there's room for improvement for everybody.
[00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:39.300]   What they found was absolutely striking.
[00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.220]   The kids that were in the control group,
[00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:43.700]   so they didn't get any specific form of praise,
[00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.940]   they perform more or less the same way as they did before.
[00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.700]   So if they were getting 75% of the answers right
[00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.440]   the first time, they got 75% of the answers right
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.100]   the second time, 25% wrong in both cases.
[00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:58.380]   The kids that were in the intelligence praise group,
[00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:01.180]   the you're so smart, you're so talented praise group,
[00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.860]   their performance went down significantly.
[00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:08.060]   Whereas the kids that were in the effort praise group,
[00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.320]   their performance increased significantly, okay?
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.540]   So this is a bi-directional effect
[00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:17.380]   where giving intelligence praise reduces performance
[00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:20.140]   and giving effort praise improves performance,
[00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:22.100]   which is absolutely striking
[00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.020]   and tells you everything you need to know,
[00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.380]   which is if you're a parent, you're a teacher,
[00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:31.180]   and of course, as we all give ourselves feedback,
[00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:33.860]   rewarding yourself for effort
[00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:36.020]   is the best way to improve performance.
[00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:38.540]   Rewarding yourself based on identity labels,
[00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:41.380]   so smart, so talented, you're a great athlete, et cetera,
