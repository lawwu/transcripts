[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840]   You've worn many hats, one of which, the one that first caused me to become a big fan
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.680]   of your work many years ago is algorithmic trading.
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.960]   So I have to just ask a question about this because you have so much fascinating work
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:14.960]   there.
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:22.080]   In the 21st century, what role do you think algorithms have in the space of trading, investment,
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.880]   in the financial sector?
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.480]   Yeah, it's a good question.
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:34.040]   I mean, in the time I've spent on Wall Street and in finance, I've seen a clear progression
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.560]   and I think it's a progression that kind of models the use of algorithms and automation
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:46.320]   more generally in society, which is the things that kind of get taken over by the algos first
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.280]   are sort of the things that computers are obviously better at than people, right?
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.080]   So first of all, there needed to be this era of automation, right?
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:03.400]   Where just financial exchanges became largely electronic, which then enabled the possibility
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:10.560]   of trading becoming more algorithmic because once the exchanges are electronic, an algorithm
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.440]   can submit an order through an API just as well as a human can do at a monitor.
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.960]   It can do it really quickly, it can read all the data.
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:23.980]   And so, I think the places where algorithmic trading have had the greatest inroads and
[00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:29.860]   had the first inroads were in kind of execution problems, kind of optimized execution problems.
[00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.600]   So what I mean by that is at a large brokerage firm, for example, one of the lines of business
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:42.440]   might be on behalf of large institutional clients taking what we might consider difficult
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.440]   trades.
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.320]   It's not a mom and pop investor saying, "I want to buy 100 shares of Microsoft."
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:53.640]   It's a large hedge fund saying, "I want to buy a very, very large stake in Apple, and
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.680]   I want to do it over the span of a day."
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.400]   And it's such a large volume that if you're not clever about how you break that trade
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.560]   up, not just over time, but over perhaps multiple different electronic exchanges that all let
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:12.960]   you trade Apple on their platform, you'll push prices around in a way that hurts your
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.400]   execution.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.800]   So this is an optimization problem.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.560]   This is a control problem.
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.840]   And so, machines are better.
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.440]   We know how to design algorithms that are better at that kind of thing than a person
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.040]   is going to be able to do because we can take volumes of historical and real-time data to
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.720]   kind of optimize the schedule with which we trade.
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:42.240]   And similarly, high-frequency trading, which is closely related but not the same as optimized
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:50.600]   execution, where you're just trying to spot very, very temporary mispricings between exchanges
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:56.800]   or within an asset itself, or just predict directional movement of a stock because of
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:03.560]   the kind of very, very low-level granular buying and selling data in the exchange.
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.800]   Machines are good at this kind of stuff.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.600]   It's kind of like the mechanics of trading.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.920]   What about the... can machines do long-term sort of prediction?
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:13.920]   Yeah.
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.960]   So I think we are in an era where clearly there have been some very successful quant
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:27.440]   hedge funds that are in what we would traditionally call still in the stat arb regime.
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.440]   So-
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.440]   What's that?
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.760]   Stat arb referring to statistical arbitrage.
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.540]   But for the purposes of this conversation, what it really means is making directional
[00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.480]   predictions in asset price movement or returns.
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:47.300]   Your prediction about that directional movement is good for... you have a view that it's valid
[00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.700]   for some period of time between a few seconds and a few days.
[00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.800]   And that's the amount of time that you're going to kind of get into the position, hold
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.220]   it, and then hopefully be right about the directional movement and buy low and sell
[00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.560]   high as the cliche goes.
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:09.700]   So that is a kind of a sweet spot, I think, for quant trading and investing right now
[00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.140]   and has been for some time.
[00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:18.260]   When you really get to kind of more Warren Buffett style time scales, right?
[00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:23.020]   My cartoon of Warren Buffett is that Warren Buffett sits and thinks what the long-term
[00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.860]   value of Apple really should be.
[00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.740]   And he doesn't even look at what Apple is doing today.
[00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:34.540]   He just decides, I think that this is what its long-term value is and it's far from that
[00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:35.540]   right now.
[00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.980]   And so I'm going to buy some Apple or short some Apple and I'm going to sit on that for
[00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.100]   10 or 20 years.
[00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:50.040]   So when you're at that kind of time scale or even more than just a few days, all kinds
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.580]   of other sources of risk and information...
[00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.620]   So now you're talking about holding things through recessions and economic cycles.
[00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.300]   Wars can break out.
[00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.300]   So there you have to understand human nature at a level that...
[00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.020]   Yeah, and you need to just be able to ingest many, many more sources of data that are on
[00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.580]   wildly different time scales, right?
[00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:17.700]   So if I'm an HFT, I'm a high-frequency trader, like I don't...
[00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.160]   My main source of data is just the data from the exchanges themselves about the activity
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.220]   in the exchanges, right?
[00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.620]   And maybe I need to pay...
[00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.860]   I need to keep an eye on the news, right?
[00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.100]   Because that can cause sudden...
[00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:36.060]   The CEO gets caught in a scandal or gets run over by a bus or something that can cause
[00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.020]   very sudden changes.
[00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.500]   But I don't need to understand economic cycles.
[00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:42.940]   I don't need to understand recessions.
[00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.700]   I don't need to worry about the political situation or war breaking out in this part
[00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:52.780]   of the world because all I need to know is as long as that's not going to happen in the
[00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:57.620]   next 500 milliseconds, then my model is good.
[00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.940]   When you get to these longer time scales, you really have to worry about that kind of
[00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:01.940]   stuff.
[00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.700]   And people in the machine learning community are starting to think about this.
[00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.600]   We held a...
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:12.020]   We jointly sponsored a workshop at Penn with the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia a
[00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.220]   little more than a year ago on...
[00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:19.740]   I think the title was something like, "Machine Learning for Macroeconomic Prediction."
[00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.580]   Macroeconomic referring specifically to these longer time scales.
[00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:32.980]   And it was an interesting conference, but it left me with greater confidence that we
[00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:34.980]   have a long way to go to...
[00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:37.100]   And so I think that people that...
[00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:42.220]   In the grand scheme of things, if somebody asked me like, "Well, whose job on Wall Street
[00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.060]   is safe from the bots?"
[00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:49.020]   I think people that are at that longer time scale and have that appetite for all the risks
[00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:54.820]   involved in long-term investing and that really need kind of not just algorithms that can
[00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:57.420]   optimize from data, but they need views on stuff.
[00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:03.900]   They need views on the political landscape, economic cycles and the like.
[00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.860]   And I think they're pretty safe for a while, as far as I can tell.
[00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:09.500]   So Warren Buffett's job is safe for a little while.
[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:13.500]   Yeah, I'm not seeing a robo Warren Buffett anytime soon.
[00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:14.540]   Should give him comfort.
