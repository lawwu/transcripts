[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.080]   I should like to call your attention this evening to the third and fourth verses in
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:14.960]   the first psalm. The first psalm, verses three and four. "And he shall be like a tree planted
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:21.960]   by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:30.120]   not wither, and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper. The ungodly are not so, but are like
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:38.120]   the chaff which the wind driveth away." Let me refresh your memories, most of you, with
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.600]   regard to what we were considering last Sunday evening, namely the first two verses of this
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:50.480]   psalm. "Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.920]   in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful. But his delight is in
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:04.200]   the law of the Lord, and in his law doth he meditate day and night. And he shall be like
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:09.840]   a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:17.920]   leaf also shall not wither, and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper. The ungodly are not
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:27.640]   so, but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away. Therefore the ungodly shall
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:34.080]   not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. For the
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:43.400]   Lord knoweth the way of the righteous, but the way of the ungodly shall perish."
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:49.760]   Now we resume our study of this psalm. As I say, we considered the first two verses
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:56.520]   together last Sunday evening, and I would say again what I said on that occasion, namely,
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.560]   that our chief reason, of course, for considering it is that it deals with the problem, the
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:10.040]   question that is uppermost in the minds of everybody, and that is the desire to be happy.
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:19.840]   And here we read, "Blessed, O the blessedness, O the happiness of the men that walketh not,
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:27.520]   etc., in the counsel of the ungodly." Very well, here is a psalm that comes to us and
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:34.480]   speaks to us about the thing that is uppermost in the mind and the heart of everybody. Now
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.680]   here is something that can be said universally of everybody. You can't say that about all
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.720]   things. We differ in many respects, but there is one thing that brings the whole of humanity
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:52.520]   to a common denominator, and that is the desire to be happy. Some people have strange ways
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.960]   of showing that desire, but they've got it. Everybody wants to be happy. Nobody wants
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:05.720]   to be miserable. Whatever their form, whatever their method, it doesn't matter. This is universal.
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.400]   And the Bible, of course, claims that it is a universal book for that reason. It's the
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:18.960]   textbook of life. It's the manual of the soul. It's the book that deals with man and his
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:25.520]   whole state and condition as he passes through this world of time. And as I was saying last
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:32.040]   Sunday night, I make no apology for calling your attention to this whole problem of men
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:39.040]   and of happiness in terms of the Bible, in terms of the first psalm in the Old Testament,
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.840]   for the simple reason that until mankind has discovered happiness apart from this, well,
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:50.040]   I'll go on preaching this. And that means that I'll go on until I die, and others will
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:56.360]   go on after I've gone, because men, according to this book, will never find happiness apart
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:03.680]   from the way that is indicated here. So it is a perennial truth. It's always a contemporary
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:10.720]   message. This book never dates. It's the most up-to-date book in the world tonight.
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.600]   All the other teachings and philosophies are constantly being put on the scrapheap, out
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:22.080]   of date. What do you think of the science of fifty years ago? What about the philosophy
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:28.400]   of fifty years ago? All this is now laughter, ridicule, forgotten, thrown into the limbo
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.640]   of things long since forgotten. But here is a message that's still contemporary. And the
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:41.800]   reason for that, as we saw, is that it is indeed the Word of God. And the man who finds
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:48.880]   happiness is the man who delights in the law of the Lord, and who meditates in it day and
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.240]   night. Now, the case put forward here, you see, is
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.640]   this, that people are not happy, and man doesn't find happiness because he always seeks it
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:10.240]   in the wrong way. He tends to make it an end in and of itself. He seeks happiness directly.
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:17.320]   And according to this book, that is something that can never be done. You live for happiness
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:24.080]   and you'll never find it. Happiness is a by-product. "Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:30.560]   righteousness. All these other things shall be added unto you." That's the order. "Blessed
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.320]   are they that who hunger and thirst after righteousness. They shall be filled." Nobody
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:40.040]   else. They are the people who get happiness, not the people who seek happiness, the people
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:44.120]   who seek righteousness. Now, here is a very fundamental point, of
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:51.080]   course. That's the great message, as I tried to show, of the first two verses. Man always
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:57.440]   makes the mistake of approaching it directly. He has never yet learned that in the spiritual
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:02.600]   realm, as in the military realm, the best strategy is generally what is called the strategy
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:10.600]   of the indirect approach. It's always true in the Bible. Indirect approach. Seek righteousness,
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:15.640]   you'll get happiness. Seek happiness, you won't get it. And the second big mistake that
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:22.000]   man makes is that he constantly thinks that happiness is something dependent upon circumstances.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:29.760]   And that's about the greatest fallacy of all. If happiness is dependent upon circumstances,
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:35.680]   well, then there will never be such a thing as happiness in this world. But we are told
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:44.080]   the other is. Blessed is the man. But it's a happiness that is independent of circumstances.
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.440]   I was saying that jocularly to the deacons before we came into this service tonight.
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:54.680]   Should we have brought in the piano, or if the power fails and the organ doesn't work,
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:59.640]   I said, thank God, our faith, our religion is one that is not dependent finally upon
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:05.920]   buildings, organs, power, or anything else. It comes from the heart, you see. So that
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:11.680]   if all power is shut off, we can still go on praising God. We are not dependent upon
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:18.160]   circumstances in any shape or form. One of these hymns has been putting that again, that
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:25.120]   second hymn that we sang, and even the first one. We don't rear earthly tabernacles. We
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:30.400]   are dependent upon the power of God, the power of the Spirit. But now man doesn't realize
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:36.160]   this. He always thinks that it's a question of circumstances and conditions. And that's
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:44.080]   his second great and fatal blunder. And here we are shown the fallacy of all that. And
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:49.600]   that we must realize that our happiness is something that is ultimately dependent upon
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:57.480]   our relationship to God and the state and the condition of our own souls. Now that's
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:03.080]   the big thing that we've already seen this man telling us in the first two verses of
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:11.760]   this psalm of his. Well now the Bible does it up to bring this home to us. It says everywhere
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:19.760]   that it alone has true happiness to give us. And it goes on to say that it's also a lasting
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:25.200]   happiness. Not something that comes and then you've suddenly lost it just when you think
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:31.040]   you've got it. No, that's the happiness of the world so-called. It doesn't last.
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:36.840]   But here is a happiness that is true. And because it is true, it is something that lasts
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:43.960]   and continues and abides whatever may chance to come across our path. Well now then here
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:52.960]   is the great question. Why doesn't man believe this and then go on to experience this blessedness,
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:09:00.000]   this happiness that he talks about? Well I want to put it like this this evening. There
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:07.440]   are two main explanations of this. And one is that man is so terribly ignorant about
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:16.640]   himself. He doesn't see himself as he rarely is. You see because of that he starts on a
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:21.840]   false assumption. He generally starts on the assumption that he himself is all right and
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:28.760]   that the trouble is somebody else or something else. Well now he's already gone wrong. And
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:32.600]   while he's wrong like this at the very beginning and in the foundation, of course he can't
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:39.040]   hope ever to arrive at true happiness. He must learn the truth about himself. And he'll
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:45.240]   never learn that except as he believes this law of the Lord, this message which we have
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:50.560]   in this book which we call the Bible. There is nothing under the heavens tonight that
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:59.320]   tells us the truth about ourselves save this book. But you see here's mankind reading newspapers.
[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:03.760]   You'll never know the truth about yourself there. Well for this reason that though in
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:10.680]   a sense the very newspapers are telling you the truth about yourself, it's put in a form
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:15.160]   in which man is pleased with it and enjoys it and is entertained by it instead of being
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:20.680]   convicted by it. He should be convicted by it. Any man who reads his newspapers today
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:26.240]   should feel a terrible sense of conviction. As a man reads about the nations, piling up
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:30.640]   armaments, quarreling, as he reads about disputes in this country, they should all be heartily
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:37.480]   ashamed. We should feel convicted of sin. We should say what's the matter with men that
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:41.960]   he behaves in such a manner and I'm a man, well it's in me, what's the matter with us?
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:48.960]   The very facts and circumstances should convict us of sin, but they don't. They don't you
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:53.960]   see because we always say it's somebody else, never ourselves. It never comes home to us.
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:11:00.240]   Now the Bible brings it home to us. It addresses us directly and individually and puts the
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:07.680]   plain and varnished truth about ourselves to us directly and immediately. We need that.
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:13.320]   Man's ignorant about himself and the second thing he's ignorant about is the true nature
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:21.560]   of the Christian life and this of course is the tragedy of prejudice. There are these
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:27.600]   two reasons why people don't believe this Christian message, this Christian faith. In
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:31.600]   addition to being wrong about themselves, they're wrong about the faith. They think
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:40.080]   they know what it is, but they don't know what it is. There is this fundamental misconception
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:46.960]   and misunderstanding with regard to the nature of the Christian message and of the whole
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:54.360]   of the Christian life. Now what the Bible does in the light of these two great and fundamental
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:12:01.280]   and initial errors and fallacies is this. It keeps on putting the two things together
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:07.560]   before us. That's why it's such a wonderful book. There's no end to the ways in which
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:13.000]   it does it. That's the proof that it's God's book. It gives it as direct teaching.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.040]   Then it says, well if you can't take it like that, take it in a picture. Take it in
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:24.040]   an illustration. Take it in a bit of history. That's why it gives us all this history.
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:28.240]   It says look at that man. Look how he started. Look how he ended. If you won't believe
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:33.440]   the teaching, look at this man's life. There it is for you. There it is in a picture.
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:39.240]   There it is represented in a bit of sheer human history, facts. And then it takes up
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:46.840]   these comparisons, these illustrations. Now all these are simply given to us in the great
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:54.160]   goodness and kindness and compassion of God in an endeavor to bring the truth home to
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:13:01.320]   us simply and directly. And that is what we have in this first psalm, undoubtedly written
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:07.800]   by David, moved by the Holy Spirit to do so. David was anxious to give this message to
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:14.520]   his contemporaries. And he says, listen, there are two types of men in this world and only
[00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:20.640]   two, the godly and the ungodly. And you see, he says happiness depends upon whether you're
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:25.520]   godly or ungodly. That's the thing. And he seems to be saying, well, how can I bring
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:31.160]   this truth home to the people? He tells us in general in the first two verses some of
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:36.800]   the obvious characteristics of these two men. This godly man doesn't walk in the counsel
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:40.960]   of the ungodly, doesn't stand in the way of sinners, doesn't sit in the seat of the
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:46.400]   scornful. Well, what does he do? Well, his delight is in the law of the Lord. That's
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:50.960]   how he spends his time, that's what he does, that's how he occupies himself. He meditates
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:59.000]   in it day and night. Yes, all right, says David. But that isn't enough. People are blind.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.760]   They can't see this. They can't see the truth about themselves. They can't see the truth
[00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:11.040]   about godliness. How can I put it to them? So he goes on. And here, you see, he implies
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:18.960]   an illustration. He brings forward a picture in order to try to help us to see the essence
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:25.840]   of this matter. Truth about ourselves, the truth about the godly or the Christian men.
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:33.040]   And you see, this is the picture that he uses. He says the difference between the godly and
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:40.480]   the ungodly is the difference between a tree and chaff. He pictures a tree by the side
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:47.920]   of a river, and then there's a heap of chaff. And he says, now then, if you can't see it
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:53.480]   in terms of direct teaching when I talk about the counsel of the ungodly and the way of
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:57.720]   sinners and the seat of the scornful, well, he says, try and look at it like this. What
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:02.080]   I'm trying to say, he says, is that the difference between these two men is the difference between
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:11.560]   a tree and a heap of chaff. Very well, my friends, if you are concerned
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:16.360]   as you are concerned about this whole problem of life and of living and of happiness and
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:22.600]   of peace and of joy, the first question I really have to ask, and indeed it's the only
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:30.120]   question I have to ask this evening, is this. What are you like? What's your life like?
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:39.080]   Are you like a tree? Are you like a heap of chaff? It's one or the other. This godly man
[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:43.840]   is like a tree planted by the water, rivers of water. Bringeth forth fruit in his season,
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:49.200]   his leaf also shall not wither, and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper. The ungodly are not
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:58.000]   so, they're not like that. Well, what are they like? Oh, he says, but are like the chaff,
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:05.040]   which the wind driveth away. Well, this to me is a tremendous thing. We are only in this
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:09.920]   world once. What's more important than that every one of us should know at this moment
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:17.520]   what kind of a person we are? What's your life like? I ask you at the beginning of 1963.
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:24.240]   I don't care how long you've lived. What's your life like? Does it resemble a tree? Does
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:32.320]   it resemble a heap of chaff? Now then, let's work this out together. There's nothing more
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:38.160]   important than this. I don't care what's going to happen in 1963 in the last analysis.
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:44.720]   Oh, but there's somebody that's callous. What I mean is this. I don't care in this matter
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:53.560]   of my own condition and my own fundamental happiness. If my happiness is contingent upon
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:57.840]   things that may or may not take place, well then I haven't got any happiness and I'll
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:06.600]   never have it. Happiness, blessedness, is that, I say, which renders a man immune to
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:15.720]   the changing scenes of time and the vicissitudes and the circumstances and accidents of life.
[00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:20.160]   So I say there's nothing more important than this. Well, very well then, let's examine
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:30.880]   it. The first thing I find is this. That the difference between these two kinds of life
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:37.120]   is a very profound difference. You see, I say the whole trouble is that people don't
[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:42.720]   know the truth about themselves and they don't know the truth about Christianity. And that's
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:48.240]   the initial trouble, that they don't realise that the difference between the two is a profound
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:55.920]   difference, is a radical difference. What they tend to think is this, of course, that
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:18:03.320]   the difference between being a Christian and not being a Christian is only one of degree.
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:08.880]   That all men are really one and are all really alike, except that there are certain particular
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:15.400]   difficulties. Difference of degree. The Christian, they say, is a man who doesn't do certain
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:19.520]   things that the other man does, and he does certain things that the other man doesn't
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:26.760]   do. But there's no essential difference. Now the world always objects to this notion,
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:32.520]   that there is an essential difference between the Christian and the non-Christian. So it
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:38.200]   tends to think that a man makes himself a Christian by taking New Year resolutions,
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:42.560]   deciding to drink less or do something else less, and improve himself a bit and try to
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:46.560]   do a little more good. He makes himself a Christian. He's improving himself. You see,
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:56.360]   it's only a question of a slight change. It's an adaptation. It's a slight modification,
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:19:03.000]   an improvement of what we once were. Or they may go further and think that the Christian
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.600]   is a man who has added something to his life which he didn't have before, and which the
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:13.120]   man who's not a Christian still hasn't got. But he essentially is still the same
[00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:18.280]   man, but he's added something to himself. I sometimes put it like this. I get the impression
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:23.240]   that many people think that the only difference between the Christian and the non-Christian
[00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:28.960]   is that it's like a book, you see. Two books, if you like. There's one. The main
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:34.120]   body of the book is the same in both cases. Well, what's the difference? One of them's
[00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:40.720]   got an appendix to the book, and in the appendix he says that he's a Christian. He's exactly
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:45.160]   the same as the other men in every other respect. If you meet him from Monday to Saturday night,
[00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:48.840]   there's no difference. Sunday, "Ah, this man goes to church, the other man doesn't."
[00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:54.560]   That's in the appendix, something he adds on. Does this peculiar thing once a week,
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:58.000]   and the other man doesn't do it. Otherwise, there's nothing in it really, except that
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.280]   he tries to live a better life, and so on. Now, that is the common notion with regard
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:10.160]   to this whole matter. That the difference between the Christian, the godly man, and
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:16.080]   the non-Christian, the ungodly, is a very slight one, and is simply a difference in
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:23.440]   certain respects. Well, I needn't keep you. Surely, this picture of ours tonight gives
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:29.720]   the lie director that once and forever. We haven't got a comparison here between two
[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:36.560]   trees. We've got a comparison between a tree and a heap of chaff. There's nothing
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:45.680]   in common at all. What he's emphasizing is the altogether entire difference. It isn't
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:50.640]   the difference between an oak tree and a larch. It isn't the difference between an oak tree
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:59.360]   and an apple tree. It isn't the difference between some majestic pine and some black
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:05.160]   thorn or something like that. No, no. He's not comparing trees. He's comparing a tree
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:12.200]   with chaff. And he does that, of course, in order to bring this point perfectly clearly
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:20.360]   before our minds that the difference is as deep and as radical and as essential as the
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:26.240]   difference can possibly be. We say it's the difference between chalk and cheese. Well,
[00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:31.400]   the difference between a tree and a heap of chaff is even bigger than that. The fact is,
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:38.000]   he says, there is nothing common at all to the two. It is a complete contrast.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:45.040]   Now, I wonder whether we'd all realize that. Had we realized that the difference between
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:53.240]   the Christian and the non-Christian is not a matter of conduct and of behavior. It is
[00:21:53.240 --> 00:22:01.280]   the difference of nature. Now, that's all important, you see, for this reason. But many
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:06.600]   ungodly men can live quite a good life, morally, ethically, judgmentally. There are many doing
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:11.440]   that. There are many very good people in the world tonight. Good from the standpoint, I
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:17.040]   say, of morals and of social customs and habits, doing good and so on. There are many people
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:21.040]   in the world tonight who are very good in that sense, who are not Christians at all.
[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:25.880]   Well, why do you say they're not Christians, says someone? Well, my main reason is this.
[00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:33.280]   They haven't got the same nature as the Christian. The Bible's full of this sort of thing. If
[00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:43.240]   you judge a man by the usual canons of judgment applied by men to one another, you would undoubtedly
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:51.680]   come to the conclusion that Esau was a much nicer and a much better man than Jacob. Seems,
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:58.000]   as we put it, to be a more decent fellow. Seems to have better traits and characteristics
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.880]   in his personality. And yet, you see, the Bible says that the man who was loved by God
[00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:12.000]   was Jacob. Why, well, the nature. God doesn't judge by the outward appearance. God judges
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:19.280]   by the heart. God's interested in what a man is, not simply in what he does. "The rank
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:25.880]   is but the guinea stamp. A man's a man for all that," says Robert Burns, and I apply
[00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:31.480]   his message in this much higher and spiritual sense. That's it. It isn't the appearance,
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:37.680]   it isn't the veneer that a man can put on. It's what he is, what's his nature, what is
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:44.600]   he in the depths and the vitals of his being. Now, that is the thing I say that is brought
[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:53.280]   out so wonderfully by our comparison here tonight. Are you a tree, or are you like a
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:24:00.560]   heap of chaff? Collection of particles, nondescript as I'm going to show you. Now, that I may
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:05.120]   prove my contention, turn over to the New Testament and what you find. Well, the New
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:09.160]   Testament, in showing the difference between the Christian and the non-Christian, puts
[00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:20.080]   it in terms like these. It says that a Christian is a man who is born again. Now, there's the
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:24.840]   same radical point. Before you can become a Christian, said our Lord to Nicodemus, you
[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:30.840]   need to be born again. Nicodemus patently thought that it was the question of adding
[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:35.480]   on to what he'd got. He goes to our Lord, seeking his interview, and he says, "Master,
[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:39.040]   I've been watching you and listening to you. You're much further advanced than I am, though
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:46.960]   I'm a master of Israel. What is this extra?" "Not a question of extras," says our Lord.
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:57.440]   "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, accept a man, be born again." He cannot see the kingdom
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:08.560]   of God. It's a rebirth that's necessary. These are the New Testament terms. A regeneration.
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:15.720]   Got to be generated anew. There was nothing there. There's to be an act of generation.
[00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:22.080]   There's to be a kind of conception, leading to a birth. Nothing less than that. Look at
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:28.000]   its other terms. It talks about a new creation. "If any man be in Christ," says the Apostle
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:34.320]   Paul, "he's a new creation." He isn't just a little bit better than he was. He isn't
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:40.480]   slightly different from the men who's not a Christian. He's a new creature, a new creation.
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:46.600]   The God who created at the beginning has created something new here that wasn't there before.
[00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:51.840]   Now that's the way the New Testament puts it. You see, David puts it in a familiar illustration.
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:56.640]   But he's really got the whole truth, hasn't he? He's got the principle. He puts it pictorially.
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:00.280]   There you've got it explicitly in the teaching of the New Testament. But it's exactly the
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:07.880]   same thing. And take one other further illustration of this in the New Testament. "It's the difference,"
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:14.880]   says Paul, "to the Ephesians between death and life. 'You, hath he quickened, who were
[00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:25.000]   dead in trespasses and sins.'" Dead! Birth! Life! That's the contrast. Well, here it is
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:32.520]   before us this evening in terms of a contrast between a tree growing by the side of a river
[00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:40.120]   and just a heap of chaff. Well, now then, having established that this is a very profound
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:46.600]   difference, I want to take you through the details of the difference. My friend, I'm
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:55.800]   doing this and I'm going into the details because I want you to be a happy man and woman.
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:27:02.760]   I want you to be a blessed person. And thank God I've got a message that can do that. I'm
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:08.560]   not doing it. I'm simply here as a mouthpiece. I'm simply here to show you what David puts
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:13.480]   before us here in this wonderful illustration, as the Spirit of God will enable me to do
[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:20.920]   so. I say to you that if your life is nothing but chaff, you'll never be happy. Indeed,
[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:25.960]   you'll be eternally miserable if you go out of this world like that. Nothing is more important
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:30.120]   than that you should see the truth about yourself. Listen, therefore, to the difference as it
[00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:39.760]   is worked out by this comparison. The ungodly is like a heap of chaff. The other man's like
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:48.320]   a tree. What's the difference? Well, here's the first thing. The ungodly is nothing but
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:28:01.320]   a relic. He is nothing but a remnant. He is nothing but a ruins. He is nothing but a wreck.
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:06.360]   What do you mean, says someone? Well, I simply ask you a question. What is chaff? Do you
[00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:12.880]   know what chaff is? Well, chaff is that which remains when you've taken the grain out.
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:20.040]   There's your grain, you see, surrounded by this covering. The grain is the kernel, and
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:27.800]   round it is this covering, this integument, as it were, this husk. And then in the process
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:33.840]   of winnowing or threshing, what you do is you take out the grain with its food and its
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:44.160]   life and its value and its power. And what's left, the refuse, is what is called the chaff.
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:48.480]   So what David is telling us about this man who is an ungodly man, who is not a Christian,
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:55.720]   is that he is nothing but a relic. He is nothing but a husk. He is nothing but a covering.
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:29:04.400]   He is that which is left when everything that is vital and is of value is gone. You see,
[00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:10.120]   it's a very wonderful picture, this. The Bible, when you turn to its great doctrinal statements,
[00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:18.440]   puts all that like this. It says, "What is the truth about men in sin?" Why is it that
[00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:23.040]   people are not blessed? Why is it that people are not happy? Well, says the Bible, the answer
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:33.360]   is this. Man has fallen. He was there, he's now here. He's fallen. Man, what's the matter
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:42.480]   with him? He is a lost soul. He's lost his soul. What's the matter with him? He's lost
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:51.040]   his life. Man is dead in trespasses and in sin. He is nothing but the husk, the kernel
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:57.280]   of God. He is nothing but the integument, the outer covering. All the valuable thing
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:07.880]   itself, it's gone. Refuse. Now, what it all means, my dear friend, is this. That man as
[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:17.320]   he is by nature and as he is born into this world, is not real man at all. The greatest
[00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:22.160]   thing, the most wonderful thing, the noblest thing about man as God originally created
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:31.760]   him has gone. Do you think that God made men and women as they are to be seen in this world
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:42.040]   at this moment? Is that God's creation? Look at that poor, helpless drunkard. Look at that
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:47.880]   poor person who's fallen into some other sin. Look at the miser. Look at the ambitious person.
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:53.080]   Did God create such things? Of course, he didn't. God never created men like that.
[00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:59.800]   That's the husk. That's the refuse. That's the chaff. The vital thing that makes man
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:08.160]   man is not there. It's gone. Lost. The soul is lost. That's why the Son of God, when he
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:13.280]   was in this world, said, "The Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which is
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:23.400]   lost." The precious grain. What is this world? You see, as God made men, he made them in
[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:35.040]   his own image. And it's the image that's been lost. Man was made by God and for God.
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:40.240]   He was made in the image and likeness of God. What's that world? That was men's relationship
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:46.760]   to God. Man was made as the companion of God. Man was like God. He was made upright. He
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:53.680]   was given an original righteousness like that of God himself. He enjoyed God and companionship
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:59.560]   with God and fellowship with God. Man had got a spiritual faculty. He was never happier
[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:05.960]   than when he was in that spiritual realm, having communion with God, the Word of God
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:13.560]   and the things of God. They were his great delight. But man has fallen, you see, he isn't
[00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:21.880]   like that. That's exactly what's gone. The original righteousness, where is it? The
[00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:31.440]   enjoyment of God, where is it? The spiritual faculty, the spirit and the faculty divine
[00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:38.120]   that the poet speaks of, where is it? I ask you directly, is it in you, my friend, or
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:43.840]   have you lost it? Is there nothing left but chaff, the outward covering, the mere integument?
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:48.040]   Oh, I mustn't keep you, but what David is saying here is this. It's the message of
[00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:53.560]   the whole Bible. As you look at man as he is in sin, man as the result of the fall,
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:57.200]   what you're seeing is nothing but the covering, the integument. You're seeing nothing but
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:02.520]   the body and the kind of body and psychical life. That's the life man is living today.
[00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:11.040]   It's not a spiritual life, it's a psychical life. It's not surprising, you see, that some
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:19.400]   of these scientists say that man is nothing but an animal. You look at man as he is in
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:26.400]   sin and you see nothing but an animal. You look at man as he is today, you see nothing
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:32.720]   but an animal that lives to eat and to drink and to indulge his sex. I really don't see
[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:40.120]   much difference. The way people are living is very reminiscent of the farmyard. Indeed,
[00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:46.840]   it's very reminiscent sometimes even of the jungle. But that isn't man. That's the refuse,
[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:55.240]   that's the chaff, that's the husk. That's nothing but the ruins. That's not man. The
[00:33:55.240 --> 00:34:01.040]   big thing, the great thing, the thing that came from God is the thing that's been lost.
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:07.760]   It's gone. There's nothing left but ruins. So you see, a writer of a hymn once offered
[00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:15.680]   up a prayer and he said, "The ruins of my soul repair and reign without a rival there."
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:22.240]   Or an old Puritan living 300 years ago, he said, "Man, as a result of the fall and as
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:28.120]   the result of sin," he said, "is like many an old castle or a great old house that you
[00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:33.720]   can see sometimes in the country." You go along a road and you see a ruins. It's grown
[00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:39.240]   over with ivy and with moss and all sorts of things and obvious ruins. And you go off
[00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:44.280]   the main road and you examine this and there you see a tablet. And on the tablet you read,
[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:52.840]   "So and so once upon a time lived here. It was once the ancestral home of some great
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:58.440]   noble men. Nothing now but a mess of ruins with the children play playing in it and the
[00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:04.200]   walls fallen down and all the moss and the ivy and all the encumbrances and the nettles
[00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:12.840]   and the thorns. Yet the tablet says, "So and so once lived here." And said the old
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:21.480]   Puritan, "That man is nothing but a ruins and there's a notice on the ruins which
[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:32.120]   says, "God once lived here." God once lived here. The image of God was once here.
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:38.240]   This was a noble creature as that was once a noble building. But you're not seeing
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:44.960]   the real thing, you're seeing the ruins. God once lived here. But you see, this is
[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:51.680]   it. Here's man as the result of sin and of the fall. He is nothing but a remnant,
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:59.480]   a relic, a ruin. Chaff. Without the wheat, without the kernel, without the germ, without
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:04.240]   the life. But the Christian is like a tree. I'm not going to tell you so much about
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:08.080]   the Christian tonight. I want anybody who's in this service who's not a Christian to
[00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:13.120]   see himself as he is. You won't believe in Christ until you've seen your need of
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:17.320]   a ruin. You won't believe in Christ until you see the ruins that you are. You won't
[00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:22.600]   turn to Christ and believe this gospel until you've seen that you're nothing but chaff.
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:31.400]   A refuse, a relic, a ruin. But just notice it in passing. A tree is an organism, isn't
[00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:37.600]   it? It's a whole. It's not a mere remnant and relic. There's a wholeness about a tree.
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:42.640]   And that is the essential difference between the ungodly and the godly. But let me hurry
[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:47.600]   to a second point. The second thing about that mass, that heap of chaff there is that
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:54.960]   it's got no form at all. It's just a mass, a formless mass, a heap, a refuse of just
[00:36:54.960 --> 00:37:00.320]   the scrapings and the shavings, as it were, of the husk. And there it is in a pile and
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:04.680]   in a heap. It looks like this now. It won't look like that in five minutes. The wind will
[00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:13.000]   have moved it a little. There it is, a formless, shapeless mass. And that's the ungodly, says
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:21.600]   this man. The truth about man in sin is that he's lost his character. It's difficult to
[00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:29.760]   define him. There's no pattern to his life. He's always changing. You never know what
[00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:34.240]   he's going to believe. You never know what he's going to do. Why? Well, because there's
[00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:42.800]   no form about his life at all. There's no governing principle. And that is why it's
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:47.560]   so difficult to define such a person. You see, the Bible says we're all either godly
[00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:53.200]   or ungodly, but then look at the ungodly. What a difference there is between them. From
[00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:56.980]   your great philosopher to your man who doesn't think at all, from your highly respectable
[00:37:56.980 --> 00:38:03.160]   person to the profligate sinner, all ungodly. What a mass it is. What a formless, shapeless
[00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:08.000]   mass. There's no rhyme or reason. You can't really define it, but there it is. It's just
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:18.760]   a conglomeration of scrapings. There's no form, there's no beauty, there's no symmetry.
[00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:23.640]   But look at this tree for a moment. What a difference. This is the godly man. He's like
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:31.560]   a tree. And the whole point about a tree is that it has form. Up it comes, the trunk and
[00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:37.360]   the branches. You've noticed the symmetry, haven't you? There's nothing more beautiful
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:41.520]   than a tree. I'm one of those people who says that a tree is much more beautiful than flowers.
[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:47.960]   Doesn't matter. You have your own opinion about that, but oh, examine trees. And look
[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:54.520]   at the form and the beauty and the balance and the symmetry, the consistency as it were,
[00:38:54.520 --> 00:39:00.480]   that is so characteristic of it. Now this is the truth about the godly man. He is not
[00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:05.520]   something indefinable. A Christian is not a man who's got some vague, nice feelings
[00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:10.440]   within him and who feels now and again like doing a bit of good. That's not Christianity.
[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:15.720]   Christianity is not a formless, shapeless collection of nice feelings and sentiments.
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:22.720]   It is definable, easily recognizable. It's like the tree. There is a balance about the
[00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:28.240]   life of the Christian. He has got a doctrine, he's got a practice, he's got an understanding,
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:36.600]   he's got an emotion. This is the great characteristic of this man who is godly, who is in Christ
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:41.120]   and who belongs to the realm of the spiritual and the unseen.
[00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:45.520]   I'm simply giving you some headings. Work them out for yourselves. Is there form in
[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:54.800]   your life? Is there a shape to it? Is there consistency? Is there balance? Is there beauty?
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:40:00.920]   Ask yourself that simple question. What is my life? Can I tell? Can I say? Can I give
[00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:05.280]   an account of it or cannot I? It's one or the other.
[00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:11.280]   Let me hurry on. The third point is this. Another very striking difference between that
[00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:18.720]   tree and this heap of chaff is this, that that tree has got roots. The heap of chaff
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:24.720]   doesn't. There it is. Somebody's brushed it together. There it is lying on the surface.
[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:28.800]   It's not attached. Everything's moving. Breathe on it and you make it move. If the
[00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:39.000]   wind comes, well this man says it's gone. Chaff, which the wind driveth away, doesn't
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.840]   drive away a tree because it's got roots.
[00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:48.360]   Now here is a tremendously important point. The whole tragedy about the man who's not
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:55.480]   godly, who's not a Christian, is that he's rootless. Or if you prefer it, he's got no
[00:40:55.480 --> 00:41:02.960]   foundations. It's a superficial life. It's a light one, all on the surface. Of course
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:07.520]   it can be made to look attractive. An artist can do something even with a heap of chaff.
[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:15.120]   But you see it's still all on the surface, all light. There are no really fixed principles
[00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:19.840]   there. There is nothing established.
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:25.640]   Now I could easily demonstrate all I'm saying. What do you really know about life? What do
[00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:31.080]   you know about death? How do you meet the possible things that may happen in 1963? These
[00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:35.720]   are the questions. Now I say that this is the truth about the godless man. He's got
[00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:41.680]   no roots. He is utterly insecure. He doesn't know what's going to happen. And when it
[00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:45.840]   does happen, he doesn't know what to do about it. A wind of change can change him.
[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:49.520]   He's subject to it all. It's all contingent. It all depends.
[00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:55.720]   Oh, there are thousands of men in this city of London tonight like that. There's many
[00:41:55.720 --> 00:42:03.160]   a poor wife tonight expecting her husband home. And this is all she can say. If he doesn't
[00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:09.320]   meet so-and-so, he'll be home at this time. If he does meet so-and-so, I don't know
[00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:16.280]   when I may see him. He's rootless. He's all on the surface. It depends whether the
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:23.000]   wind blows, who's beneath, what may happen to him. All these things determine his life.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:30.840]   Ah, this godless life, it's an insecure one. It's a life that's always changing.
[00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:34.840]   You find these people change their views. They change their ideas. They change their
[00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:41.000]   cults. They change their religions. Like we are told of those people that Paul found at
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:47.040]   Athens, there they were in Athens, the Stoics and the Epicureans, the most sophisticated
[00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:53.440]   people of the first century. They spent all their time in telling or hearing some new
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:43:00.320]   thing. And the clever people who are godless are still doing that. Have you heard this?
[00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:04.640]   Have you heard the latest? And there's some new cult, some new treatment, some new
[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:09.240]   idea. After it they go. Then it doesn't work, they try the other. Always spending
[00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:21.240]   their time in hearing or telling about some new thing. Like the chap, rootless. No foundations
[00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:26.640]   to their lives. Well, the Christian, the godly man, is altogether different, you see. This
[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:32.200]   man is delightous in the law of the Lord and he meditates in it day and night. So we are
[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:41.840]   told about him in the New Testament that he is rooted and grounded in the faith. And this
[00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:49.200]   is something that needs to be emphasized at this present time. The Christian is not just
[00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:54.080]   a nice man, he's not just a good man, he's not just a man who has pleasant and happy
[00:43:54.080 --> 00:44:05.440]   feelings. The Christian is a man who is rooted and grounded in the faith. The Christian is
[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:14.640]   a man who knows what he believes and he knows whom he believes. I grieve to have to say
[00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:20.720]   it, but I don't care who says it on a television interview or anywhere else. A man who says
[00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:26.120]   that a Christian is just a man who recognizes the ethical teaching of Christ and then does
[00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:33.160]   his best to follow it, is a man who knows nothing about Christianity. Whatever position
[00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:43.600]   he may have held in the Christian church before he retired. A Christian is a man who believes
[00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:51.160]   a body of doctrine. It's like a tree. It's got roots. It's held by something. It's
[00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:55.680]   fixed to something. The tendrils are grasping something. That's why it's not carried
[00:44:55.680 --> 00:45:08.560]   away by the wind, you see. A Christian is a man who believes a body of doctrine. And
[00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:14.440]   the body of doctrine doesn't stop at believing in God. Of course, some say that you don't
[00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:19.960]   even need to believe that, that you can look forward to meeting atheists in heaven. What
[00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:26.320]   have we come to, my dear friends? That's chaff. That's chaff to say that a man can
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:30.440]   believe or disbelieve anything he likes in this world and still go to heaven. That's
[00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:35.280]   to say that the chaff becomes a tree. But there's no difference. It's a lie. It's
[00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:41.040]   not true. It's the difference between chaff and tree. And the tree has got its roots,
[00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:49.480]   and the roots are fixed, rooted and grounded in the faith. What is this faith? Oh, it's
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:56.280]   the faith in the Son of God. It is the faith that says that Jesus of Nazareth is the only
[00:45:56.280 --> 00:46:03.880]   begotten Son of God. It says that he was born of a virgin. It was a miraculous birth. He
[00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:10.320]   had no human father. It was a unique act of God. The Holy Spirit came upon Mary, conceived
[00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:18.960]   of the Holy Ghost. It says that he proved that by his miracles and by his teaching.
[00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:23.920]   It says that he went to the cross on Calvary deliberately because it was the only way whereby
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:28.840]   he could save us. That he took our sins upon himself and bore their punishment. That our
[00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:34.520]   guilt was laid on him and God smote our guilt in him, punished him for us and thereby gives
[00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:39.320]   us free forgiveness. It believes that a man becomes a Christian not as the result of his
[00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:45.920]   good life or his good deeds, but because he believes that Christ died for him and rose
[00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:52.320]   again and God puts Christ's righteousness upon him. That's what it believes. It believes
[00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:58.880]   in the resurrection of Christ. The literal, physical, bodily resurrection. It believes
[00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:02.800]   in the person of the Holy Spirit and that he was sent upon the church on the day of
[00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:10.160]   Pentecost. These are the things onto which the roots of these men cling and are entwined
[00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:15.920]   about them and hold on to them and out of which everything else comes. There are roots
[00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:23.360]   in the Christian. There is nothing in the chaff. The chaff doesn't know what it believes.
[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:27.040]   It doesn't know where it is and that's why it's always changing and that's why
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:31.720]   it's always insecure. The other man, you see, is entirely different. "Let every man,"
[00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:36.080]   says the apostle Peter, "be ready at all times to give a reason for the hope that is
[00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:43.120]   in him." Come, my friends. We are living in a dying world. I've read again this week,
[00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:47.480]   as probably some of you have done, that the leading scientists who recently held a conference
[00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:54.760]   on their own, they came to a majority decision. This isn't my view. This is the view of
[00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:59.320]   some of the most leading scientists in the world today who are not Christians. They came
[00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:06.880]   to the solemn conclusion, the majority of them, that this world of ours has not got
[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:15.520]   another ten years to go. "Very well," I say. "I can't afford to take risks. I'll
[00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:20.120]   have to give an account of my stewardship, of my preaching. I may be asked about your
[00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:24.960]   soul. Did I make it plain and clear to you? What I'm asking you, therefore, is this.
[00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:28.960]   You say you're like a tree and that you don't belong to the chaff. Well, then I ask
[00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:36.000]   you, do you believe the things I've been putting before you? And do you believe that
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:42.040]   unless a man does believe those things, he is not a Christian? However good he may be,
[00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:47.280]   however moral, however much good he may do, however wonderful his philosophy may be, if
[00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:53.200]   he doesn't believe the bare essentials, the irreducible minimum of this Christian
[00:48:53.200 --> 00:49:02.240]   faith, he is chaff, and nothing but chaff. The godless man has no roots. The tree has
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:08.240]   roots. Then another thing I'd ask you to consider and to work out for yourselves is
[00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:15.800]   this. The difference between a heap of chaff and a tree is the difference between lifelessness
[00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:23.920]   and life. There's no life in a heap of chaff, and you'll never get growth in a heap of
[00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:28.800]   chaff. You can leave it there on the ground for a thousand years. It won't add to itself.
[00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:35.200]   Why? It's got no life in it. But a tree, why? The whole thing about a tree is that
[00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:44.000]   it's got life in it and it can grow, but not so that chaff. The chaff, I say, is the
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:47.840]   same at the end as it was at the beginning. Well, that isn't quite true. It's worse.
[00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:54.280]   A lot of dirt and mud gets attached to it. Bits of it are blown about. All sorts of things
[00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:59.560]   are added to it. But there's never any improvement. There's never anything better. Well, no, that's
[00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:05.920]   what the Bible says about man in sin. It doesn't matter what he does. He doesn't improve himself.
[00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:09.440]   He doesn't add to himself. He doesn't grow. He doesn't develop. What, you say? Are you
[00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:14.400]   talking about science? Are you talking about music and art? I am. I tell you that if a
[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:20.280]   man doesn't know this truth of God as it is in Christ Jesus, he will end where he began.
[00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:27.840]   No, that's not true. He'll be worse than when he began.
[00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:33.880]   The wise men Solomon in writing Ecclesiastes put it, didn't he? "Vanity of vanities, all
[00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:42.320]   is vanity." But the poets have said it. There isn't two words worth saying it. You see,
[00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:47.800]   all these poets, they're all suffering from nostalgia. The greatest English poets generally
[00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:56.160]   look back across their lives. "Oh, they said that I was still the man I once was. Our birth
[00:50:56.160 --> 00:51:04.080]   is but a sleep and a forgetting. The soul that rises with us are a life star at that
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:13.040]   elsewhere it's setting and cometh from afar not in entire forgetfulness and not in utter
[00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:21.640]   nakedness. Trailing clouds of glory do we come from God who is our home. Heaven lies
[00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:30.720]   about us in our infancy. Shades of the prison house begin to close upon the growing by.
[00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:36.520]   The youth who daily from the east must travel still is nature's priest and by the vision
[00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:46.320]   splendid is on his way attended. At length the man perceives it die away and fade into
[00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:54.480]   the light of common day. Oh, that I could go back," says the poet, "to nostalgia. I'm
[00:51:54.480 --> 00:52:00.200]   not the man I once was. Where is the dream? Where is the ecstasy? Where is the man I once
[00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:06.080]   set out as? What's happened to him? Oh," he says, "I seem to be losing. Change and decay
[00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:13.520]   in all around I see. There's no progress. There's no development. There's no possibility
[00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:18.960]   of growth. Chaff can't grow. It can't develop. It can't add to itself. It must be worse.
[00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:25.600]   Dust, mud, mire are added to it. There it is." And so these great poets say about life, you
[00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:34.640]   see, supporting the teaching of the Bible. All your great vast knowledge and learning,
[00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:40.720]   where does it bring you? Does it really help you to live? Does it really help you to be
[00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:46.080]   a man? Does it really help you to die? Does it throw any light upon eternity? Look at
[00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:51.520]   your great men dying and then watch them even as they're decaying before they die. They're
[00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:55.640]   objects of misery and compassion and we feel like saying, "Oh, what a pity he doesn't
[00:52:55.640 --> 00:53:04.240]   go," before he'll be too sad even to look at. Chaff, that's chaff, you see. You never
[00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:07.920]   speak like that about a tree, do you? "Oh no, the whole thing is different. The tree
[00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:12.560]   has got life in it." So you turn to your New Testament and you read about men starting
[00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:18.040]   out as babes in Christ. Ah, here's something different. You see, the difference between
[00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:23.240]   a babe and a heap of chaff is this. That can never develop. It can never grow. But oh,
[00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:28.040]   a babe, he can't speak, he can't think, he can't reason. But he's a babe. He's got life
[00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:32.640]   in him. He can develop. He can grow. And so he does. And John writes his first epistle
[00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:39.080]   to the children, to the young men, to the old men. There's an advance, there's a development,
[00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:43.600]   there is a growth always possible in a tree. And to me that's one of the most glorious
[00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:50.160]   things about this Christian life. The more I go on it, the more thrilled in it I am.
[00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:56.320]   Oh, the vastness of the knowledge as one brings one's little mind to these mighty epistles
[00:53:56.320 --> 00:54:01.560]   of the Apostle Paul and see him handling what Thomas Carlyle called the "immensities and
[00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:07.720]   infinities," this truth of God that you may be able to comprehend, he says, with all saints
[00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:13.400]   everywhere. What is the breadth and length and depth and height and to know the love
[00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:21.240]   of God which passes knowledge. What is this? It's a never-ebbing sea. And one goes on out
[00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:27.760]   into it ever forward, into the depths, the deep things of God. And one grows in knowledge
[00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:34.920]   and one grows in grace and there is endless, infinite, eternal possibility of development
[00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:43.200]   and of advance. Oh, the difference between the godly life and the ungodly life. The difference
[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:50.440]   between the tree and the chaff, the difference between life and death. Something inert, lifeless,
[00:54:50.440 --> 00:54:55.680]   inanimate and that which is full of life. But I must let you go.
[00:54:55.680 --> 00:55:04.480]   The last thing, of course, one must refer to is the fruit. Never any fruit yet coming
[00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:19.200]   from chaff. Chaff is always useless. And the ungodly life is a life of chaff. It never
[00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:25.080]   gives them any real satisfaction. Listen to the way the Apostle Paul puts a question to
[00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:30.680]   the Romans. He reminds them that they were once sinners and slaves of sin. And he puts
[00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:36.560]   this tremendous question that I would put to everybody tonight who is listening to me.
[00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:42.440]   "For when you were the servants of sin, you were free from righteousness, you didn't
[00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:50.240]   have any." Then he asks his question, "What fruit had you then in those things whereof
[00:55:50.240 --> 00:56:00.440]   now you are ashamed?" "For the end of those things is death." Listen, says Paul.
[00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:06.800]   Tell me, what real fruit did you have in those things when you were doing them? Did they
[00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:13.320]   give you real satisfaction? Did they give you real joy? Did they give you true and clean
[00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:19.560]   and real happiness? Did they give you anything then? I know he says you're ashamed of them
[00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:28.800]   now, but did they even give you any satisfaction then? "And their end is death." How true
[00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:35.840]   it is. The life of sin never gives satisfaction. We think it's going to. The moment you think
[00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:40.720]   you've had it, you've lost it. There's nothing to feed upon. There's nothing left.
[00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:45.600]   Nothing to ruminate upon. There's no real value. What does lust really give you? What
[00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:50.480]   does greed really give you? What does ambition really give you? Never. It's never satisfied.
[00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:55.080]   The ambitious man is never satisfied. He always wants more, and he's afraid somebody else
[00:56:55.080 --> 00:57:00.120]   is coming up, afraid he's going to be robbed of it. Never peace, never joy, never real
[00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:04.280]   happiness. It's death.
[00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:20.800]   Oh, that hymn that we sang just now puts it very perfectly. "I lay in dust, life's glory
[00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:33.480]   dead." He'd come to see the truth about himself, that it was a life of chaff. And so as I leave
[00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:41.160]   you this evening, I ask you this final question. What is the nature, the character of your
[00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:55.440]   life? Is it chaff, or is it like a tree? This is what the Bible tells us. All flesh is as
[00:57:55.440 --> 00:58:09.280]   grass, and all the glory of man is the goodness of grass. The grass withereth, the flower
[00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:18.880]   thereof falleth away. That's it. All the glory of man, the burst of heraldry, the pump of
[00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:25.600]   power and all the beauty all that welfare gave, awaits alike the inevitable hour. The
[00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:34.280]   paths of glory lead but to the grave. And many a man who's lived for this world and
[00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:38.920]   its glory and thought he's achieved a great deal, finds at the end he's got nothing but
[00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:45.760]   a heap of chaff. What the world is living for tonight is nothing but chaff. Think of
[00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:49.360]   the people who've been feeding today on the filth of the law courts in their Sunday
[00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:53.840]   newspapers who are living to drink and to gamble and to indulge other things. What have
[00:58:53.840 --> 00:59:00.560]   they got? What's left? What will they have at the end? It's nothing but refuse, chaff.
[00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:13.360]   I lay in dust, life's glory dead. And that's what it always comes to. All flesh is but
[00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:22.120]   as grass. And all the glory of men as the flower of grass. The wind of the Lord bloweth
[00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:29.720]   upon it and the result is the grass withereth and the flower thereof falleth away. Like
[00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:40.600]   the chaff it's carried away by the wind and nothing and nothing at all remains.
[00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:47.880]   That is the life of the ungodly, my friends. The glittering prizes of this world are nothing
[00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:55.760]   but chaff. They've got nothing to give the soul, nothing to give the spirit, nothing
[00:59:55.760 --> 01:00:06.480]   to give real joy and lasting peace or a solid treasure. Man is chasing bubble. The moment
[01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:11.080]   he touches it, it's exploded in its head. There's nothing there. He's got nothing but
[01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:17.920]   a heap of refuse. The kernel, the life, the grain is gone. There's nothing but the remains,
[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:35.480]   the ruins, the refuse. That's man without God. That's man as he is left to himself.
[01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:43.880]   The Son of God came as I've reminded you to seek and to save that which is lost. God willing,
[01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:48.360]   I'm going to try to tell you next Sunday night something of how he does this and how he gives
[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:53.160]   us this life. But I want you to know before you leave, because you may not be here, you
[01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:57.720]   may have gone before next Sunday, if you find there's nothing but refuse and chaff left
[01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:03.520]   in your life tonight, if there's nothing of the man that God originally made, oh, cry
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:09.200]   out to God, confess it to him, acknowledge it, don't try to defend yourself. Say, "I've
[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:20.480]   nothing. Create me anew." And he'll do it. He sent his Son into this world to save chaff,
[01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:32.800]   refuse, the ruins of the soul. And he has power sufficient to do it. He's born the punishment
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:40.400]   and the guilt of our sin for being chaff, whereas we were meant to be trees. He's died
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:51.280]   for you. And thus he exposes you to the life-giving and new-creating power of God through the
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:02:04.240]   blessed Holy Spirit. Oh, face the facts, acknowledge the truth, and cast yourself upon the mercy
[01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:17.880]   and the love of God in Jesus Christ our Lord, and be ye saved. Amen.
