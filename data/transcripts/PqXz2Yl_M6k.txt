[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.640]   So one of the things I'm most known for is the fact that I have never used social media.
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:15.760]   My 2016 TED talk, which is titled "Quit Social Media" just passed the 10 million view mark.
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:21.880]   My 2019 book "Digital Minimalism" has sold hundreds of thousands of copies.
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.340]   In recent years, I've been extensively covering the social media industry from a critical
[00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.120]   perspective for the New Yorker.
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.340]   So this is something that I am deeply associated with.
[00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:39.160]   It occurred to me recently, however, how do I know I'm not missing out on something special?
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.180]   What if social media really has evolved into something that is a true source of value in
[00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.720]   a way that I am forgetting?
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:53.360]   So I thought today it might be fun if I was to actually live here in the show, load up
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.400]   some actual social media apps and see what's going on.
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.460]   Jesse, you can attest I did not look at these in advance, so God knows what we're going
[00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.460]   to find.
[00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.200]   But we're going to look at some social media together and then talk about how we might
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.000]   repair our relationship with these tools.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.080]   Jesse, it would be funny if when I turn on these tools, it turns out that I'm in the
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.000]   middle of like a global canceling campaign that I didn't realize.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.560]   That "Cancel Cal" is like the number one trending hashtag would be a funny way to figure that
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.560]   out.
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.560]   All right.
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.560]   Let's look at some real social media.
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.240]   For those who are watching at home, I'm bringing this up on the screen.
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.960]   We're starting with Twitter, or as the kids call it today, X.
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:34.960]   Let's see what we can find.
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:35.960]   All right.
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.120]   Right off the bat, there is a tweet response here.
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.120]   So there's a tweet.
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.960]   I don't know if you can see this.
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.040]   There's a tweet, first of all, that's showing Taylor Swift hugging Travis Kelce after their
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.040]   Super Bowl win.
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.760]   We're recording this a couple of days after the Super Bowl.
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.920]   The original tweet says, "Imagine being against this," all right?
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.560]   But this tweet is being responded to.
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.160]   This response says, oh Lord, okay.
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.680]   This response from SmugFacundity, so I'm sure this is going to be very well-reasoned and
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:15.160]   compassionate, is the following, "Look, I hope everyone finds a wonderful spouse and
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.280]   brings 10 kids into the world and raises them together.
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.760]   Here's why this falls flat for 'the audience.'
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.960]   There is no hero's journey, no character arc.
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:29.640]   This is a perfect example of potential marriage as the capstone to a perfect life, and I'm
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.800]   against this message."
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.120]   Jesse, I don't even know if I know what that means.
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.600]   I don't know what that means either.
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.600]   Okay.
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.240]   SmugFacundity is upset that Taylor Swift is hugging Travis Kelce.
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:45.720]   I wonder if she's whispering into his ears, "Only two receptions for serious yardage?
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.320]   Come on, Travis.
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.320]   You can do better."
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.320]   See, that could be on Twitter.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.000]   So what I want you to do is think of something mean to say and hope that you get clout for
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   it.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.200]   Let me click on something else on here, #farmersprotest, all right?
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:06.080]   Let's just see what else is going on on Twitter.
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.560]   This is a protest going on in India, it looks like, and then there's a lot of arguing back
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.520]   and forth about what's going on.
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.560]   So let me read this, "They're fighting for regime change on behalf of opposition parties,
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:25.880]   said the professional protester, Chitra Singh," and here's some video of what looks like tear
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.000]   gas and a crowd.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   There's a drone flight.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.320]   All right, look, I think this is like classic, as I would expect, this is classic Twitter,
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.360]   and I don't mean this in a dismissive way because what we're seeing here is both the
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.180]   good and the bad in Twitter.
[00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.340]   The bad, I think, is let's all just take a pop culture event involving people that are
[00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.480]   impossibly distant from us, like Super Bowl champions and Taylor Swift, and just take
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:56.000]   turns seeing who can say like the more mean thing or smarmy thing and sort of hope we
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   get clout.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:04.880]   On the other hand, we also see Twitter highlighting here a protest happening in India that maybe
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.600]   you otherwise wouldn't come across it unless you were reading a newspaper.
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.360]   All right, so there's Twitter.
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.000]   Let's check in on some other social media, see what we are missing.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.200]   All right, let me load up a browser here.
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.840]   We've jumped now on the Instagram.
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.520]   The gram, as I'm told, it's called.
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.960]   I'm on the page here, Jesse loaded up, is popular hashtag, so I don't know if that actually
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.040]   means popular post or post that just happened to be associated with the word popular.
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.280]   I'm going to click on one.
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.280]   All right.
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.960]   I should be nervous, Jesse.
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.080]   If I click on this post, is it going to be something, let's see, it looks harmless.
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:47.320]   It looks like a nice couple in their young thirties, well-dressed with complicated glasses,
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.320]   arms interlocked.
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.320]   Let's click on this post.
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.320]   Oh, I got to log in.
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.680]   Oh, this is good.
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.120]   This means Jesse, you don't use Instagram.
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.960]   All right, so we can't actually click on these without logging in, so let's just look at
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:57.960]   them.
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:58.960]   That looks nice.
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.440]   Here's a person with huge muscles in the gym, looking nice.
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.360]   We have people on vacation.
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.440]   This is kind of classic Instagram, looking over a nice swimming pool with cabanas, so
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.680]   they're probably bragging about their vacation.
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.400]   All right, so here's a football thing.
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.080]   All right, this is a classic Instagram, people, everyone looks kind of happy.
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.880]   Everyone looks like they're in good shape.
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.880]   Everyone is sort of showing off a life that they want you to think is good.
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.200]   All right, God help us.
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.200]   Let's jump over to TikTok.
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.560]   All right, what am I looking at here?
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.120]   It's a person playing a video game.
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.720]   All right, I mean, good, I suppose.
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.160]   Oh, I see.
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.200]   So look at this.
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.920]   So this is classic TikTok.
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.120]   Every time I touch the screen, it just throws up another video as soon as I get bored.
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.600]   All right, here's a girl saying, "How much do I owe you?"
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:48.720]   Someone else says, "It's okay.
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:49.720]   It's on the house."
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.560]   I don't even know what they were showing, probably something inappropriate.
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.560]   Here's a video game.
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.520]   Let me swipe again.
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.560]   I got hired as a security guard at a pizzeria.
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.320]   They're pouring stuff onto avocados.
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.880]   They fried an avocado.
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.240]   All right, fine.
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.880]   Here is some sort of mashed potato dinosaur volcano.
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:09.880]   My God, look at this, Jesse.
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:14.360]   You just keep flipping and it's...
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.360]   Here's something.
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.360]   Ah, that's weird.
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.360]   Okay, next.
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.360]   Ah, that's weird.
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.480]   Okay, so there we go.
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.360]   We've checked in on social media in 2024.
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.160]   All right, so here's my take.
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.040]   Look, there's nothing intrinsically evil about what I just saw.
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.960]   There's nothing inherently bad about engaging with anything I just saw.
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.400]   But I can tell you as an outsider who doesn't use these services, who is looking at these
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:42.440]   with fresh eyes, guys, this stuff is really weird.
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:48.360]   It's really weird looking at what we just saw there, not in isolation that any one of
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:55.200]   those things is crazy, but that the foundation for a huge portion of our culture, the foundation
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:00.640]   of their engagement with their leisure time is based on these types of interactions.
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.880]   That I find to be strange.
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:07.080]   We get used to things once we've been in that world, but the outsider perspective here is
[00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:13.800]   these short videos, the people trying to be smug about celebrities and who can outdo each
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.160]   other, this pictures of various people's vacations.
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:22.880]   For this to be the foundation of your engagement with leisure, if a time traveler came forward
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:26.840]   from 2005 and looked at what I just looked at, it's not that they would be horrified
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.200]   by the individual things.
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:34.080]   I really do think however, they would be somewhat perplexed by the idea that this is the foundation
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:38.160]   of our culture's engagement with leisure.
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:43.080]   This stuff is okay, but it really does not seem like this should be the core of how we
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:48.200]   engage with the world outside of our work.
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.440]   So if you agree with this, what should we do about it?
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:51.960]   If you're like, you know what?
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:56.440]   I don't want to, oh my God, the video now, Jesse, because the TikTok's on my screen here
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:00.360]   still, they're pouring gravy down the mashed potato mountain.
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:02.840]   You see that?
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.840]   Just imagine you're the time traveler from 2005.
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:11.240]   Like, okay, so I'm watching, and the music playing is the Jurassic world theme song while
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:18.280]   gravy pours down a chute carved into a mashed potato mountain covered with chicken nugget
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:21.560]   dinosaurs.
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:24.600]   The Algonquin round table, this is not.
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:25.600]   All right.
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.280]   So we could do better.
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:30.080]   We could do better than making this the main thing we're looking at.
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.080]   All right.
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:32.080]   So how do we make this better?
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:36.520]   So let me start with the biggest mistake people make when they finally get fed up with how
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.500]   much time they're looking at their phone.
[00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:43.680]   The biggest mistake people make is they go straight to white knuckle abstention.
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:44.680]   You know what?
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:49.720]   I am fed up with people's comments on Taylor Swift and dinosaur mountains.
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.960]   So no more, no more phone.
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:55.140]   And I'm going to actually feel righteous by the fact I don't use my phone.
[00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:58.320]   You know these people because they will tell you immediately that they don't use social
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.640]   media or their phone.
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.760]   They will work it into every conversation.
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.880]   You can be in a building that's on fire and you can say this way, this way, this is the
[00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:09.220]   only staircase that's not engulfed in flames quickly.
[00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:11.520]   And they'd be like, great.
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.320]   Don't worry about this going on Instagram.
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.720]   I don't check Instagram anymore.
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.520]   I have an account, but I barely, and then they catch on fire.
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:21.000]   So, you know, when people are doing white knuckle abstention, because they talk all
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.400]   the time about it.
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:26.080]   That alone doesn't work very well.
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:31.120]   My philosophy of digital minimalism, my approach for dealing with these issues argues that
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:36.280]   these tools push out other things in your life and therefore then feel a void that those
[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:38.440]   things used to fill.
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:45.680]   When you just do white knuckle abstention, you are faced with the yawning void of boredom
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.560]   and your own thoughts and anxiety.
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:48.560]   It's very uncomfortable.
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:51.220]   You just sit there like, what am I supposed to do?
[00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:53.880]   You need something to have that smoothing distraction.
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.320]   Hey there.
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:10:00.760]   I want to take a quick moment to tell you about my new book, Slow Productivity, The
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:05.260]   Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout.
[00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:09.240]   If you like the type of things I talk about on this channel, you're really going to like
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.640]   this book.
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:17.040]   It distills all of my ideas into a clear philosophy combined with step-by-step instructions for
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.480]   putting it into action.
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:25.060]   Now if you pre-ordered this book before it comes out on March 5th, I have some bonuses
[00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:29.000]   I want to offer you as my way of saying thanks.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:35.720]   These include a chapter-by-chapter audio commentary from me, the author, and a crash course that
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:40.800]   will teach you how to put the ideas of slow productivity into action in your own life
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:41.800]   right away.
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:47.680]   So to find out more about the book and how to redeem your pre-order bonuses, check out

[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.080]   Everything you need, you can find there.
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.120]   Alright, thanks, let's get back to it.
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:58.160]   So the first step is not to abstain from your phone.
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.900]   The first step is forget your phone, do what you want to do on your phone, watch your Dino
[00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:09.060]   Mountain Gravy videos, but start adding at the same time really quality alternatives.
[00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:14.560]   Start adding into your life things that can eventually take the place of just looking
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:21.640]   at your phone, that can eat away at that sensation of boredom and anxiety of being alone with
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:26.260]   your own thoughts that drives us back to the suker of low-quality distractions.
[00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:27.400]   So what would these things look like?
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:32.140]   I'm going to give you six different things, we'll call this our high-quality leisure toolkit.
[00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:36.880]   Six different things that you should probably engage with, all of them, to some degree in
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:40.560]   your life in preparation to changing your relationship with your phone.
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.840]   One is going to be reading.
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.160]   You should read a lot more.
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:49.560]   This could be a mix of things that are just really fun, magazine articles or books that
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:54.240]   are really fun to read, as well as things that are smarter.
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:59.800]   A recent episode of the show, Jesse, I don't know if that was 286 maybe, I got into how
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:05.400]   to engage with this higher quality leisure, how to learn to engage with harder books.
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:07.440]   So you might want to check out that episode.
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:14.880]   All right, second, higher quality video media, prestige TV, movies, documentaries.
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:17.240]   This is another piece of this toolkit.
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:24.480]   This is content, which I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess that slightly more
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:29.280]   money and time was invested than in the video of gravy being poured down the mashed potato
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:30.280]   dinosaur mountain.
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:35.840]   So stuff in which real creative energy and focused effort was placed.
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:38.600]   Number three, skill-based hobby.
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.560]   Something you're into that requires a skill you can get better at, your results get better
[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:42.800]   as that skill improves.
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:46.460]   This creates a feedback loop that our mind really likes that can be more compelling to
[00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:50.000]   our mind than low quality distraction.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.320]   Hey, I'm working on this new project that is more advanced than I've done before.
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:57.240]   I think I might pull it off.
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.320]   This is compelling to me.
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:04.320]   Compelling enough that these other lower quality distractions aren't so strong in their appeal.
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:09.320]   Four, have some sort of exercise-based hobby, some sort of physical fitness where you're
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:14.840]   trying to build a streak, hit some marks in terms of where you want to get in your health,
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:18.540]   some sort of serious engagement with the physical.
[00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:25.500]   Among other things, this frees up, it frees up your body, it releases these chemicals
[00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:33.680]   into your mind that makes you less, gets you out of this torporific state of I'm low energy,
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:37.860]   I want to minimize energy, what's the lowest energy thing I can do to engage, it puts you
[00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:42.020]   more into a state of we're active, our muscles are growing, our lungs are being used.
[00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:44.660]   It changes your outlook at the world.
[00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:48.380]   Number five, get involved with communities that meet regularly, even if this is just
[00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:53.740]   friends that you have a standing, we go and see a movie every other week, we go to dinner
[00:13:53.740 --> 00:14:01.180]   once a month or a bigger, more organized activity, a league or a group that you go to.
[00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:03.920]   Have something that meets regularly that involves other people.
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:07.120]   And six, seek out adventures.
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:12.980]   I want to go travel to see the sports team play at the away stadium.
[00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:18.500]   I want to go to this museum, there's a special exhibit that's coming, I want to go read by
[00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:23.460]   a waterfall that I heard about that takes a two mile hike to get to.
[00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:26.880]   Things that are above and beyond what's easy and are really cool could create a really
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:29.020]   interesting experience.
[00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:33.540]   If you have these six things in your life, reading, high quality TV movies, skilled based
[00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:40.060]   hobby, exercise based hobby, regular meeting communities and adventures, take some time
[00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:42.660]   to add all these into your life.
[00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:46.980]   Now you're going to be in a position where the monopoly that your phone has on your time
[00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:49.340]   and attention has dissipated.
[00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:56.680]   It is now competing against higher quality versions of things that can satisfy the same
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:59.400]   needs that were driving you to your phone.
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:03.860]   Those needs are going to drive you one way or the other, but the phone gives you a low
[00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:07.860]   fidelity solution to what you crave.
[00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:14.020]   These high quality leisure activities give you a higher fidelity solution and therefore
[00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:19.260]   they're going to be more easily victorious.
[00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.580]   That's step one, you put alternatives to your phone in your life before you even worry about
[00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:25.140]   your phone habits.
[00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:26.140]   Step two, we declutter.
[00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:30.860]   Now this is the core idea for my book, Digital Minimalism.
[00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:34.140]   I don't believe in detoxing in the sense of take a break and then go back to what you're
[00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:37.900]   doing before, I believe in decluttering.
[00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:43.220]   So you step away, you take a break as step one of making permanent change.
[00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:47.300]   So the way this works is that you take 30 days where you are now ready to stop using
[00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:50.340]   these optional digital technologies in your life.
[00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:57.220]   The TikTok, the Instagram, the Twitter, the video games, YouTube.
[00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:02.060]   You step away from these optional technologies, but now you're prepared to do so because you
[00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:06.820]   have these six areas of high quality leisure already in your life, already rock and rolling.
[00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:08.620]   Just lean heavily into those.
[00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:10.460]   You're not staring into the void.
[00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:15.660]   You're not sitting there like a detoxing drug addict, shaking, like what am I going to do
[00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:16.660]   next?
[00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:17.660]   You're doing other things.
[00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:21.540]   So you're getting a taste of life without these tools.
[00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:23.900]   In doing so, you can see what you miss.
[00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:26.740]   You can also figure out what you really care about.
[00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:30.820]   At the end of the 30 days, then you can decide what, if anything, you want to add back into
[00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:35.940]   your digital life, to add back a tool, it must be really valuable, like, hey, this actually
[00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:38.900]   satisfies something that's important to me.
[00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:42.260]   And two, when you add it back, you should have clear rules for how and when you're going
[00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.660]   to use it.
[00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:50.940]   So maybe Twitter comes back into your life because you realized you really do need to
[00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:55.160]   keep up with baseball trade rumors that are going on.
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:17:00.060]   This is really important to you that during the hot stove season, you do really like baseball
[00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:05.980]   and it helps you engage to hear the baseball reporters sharing rumors on player trades.
[00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:06.980]   Let's say this is the situation.
[00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:09.900]   Well, now that you know this is why you're bringing Twitter back into your life, you
[00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:11.100]   can have clear rules on it.
[00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:12.100]   All right.
[00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:16.300]   I check in on these rumors during lunch break.
[00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:18.280]   It takes about 20 minutes.
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.140]   I don't follow anyone on Twitter.
[00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:27.220]   I just bookmarked the four baseball reporters who I follow, two from my team and maybe like
[00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:32.700]   Ken Rosenthal and Jay Papasan, national reporters have good sources.
[00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:35.920]   And I look at it on my desktop computer when I'm at work.
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:36.920]   So now I get that value.
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:38.540]   Every day I go on and see what's going on.
[00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:40.900]   But I also don't have Twitter with me on my phone.
[00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:44.020]   And these are part of a much larger timeline that I can check at any time.
[00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:46.300]   It has endless information.
[00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:50.620]   I put this tool back into my life for a specific reason with specific rules.
[00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:55.220]   This is how you reconfigure a digital life that operates on your terms, supports what
[00:17:55.220 --> 00:18:03.260]   you value, and yet minimizes the unnecessary negative side effects.
[00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:06.660]   So none of this is about this technology is good or that technology is bad.
[00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:12.180]   None of this is about you need to live exactly this way versus that way.
[00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:16.940]   It's about intention, but you can't have intention about your digital life until you build a
[00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:21.980]   life that's better than what we just saw when we took this quick tour through the state
[00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:24.020]   of social media in 2024.
[00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:29.460]   Again, what we just encountered here is fine, but also sort of weird and eccentric and idiosyncratic.
[00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:31.380]   To look at that now and again, who cares?
[00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:35.660]   It's like reading the tabloid in the supermarket checkout line.
[00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:40.340]   But if I found you reading the National Enquirer three to four hours a day, seven days a week,
[00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:43.060]   I would say, "Okay, buddy, I think we need a better hobby."
[00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:46.940]   And that is implicitly what we've all ended up doing.
[00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:52.460]   So to fix this relationship with social media and our phones more generally, put in place
[00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:54.820]   the alternatives that are much better.
[00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:59.620]   Get yourself to the place where your mind is increasingly embarrassed by choosing TikTok
[00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:04.700]   over all of these other much richer options, and then do your organized declutter.
[00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:09.780]   If you want to find out more about this, my book, Digital Minimalism, of course, dives
[00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:14.220]   into all these details, but hopefully I've given you enough there to get you started.
[00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:19.300]   Did you see, Jesse, in the Super Bowl, there was an ad for Snapchat?
[00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:21.300]   I did.
[00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:27.740]   It seemed to me like Snapchat was trying to argue, "We don't have some of the same problems
[00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:30.300]   as other social media platforms."
[00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:35.260]   Even though Snapchat, as any social media research will tell you, has been at the core,
[00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:38.540]   for example, of the teenage mental health crisis and its intersection with social media.
[00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:43.980]   It's very big among teenagers and Snapchat conversations, it leads to all sorts of issues.
[00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:46.820]   I was joking with the person I was with when we were watching the Super Bowl.
[00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:53.780]   I was like, "This is sort of like having an anti-Fentanyl ad sponsored by Crack."
[00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:56.060]   Remember Crack?
[00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:58.540]   This was better in some sense than it was now with Fentanyl.
[00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:01.280]   That was sort of the sense I got with that ad.
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:04.980]   It was hard to get Crack, so you wouldn't do as much of it.
[00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:08.020]   Fentanyl, it's an interesting argument.
[00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:11.020]   Hey, we're better than the other stuff that's causing damage.
[00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:12.020]   Oh well.
[00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:13.020]   All right.
[00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:14.020]   Well, there we go.
[00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:17.020]   So, I'm not joining social media yet, Jesse, but it was good to see it.
[00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:18.020]   Yep.
[00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:22.260]   By the way, I was proud that Instagram was not signed in on your iPad.
[00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:24.420]   That means you must not be a heavy Instagram user.
[00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:30.420]   I tried to open it on the app on my iPad and then I was asking for my password and I haven't
[00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:31.420]   used it in a while.
[00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:35.340]   Then I tried to find my password and I entered it, but then it wouldn't let you reset it.
[00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:36.340]   No, I like that, though.
[00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:38.980]   That means you haven't used it in a while and you've been okay.
[00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:39.980]   I've been okay.
[00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:42.540]   Think about all those beach vacations, though, you could have been learning about.
[00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:43.540]   Yep.
[00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:46.300]   You know, every once in a while, like a coach, like my golf coach or someone will send me
[00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:47.300]   a video.
[00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:48.380]   So, I go in and check that out.
[00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:49.380]   Yeah.
[00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:50.380]   People have done that, too.
[00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:54.220]   And you can, they'll let you see like one thing and then they'll say you have to log
[00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:55.220]   in.
[00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:56.220]   Mm-hmm.
[00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:57.220]   Yeah.
[00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:58.220]   So, there you go.
[00:20:58.220 --> 00:20:59.220]   All right.
[00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:02.580]   So, we got a bunch of questions from you, the listeners, that are all focused on this
[00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:04.220]   topic.
[00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:07.060]   Before we get to those questions, though, I want to mention one of the sponsors that makes
[00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:09.300]   this show possible.
[00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:14.060]   Talk about our friends at Rhone, R-H-O-N-E.
[00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:20.100]   Men's clothes were due for a radical reinvention and Rhone stepped up to the challenge.
[00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:24.780]   Rhone's commuter collection is the most comfortable, breathable, and flexible set of products known
[00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:26.160]   to man.
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:28.100]   And here is why.
[00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:32.460]   It has a variety of different pieces from the world's most comfortable pants to quarter
[00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:35.360]   zips, dress shirts, and polos.
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:36.360]   Very comfortable.
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:41.560]   I love the commuter collection because the material is very comfortable.
[00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:42.900]   They have a name for it.
[00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:45.060]   It's four-way stretch fabric.
[00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:46.060]   It's very lightweight.
[00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:48.020]   It's very breathable.
[00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:49.020]   You're somewhere that's hot.
[00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:50.420]   You know, you worry about sweating.
[00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:53.020]   This is going to be very breathable and light.
[00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:59.720]   It works just as well giving a talk in a boardroom as it does playing 18 holes of golf.
[00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:02.060]   It has wrinkle release technology, which I love.
[00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:03.920]   You travel with this stuff.
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:08.960]   You put it on, the wrinkles fall out as you wear it, so you can travel with it without
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:10.640]   having to worry about wrinkles.
[00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:13.040]   Even has Goldfusion anti-odor technology.
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:16.240]   Look, if you're a guy, like I need good clothes.
[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:17.240]   I don't want to overheat.
[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:18.240]   I don't want to worry about wrinkles.
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:23.920]   I just want to have stuff I can put on that's going to perform, check out the Rhone commuter
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:25.920]   collection.
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:29.100]   This commuter collection can get you through any workday and straight into whatever comes
[00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:30.100]   next.
[00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:38.880]   So go to rhone.com/cal and use the promo code CAL to save 20% off your entire order.
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:40.440]   That's 20% off your entire order.
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:50.180]   When you head to rhone.com/cal and use the code CAL, it's time to find your corner office
[00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:51.180]   comfort.
[00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:56.520]   I also want to talk about our friends at Mint Mobile.
[00:22:56.520 --> 00:23:01.340]   On average, it takes about 30 days for a person to break their new year's resolution.
[00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:07.460]   So if saving money was on your 2024 list, your odds aren't looking that great.
[00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:11.800]   Luckily, I have a 100% guaranteed way to save you money this year.
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:14.500]   Just switch to Mint Mobile.
[00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:19.060]   Right now, Mint Mobile has wireless plans starting at $15 a month.
[00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:24.540]   That's unlimited talk, text and data for $15 a month.
[00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:27.940]   All these plans come with this unlimited talk and text plus high-speed data delivered on
[00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:32.000]   the nation's largest 5G networks.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.340]   They give you these good rates because they don't have the overhead.
[00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:36.540]   You purchase right online.
[00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:41.300]   They can send you the SIM card or even simpler, an eSIM card, depending on your phone.
[00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:47.140]   No expensive storefronts, no super expensive Super Bowl ad campaigns.
[00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:50.660]   So they're able to pass these savings on to you.
[00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:55.860]   We're actually just about to use them, Jesse, because my oldest is old enough now to spend
[00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:59.220]   time at home alone.
[00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:05.140]   And so we want to have a dumb phone dedicated just for, this is here so you can call us
[00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:08.260]   if there's an emergency when we leave you at home.
[00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:11.320]   And my wife the other day was like, "Well, how do we get a phone that, you know, we just
[00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:12.320]   need to do calls.
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:13.700]   He can just call us on it.
[00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:15.260]   We don't need the internet or whatever."
[00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:16.780]   I was like, "Oh, I know how to do that, Mint Mobile."
[00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:18.820]   It'd be 15 bucks a month.
[00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:19.820]   Get a SIM card.
[00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:25.540]   I already have, I'm grabbing it here for people who are watching.
[00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:26.540]   Bought this off Amazon.
[00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:30.100]   It's like 50 bucks.
[00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:32.220]   The nerdiest phone I could find.
[00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:35.660]   So you know, my son won't be impressed that he has access to this in the brief times when
[00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:36.660]   he's home alone.
[00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:39.860]   Throw in a Mint Mobile SIM card, boom, emergency phone.
[00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:41.940]   So quite useful.
[00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:45.100]   To get your new wireless plan for just 15 bucks a month and get the plan shipped to
[00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:48.540]   your door for free, go to mintmobile.com/deep.
[00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:50.660]   That's mintmobile.com/deep.
[00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:55.140]   Cut your wireless bill to 15 bucks a month at mintmobile.com/deep.
[00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:58.020]   Additional taxes, fees, and restrictions apply.
[00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:00.100]   See Mint Mobile for more detail.
[00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:03.180]   All right, Jesse, let's do some questions.
[00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:05.960]   Who do we got first?
[00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:06.960]   - First question's from Henry.
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:10.740]   "What do you think of Neil Postman's 'Amusing Ourselves to Death?'
[00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:14.700]   I feel like that book fits well as a root for your digital minimalist philosophy.
[00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:20.380]   Do you think that the medium of screens fundamentally opposes the deep life?"
[00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:24.420]   - That's a good book, "Amusing Ourselves to Death" by Neil Postman.
[00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:28.940]   The late Neil Postman is often cited by people who do techno-criticism.
[00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:34.340]   So Henry, I'm going to point you towards a recent article I wrote for The New Yorker.
[00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:36.860]   This would have come out in December.
[00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:44.420]   I don't remember the exact title of the article, but I can tell you it is about Neil Postman,
[00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:51.060]   not "Amusing Ourselves to Death," but instead his subsequent book, "Technopoly."
[00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:56.220]   So I argue in this article that "Technopoly" is probably the best full summary of Neil
[00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:59.820]   Postman's philosophy regarding technology.
[00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:06.540]   And in that article, I get into the impact of Postman's "Technopoly" theory on my own
[00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:10.300]   thinking about technology and techno-criticism, and it did have a big impact.
[00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:14.240]   So you're correct to note that Postman is related to my work.
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:17.860]   I draw probably more heavily from "Technopoly" than "Amusing Ourselves to Death."
[00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:22.940]   So check out that New Yorker piece to get a better sense of that.
[00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:25.480]   I like "Amusing Ourselves to Death."
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:29.500]   It definitely is a standalone book worth reading.
[00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:34.060]   What people often get wrong about it is they think it's just a book about TV being bad.
[00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:37.660]   And yes, that's the main theme.
[00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:41.320]   It was written in the 1980s, the "Amusing Ourselves to Death."
[00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:45.820]   It's talking about doing so with TV and the way that TV has evolved.
[00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:50.600]   But there is a deeper techno-critical argument that's proven very influential in that book.
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:57.260]   What Postman argues is technologies in general, and media technologies more specifically,
[00:26:57.260 --> 00:27:00.140]   can affect the way cultures actually think.
[00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:03.220]   TV was just the latest example of this.
[00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:08.860]   So he talks in the book famously about how during the time of Abraham Lincoln, the media
[00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:11.660]   culture was built on newspapers.
[00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:16.500]   And newspapers would have really long articles in them, right?
[00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:20.220]   You have thousands of words, articles, and speech transcriptions.
[00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:23.940]   The America at that time was actually highly literate.
[00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:25.540]   You didn't have a lot of other diversions.
[00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:30.940]   So you're plenty happy to spend lots of time reading all these details in the newspaper.
[00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:33.220]   He called it a lexicographic media culture.
[00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:38.740]   He said in a lexicographic media culture, we were very comfortable with consuming information
[00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:42.340]   in sort of long, discursive discussions.
[00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:46.860]   This is why, for example, when Abraham Lincoln was debating Stephen Douglas in the famed
[00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:51.660]   Lincoln-Douglas debates, these were huge spectacles that have huge crowds.
[00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:54.580]   They would each talk for three hours at a time.
[00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:58.580]   Lincoln would talk for three hours, and then they would all get lunch or dinner.
[00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:02.020]   And then Stephen Douglas would talk for another three hours, and then Lincoln would have a
[00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:04.220]   one-hour rebuttal.
[00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:09.860]   And Postman said, "We were completely comfortable with that in the mid-19th century, because
[00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:12.380]   this was the media culture was one of long discursion."
[00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:16.860]   And so he argues in the culture of the '80s, which was based on soundbite television, the
[00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:20.020]   way that we process information and think about things is much different.
[00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:22.900]   The media affects how we think.
[00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:29.020]   The bigger example, I mean, he goes into how Gutenberg and the printing press, that gave
[00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:37.480]   us a way of thinking and introduced a way of thinking that was more precise and structured.
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:40.340]   And he said that the printing press changed the way we thought in such a way that the
[00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:43.580]   Enlightenment and the scientific revolution became possible.
[00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:47.900]   And until the printing press, the media changed and changed the way our minds worked, we weren't
[00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:52.220]   actually capable of having the scientific revolution.
[00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:53.980]   This came before it.
[00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:54.980]   Books changed how we thought.
[00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:58.060]   How we changed how we thought, we could do things like invent science.
[00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:02.300]   Newspapers changed how we thought, so we were comfortable with very long discursive discussions
[00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:03.300]   and so on.
[00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:08.100]   So, of course, the interesting question is, how did social media and phones change the
[00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:09.100]   way we thought?
[00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:11.340]   How does it change the way we engage with the world?
[00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:16.700]   That's a question a lot of people post-Postman have been tackling more recently, and it's
[00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:18.680]   a smart one to think about.
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:26.700]   If the media itself, the form of the media changes how we just cogitate, what does that
[00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:29.900]   mean about how our brains operate in a world of social media?
[00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:33.940]   That is something worth thinking about because I think those impacts have been profound.
[00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:34.940]   So check out that book.
[00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:35.940]   It's a cool one.
[00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:41.500]   Check out my New Yorker piece about Technopoly as well, because that's also a very deep book.
[00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:44.700]   All right, who do we got next?
[00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:46.540]   Next question is from Roshan.
[00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:50.760]   I was wondering if you could square the theoretical four-hour daily limit on deep work mentioned
[00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:55.800]   in Deep Work and the pursuit of high-quality leisure mentioned in Digital Minimalism.
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:30:01.000]   Is it possible to pursue a high-quality leisure activity on a day you completed deep work
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   professionally?
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   For the most part, it's not a problem.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.280]   That four-hour daily limit, what that comes out of actually is people who are in states
[00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:13.320]   of more intense deliberate practice.
[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:18.560]   That number was first identified in a study of professional violin players.
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:23.520]   Four hours broken into two two-hour chunks was about on average the maximum a professional
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:31.000]   player could practice because when professional players practice, it's incredibly intense.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.040]   They don't just play stuff they know how to play.
[00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:39.120]   They're instead systematically and deliberately trying to push their skills to the next level.
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:43.480]   Professionals can do that for four hours but not much longer.
[00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:45.400]   We see that in other places as well.
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:51.680]   There's a type of software development called extreme programming in which you sit two people
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:54.020]   at the same monitor.
[00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:58.360]   It is very intense programming where the one person's looking over your shoulder and you're
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:01.980]   trying to build the best code with someone watching you do it.
[00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:06.520]   This is very intense because you have to have like a violin player practicing complete unbroken
[00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:07.520]   concentration.
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:11.880]   I write about this a little bit in my book, "A World Without Email."
[00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:15.700]   What they found with extreme programming is that it's super productive.
[00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:17.400]   You would think, "Hey, we're doing two people per screen.
[00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:21.200]   We're going to get half as much done," but the code is so good.
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:22.800]   You get quality code so fast.
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:24.120]   It's incredibly productive.
[00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:28.280]   But they also learned you can only do it for a certain number of hours a day.
[00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:30.440]   People completely burn out.
[00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:32.960]   You get like four o'clock in the afternoon.
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:34.880]   It's like everyone has to go home and take a nap.
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:40.920]   There is no notion of working late in an extreme programming environment because it's too exhausting.
[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:44.880]   High quality leisure typically doesn't trigger this unless your high quality leisure is intensely
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:46.760]   practicing your instrument.
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:51.120]   High quality leisure is not going to exhaust you in the same way as fully focused deep
[00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:54.420]   work, so you should be okay.
[00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:58.080]   If you feel like what you're doing is pretty exhausting, like maybe you're working on a
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:05.800]   novel on the side as a leisure project, and that really can, like extreme programming,
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:10.040]   like practicing an instrument, that really can actually make a lot of demands.
[00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:14.080]   Do less of it and balance it out with other leisure activities that pull from different
[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:15.720]   parts of your brain are less exhausting.
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:20.920]   There's a cool book on this from the early 20th century, Arnold Bennett's "How to Live
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:23.280]   on 24 Hours a Day."
[00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:30.000]   One of his arguments is even if you're exhausted from your work, if you switch over to unrelated
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:35.720]   high quality leisure, your energy raise is not false.
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:41.340]   So he's arguing our brain, yes, our brain needs rest, but it gets that rest and sleep.
[00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:46.420]   So yes, we do have to sleep every day, but when our brain is active, like we are awake,
[00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:51.400]   it does not actually demand in the way that we imagine complete downtime, where it just
[00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:57.920]   needs to sit there and do nothing or consume very low quality media.
[00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:04.840]   In the world of Arnold Bennett, sort of snobby, striving middle-class that's middle-class
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:10.920]   England in the early 20th century, he described as sort of low quality media that you're drinking
[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:14.320]   and like playing cards and sort of just sitting around and listening to popular music.
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:16.400]   And he says, you don't need that.
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:19.240]   This idea that you need that's not true.
[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:23.560]   Under poetry or whatever his definition of high quality leisure is, he says it'll re-energize
[00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:24.560]   you.
[00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:26.280]   The brain wants to do interesting stuff.
[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:31.200]   So yeah, you might have to adjust a little bit, but you should be able to find on almost
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:36.020]   any day, unless you're actually sick, a groove of high quality leisure that is going to feel
[00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:41.200]   better and be more energizing than just falling back to let me do nothing hard at all.
[00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:47.280]   I actually have a listener sent me a first edition of "How to Live on 24 Hours a Day."
[00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:48.280]   I have it displayed in my library.
[00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:49.800]   Yeah, I think you've mentioned that before.
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:50.800]   Yeah.
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:51.800]   It's really cool.
[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:52.800]   I'm really happy to have that.
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:53.800]   All right.
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:54.800]   Who do we got next?
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:55.800]   Next question is from Sam.
[00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:56.800]   Hi, Cal.
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:00.560]   I'm working on digital minimalism and one of the high value activities I want to include
[00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:03.600]   in my life is watching sports on TV.
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:06.640]   But there are so many commercials throughout sports that I feel like I could use the commercial
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:07.640]   time better.
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:11.640]   Do you have any ideas on how to deal with activities that have inherent frequent breaks
[00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:13.960]   such as sports?
[00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:22.640]   What do you do, Jesse, when you're watching TV sports?
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:23.640]   That's a good question.
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:24.640]   Yeah, I just...
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:28.680]   Like, for instance, during the Super Bowl, I had it on, and I was just...
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:29.680]   It's just on.
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:34.840]   But a lot of times during NFL games, like on Sundays, I'll be at work, so the sun's
[00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:35.840]   on anyway.
[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:36.840]   Yeah.
[00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:38.060]   So you're kind of just checking in.
[00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:43.920]   But then on like a Saturday, or sorry, like a Monday night game, I will, yeah, just have
[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:44.920]   it on.
[00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:49.520]   One of the things I used to like, well, I still do, I wrote about this in my newsletter,
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:53.120]   is reading a book while listening to baseball on the radio.
[00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:56.200]   That's a favorite of mine, maybe even outside on a summer day.
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:59.800]   You read a book and then you sort of put the game on when it comes back.
[00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:02.600]   And with baseball, you can kind of tune in and out a little bit, right?
[00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:06.040]   So you're like, okay, if something interesting is happening, I'll really listen.
[00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:08.260]   But now it's going to commercial break, I'll go back to my book.
[00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:14.880]   During a pennant race, I could get more reading done, because as we got towards later innings,
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:19.600]   I would turn the radio down when we were pitching, because it was too much stress.
[00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:23.480]   So then you could get a whole half inning of reading, because when it's your team up
[00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:24.880]   the bat, it's all possibility.
[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:28.840]   You're like, hey, anything good could happen here, nothing that terrible could happen other
[00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:31.400]   than we just get outs.
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:35.640]   So I don't know, if you're watching sports on TV, I would say it's fine to have some
[00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:39.600]   sort of leisure activity that you're going back and forth through.
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:44.880]   I would not make it work-related, because if you context ship like into your email and
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:50.160]   then back to the football game, your mind is now stuck between these two worlds, and
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:54.640]   you're not going to get the sense of relief of doing something unwork-related.
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:55.640]   Don't make it work-related.
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:58.500]   Also, don't make it engineered to be addictive.
[00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:03.480]   So you mentioned in the longer version of your question that you're watching YouTube
[00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:04.480]   videos.
[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:10.320]   I don't like necessarily that tension between, hey, look at me, look at me, like addictive
[00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:13.640]   if the content has these recommendations that are grabbing your attention.
[00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:16.960]   And now you're competing that against the high-quality activity.
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:23.480]   I would rather your secondary leisure activity be a little more boring, be on that same level
[00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:26.500]   of slowness as the game on TV itself.
[00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:28.720]   So I think a book is a good example.
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:32.120]   Some other sort of analog thing that you're working on, something that you're trying to
[00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:37.360]   fix, you're cleaning something while the game is on, and you kind of clean during the commercials.
[00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:42.300]   Maybe have a secondary activity that is on an equal level of slowness.
[00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:46.520]   It's not competing for your attention, because then you really get the experience then of
[00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:53.740]   your brain downshifting to this medium, which itself I think is just clearing and useful.
[00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:56.960]   So I think it's okay to have something to do during the commercials.
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:58.840]   Just don't make it work-related.
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:00.120]   Don't make it too addictive.
[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:04.240]   All right, what do we got next?
[00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:06.160]   Next question's from Chris.
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:10.580]   How do you envision digital minimalists interacting with augmented reality once the technology
[00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:15.760]   has advanced sufficiently to replace all the screens in our lives as you have predicted?
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:23.360]   Well, first of all, I still think my prediction is not being discovered enough.
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:28.000]   Not necessarily from me, but I don't see enough other people talking about that prediction,
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.240]   in particular in their coverage of the new Apple Vision Pro.
[00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:36.240]   I don't know that everyone yet is still on the same page that I'm on, which says the
[00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:41.540]   whole reason why Apple is investing in the Apple Vision Pro, the whole reason why they're
[00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:46.120]   doing this is because you don't need to, once this technology is sufficiently advanced,
[00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:48.840]   you don't need to own separate screens.
[00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:54.200]   Once you can fit an Apple Vision Pro into a pair of Ray-Ban glasses, I don't need a
[00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:58.640]   phone and an iPad and a laptop and a TV and an office computer.
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:05.160]   I just need these glasses, which can put similar-sized screens wherever I happen to be, so why buy
[00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:06.160]   all those things?
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:07.520]   That's a huge industry.
[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:10.880]   The consumer electronics industry is huge.
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:17.960]   Apple's profit comes almost entirely from building physical screens in nice brushed
[00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:19.120]   metal boxes.
[00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:22.720]   If those all go away, Apple's in trouble, so they want to own the virtual screen future,
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:25.520]   and I'm still convinced that's where we're going to end up.
[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:30.080]   If I want to make a phone call, I put a screen in front of me projected by my glasses.
[00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:35.600]   If I want to watch TV, there's a screen put on the wall projected by my glasses.
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:41.560]   If I want to write, a screen comes in front of me at the coffee shop projected by my glasses.
[00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:43.400]   I don't need to own other bits of electronic.
[00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:47.560]   I just need whatever drives those glasses.
[00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:51.360]   So when people do hear about this future, their concern is, like Chris's concern is
[00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:55.200]   here in this question, are we going to be super distracted in a way that we don't even
[00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:57.140]   know now?
[00:38:57.140 --> 00:39:00.680]   Because there is no hard line between reality and the digital.
[00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:03.520]   Could our whole world be full of these distractions?
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:06.800]   Here's my current guess, no.
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:14.840]   I think even in a world of virtual engagement, so augmented reality engagement, we are still
[00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:22.520]   going to prefer the screen metaphor as the mediation with the digital.
[00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:27.320]   So even when these screens are not physical, they're being projected in the space by a
[00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:32.520]   pair of Apple glasses, we still are going to want our digital to be within some sort
[00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:37.480]   of screen, a clear demarcation between the digital and the real.
[00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:43.200]   It would be possible, of course, for the digital world to be fully integrated in a more obfuscated
[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:44.640]   way with what's going on around us.
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:46.360]   I don't think we're going to want that.
[00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:48.080]   I don't think that's what the market's going to demand.
[00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:52.240]   I think the market is going to be very happy with, I don't have to buy screens anymore.
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:57.360]   My TV is awesome because I can just make a giant screen without having to buy one.
[00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:01.300]   I don't need a separate laptop and iPad or what have you, because I can just have four
[00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:03.580]   monitors whenever I need it.
[00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:04.580]   This is great.
[00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:07.720]   I don't need keyboards and mice, it's just going to look at my hands.
[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:11.520]   I think that is going to be a compelling pitch to the market, but the screen metaphor will
[00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:12.520]   persist.
[00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:14.480]   I mean, think about this.
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:20.800]   This has been the dominant metaphor of media consumption for over 500 years.
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:25.060]   Basically when we switched from the scroll to the codex, the bound codex, as our way
[00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:33.680]   of conveying written technology, the idea of a constrained rectangle containing information
[00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:36.440]   has been what we've done.
[00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:40.280]   Movie screens, constrained rectangles, televisions, constrained rectangles, computer screens,
[00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:45.680]   constrained rectangles, phones, iPads, video games, constrained rectangles, which information
[00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:46.680]   is found.
[00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:50.440]   So I think that that metaphor is going to continue, not because it's necessarily the
[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:51.440]   best way.
[00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:58.240]   I mean, maybe it is better to have the things we're interacting with just sort of be in
[00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:01.440]   the world and we can't tell the difference between them and other things.
[00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:06.440]   Maybe it is better, but psychologically and philosophically, I think we prefer to have
[00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:09.120]   a clear demarcation between real and fake.
[00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:14.800]   So yes, I think AR is going to completely up in the consumer electronics industry.
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:21.080]   Most of us will be engaging with a world augmented with digital elements just all day long, but
[00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:26.440]   it might not look as paradoxical as this might seem that different than our current world
[00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:27.440]   today.
[00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:30.440]   We might not be able to reach out and grab the screen we're looking at, but I think it's
[00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:31.960]   still going to be a screen.
[00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:39.240]   There might be some exceptions, some games, et cetera, but some pop out stuff, but I don't
[00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:40.240]   even think so.
[00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:46.240]   Like, so Jesse, I see a lot of these demos of checking email and AR.
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:53.080]   The demo videos, they like to have it sort of your messages fly out or like they're kind
[00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:57.960]   of in space and you're scrolling in space and then over here you're writing.
[00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:01.400]   And you know, maybe, but I also think people will be happy with, no, I could just have
[00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:06.680]   a giant screen in front of me so it's, you know, I can see my, I have two messages side
[00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:07.680]   by side.
[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:11.080]   I don't need the messages to float in like little envelopes.
[00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:13.040]   I'm fine with what Gmail looks like.
[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:16.640]   I just want to be able to access Gmail wherever I am and have like a really big screen where
[00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:19.880]   I can look at two messages side by side and drag things back and forth.
[00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:24.040]   So I think something like the screen metaphor, that's my new prediction, um, is going to
[00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:25.040]   dominate.
[00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:27.040]   Also, it's just technically easier.
[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:32.640]   It's going to be the, that's going to be easier than trying to more complexly integrate digital
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:33.640]   elements of the real world.
[00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:38.800]   The easiest thing to do with AR is just try to anchor a screen in space as you move around.
[00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:43.600]   So we'll see, but that's my current, that's my current guess.
[00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:46.080]   I still haven't found an excuse to get an Apple vision pro.
[00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:50.540]   I'm trying to find like an article idea that's going to, that would require me to get one
[00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:51.800]   of those to mess around with.
[00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:52.800]   How much are they?
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:53.800]   3000 bells.
[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:54.800]   Oh really?
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:55.800]   Yeah.
[00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:56.800]   I think they're expensive.
[00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:57.800]   I don't know.
[00:42:57.800 --> 00:42:58.800]   I don't know.
[00:42:58.800 --> 00:42:59.800]   I don't know.
[00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:00.800]   I just, I was on there.
[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:01.800]   I just wrote a good New Yorker piece on, on this.
[00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:02.800]   So I'll have to check it out.
[00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:03.800]   That might've burned the, my opportunity to convince the New Yorker that I really need
[00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:06.800]   an Apple vision pro or you just bar his.
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:07.800]   Yeah.
[00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:09.800]   Uh, well, yeah, maybe I can.
[00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:10.800]   Jared, come on.
[00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:13.000]   No, he helped invent virtual reality.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.640]   So I think he was well suited to write about this.
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:19.680]   He probably has to, I, yeah, I should, he probably does.
[00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:20.680]   He probably does.
[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:21.680]   All right.
[00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:22.680]   What do we got next?
[00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:23.680]   All right.
[00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:24.680]   Laura.
[00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:25.680]   Next question.
[00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:27.520]   How do I have a digital minimalist life?
[00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:32.200]   When I have a online business based on social media, I'm a full-time YouTuber who struggles
[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:35.520]   with keeping up with my subscribers in their actions.
[00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:39.480]   I have a channel with 30,000 subscribers that keeps growing at a very good pace.
[00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:42.920]   I've been trying to reply to all the comments on my channel, but lately it's been getting
[00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:43.920]   harder.
[00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:49.320]   Well, Laura, I think that's a good question because it emphasizes a common confusion about
[00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:51.640]   digital minimalism.
[00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:54.400]   You don't have a digital minimalism problem.
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:59.080]   You have an entrepreneur workflow problem, and I want to distinguish between these two
[00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:01.520]   because I think it's important.
[00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:07.440]   When people hear digital minimalism and they know that it has to do with having a more
[00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:12.520]   healthy relationship with your tools, they often change the second word in their head.
[00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:18.680]   And so, yes, what we're talking about here is digital minimization.
[00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:24.960]   The goal of this philosophy is to use as little technology as possible, to remove technology
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:26.400]   from your life.
[00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:28.520]   More removal is better than less.
[00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:33.080]   And from the perspective of digital minimization, you say, "I'm spending all this time on YouTube.
[00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:37.360]   That goes against minimization because I'm spending time on YouTube, and so maybe this
[00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:39.480]   philosophy doesn't hold."
[00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:42.520]   Minimalism though is different.
[00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:45.600]   Minimalism says you figure out what's important to you in your life.
[00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:49.680]   You figure out what tools, if anything, support these things that are important.
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:53.440]   Because you know why you're using the tools, you can put rules around their use that dictates
[00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:56.080]   how and when you use them.
[00:44:56.080 --> 00:44:59.120]   So in this case, you're a YouTuber.
[00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:00.840]   Your business is based on YouTube.
[00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:07.320]   Clearly, when you go through this exercise, you would say, "Yes, engaging with YouTube
[00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:10.800]   does support things I value, such as making money and keeping my job.
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:12.080]   My job requires me to use YouTube."
[00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:13.080]   There's no problem there.
[00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:17.120]   There's no minimalism to say there's a reason why you're using YouTube.
[00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:20.080]   It would also say, of course, have rules about how and when you use it to make sure that
[00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:24.120]   you do the stuff that's important, but not paying unnecessary side effects.
[00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:27.500]   And this is where I think this becomes a business workflow problem.
[00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:32.840]   Your issue is your channel has grown, and it takes a lot of time to interact with subscribers.
[00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:33.840]   Like that's your problem.
[00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:36.720]   That's a business problem.
[00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:40.800]   Your rules for engaging with YouTube as your channel grew was, "I'm going to try to answer
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:46.040]   user comments because that leads to more engagement and will help the rate at which my channel
[00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:47.040]   grows."
[00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:49.960]   I guess this is like a common YouTube strategy idea.
[00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:53.400]   Now your channel is up to a given size that these interactions become more difficult because
[00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:55.760]   of scale.
[00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:56.760]   So what do you have to do?
[00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:58.240]   It's a business workflow problem.
[00:45:58.240 --> 00:45:59.240]   All right.
[00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:03.600]   Either I have to put aside more time for doing this or move on to the next stage of my channel
[00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:06.680]   growth where I no longer try to interact directly with subscribers.
[00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:10.680]   I mean, all YouTube channels will eventually go through that stage.
[00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:13.280]   Once you get to a certain size, you're not interacting with your commenters.
[00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:16.200]   I mean, we just had Ali Abdaal on the show.
[00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:17.200]   He's not sitting there.
[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:18.400]   He has 5 million subscribers.
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:20.800]   He's not sitting there trying to answer every comment.
[00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:23.680]   So there's some point where that no longer makes sense.
[00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:26.840]   And maybe you're at that point, which would mean you stop doing that.
[00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:33.120]   And if you're not at that point, my suggestion would be to lean into the how and when attributes
[00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:36.680]   that digital minimalism says you should place around any technology in your life and be
[00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:38.280]   much more structured about it.
[00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:42.840]   I have one hour here and a half hour here every other day where I go through and reply
[00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:43.840]   very quickly to comments.
[00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:45.480]   I don't look at them otherwise.
[00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:47.800]   So I've put fences around it.
[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:49.040]   That's where you are.
[00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:54.280]   You either need better fences, wider pastures fenced in for this behavior, or you need to
[00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:55.340]   move on from this behavior.
[00:46:55.340 --> 00:47:00.480]   But this is a business workflow problem more than it is a minimalism problem.
[00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:02.640]   Minimalism is not about stop using technology.
[00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:04.640]   If you have to use technology, give up on it.
[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:06.620]   It's about being intentional.
[00:47:06.620 --> 00:47:11.760]   So just be very careful about your intentionality here with YouTubers and comments and say,
[00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:12.760]   is this necessary?
[00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:14.800]   Is there another way I could do this?
[00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:17.080]   Let's rethink how I want to engage with these tools.
[00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:19.080]   But that's a business workflow issue.
[00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:23.520]   I mean, I remember going through this with my newsletter and blog.
[00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:26.440]   Very similar, Laura, to what you're talking about here.
[00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:31.520]   Early on, we're talking 2007, 2008, when I started this, I answered every email that
[00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:32.520]   people sent me.
[00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:34.580]   And I was talking mainly to students back then.
[00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:38.800]   And so I would get these emails from students with specific problems that I really liked
[00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:40.240]   trying to give them advice.
[00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:42.160]   A, it felt useful.
[00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:46.560]   And B, it helped me better keep up with what are the specific issues that students right
[00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:47.560]   now are facing.
[00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:51.800]   As I talk about often on the show, however, there was this point where I had to stop doing
[00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:53.320]   that.
[00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:56.880]   There was just too many readers, therefore too many emails.
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:58.200]   It was taking up too much of my life.
[00:47:58.200 --> 00:47:59.400]   It was stressful.
[00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:00.440]   I couldn't keep up.
[00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:05.960]   I was spending hours working on it, and eventually I had to evolve to the next stage of my media
[00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:10.720]   career and say, "Okay, I no longer have a sort of open email address where I just answer
[00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:11.720]   questions.
[00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:13.800]   It's just not sustainable."
[00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:16.160]   And it was weird, and then I got over it.
[00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:17.520]   So maybe you're there.
[00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:23.120]   But I like this question because if you use your businesses based on social media, you
[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:24.680]   could still be a digital minimalist.
[00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:27.320]   You just have to be intentional.
[00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:30.800]   If you're having trouble with your work, it might not be a technology problem, but just
[00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:33.600]   a workflow problem.
[00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:35.360]   We don't talk to our subscribers on YouTube.
[00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:37.120]   Is that something people do, Jesse?
[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:40.760]   Does that help your channel grow or something?
[00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:43.880]   I think it might, but it seemed like it would be pretty...
[00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:47.320]   I don't think I would know how to do that.
[00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:49.320]   I don't know how comments work on YouTube.
[00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:51.760]   You just go to the YouTube studio and then...
[00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:56.880]   You do it in the back end, and then it would show up as coming from the channel itself.
[00:48:56.880 --> 00:48:59.040]   Audience, I'm unlikely to do that.
[00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:04.520]   So if you're watching this on YouTube, I am unlikely to go in and start responding to
[00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:05.520]   the comments.
[00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:06.520]   But there you go.
[00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:07.520]   YouTube is a weird beast.
[00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:08.520]   All right.
[00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:09.520]   Do we have a call this week?
[00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:10.520]   Yes, we do.
[00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:11.520]   All right.
[00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:12.520]   Let's do that.
[00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:13.520]   All right.
[00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:14.520]   Here we go.
[00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:15.520]   G'day.
[00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:16.520]   It's Logan here.
[00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:20.400]   I'm a Kiwi currently living in the US working as a financial consultant.
[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:23.960]   I have a question around decentralized social media.
[00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:27.920]   I've spent the last five years developing my artistic drawing skills to a proficient
[00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:31.080]   level and feel that I could now generate some real revenue.
[00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:32.920]   I'm not about to quit my day job.
[00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:36.760]   My question is more about how do I share my content with an audience?
[00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:38.280]   How do I monetize it?
[00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:42.560]   How do I do this and still maintain control over what I create while not handing over
[00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:48.360]   the reins of these things and my audience to a large social media company?
[00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:52.560]   Ideally I would only use social media as a tool to funnel viewership into some other
[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:53.560]   thing.
[00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:54.920]   Well, I'd love to hear your thoughts.
[00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:59.160]   I've heard you talk theoretically about this idea, but don't really know how you imagine
[00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:00.160]   it to work in practice.
[00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:01.920]   Cheers for all the hard work.
[00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:02.920]   Owl.
[00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:05.520]   Well, I got two ideas here.
[00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:09.280]   One, let's just talk fundamentals.
[00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:11.960]   You want to sell something online.
[00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:16.280]   You're monetizing a rare and valuable skill you have online.
[00:50:16.280 --> 00:50:22.560]   There's a fundamental principle here which says you need a home where, like a home base
[00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:28.600]   for this material, this content, the drawings, music, artwork, whatever it is, you need a
[00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:34.600]   home base that you can control or allows you to control what you're selling.
[00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:39.000]   You also want to have control over how it's sold.
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:44.960]   So never let your home base for what you're trying to monetize online be something owned
[00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:47.040]   by someone else, right?
[00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:53.280]   So this is what would happen, for example, if your main place where you hold your contents
[00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:55.560]   on a social media platform, that's their content.
[00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:59.160]   You're working for that platform to help them harness eyeballs.
[00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:01.000]   They decide how they show it to people.
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:03.120]   They decide how the selling works.
[00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:05.460]   They can do what they want with that material.
[00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:09.040]   This is very different than having your own website, for example.
[00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:12.640]   It's very different than selling things using the Shopify store.
[00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:13.640]   It's your stuff.
[00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:15.480]   Shopify is just helping you sell it.
[00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:17.960]   It's very different, let's say, you know, a podcast.
[00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:21.720]   Yeah, you'll have a hosting service somewhere, but this is just a server that hosts your
[00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:24.280]   MP3 files, which are your MP3 files.
[00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:29.040]   And all these other players like Spotify or Apple iTunes players are just getting copies
[00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:30.040]   from the server.
[00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:31.040]   You own it.
[00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:32.080]   It's yours.
[00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:37.400]   So you want to own, have a home base for whatever you're trying to monetize online.
[00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:42.980]   The more you can have your own home base that you can control and that you own, the better.
[00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:49.160]   You can then use, as you mentioned, various platforms to try to draw attention to this
[00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:50.680]   home base.
[00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:55.200]   So for writers, for example, their home base might be an email subscription newsletter
[00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:58.640]   and they use other social media tools to try to pull people towards it.
[00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:00.720]   But what matters is their list.
[00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:04.760]   Artists might show some of their artwork on Instagram, but they have a website where their
[00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:08.400]   art lives and where you can actually order limited edition prints to their own Shopify
[00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:09.400]   store.
[00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:11.160]   They can control it.
[00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:15.940]   Creators like me, we put video versions of these podcasts on YouTube.
[00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:20.140]   There's a whole new audience there, a younger audience that can learn and find these on
[00:52:20.140 --> 00:52:23.060]   YouTube and some people just like to watch it.
[00:52:23.060 --> 00:52:24.820]   But the show itself lives, we own it.
[00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:29.780]   It lives on our own third-party podcast server.
[00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:33.020]   That's what matters to us is the show itself is something we own.
[00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:37.260]   You can shut down YouTube tomorrow and it doesn't matter because we have this show with
[00:52:37.260 --> 00:52:39.940]   an audience we've built and we owned and so on.
[00:52:39.940 --> 00:52:46.820]   So I think that's a good principle to go into this idea of using existing algorithmically
[00:52:46.820 --> 00:52:50.440]   recommendation driven platforms like social media to promote your work.
[00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:52.920]   Go into that with your eyes open and care.
[00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:57.260]   What I often tell people who are wondering, okay, I have this old fashioned skill.
[00:52:57.260 --> 00:52:59.080]   How do I promote it in the new media world?
[00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:04.640]   I say, start by seeing what you would have done 12 years ago, 2012.
[00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:09.420]   We think of that roughly speaking as the point where social media tipped into becoming something
[00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:12.040]   that was generally assumed to be used.
[00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:13.920]   That's when it really grew to cultural ubiquity.
[00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:14.920]   All right.
[00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:17.720]   So what would you have done in 2011?
[00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:22.740]   How did people who drew get attention to their work and sell their work?
[00:53:22.740 --> 00:53:27.200]   How did people who wrote books used to get attention to their work?
[00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:28.840]   How did artists get attention for their work?
[00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:34.160]   How did musicians find and grow in audiences in 2011?
[00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:39.340]   Ask yourself that question and start there because what often turns out is those are
[00:53:39.340 --> 00:53:42.540]   still the main ways you should do it.
[00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:45.180]   That social media, sure, you can go on there.
[00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:51.480]   Maybe there'll be some break, but more likely it'll just be you are dedicating your time
[00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:56.500]   to help generate attention for these companies so they can monetize it more.
[00:53:56.500 --> 00:54:02.140]   I think the reason why we get so, it's so appealing to think, I want to promote this
[00:54:02.140 --> 00:54:08.060]   work on social media is because there's this lottery ticket feel to it.
[00:54:08.060 --> 00:54:10.080]   Hey, you never know.
[00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:13.980]   These TikToks might go viral and I'll be the next Justin Bieber.
[00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:17.180]   That could happen, but it probably won't.
[00:54:17.180 --> 00:54:21.300]   The platform will string you along, give you a little burst of views every once in a while
[00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:23.380]   so you think that you're just around the corner.
[00:54:23.380 --> 00:54:25.820]   But for 99.9% of the people, that's not how it worked.
[00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:28.020]   The old fashioned way is what really matters.
[00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:29.020]   I'm a musician.
[00:54:29.020 --> 00:54:30.020]   I get better at playing.
[00:54:30.020 --> 00:54:31.020]   I start performing.
[00:54:31.020 --> 00:54:33.580]   I build up my own audience and mailing list.
[00:54:33.580 --> 00:54:37.580]   My skills get to a place where this begins to attract the attention of A&R executives
[00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:40.660]   who are desperate to find actually really good musicians.
[00:54:40.660 --> 00:54:44.620]   Now that I'm connected with A&R representatives, I go on tour, I'm opening for bigger bands.
[00:54:44.620 --> 00:54:45.960]   They've set me up to do.
[00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:47.720]   That puts me in front of a bigger audience.
[00:54:47.720 --> 00:54:48.720]   This gets me ready.
[00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:52.180]   It probably takes about 10 years, but now we're ready to actually have an awesome album.
[00:54:52.180 --> 00:54:55.220]   We have the whole mechanisms of this record label behind the album.
[00:54:55.220 --> 00:54:56.780]   That's complicated and boring.
[00:54:56.780 --> 00:55:03.900]   What's better is I'm on YouTube and next week, Kim Kardashian or Mr. Beast is going to mention
[00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:04.900]   one of my songs.
[00:55:04.900 --> 00:55:07.820]   The 10 million people are going to view it and then I'm just going to have a lot of money.
[00:55:07.820 --> 00:55:12.580]   There's a lottery ticket feel that I think new media, social media gives to us.
[00:55:12.580 --> 00:55:19.560]   There's also a scariness with the existing traditional methods of getting an audience
[00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:21.020]   in many creative fields.
[00:55:21.020 --> 00:55:24.700]   There's a scariness because it is rife with rejection.
[00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:29.460]   Well, an agent might say, I don't want your book.
[00:55:29.460 --> 00:55:33.540]   You perform and they don't call you back because your music's not that good.
[00:55:33.540 --> 00:55:40.620]   You try to move your drawings in a gallery or sell prints at the market and people don't
[00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:42.340]   like them.
[00:55:42.340 --> 00:55:44.720]   Social media kind of hides you from that type of rejection.
[00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:51.540]   It's like, no, like it's out there and it engineers like a background hum of attention.
[00:55:51.540 --> 00:55:54.780]   So if you're on social media, you'll make sure that like you're going to get some people
[00:55:54.780 --> 00:55:55.780]   are going to see you.
[00:55:55.780 --> 00:55:56.780]   You'll have some followers.
[00:55:56.780 --> 00:56:01.340]   So it gives you that simulacrum of people care and then you have this lottery ticket
[00:56:01.340 --> 00:56:02.340]   mentality in the background.
[00:56:02.340 --> 00:56:03.700]   Hey, this could take off anytime.
[00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:06.460]   It's just psychologically easier.
[00:56:06.460 --> 00:56:11.380]   So I think we get seduced by these new channels because it gets around everything that made
[00:56:11.380 --> 00:56:16.820]   succeeding as a creative hard just 12 years ago.
[00:56:16.820 --> 00:56:18.580]   We get seduced by these new channels.
[00:56:18.580 --> 00:56:22.180]   That being said, you might find when you do this exercise that no, no, no.
[00:56:22.180 --> 00:56:26.020]   There is a particular now market for this stuff that didn't exist before and there's
[00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:28.460]   a way to get there through a particular social media channel.
[00:56:28.460 --> 00:56:33.380]   So sure, go with that with your eyes open, execute that plan carefully, but be careful
[00:56:33.380 --> 00:56:38.840]   about just this general seduction that somehow everything that has always been hard about
[00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:43.580]   trying to make a living in a sort of interesting, creative, autonomous field that you can bypass
[00:56:43.580 --> 00:56:45.820]   all that through social media.
[00:56:45.820 --> 00:56:50.140]   The person who's winning in that equation is Mark Zuckerberg, right?
[00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:55.500]   The person winning that equation are the people that can monetize all that time you spend
[00:56:55.500 --> 00:57:02.620]   doing this sort of like easy, low return activities online, monetizing your attention.
[00:57:02.620 --> 00:57:07.780]   Be very careful about how you use that world and why you're using that world.
[00:57:07.780 --> 00:57:08.780]   All right.
[00:57:08.780 --> 00:57:12.700]   So I want to do a case study before we get to our final segment.
[00:57:12.700 --> 00:57:15.820]   We found a case study that has to do with digital minimalism.
[00:57:15.820 --> 00:57:21.900]   I don't think I got a name on this one actually, so we'll just call this person anonymous.
[00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:25.740]   All right, here's what he wrote.
[00:57:25.740 --> 00:57:32.540]   In May of 2022, I read a post on lesswrong.com called do a cost-benefit analysis of your
[00:57:32.540 --> 00:57:34.020]   technology usage.
[00:57:34.020 --> 00:57:41.020]   I immediately read digital minimalism, completing it in June of 2022 and beginning my digital
[00:57:41.020 --> 00:57:45.460]   declutter, then gradually removing more and more apps from my phone.
[00:57:45.460 --> 00:57:50.620]   I also eventually picked up deep work and spent time on improving my time blocking and
[00:57:50.620 --> 00:57:53.700]   multi-scale planning game.
[00:57:53.700 --> 00:57:59.060]   It's been 1.5 years since I read digital minimalism and started applying its lessons.
[00:57:59.060 --> 00:58:06.820]   Since then, I have one, drastically increased how much I read, two, drastically increased
[00:58:06.820 --> 00:58:14.620]   how much I exercise, three, incrementally increased how much I sleep and four, significantly
[00:58:14.620 --> 00:58:21.180]   increased the amount of movies and video games I have actively and consciously consumed in
[00:58:21.180 --> 00:58:25.660]   contrast to passive or regretful consumption.
[00:58:25.660 --> 00:58:29.640]   After one and a half years of saying to my wife, let me tell you what Cal Newport says
[00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:31.500]   you should be doing.
[00:58:31.500 --> 00:58:36.180]   She has gone from rolling her eyes and making fun of my hints and razor to forcing me to
[00:58:36.180 --> 00:58:42.340]   listen to her read out loud passages from So Good They Can't Ignore You.
[00:58:42.340 --> 00:58:45.580]   Well, there's a good and a bad in there.
[00:58:45.580 --> 00:58:48.780]   The negative lesson there is don't bother your wife about Cal Newport stuff.
[00:58:48.780 --> 00:58:52.380]   Trust me, there's thousands of wives and girlfriends around the world who are tired of hearing
[00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:53.940]   about Cal Newport.
[00:58:53.940 --> 00:58:55.640]   My empathy goes out to your wife.
[00:58:55.640 --> 00:59:03.140]   But the good in here is that digital declutters and digital minimalism works, right?
[00:59:03.140 --> 00:59:06.220]   He got intentional about his technology usage.
[00:59:06.220 --> 00:59:09.840]   He added things into his life that was more meaningful to him.
[00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:11.500]   And look at these changes.
[00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:13.860]   He's reading, he's exercising, he's sleeping more.
[00:59:13.860 --> 00:59:16.500]   He's much more conscious about how he engages with media.
[00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:20.700]   This is someone who I can tell you is probably a lot less anxious, a lot more engaged than
[00:59:20.700 --> 00:59:25.440]   he was before, probably a lot more productive in work as well.
[00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:30.620]   It's like the heavy drinker doesn't realize the impact this is having on their lives,
[00:59:30.620 --> 00:59:34.420]   the hangovers, the lack of energy, the lack of other pursuits until they move on.
[00:59:34.420 --> 00:59:38.460]   And then they realize, oh my God, life is in technicolor before it was in a sort of
[00:59:38.460 --> 00:59:40.220]   fuzzy black and white.
[00:59:40.220 --> 00:59:42.820]   So I love hearing those case studies.
[00:59:42.820 --> 00:59:44.980]   You can completely change your relationship with your phone.
[00:59:44.980 --> 00:59:46.340]   It's not as hard as you think.
[00:59:46.340 --> 00:59:48.780]   And the results when people do can be pretty cool.
[00:59:48.780 --> 00:59:49.780]   All right.
[00:59:49.780 --> 00:59:53.820]   So I want to get to a final segment where I react to something that someone sent me
[00:59:53.820 --> 00:59:55.300]   or I encountered in the news.
[00:59:55.300 --> 01:00:01.020]   But first, however, let's hear from another sponsor.
[01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:06.180]   So I want to talk about another one of our sponsors, our friends at Ladder.
[01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:10.100]   This is that time of year where you have all the information you need, for example, to
[01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:13.860]   file your taxes, but you're putting it off.
[01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:16.320]   Why do we procrastinate on things like that?
[01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:18.680]   Because we know that there's going to be ambiguity.
[01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:22.980]   We know it's going to be complicated, so we don't want to deal with it.
[01:00:22.980 --> 01:00:26.580]   That's often how we think about life insurance as well.
[01:00:26.580 --> 01:00:32.180]   We know we need more life insurance to take care of those who love us and depend on us,
[01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:37.900]   but it seems like a complicated, ambiguous progress or process, so we put it off.
[01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:40.540]   Ladder makes it simple.
[01:00:40.540 --> 01:00:42.620]   Ladder is 100% digital.
[01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:45.260]   There are no doctors, no needles, and no paperwork.
[01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:49.740]   When you apply for $3 million in coverage or less, you just answer a few questions about
[01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:51.220]   your health and an application.
[01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:55.420]   You need just a few minutes and a phone or laptop to apply.
[01:00:55.420 --> 01:01:00.180]   Ladder's smart algorithms work in real time, so you'll find out if you're instantly approved.

[01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:17.860]   We're talking those rated A and A+ by AM Best.
[01:01:17.860 --> 01:01:23.780]   So Ladder gets rid of that ambiguity and makes it easy to get more life insurance.

[01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:42.740]   I also want to briefly talk about our friends at My Body Tutor.
[01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:47.460]   I've known Adam Gilbert, My Body Tutor's founder, for over 15 years now.
[01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:51.780]   He used to be the fitness guru for my blog back in his early days.
[01:01:51.780 --> 01:01:56.640]   His company, My Body Tutor, is a 100% online coaching program that solves the biggest problem
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:02:00.700]   in health and fitness, which is a lack of consistency.
[01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:06.140]   They do this by giving you a dedicated coach.
[01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:10.580]   This coach helps you figure out your nutrition plan and a fitness plan that fits your goals
[01:02:10.580 --> 01:02:11.860]   and your life.
[01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:16.220]   You then check in digitally with this coach every single day.
[01:02:16.220 --> 01:02:18.580]   There you get sustainability.
[01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:22.380]   Knowing that you are checking in keeps you on the right track.
[01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:26.300]   Knowing that you can adjust your plan when life intercedes with the help of an expert
[01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:29.300]   coach helps you stay on the track.
[01:02:29.300 --> 01:02:34.780]   And because the coaching is online, it's done through an app and through digital communication,
[01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:39.180]   the cost of course is much cheaper than hiring a personal trainer nutritionist to come to
[01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:40.180]   your house.
[01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:45.260]   So if you want to get healthier, there's really no more effective way to do it than using
[01:02:45.260 --> 01:02:47.140]   My Body Tutor.
[01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:50.580]   So go to MyBodyTutor.com, that's T-U-T-O-R.
[01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:54.940]   If you mention deep questions when you sign up, you will get $50 off your first month.
[01:02:54.940 --> 01:02:56.940]   That's MyBodyTutor.com.
[01:02:56.940 --> 01:03:00.580]   Mention deep questions when you sign up.
[01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:03.500]   All right.
[01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:08.900]   So now we've made our way to our final segment where I react to something I've seen in the
[01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:09.900]   news.
[01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:16.620]   And we are combining this final segment with another segment, which is our weekly slow
[01:03:16.620 --> 01:03:27.360]   productivity corner.
[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:31.660]   The slow productivity corner is where we do answer a question or tackle a segment each
[01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:37.300]   week that's related to my upcoming book, Slow Productivity, which you can pre-order now.
[01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:41.700]   Go to calnewport.com/slow to read an excerpt and find out more.
[01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:47.700]   I usually use a question, but I had this final segment, which put me in a slow productivity
[01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:53.780]   mood because it featured someone who is featured in the book.
[01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:57.140]   So the person I want to talk about today is J.R.R.
[01:03:57.140 --> 01:04:03.140]   Tolkien, author of other things, among other things, of the Lord of the Rings trilogy.
[01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:10.340]   In particular, there's a quote that was sent to me by a curator of medieval manuscripts
[01:04:10.340 --> 01:04:12.260]   at one of the libraries at Oxford.
[01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:16.580]   So I thought that was just so cool that I was like, "I'm going to take seriously whatever
[01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:18.020]   you send me."
[01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:22.700]   You know when you're getting a message from a curator of medieval manuscripts at Oxford,
[01:04:22.700 --> 01:04:28.020]   they're probably not writing you about kettlebells or bow hunting.
[01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:29.460]   Or TikTok videos.
[01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:33.380]   They're probably not, "Hey, do you see this fire TikTok video?"
[01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:40.300]   At first I thought this guy was sus, but now I know they're Audie 9000.
[01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:43.980]   I'm mixing late '90s lingo with modern lingo.
[01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:46.740]   No, it's very dignified.
[01:04:46.740 --> 01:04:48.700]   So he sent me this quote from Tolkien.
[01:04:48.700 --> 01:04:51.700]   I'm actually going to bring up an article on the screen for those who are watching that
[01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:54.340]   also includes this quote.
[01:04:54.340 --> 01:04:59.140]   Here's an article here from the New Criterion called The Constellations of Fantasy that
[01:04:59.140 --> 01:05:03.860]   is talking about this really cool Tolkien exhibit that was put on by the Morgan Library
[01:05:03.860 --> 01:05:05.300]   Museum a couple of years ago.
[01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:10.260]   What I like about some of this artwork, so you can see for those who are watching on
[01:05:10.260 --> 01:05:18.580]   the screen, an illustration that Tolkien did himself for The Hobbit.
[01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:21.300]   You sort of see this fantastical English landscape.
[01:05:21.300 --> 01:05:26.020]   I assume this might be the Shire done in pastel colors.
[01:05:26.020 --> 01:05:27.620]   Here he is working, a picture of him working.
[01:05:27.620 --> 01:05:29.860]   All right, here's other illustrations he did.
[01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:33.220]   This is from a series of stories he did for his children about Father Christmas.
[01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:42.660]   It's a fantastical picture he did about Father Christmas going to his snow palace.
[01:05:42.660 --> 01:05:47.220]   Here's a collection of graph paper from the exhibit that had been pasted together and
[01:05:47.220 --> 01:05:51.820]   on here, Tolkien has drawn out a map of Middle-earth.
[01:05:51.820 --> 01:05:55.020]   This was his first map of Middle-earth.
[01:05:55.020 --> 01:05:58.260]   This caught my attention because I know a lot about Tolkien.
[01:05:58.260 --> 01:06:02.940]   I read the Raymond James academic biography a couple of years ago.
[01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:10.580]   He's living his life at Oxford where he's being overwhelmed to some extent by the administrative,
[01:06:10.580 --> 01:06:16.980]   by the details of being a lecturer at Oxford in the early 20th century, the stresses of
[01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:23.740]   being in a field, philology, that was transforming into modern linguistics.
[01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:26.460]   He was on the old-fashioned side of that.
[01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:28.300]   He was grading a lot.
[01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:30.460]   He was preparing a lot of courses.
[01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:33.300]   He was really busy and feeling overwhelmed.
[01:06:33.300 --> 01:06:35.180]   He also worried about money.
[01:06:35.180 --> 01:06:37.160]   Meanwhile, look what he's doing.
[01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:40.700]   He's drawing these almost childlike, fantastical images.
[01:06:40.700 --> 01:06:43.500]   His imagination was soaring.
[01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:52.180]   When Lord of the Rings began to do well, he finally saw that he had a chance to spend
[01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:58.300]   less time with all of these grinding activities that he just felt were put upon him and more
[01:06:58.300 --> 01:07:02.420]   time in these fantastical worlds that are revealed through his artwork.
[01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:05.580]   This brings us to the quote that was sent to me by this curator of medieval manuscripts
[01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:07.260]   from Oxford.
[01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:13.260]   It's a quote in a letter sent from Tolkien to Stanley Unwin.
[01:07:13.260 --> 01:07:20.180]   Here's the quote, "Writing stories in prose or verse has been stolen, often guiltily,
[01:07:20.180 --> 01:07:23.900]   from time already mortgaged and has been broken and ineffective.
[01:07:23.900 --> 01:07:30.500]   I may perhaps now do what I much desire to do and not fail a financial duty."
[01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:38.940]   What he's pointing out there is that he had been stealing time from these other professional
[01:07:38.940 --> 01:07:45.340]   grinding activities to which it had already been mortgaged to work on these fantastical
[01:07:45.340 --> 01:07:48.220]   images that really spoke to him.
[01:07:48.220 --> 01:07:53.580]   Once his book started doing a little bit better, he finally had time to actually, without guilt,
[01:07:53.580 --> 01:07:57.220]   focus on this thing that's really important to him.
[01:07:57.220 --> 01:08:00.580]   There's a slow productivity lesson in there.
[01:08:00.580 --> 01:08:05.180]   Tolkien, as an exemplar of fast productivity, of all these things I'm doing and juggling
[01:08:05.180 --> 01:08:09.540]   as a professor and doing all these things, wasn't that happy.
[01:08:09.540 --> 01:08:13.860]   Where did he find real peace, being able to return to these fantastical worlds that he
[01:08:13.860 --> 01:08:19.300]   was creating, working on fewer things, slowing down on the work, obsessing over the quality
[01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:21.140]   of the few number of things he did?
[01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:22.140]   This is hard to get to.
[01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:24.820]   Not all of us are going to get there completely.
[01:08:24.820 --> 01:08:27.120]   Not all of us are going to write Lord of the Rings.
[01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:31.140]   I give a lot of advice in my book about how to move towards this world, but I just thought
[01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:35.260]   it was a great example of the joys of slowness.
[01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:41.980]   This is what Tolkien wanted to do, was engage in this slower, more engaging world, to get
[01:08:41.980 --> 01:08:44.620]   away from the fast productivity of his time.
[01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:50.100]   The issues we face today in our world of slack and email were issues that Tolkien faced in
[01:08:50.100 --> 01:08:54.060]   the early 20th century in his age of academic responsibilities.
[01:08:54.060 --> 01:08:57.900]   I just thought it was cool to see that quote and to see these examples of the fantastical
[01:08:57.900 --> 01:08:59.380]   worlds that really drew his attention.
[01:08:59.380 --> 01:09:01.340]   Here's another one here.
[01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:03.700]   Here's an ink drawing he did called Eeriness.
[01:09:03.700 --> 01:09:08.020]   He had this childlike imagination, but it was sophisticated.
[01:09:08.020 --> 01:09:11.420]   That's what he wanted to do, and eventually he would slow down enough to be able to do
[01:09:11.420 --> 01:09:12.420]   it.
[01:09:12.420 --> 01:09:15.240]   There he found this real contentment.
[01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:20.460]   Perfect example of the promise of slow productivity, and a great excuse, Jesse, to hear once again
[01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:30.240]   our slower productivity theme song.
[01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:32.980]   That's all the time we have for today.
[01:09:32.980 --> 01:09:33.980]   Thank you for listening.
[01:09:33.980 --> 01:09:39.620]   Remember calnewport.com/slow to hear more about my book, thedeeplife.com/listen for
[01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:43.580]   instructions on how to submit your own questions and calls to the program.
[01:09:43.580 --> 01:09:48.980]   We'll be back next week with a new episode, and until then, as always, stay deep.
[01:09:48.980 --> 01:09:54.020]   Hey, so if you enjoyed today's discussion of digital minimalism, I think you'll also
[01:09:54.020 --> 01:10:01.640]   like episode 286 in which I go into the different types of self-help from the simple and advice
[01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:07.380]   focus to the deep and philosophical and tell you how to integrate these sources of wisdom
[01:10:07.380 --> 01:10:10.860]   into your high quality leisure habits.
[01:10:10.860 --> 01:10:11.860]   Check it out.
[01:10:11.860 --> 01:10:14.300]   I think you'll enjoy it.
[01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:21.820]   The general topic is how do you cultivate a deep life in a world that is increasingly
[01:10:21.820 --> 01:10:22.700]   distracted?
