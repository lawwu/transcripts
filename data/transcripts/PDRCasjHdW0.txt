[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:12.920]   the book of the Acts of the Apostles in the seventh chapter, reading verses 42 and 43.
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:19.240]   Verses 42 and 43 in the seventh chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:25.560]   Then God turned and gave them up to worship the host of him, as it is written in the book
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:32.080]   of the prophets, "O ye house of Israel, have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.680]   by the space of forty years in the wilderness?
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.840]   Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your God, Rephan, figures
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:47.160]   which ye made to worship them; and I will carry you away beyond Babylon."
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.360]   Now this statement can only be truly understood and appreciated if we take it in the context,
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.920]   and therefore I must read to you the words that precede it.
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.480]   Stephen, the martyr Stephen, the first Christian martyr Stephen, is here delivering his great
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.760]   address before the council at Jerusalem known as the Sanhedrin.
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.520]   He's on trial, and he's on trial because he's a Christian and a preacher of the Christian
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.040]   gospel.
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.780]   They say that he has spoken blasphemous words against Moses and against God.
[00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.720]   They say that they've heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.920]   place, that's to say the temple, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.960]   This man, they said, ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.800]   and the law.
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:43.160]   And so Stephen has been arrested and is on trial for his life, simply because he's a
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:49.320]   Christian, because he does believe that Jesus of Nazareth is the son of God, and that he
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.680]   has risen from the dead, and that he is the savior of the world and the only savior.
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.280]   He's on trial for that.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.440]   This is regarded by the Sanhedrin as blasphemy.
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.280]   So they make him stand there and they call upon him to speak for himself.
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.800]   The high priest said, "Are these things so?" and Stephen replies.
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.240]   And that's what we have here is his great speech, and we've been considering it for
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.240]   some time.
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.640]   Now what he does here is to review the history of the children of Israel, the history with
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.360]   which they were so familiar, the history of which indeed they were so proud.
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.800]   Stephen takes them over it, its salient features.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.800]   What for?
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.400]   Well, to show them that they've never understood it, that they've completely misunderstood
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.240]   it, and that in doing that they were alas but repeating what their forefathers had been
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.440]   doing almost from the very beginning.
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.360]   Alas had been the story of this people.
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.720]   They'd never understood who they were and what God was doing with them and through them.
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.600]   And so he rehearses the history, and particularly the story of Moses, and that's what we are
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.320]   dealing with at this moment.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.520]   He's reminded them of the history, then he says, "This is that Moses which said unto
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:07.160]   the children of Israel, 'A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.440]   like unto me.
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.420]   Him shall he hear.'
[00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.160]   This is he that was in the church in the wilderness, with the angel which spake to him in the
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:23.040]   Mount Sinai, and with our fathers, who received the lively oracles to give unto us.
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:31.480]   To whom, this Moses, our fathers would not obey, but thrusting from them, and in their
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:38.920]   hearts turned back again unto Egypt, saying unto Aaron, 'Make us gods to go before us,
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.560]   for this Moses which brought us out of the land of Egypt, we want not what is become
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.560]   of him.'
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:50.440]   And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.760]   works of their own hands."
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:59.720]   Then comes the words that we're considering tonight, "Then God turned and gave them up
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.480]   to worship the host of heaven," etc.
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.680]   So then you see this is the setting of these words that we are considering together.
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:16.360]   Now someone may ask me, "What is the object of considering an old story like that?
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.840]   What's that got to do with us?"
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.840]   Here we are in this troubled world.
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:27.320]   China now has exploded a hydrogen bomb, and we are beginning to see the possibilities
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.160]   that are facing us.
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.280]   What has all this got to do with us?
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.200]   The modern men and the modern world, and the modern problem and situation?
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:43.960]   Well, it is because I want to show you that this old story speaks more directly to this
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:49.800]   modern situation tonight than anything else in the universe that I'm directing your attention
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.120]   to it.
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.240]   The story of the Jewsâ€”I'm not thinking of the modern Jew, I'm talking about the
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.880]   Jews as we find them in the Old Testament.
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:09.360]   The story of the Jews is a great object lesson of God's relationship to, and God's dealing
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:15.600]   with, the entire human race.
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:24.440]   Now what God did to these people in particular, he will do with the entire human race.
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:30.160]   That's the great point of this address that is here delivered by Stephen.
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.840]   You see what he's showing them is this.
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.160]   Here they are, they're rejecting Jesus Christ.
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.280]   He is the Son of God.
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.920]   He's come to save the world, and they have nothing to do with him.
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.160]   They regard his preachers as blasphemers.
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.800]   This man's on trial, he's going to be put to death for preaching Jesus Christ.
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.200]   They're rejecting him.
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:57.240]   Yes, and Stephen's whole objective, you see, is to show them that in doing that, they
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.600]   are, as I say, just repeating what their forefathers had always done.
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:07.240]   Here are these foolish members of the Sanhedrin, glorying in the name of Moses.
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:13.280]   But Moses had prophesied the coming of Jesus Christ, and he had told people to listen to
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.280]   him.
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.000]   They're disobeying Moses.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.800]   It is they who are against Moses, not he, Stephen, and the Christians.
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.800]   These people, they talk about Moses, they talk about the temple, they talk about the
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:25.800]   nation.
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.480]   They've never understood it.
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:31.760]   That's been the curse of the people from the very beginning, as Stephen points out
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:32.760]   here so clearly.
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:39.200]   Now I say we are interested in this, because these people and their behavior and what happened
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:48.320]   to them is just a great object lesson of God's relationship to the entire human race.
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:56.040]   So, this is most important in this way, that Stephen is dealing here with history.
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.040]   He's not dealing with theory.
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.040]   He's dealing with history.
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:03.480]   You've only got to read this chapter to see that quite clearly.
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.840]   As I say, he rehearses the history.
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.520]   Now this is of tremendous importance.
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.160]   It isn't theory.
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.160]   It isn't an attitude.
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.360]   It isn't a point of view.
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:17.440]   He is rarely dealing with solid history.
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:24.440]   More important still, he is dealing with history that has not only happened, but which has
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:25.440]   been foretold.
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:29.400]   That's the remarkable thing.
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:35.280]   The history that you've got in the Bible is history that had been previously prophesied,
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:38.400]   previously foretold.
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:45.800]   And in addition to that, we've got to say this, this history is itself a prophecy.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:52.600]   In other words, it tells us of what is going to come if we persist in behaving in the same
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:59.000]   way as the Sanhedrin or as the children of Israel have done under the Old Testament dispensation.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.320]   So it's a most amazing thing.
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:03.520]   It is history.
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:09.480]   It is history that is fulfilled prophecy, but which in turn itself is a prophecy of
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.160]   what is yet to happen.
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.400]   What can be more important than this?
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:19.400]   Now, I'm calling your attention to it for this reason.
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:26.200]   My assertion tonight is that it is only as we understand the principles that are taught
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:34.760]   here by Stephen that we can possibly understand the past history of the human race.
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:35.760]   I'll go further.
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:44.600]   It is only as we understand the principles taught here by Stephen that we can understand
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:51.920]   the very condition in which we find ourselves as a world of people at this very moment.
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:52.920]   Now look at your world.
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:55.480]   Look at the state of the world tonight.
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:58.480]   Look at the things that are happening, the things that have just happened.
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.960]   Look at this century and the two world wars.
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.360]   Look at what is developing.
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:05.800]   Look at the possibilities that are looming upon the horizon.
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:10.360]   Now I say that there is only one way to understand all this.
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:16.480]   It is to understand and to grasp the principles that are here taught by this first Christian
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:23.760]   martyr Stephen as he reviews the history of Israel and works out what I venture to call
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:27.080]   a philosophy of history.
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:30.320]   Now let me put it to you like this.
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:34.600]   Why is the world as it is at this moment?
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:41.920]   Why are we in the situation in which we find ourselves nationally, internationally, members
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.480]   of society and as individuals?
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.360]   Why is the world as it is?
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.720]   Now here is the great question.
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:54.640]   I'm sure it's a question that is in all your minds.
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:10:02.040]   The world of course, looking at this problem, blames God for it.
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.760]   It's its great reason for not believing in God.
[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:08.160]   This is how the world speaks, isn't it?
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.540]   Why does God allow this?
[00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:17.360]   If God is a God of love, if God is omnipotent, why does he allow these things to happen?
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.280]   Why doesn't he stop it all?
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.280]   Now that's the argument.
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:21.280]   You're familiar with it.
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:24.120]   Now I don't want to spend the evening in discussing that.
[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:29.260]   I want to make a positive statement to you because that is what we've got here.
[00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.240]   But I must point out this in passing.
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:35.320]   How inconsistent is the world in its reasoning?
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:42.200]   Its main objection to God is that it believes in freedom, the free will of man, man's freedom
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:45.640]   to determine his life and his future and everything.
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:48.360]   This God is regarded as someone who is inimical to that.
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:52.760]   So the average man rejects God because he feels that God is holding him down and he
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:53.760]   wants freedom.
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:59.800]   And yet you notice, the moment he gets into trouble, he wants God to handle him as if
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:00.800]   he was a machine.
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.440]   You say, "Why doesn't God stop it?"
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:08.960]   The man who rejects God because God interferes with his life, the moment he gets into a mess
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:12.320]   and into a trouble, he says, "Why doesn't God stop this?"
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:15.440]   He wants God to regard him as a machine.
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:22.600]   He boasts about his freedom and yet he complains and objects when God continues to regard him
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:28.200]   as a free individual who is responsible for his actions and the results that follow from
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.200]   them.
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:34.280]   I just leave that in passing because I want to give you the full positive answer as it
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:36.040]   is given us here.
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:39.760]   Why is the world as it is?
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.440]   Stephen makes it abundantly clear.
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:54.960]   It is all due to the fact that men turns away from God and God's holy laws, to whom our
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:12:01.760]   fathers would not obey but thrust him from them, Moses and the Lord.
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:05.240]   And in their hearts, turned back again into Egypt.
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:09.120]   They turned away from God.
[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.320]   That's how they got into trouble.
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:15.920]   Read the story in the Old Testament and you'll see how frequently they were in trouble.
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:20.840]   And they were always in trouble because they turned away from God.
[00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:23.800]   They turned their backs upon him.
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:27.160]   And they renounced and rejected his holy laws.
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.160]   Now why does man do this?
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.920]   Well, Stephen has told us.
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:33.640]   We've already dealt with it last Sunday night.
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:42.200]   Men turns away from God and God's laws because he's a fool, because he's self-confident.
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:46.600]   And we saw how he proves that he is a fool.
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:51.680]   Men turns from God to a calf.
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:55.000]   What can you call that but unutterable folly?
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:02.480]   He turned from the uncorruptible God to corruptible things, to man in his corruption and four-footed
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:05.240]   beasts and creeping things.
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:08.760]   Man is the biggest fool in the universe.
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:15.640]   He turns from God to a golden calf, from the everlasting creator of the universe to gods
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:17.480]   that he makes with his own hands.
[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.040]   That is the height of folly.
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:20.040]   We've already dealt with it.
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:23.040]   But you see, that isn't all.
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:26.040]   Stephen goes on.
[00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:28.680]   There is another most important principle taught here.
[00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:32.560]   And if this is not relevant to the situation that you and I and the whole world are in
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:36.720]   tonight, I'd like you to tell me what is relevant.
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:40.520]   There is another principle here enunciated by Stephen.
[00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:47.480]   And this is what I call the true philosophy of the history of this world.
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:48.480]   What is it?
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:51.040]   Well, now let's look at it like this.
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:53.120]   Take a view at the history of the world.
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.800]   Take a bird's eye view.
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:55.800]   What do you find?
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.800]   You find something like this.
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:05.760]   Nothing has so characterized the history of the human race as a strange kind of periodicity.
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:06.760]   What do I mean?
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:07.760]   Well, I mean this.
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:11.400]   There have been certain times and epochs in the history of the world when things seem
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:17.000]   to be getting better, when men seem to be improving, when they seem to be rarely ascending
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.760]   and going upwards.
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:28.320]   But then that is followed by a period when there is a decline, a declension, a period
[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:29.320]   of retrogression.
[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:33.680]   Now, you've simply got to take, as I say, a bird's eye view of history and you'll
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:34.840]   see this very clearly.
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:40.240]   Now, the last century appeared to be one of those periods of ascension when everything
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:41.240]   was going upwards.
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:42.240]   Peace had reigned.
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:46.840]   There was an occasional war, like the Crimean War here and there.
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:50.200]   There had been nothing commensurate with the Napoleonic Wars.
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:54.600]   There was the great Pax Britannica and it looked as if it was going to last forever.
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:57.760]   And there was an empire in which the sun never set.
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:02.240]   And science had come in and knowledge was growing and advancing and the whole world
[00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:05.080]   was obviously going right up into the heavens.
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:10.120]   And some were quite sure that this twentieth century was really going to be the grand climax
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:14.200]   for which the whole of civilization had been waiting.
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:20.680]   But alas, our twentieth century has turned out to be something very different.
[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:30.320]   Our twentieth century is a century of calamity, a century of disaster, a century of horrors.
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:33.040]   That's the characteristic of this century.
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:34.720]   Now, here is the great question.
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:35.720]   Why is this?
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:44.000]   How do you explain this periodicity, apparent improvement, then terrible declension, facing
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.360]   the abyss and the end of all things?
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:48.600]   What's the cause of this?
[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:54.240]   Now the world simply cannot understand this at all.
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:56.440]   It's admitting it, it can't.
[00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:58.560]   It's completely baffled by it.
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:15:59.560]   Why?
[00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:03.760]   Well, because the world, you see, postulates development.
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:06.520]   The world believes in evolution.
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:12.200]   The world says that there is a force working in the direction of goodness, lifting up the
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:17.880]   entire human race, the era vital of Bergson and others.
[00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:22.240]   Now that's what the world believes, and it believes it very firmly.
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:29.360]   It's rejected belief in God in favor of this, this force that is there working men and everything
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.280]   upwards in the direction of perfection.
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:35.880]   Well, obviously, if you believe that, you've no explanation of what's happening at the
[00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:39.580]   present time, which is the reverse of all that.
[00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:43.040]   It seems to be a reversal of all that was happening in the last century.
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:45.640]   Now, the world, I said, doesn't understand.
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:53.360]   It's completely bankrupt because it has this fatal belief in this steady, inevitable, constant
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:59.120]   development and evolution.
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:08.520]   That's why the world is baffled tonight, is without an answer, doesn't know what to say,
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:14.240]   and is turning away for some temporary relief to drugs and drink or pleasure.
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:19.080]   Now, why does the world do this?
[00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:20.360]   Why is the world like this?
[00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:22.960]   Well, there's only one answer.
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:34.520]   It is entirely due to the fact that man forgets God, and that this world is God's world.
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:37.040]   This is why man is bankrupt in his thinking tonight.
[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:43.120]   You see, man thinks of this world solely in terms of himself, his own activities and his
[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:45.320]   own efforts.
[00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:52.280]   His idea of history is this, man fighting, man getting married, man being born, getting
[00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:57.920]   married, dying, wars, knowledge increasing, science and its discoveries.
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:06.200]   Man, he thinks of everything, always and exclusively in terms of man and the activity of man.
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:12.080]   And so he's baffled when he lives in a period such as this.
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:15.680]   And there's only one answer to this problem that confronts us all tonight.
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:21.960]   It's the answer that is given here by Stephen in this extraordinary statement that he makes
[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:26.160]   here to the members of the Sanhedrin.
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:32.520]   The answer to man and his baffled condition tonight is this, that what matters in this
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:40.800]   world ultimately is not what man does, it is what God does.
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:45.560]   And it is the failure, I say, to grasp and to understand this, that accounts for all
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:48.000]   the bafflement about the present situation.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   Now let me put it to you.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   Here is the biblical case.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   God made man, he made the world, and he made man, and he made the world perfect, and he
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.320]   made man perfect, and put him into this perfect world.
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:04.160]   And you say, "Well, why are things as they are?"
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:07.000]   Well, the answer is that men fell.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.680]   Men disobeyed God.
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:11.360]   Men rebelled against God.
[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:13.040]   Men asserted himself.
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:16.400]   Men said, "I'll take charge."
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:18.320]   That's the fall.
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:20.600]   Men fell.
[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:24.000]   Because men fell, God punished him.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:31.360]   And remember, a part of the punishment was this, that God, because of the rebellion and
[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:37.280]   the fall of men, cursed the very ground.
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:41.760]   Nature and creation are not what they were as God originally made them.
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:46.720]   God as a part of the punishment of men cursed the very ground.
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:49.440]   Briers and thorns came into existence.
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:51.560]   Diseases came into existence.
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:54.000]   This is a part of the punishment of the sin of man.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.040]   They were never intended in the universe.
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:20:00.520]   This is all a part of the punishment.
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:06.600]   What's still more serious, of course, is this, that as a result of his folly and his
[00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:15.040]   conceit and his rebellion against God and his blasphemy against God, man became the
[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:21.920]   slave of the devil and the slave of sin and the slave of evil.
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:26.960]   And ever since, he's been governed by the devil and by sin and by evil.
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:30.800]   You again take a bird's eye view of the history of the human race and what will you
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:31.800]   find?
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:34.560]   Well, you'll find that it's a history of misery in the main.
[00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:41.120]   Troubles, problems, illnesses, wars, earthquakes, calamities, pestilences, death.
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:42.720]   That's the story of the human race.
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.720]   Now, it was never meant to be like that.
[00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:47.920]   This is all a part, I say, of the punishment of sin.
[00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:54.280]   And man has been unhappy because he has become the slave of the devil.
[00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:57.600]   The devil has become the god of this world.
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:00.040]   And he governs men and he rules them.
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:07.000]   And men have become a creature of lust and desire and passion and of evil.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:15.920]   But, and this is an essential part of the biblical message, God has controlled even
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:16.920]   that.
[00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:24.200]   Now, I'm really bringing you to the explanation of the modern position in the world tonight.
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:29.000]   There is the fall of men and there are the consequences in general.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.960]   But God didn't abandon the world.
[00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:38.400]   God decided to keep evil and sin under control.
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:39.400]   How has he done so?
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:41.280]   Well, the Bible tells us.
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:45.200]   One of his ways in doing that was appointing government.
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:48.720]   You know, government is not a human invention.
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:51.120]   Government is something that has been introduced by God.
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:57.440]   You see, we talk about kings and princes and emperors and governors and so on, as if man
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:58.440]   had brought them into being.
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:21:59.440]   But he hasn't.
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:00.440]   This is God's device.
[00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:05.160]   "Let every soul," says Paul in Romans 13, "be subject unto the higher powers, for there
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:07.280]   is no power but of God.
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:10.920]   The powers that be are ordained of God."
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:13.120]   He's talking about magistrates and governments.
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:17.600]   "Whosoever therefore resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of God," and so on.
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:22.640]   "Rulers are not a terror to good works but to the evil," and so on.
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:27.400]   The magistrate, he says, "for he beareth not the sword in vain, for he is the minister
[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:31.680]   of God, a revenger, to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil."
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:41.760]   Now, all that means this, that God has not allowed man in sin unrestrained freedom and
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:42.760]   activity.
[00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:49.280]   He has brought in government and order and system in order to keep it all in bounds,
[00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:52.000]   to keep it all in check.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.200]   This is a part, an essential part of the biblical teaching.
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:56.800]   God did this when man fell.
[00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:01.640]   He punished him, certain consequences happened, but God put a limit and a control upon it
[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:02.640]   all.
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:14.000]   Now, here is the message.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:21.560]   Whenever man abuses God's goodness, whenever man becomes exceptionally arrogant and vile,
[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:27.040]   then God acts, and he acts in a specific manner.
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:31.720]   And I want to show you that that is precisely what God is doing at this present hour, and
[00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:36.760]   that this is the only explanation of what has been happening in this twentieth century.
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:39.840]   The world, I say, turns against God and says, "Why does God allow this?
[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:41.360]   Why doesn't God stop it?
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:44.520]   Why does God do this sort of thing?" they say.
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:46.280]   I'll give you the answer to that.
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:49.400]   It's Stephen's answer, it isn't mine.
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:51.560]   I say, here's the principle.
[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:56.760]   God controls sin and evil and their effects upon the human race.
[00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:58.760]   He keeps them in check.
[00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:08.720]   When man, I say again, has been exceptionally arrogant and proud and vile, God does something
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:09.720]   else.
[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:15.880]   Now, I am suggesting that this is what is happening at this present time.
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:23.080]   For man, during the last hundred years, has been exceptionally arrogant.
[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:26.560]   He's been unusually vile.
[00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:33.360]   We have seen a century in which man has ridiculed God, laughs at him, makes a joke of him.
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:34.360]   Science comes in.
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:42.640]   Man is able to do everything, and God has been derided and dismissed, treated with scorn.
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:43.640]   That's arrogance.
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:47.040]   Man has said he could control the universe.
[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:50.640]   There was nothing he couldn't do, and he's been setting up to do it.
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:56.720]   Now, I say that when man does behave like that, God invariably acts in the manner that
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:58.560]   is taught here by Stephen.
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:24:59.560]   What is it?
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:02.920]   Well, let me put it to you in the form of principles.
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:08.800]   What God does at such a time is that he punishes man.
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:10.280]   How does he punish him?
[00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:17.920]   Well, says Stephen, the first element in the punishment is that God turns away from him.
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:21.600]   Did you notice this?
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:28.720]   Then God turned and gave them up to worship the host of heaven.
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:33.000]   You see, we've been told previously that these children of Israel wouldn't listen to Moses,
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.480]   but thrust him from them, and in their hearts, turned back again into Egypt.
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:39.680]   You see, here they were, the typical arrogance of men.
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:42.720]   They said, "This Moses, we don't know what's happened to him.
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:43.720]   Who is he?
[00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:44.720]   He's gone up onto a mountain.
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:45.720]   Shall we ever see him again?
[00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:47.800]   Look here, let's make a God for ourselves."
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:51.640]   They turned away from God, and they thought they were clever.
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:53.800]   This is a part of the punishment.
[00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:59.080]   God turned away from them.
[00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:07.320]   That's the most awful thing that I can think of, that God should turn away from men.
[00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:15.400]   But this is what he does at certain periods of exceptional arrogance on the part of men.
[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:18.320]   You see, what it means is this.
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:23.520]   Oh, how little we know about God, and how little we understand him.
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:29.760]   Though men had sinned against him, God didn't turn away from him.
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:37.040]   As I say, he brought in powers, governments, magistrates, kings, order into society, the
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:38.960]   family, the home, and all these things.
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:43.600]   These are all God's ways of controlling and keeping sin within bounds.
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:48.560]   Not only that, he sends his sun upon the evil and the good and the rain upon the just and
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:49.560]   the unjust.
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:52.000]   How good and kind God is to us.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:58.640]   He looks at us still, but you know there are times when he turns away.
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:04.040]   Man in his arrogance turns away from God, and he thinks this is marvelous and wonderful.
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:06.280]   Do you know what he forgets?
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:11.360]   He forgets that God can turn away from him.
[00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:15.760]   And I suggest to you that if you want to understand the 20th century, there's the first key to
[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:17.120]   it.
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:27.160]   This is the century in which God is turning away from man, deliberately.
[00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:28.760]   Now let's be clear about this.
[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:36.080]   God never turns away from men until he has first of all blessed him, and given him every
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:40.040]   chance and every opportunity.
[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:41.920]   He did that with the children of Israel.
[00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:45.360]   He only just brought them out of the captivity and the bondage of Egypt.
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:48.000]   He brought them miraculously through the Red Sea.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.400]   Then they became arrogant, and he turned away from them.
[00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:55.520]   And this is always true.
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:28:02.880]   Oh, the blessings that God has given to the human race, we can't count them.
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:08.560]   God never turns away from men without first of all blessing him in an amazing manner.
[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:10.400]   I'll tell you more.
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:17.640]   God never turns away from men without first of all warning him that he will do so.
[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:20.520]   You read the story of these children of Israel.
[00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:23.160]   Stephen is really just giving a summary of it here.
[00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:24.920]   And this is what you'll find.
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:29.080]   God when he speaks to these children of Israel, he tells them every time, "Now look here.
[00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:30.840]   You obey my laws.
[00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:34.040]   You come my way, and blessing I will bless you."
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:42.200]   And he always says, "If you don't, cursing I will curse you."
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:45.840]   You see, this happened at the very beginning when God made men.
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:47.040]   He made him in his own image.
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:49.320]   He surrounded him with everything that men could desire.
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:50.320]   It was paradise.
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:53.360]   But God, you see, he again gave the warning.
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:54.720]   He said, "Now there's that one tree.
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:29:00.240]   You mustn't eat of that, because if you do, the day that you eat of that dying, thou
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:01.240]   shall die."
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:03.080]   He was warned.
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:09.400]   God never turns away without first of all warning us that he may do it in certain circumstances,
[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:14.680]   and if he does, there will be certain consequences.
[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:20.040]   This is invariable from the beginning until this hour.
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:31.280]   But when men ignores the goodness of God and ridicules the warnings of God, then God turns
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:33.200]   away from them.
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:35.320]   This is a terrible thing.
[00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:38.880]   The prophet Amos puts it in his own graphic manner when he says this.
[00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:41.960]   It was a similar period to the one in which you and I are living.
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:45.600]   God gave this message to the prophet Amos to these people, and he said, "Look here,
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:49.680]   there is a day coming when I will send a famine into this land.
[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:54.520]   It will not be a famine of eating of bread, nor a famine of drinking, nor a thirst for
[00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:55.520]   water.
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:30:01.160]   It will be a famine of hearing the word of the Lord."
[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:06.280]   And that's the most awful thing that can ever happen, to be left with nothing but the
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:14.240]   humanists, the scoffers and the unbelievers, and their supposed wisdom, nothing else.
[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:21.160]   Can you imagine what a world like that is, when God doesn't speak and just leaves us?
[00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:27.640]   God turned away from them.
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:32.920]   It is a part of his punishment of men's exceptional arrogance and vileness.
[00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:35.360]   But wait, it isn't all.
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:37.480]   The next thing I read here is this.
[00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:45.720]   Then God turned and gave them up, gave them up to worship the host of heaven, and so on.
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:50.240]   Now, the real exposition of this, of course, is in the passage that I read to you at the
[00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:55.640]   beginning to the first chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans.
[00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:58.960]   God gave them up.
[00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:00.800]   Paul says that three times.
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:02.960]   He gave them up to a reprobate mind.
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:05.080]   He gave them up to this, he gave them up to that.
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:06.080]   What does this mean?
[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:09.660]   Well, this is what it means.
[00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:16.080]   I told you just now that when men fell and brought calamity upon himself and his world,
[00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:17.880]   that God didn't just leave him.
[00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:20.680]   God didn't say, "All right, I finish with you, carry on."
[00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:21.680]   No, no.
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:24.680]   God, in his great kindness, it's what we call common grace.
[00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:26.320]   He put limits upon sin.
[00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:27.600]   He put restraints.
[00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:29.320]   He held it within bounds.
[00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:31.440]   He put controls upon it.
[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:38.800]   Now, the second way in which God worships the exceptional arrogance of men is this,
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:43.600]   that he withdraws the restraints and the controls.
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:44.720]   God gave them up.
[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:45.960]   God gives them over.
[00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:52.640]   What it means is this, that God allows men to do what he likes and withdraws all his
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:54.800]   restraining influences.
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:57.520]   This is a tremendous thing.
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:00.920]   I would be baffled about the present state of the world but for this.
[00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:02.480]   This is the whole key to it.
[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:05.560]   Let me put it like this to you.
[00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:13.160]   The world, as I say, holds God responsible for what is happening in the world.
[00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:17.640]   But you know, my dear friends, far from God being responsible for what is happening in
[00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:23.080]   the world tonight and what has happened during this century, the two world wars and the concentration
[00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:30.080]   camps, Belsen, Buchenwald and all the rest of it, and all people are blaming God for
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:31.080]   this.
[00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:32.080]   You know the answer to that?
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:41.120]   The answer to that is this, that that is nothing but God allowing men to have his own way.
[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:43.080]   Normally God doesn't allow that.
[00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:44.440]   He restrains.
[00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:45.440]   He puts the limits.
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:51.880]   There is a kind of decency that he produces even in the unregenerate and by means of laws
[00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:58.200]   and acts of parliament and a general moral teaching, he restrains evil.
[00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:03.040]   But when men, I say, as displayed this unusual exceptional arrogance and vileness, do you
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:04.040]   know what God does?
[00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:06.000]   He takes away the restraints.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:11.480]   He just allows men to do anything he likes.
[00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:18.800]   And that is what is happening in this modern world of ours at this present time.
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:20.440]   Man has turned his back upon God.
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:22.360]   He says, "We don't need you.
[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:23.440]   You're unnecessary.
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:25.120]   We can do it all."
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:28.680]   Very well, God is saying, "Get on with it.
[00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:30.880]   Let's see what you do make of it.
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:32.280]   Let's see what you do produce."
[00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:35.000]   God does this quite deliberately.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:40.400]   As men deliberately turns from God, God deliberately turns from men.
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:43.620]   And you see what is happening in your world tonight is this.
[00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:51.520]   You are seeing the world as it is without the restraints of God.
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:54.160]   God is no longer keeping evil in check.
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:59.600]   He's just allowing it to have its fling and its full course.
[00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:02.360]   He gave them up.
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:07.920]   He gave them up to a reprobate mind and all that follows from it.
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:08.920]   That's the second principle.
[00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:16.360]   And the third is this one, "And I will carry you away beyond Babylon."
[00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:19.520]   That means just this.
[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:26.300]   That in addition to turning his face from them and not smiling upon them, in addition
[00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:33.200]   to withdrawing his restraints and his controls, God actively punishes.
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:37.560]   This is all part of the biblical teaching.
[00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:39.320]   God sends them to Babylon.
[00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:43.040]   In other words, he allows their enemies to conquer them and he allows their enemies to
[00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:45.120]   control them.
[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:49.240]   You read the story of the children of Israel and this is what you'll always find.
[00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:52.640]   When they were obedient to God, they could conquer any enemy that came along.
[00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:53.920]   It didn't matter who he was.
[00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:56.040]   They were always victorious.
[00:34:56.040 --> 00:35:00.000]   On the contrary, you will find that when they turned their backs upon God and trusted to
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:05.840]   their generals or their own prowess or their own armaments or skill, they were invariably
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:06.840]   defeated.
[00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:08.520]   God just left them to themselves.
[00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:12.600]   And he did so when the Chaldeans raised a great army against them.
[00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:14.960]   God allowed them to suffer defeat.
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:20.160]   God withdrew all his power and all his help and they were carried away to the captivity
[00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:22.160]   of Babylon.
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:29.120]   Now this is deliberate punishment given by God.
[00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:33.720]   And what happened to the children of Israel in the matter of going to Babylon is just
[00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:38.080]   a picture of what happens to the whole human race.
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:40.500]   God punishes sin.
[00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:42.560]   You try and defy that if you like.
[00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:43.560]   You laugh at that.
[00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:44.560]   You scorn God's laws.
[00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:45.560]   You say, "I don't care.
[00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:46.560]   I don't believe that sort of rot.
[00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:47.560]   I'm going to do this and that."
[00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:48.560]   Very well.
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:49.560]   You do it and I'll tell you what'll happen to you.
[00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:50.560]   You'll suffer.
[00:35:50.560 --> 00:36:00.080]   "There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked."
[00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:02.280]   And you know that's true, don't you?
[00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:03.840]   You've been wicked.
[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:04.840]   You don't believe in God, you say.
[00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:05.840]   You're going to live your own life.
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:06.840]   Have you found peace?
[00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:07.840]   Of course you haven't.
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:11.680]   "There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked."
[00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:13.720]   You won't be allowed to have peace.
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:14.720]   God makes it impossible.
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:17.400]   It's a part of your punishment.
[00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:20.880]   The way of the transgressor is hard.
[00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:25.840]   Of course, you wouldn't think that from the novelets and the films, would you?
[00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:28.360]   But you follow the end of the story.
[00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:31.320]   The way of the transgressor is hard.
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:33.720]   The sinner is always found out.
[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:36.560]   Be sure your sin will find you out.
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:41.160]   You'll get misery, you'll get unhappiness, you'll get agony, and you'll get remorse.
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:44.560]   You, if you sin against God, you'll be made to pay for it.
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:46.960]   Now, I'm simply giving you hard facts.
[00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:49.240]   This is history.
[00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:50.880]   And God does this deliberately.
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:51.880]   He said he would.
[00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:56.320]   He's warned us there's no excuse, and he does it.
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:37:01.320]   Now, according to Stephen's exposition, this is how God dealt with the children of
[00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:05.720]   Israel when they were recalcitrant and refused Moses and refused his law.
[00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:07.960]   He says, "Look here, you members of the Sanhedrin.
[00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:12.160]   You were refusing God's Son, not his servant, but his Son.
[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:13.840]   This is what will happen to you.
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:16.120]   Listen," he says.
[00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:20.440]   That's why he's putting the case to them.
[00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:26.360]   But now let me come to my last principle, which is this one.
[00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:29.800]   Why do you think God behaves in this manner?
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:31.960]   God turned away from them.
[00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:35.120]   God delivered them up, gave them up.
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:39.280]   God punished them by sending them to the captivity of Babylon.
[00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:41.360]   Why does God do this?
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:43.240]   Can I justify God's ways?
[00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:44.240]   Of course I can.
[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:45.240]   There's no difficulty.
[00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:47.800]   The whole of the Bible gives us the justification.
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:48.880]   Here's the answer.
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:56.920]   God does this in order to reveal to men his true state and condition.
[00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:59.360]   This is what I mean.
[00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:06.320]   I say for a hundred years, man has been ridiculing belief in God, God's unnecessary.
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:10.480]   Man is perfect, man is wonderful, and he can make a wonderful world.
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:14.400]   You know, the people who don't believe in God, they generally tell you themselves that
[00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:19.120]   what they believe in is the dignity of man and the capability of man.
[00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:20.120]   That's what they say.
[00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:22.040]   You've heard them saying it, haven't you?
[00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:23.040]   They don't believe in God.
[00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:24.720]   Well, what do they believe in?
[00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:27.540]   They believe in the dignity of man.
[00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:29.920]   They believe in the capability of man.
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:31.920]   Now this is what you've got to face.
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:37.200]   If you reject God, that's all they've got to offer you, the dignity of man and the capability
[00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:38.200]   of man.
[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:39.200]   Well, what is it?
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:45.560]   Well, I read it to you at the beginning in the first chapter of Paul's epistle to the
[00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:46.560]   Romans.
[00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:54.120]   "Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lust of their own hearts, to dishonor
[00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:59.960]   their own bodies between themselves, the dignity of man, the capability of man, who changed
[00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:04.440]   the truth of God into a lie and worshiped the creature more than the Creator who is
[00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:05.440]   blessed forever.
[00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:09.920]   For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections.
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:15.320]   For even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature."
[00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:17.640]   That's the dignity of man.
[00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:22.280]   This is the capability of man of controlling himself and controlling life and controlling
[00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:26.160]   the whole world, the dignity of man, the capability of man.
[00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:27.160]   What is it?
[00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:33.800]   It's your modern world, your sexual perversions, your drugs, your drink, your pilfering, your
[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:36.800]   dishonesty, the vileness of life.
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:39.040]   That's man.
[00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:43.240]   And do you see what God is doing?
[00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:52.120]   God withdraws his restraints in order that men may see what he really is like.
[00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:56.440]   You see, this century is man having his own way.
[00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:58.800]   That's exactly what it is.
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:01.800]   In our cleverness, I say, we've rejected belief in God.
[00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:04.000]   Of course, we know far too much, we are scientific.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.400]   We can't possibly believe in God.
[00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:08.480]   Well, very well, then that means that we are capable of running the universe.
[00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:09.600]   Of course it does.
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:11.880]   We are quite capable of doing so.
[00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:13.440]   What's happening in the modern world?
[00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:18.920]   Well, you are just seeing what man makes of himself and of the world when he's given
[00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:21.160]   free play.
[00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:27.560]   You are seeing today what life is when God withdraws his restraints and his controls
[00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:28.560]   and his inhibitions.
[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:29.560]   God gave them up.
[00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:30.560]   He gave them over.
[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:31.560]   He abandoned them.
[00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:32.560]   He said, "All right, I'll leave you alone.
[00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:33.560]   You've told me to leave you alone.
[00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:34.560]   You say you don't believe in me.
[00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:35.560]   You say you are alone.
[00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:36.560]   Very well, I'll act as if I were not there.
[00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:37.560]   Carry on."
[00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:48.560]   And you are seeing what you are doing.
[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:54.280]   Civilization is better than the earth.
[00:40:54.280 --> 00:41:01.600]   And man is seeing tonight what his supposed dignity and capability are producing.
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:02.600]   Are you proud of it?
[00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:06.520]   That's what God's doing.
[00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:12.800]   He wants us to see the vileness, the rottenness of human nature.
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:14.880]   What produces book and word?
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:17.560]   Human nature, man.
[00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:23.760]   What produces infidelity and divorce and rape?
[00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:29.000]   Human nature in sin and degradation, rebelling against God.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.040]   This is the supposed dignity of man.
[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:33.560]   There it is revealed to us today.
[00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:39.480]   The world that rejects God proves God to be right, that human nature is rotten, it's
[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:41.760]   vile, it's putrid.
[00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:45.480]   And your papers are proclaiming it to us day by day.
[00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:50.680]   God deliberately turns away and abandons, gives us up in order that we may learn the
[00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:52.280]   truth about ourselves.
[00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:59.000]   Secondly, he does it to show his hatred of sin and his own holiness.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:03.820]   He does it to justify his own punishment of sin.
[00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:08.480]   He wants us to see why he's ever given us the Ten Commandments and the moral law and
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:10.100]   the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:15.240]   He wants us to see why he tells us that we must obey him, because if we don't, that's
[00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:16.240]   the result.
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:23.480]   He's proclaiming his holiness, his hatred, his abomination of sin.
[00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:26.120]   What else is he doing?
[00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:31.760]   Well, he is teaching us by all this, isn't he, that he normally controls the world because
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:36.760]   it is his world.
[00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:42.760]   By abandoning it occasionally, he is asserting his control.
[00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:48.080]   He gives us up, he gives us over, just for a period, in order to bring us to our senses,
[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:52.000]   in order to convince us, in order to make us see that we are completely helpless and
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:57.280]   hopeless, and vile, and utterly impotent, and can do nothing.
[00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:59.880]   And in the meantime he's asserting his holiness.
[00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:01.560]   He says he wouldn't come my way.
[00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:02.680]   You see where you're going?
[00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:07.800]   I am a holy God, be ye holy, for I am holy.
[00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:08.920]   That's what he's saying.
[00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:09.920]   What else?
[00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:23.160]   Well, he does it in order to warn us of an ultimate and of a final judgment.
[00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:34.560]   You see, these are the particular judgments of God in history, and they're all but prophecies
[00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:39.880]   of a final judgment, of a last judgment.
[00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:42.280]   God does this to mankind.
[00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:47.120]   Mankind sees the folly and returns to God, and there's a good period, but then man goes
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:48.120]   back again.
[00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:51.160]   Then there's another judgment, and they come one after the other.
[00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:57.560]   The flood, the Tower of Babel, the captivity of Egypt, the captivity of Babylon, the destruction
[00:43:57.560 --> 00:43:59.640]   of Jerusalem in A.D. 70.
[00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:01.360]   It's all in our minds these days.
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:02.360]   Why did it happen?
[00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:03.640]   God said it would happen.
[00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:07.960]   He warned those people that if they didn't obey him, that he'd even drive them out of
[00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:09.960]   their land, that their city would be sacked.
[00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:15.280]   It was all prophesied centuries before it happened, and then it happened, this fulfilled
[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:18.240]   prophecy, and it's all a punishment of sin.
[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:29.800]   But oh, my dear friends, all this is but as nothing to what will happen in the final judgment.
[00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:38.720]   Our blessed Lord himself in prophesying the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70 was clearly
[00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:44.040]   prophesying the final judgment when he'd come back to judge the world in righteousness.
[00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:45.720]   You know what's going to happen when it's this.
[00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:50.000]   There is a day coming when the end will have arrived, and the Son of God will come back
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:55.240]   to judge the whole universe, and those who have continued in rebellion against God, God
[00:44:55.240 --> 00:45:00.480]   will finally turn his back upon them, and they'll be cast into the sea of destruction.
[00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:02.080]   He'll never look at them again.
[00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:03.760]   He'll never smile upon them.
[00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:09.280]   They'll never have mercy, and they'll go on living in a living hell forever and forever
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:10.280]   and forever.
[00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:14.520]   They'll have the world they say they want, and they'll never be able to get out of it.
[00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:17.320]   That's hell.
[00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:24.680]   And God does this in order to warn us of the coming of that great and terrible day
[00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:25.680]   of judgment.
[00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:33.600]   How near it may be I don't know, but I know it's coming, and I know that Buchenwald
[00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:38.160]   and all these other horrors, and life as it's being lived today, the poor drug addicts and
[00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:44.000]   the victims of other ills and diseases, and all the unhappiness and the misery, I know
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:49.240]   that this is going to be multiplied a thousand, a million fold, and it'll go on forever and
[00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:50.240]   forever and forever.
[00:45:50.240 --> 00:46:00.160]   God will have abandoned man in sin forever, and there'll be no hope for him, no intermission.
[00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:03.280]   That's why God does this.
[00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:08.720]   And can't you see that the object of it all is an object of love?
[00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:12.880]   God wants men to see what he's doing.
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:15.720]   God is trying to awaken the human race.
[00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:19.320]   It won't listen to the gospel, it laughs at it and ridicules it.
[00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:25.720]   It makes fun of Jesus Christ and blasphemes his holy blood shed on the cross on Calvary's
[00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:26.720]   hill.
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:27.720]   It won't have anything to do with it.
[00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:28.720]   Well, do you know what happens?
[00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:37.400]   God so loves the world that he's trying to open its eyes by seeing the inferno that it's
[00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:38.400]   creating.
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:44.240]   This is God's way of calling mankind to repentance.
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:50.520]   As Paul puts it in Romans 2, "For the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance."
[00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:52.560]   Or do you remember how Peter put it?
[00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:57.080]   Peter says in his second epistle and then the third chapter that certain scoffers will
[00:46:57.080 --> 00:47:01.280]   come at the last time and say, "Where is the promise of his coming?
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:05.600]   For since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of
[00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:06.600]   the creation."
[00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:09.840]   And Peter's got his answer.
[00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:12.520]   Why does God tolerate the world as it is?
[00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:15.400]   Why hasn't he blasted it to destruction long since?
[00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:16.800]   Do you know the answer?
[00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:17.800]   Here it is.
[00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:24.080]   "The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men can slackness, but is longsuffering
[00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:30.000]   to usward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance."
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:39.440]   Can't you see that God, by allowing men to reap the consequences of his own folly
[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:45.760]   and this modern inferno, is just designed to awaken us, to make us see our wretchedness,
[00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:50.960]   our rottenness, our vileness, our hopelessness, our utter helplessness?
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:55.760]   He's awakening us, calling us to repentance, ere it be too late.
[00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:58.400]   It is God's love that allows it.
[00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:08.480]   We won't listen to his appeals, so he tries the other method, but it's all in love.
[00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:15.760]   But let me put this to you in its final and in its most glorious form.
[00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:18.600]   Why is God permitting these things to happen?
[00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:24.120]   Why is God giving mankind up to its own way of living and its own devices, and to the
[00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:27.440]   reaping of its consequences?
[00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:33.800]   I say it's not only to call us to repentance, it is to proclaim his wonderful offer of salvation
[00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:37.960]   in Jesus Christ his Son.
[00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:41.760]   Here we are, the table in front of me, bread and wine.
[00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:42.760]   What do they remind us of?
[00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:48.440]   They remind us of a cross on Calvary's hill, and the death of the Son of God.
[00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:49.440]   What was that?
[00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:50.440]   What was happening?
[00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:51.440]   Is that man?
[00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:53.400]   Well, of course, that's what they say, isn't it?
[00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:58.560]   You see, they even explain the death of the Son of God in terms of the activity of men.
[00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:02.960]   They regard Jesus Christ as a pacifist who wasn't understood, a good man who was never
[00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:05.880]   understood, good men never are, and they killed him.
[00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:08.160]   It was a great tragedy, it was a great pity.
[00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:12.000]   Oh, what utter nonsense.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   Do you know what was happening on the cross on Calvary's hill?
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.360]   It was men acting.
[00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:22.040]   It was God acting.
[00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:25.800]   And this is how Peter puts it in his sermon on the day of Pentecost, as recorded in Acts
[00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:26.800]   2.
[00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:36.240]   Him, Jesus Christ, being delivered, handed over, given up, being delivered by the predeterminate
[00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:40.800]   counsel and foreknowledge of God.
[00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:43.840]   God had planned the death on the cross before the foundation of the world.
[00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:44.840]   It was God acting.
[00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:47.200]   It's God acting on the cross.
[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:50.680]   It's the Holy God acting upon the cross.
[00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:51.920]   And do you know what he did there?
[00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:52.920]   I can tell you.
[00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:57.040]   Look at this blessed person, Jesus Christ, Son of God.
[00:49:57.040 --> 00:49:58.040]   Look at him, see his agony.
[00:49:58.040 --> 00:49:59.040]   What's the matter?
[00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:00.040]   I'll tell you what's the matter.
[00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:01.040]   God has turned away from him.
[00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:10.800]   The very thing that Stephen tells us he did with the children of Israel.
[00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:15.880]   They turned away against God, God turned away against them.
[00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:16.880]   What's happening there?
[00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:20.440]   Oh, what's happening is that God has averted his face.
[00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:23.000]   God is turning away from his own Son.
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   Why?
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:28.560]   Well, because the Son has made himself responsible for sinners and for the sin of mankind.
[00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:31.200]   God turns his face away from him.
[00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:36.800]   Not only that, he has delivered him up.
[00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:38.280]   You see, these are the steps.
[00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:40.440]   God turned away.
[00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:44.680]   God gave them up.
[00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:49.920]   God delivered them unto a reprobate mind.
[00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:51.800]   And this is the astounding thing.
[00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:54.760]   This is what I read in Romans 8, 32.
[00:50:54.760 --> 00:51:00.960]   He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all.
[00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:06.400]   Do you know it's exactly the same word as we've got in my text tonight?
[00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:11.840]   God gave up his only begotten, dearly beloved Son.
[00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:14.120]   He abandoned him.
[00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:16.680]   He just gave him up.
[00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:17.680]   What for?
[00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:22.920]   For that the full wrath of God against sin might fall upon him.
[00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:24.200]   He spared him nothing.
[00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:28.800]   He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all.
[00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:32.840]   Oh, shall he not with him freely give us all things?
[00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:36.440]   Can't you see then what God is saying?
[00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:39.200]   He's turning away at the present time.
[00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:42.280]   He's giving us up to a reprobate mind.
[00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:48.040]   He is punishing us actively in the modern Babylon.
[00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:53.640]   And he's doing it in order that he may call you to look at and to consider and to think
[00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:58.980]   of what happened to his own dearly beloved Son.
[00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:02.920]   He made him to be sin for us.
[00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:04.240]   And then he couldn't look at him.
[00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:06.800]   He turned away from him.
[00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:07.800]   He gave him up.
[00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:09.880]   He didn't spare him anything.
[00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:11.720]   He left him to himself.
[00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:17.560]   And so the Son cries out in his agony, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
[00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:18.560]   Why have you given me up?
[00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:19.560]   Why have you turned away?
[00:52:19.560 --> 00:52:20.560]   I can't find him."
[00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:31.800]   God punished him for our sin.
[00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:41.920]   He did to him there the three things that he always does to sin, invariably.
[00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:46.840]   And there he has done it once and forever in order that he might turn to you tonight
[00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:52.840]   and to say this, "If you realize that you rebelled against me and that I'm going to
[00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:58.320]   turn my face against you through eternity and abandon you and give you up and leave
[00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:04.120]   you to yourself and to your hell and receive the punishment you so richly deserve, if you
[00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:11.360]   realize that and turn to me and acknowledge and confess your sin and repent of it, I'll
[00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:15.680]   tell you something.
[00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:25.760]   I've already done all that to my only begotten dearly beloved Son for you.
[00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:35.880]   He's suffered it all to the last dreg in order that you might never experience it.
[00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:38.160]   Come unto me.
[00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:39.160]   Look unto me.
[00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:40.920]   I'm looking to you.
[00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:43.120]   I've set my affection upon you.
[00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:46.200]   I'm turning towards you.
[00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:48.760]   Turn you to me.
[00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:52.920]   Look unto me and be ye saved.
[00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:55.160]   All the ends of the earth.
[00:53:55.160 --> 00:54:01.320]   Can't you see, my dear friend, that the God whose gospel of love you've refused is speaking
[00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:06.040]   to you through modern events, through modern history, through the agony of the modern world,
[00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:10.040]   through wars and pestilences and all the horror of it all?
[00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:15.280]   He's calling you to repentance.
[00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:22.760]   And he's telling you that having done these three things to his only Son, he is looking
[00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:24.840]   at you again.
[00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:27.000]   He's turning to you.
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:31.920]   He wants to take you up, to make you anew, not only to forgive you but to give you a
[00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:39.880]   new heart, a new nature, a new life and shower his blessings upon you and in the glory that
[00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:49.240]   is to come, receive you unto himself where you will enjoy and bask in the sunshine of
[00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:54.000]   his face forever and forever.
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:59.440]   My friend, you, we all, have turned from God.
[00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:03.280]   He has turned from us.
[00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:10.280]   Turn back to him tonight and you will find that he's turned to you before you ever thought
[00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:12.720]   of turning to him.
[00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:14.280]   Turn ye.
[00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:15.720]   Turn ye.
[00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:18.080]   Why should you be destroyed?
[00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:24.760]   Why should you go to an eternity of the modern world but infinitely worse?
[00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:31.800]   See the rottenness, the vileness, the hopelessness, the helplessness of the supposed dignity of
[00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:32.800]   man.
[00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:33.800]   Repent.
[00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:45.600]   Believe the gospel and you will find in it all you will ever need and infinitely more.
[00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:52.080]   There, it seems to me, is the philosophy of history as taught by the martyr Stephen to
[00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:54.280]   the members of the Larned Sanhedrin.
[00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:57.840]   They were blind to it, they couldn't see it and they put him to death.
[00:55:57.840 --> 00:56:02.800]   My dear friend, are you able to read the signs of the times?
[00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:06.080]   Are you seeing what God is doing in the modern world?
[00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:11.440]   Can you hear him speaking to you through these walls and alarms and taverns?
[00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:15.880]   He's calling you to repentance.
[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:24.960]   Ere it be too late, it isn't too late yet, the door of grace is still open, the day of
[00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:30.480]   grace is still here, why should you perish?
[00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:55.720]   Repent, believe the word of God concerning Jesus Christ, the Savior of the world.
[00:56:55.720 --> 00:57:21.960]   Amen.
[00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:31.960]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
