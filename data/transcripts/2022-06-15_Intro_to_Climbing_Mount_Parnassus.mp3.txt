[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.480]   Anyone setting out to defend what Albert J. Nock once called "the grand old fortifying
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:13.400]   classical curriculum" (essentially Greek and Latin) does so knowing that he flies the
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.520]   tattered flag of a lost cause.
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:23.400]   Surrender to the victors has already been signed, the army dispersed, the guns are silent.
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.040]   That day is done.
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.460]   Why in the age of the internet and the global economy dwell upon the words and deeds of
[00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.360]   people long dead who spoke and wrote in tongues equally dead?
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:40.120]   Surely education should help us to enjoy our fair share of bread and circuses.
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.960]   Education should help us to get things.
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.920]   It's about the future.
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.200]   A recent American president, after all, made much ado about "building bridges to the
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.800]   twenty-first century."
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.160]   We had best be crossing.
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:00.060]   But the happy bands of those who fend for classical education, along with other tilters
[00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.140]   at windmills, are not so easily daunted.
[00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.300]   They would make a last stand for the barricades.
[00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:13.460]   They have wandered as exiles in occupied territory, but the land is worth fighting for even if
[00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.860]   the battle should yield but a few paces.
[00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.300]   Ralph Waldo Emerson once chided the brashness of a lost cause like this one.
[00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.620]   I proffer to him my apologies.
[00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:31.620]   "It is ominous," he wrote, "that this word education has so cold, so hopeless a
[00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:32.620]   sound.
[00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:40.420]   A treatise on education, a convention on education, affects us with slight paralysis and a certain
[00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.540]   yawning of the jaws."
[00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:49.300]   Ominous indeed, for ponderous books on education proliferate and provide what one historian
[00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.500]   has called a "dismal consolation to the misanthrope."
[00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:02.420]   We ought to cast a caustic eye on such trickery, for the utopian promises what he cannot deliver.
[00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.080]   Beware the man with a new truth to preach.
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:11.580]   He bids to do our thinking for us, better, in the words of Auden, "to read the New Yorker,
[00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.140]   trust in God, and take short views."
[00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.740]   The American soil is not naturally fertile for classics.
[00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.780]   The seed falls on hard clay.
[00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.280]   As another man of letters told us nearly eighty years ago, we as a nation possess "a weakness
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:35.180]   for new gospels, a vital but hazardous trait, as we stand in danger of discarding both the
[00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.080]   good and useful in a quest for the dubious and untried."
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:46.100]   We reconfigure our lives daily, we pride ourselves on our capacity to reach far and entertain
[00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:52.720]   the fantastic idea, and we think of ourselves more as "doers" than as thinkers.
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.880]   While others waxed about going to the moon, we went.
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.000]   We are forever on the move.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.900]   But this restless drive which we Americans are wont to think unique to us also fuels
[00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:11.720]   the rest of the frenetic modern world, particularly in the West where, despite some multiculturalists'
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.560]   claims, our civilization supplies the model most peoples around the globe wish to emulate.
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.360]   We spell "PROGRESS" with a capital.
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.580]   Here the news is always better, the old worse.
[00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.720]   The new is always rich and relevant, the old threadbare and obsolete.
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:35.400]   Ours is the "shining city on a hill" in John Winthrop's memorable coinage, a city
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.720]   that could begin afresh because it had no past.
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.600]   We could start from scratch and travel lightly.
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:50.560]   Yet, having crossed the threshold of a millennium, we feel a few spiritual tremors.
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.340]   Impetuosity does not reflect.
[00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.120]   The superannuated, ever-changing mind cannot speak to the whole of life.
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.360]   It cannot contemplate.
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.360]   It cannot assign value.
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.920]   It can drive us to build new roads and bridges, but it cannot explain where we want to go.
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.400]   It can build rockets to Mars and beyond, but it cannot tell us whether it's wise to go
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.400]   there.
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.820]   It cannot answer questions it long ago lost the wisdom to ask.
[00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:24.320]   The life of the mind and soul it leaves bereft of standards, those talking points of judgment
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.660]   which are acquired only with time and patient effort.
[00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.900]   We appeal to the freakish in witless arts and entertainment.
[00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:38.320]   To serve the boring or the bored is not always clear, leading inexorably to the shocking
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.800]   that melts into a monotonous vulgarity in the public square.
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.360]   Even shock cannot shock indefinitely.
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.160]   Intellectuals are not immune.
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.120]   Scratch a believer in bold new ideas and find a slave to fashion, proving the adage that
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.440]   the newest is always the most quickly dated, whether it come from Madison Avenue or the
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.560]   Modern Language Association.
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.800]   Nor is our political life unaffected.
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:13.440]   We call for candidates with new ideas, votaries to a perpetually malleable future.
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.120]   Here is the spirit of El Dorado, the hope that riches and salvation wait around the
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.480]   next bend in the road.
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.280]   Old gospels lack the beckoning allure of the road not taken.
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:32.120]   But like explorers in the desert ever prone to mirage, we have had, along with remarkable
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:39.660]   discoveries, a few false sightings, and we are beginning to sense a certain lack of point
[00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.680]   and permanence in modern life.
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.680]   The new gospels have certainly delivered, but they have not saved.
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:53.680]   Education, that vague and official word for what goes on in our schools, has also been
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:59.040]   a trinket on the shelves of snake oil salesmen and a plaything for social planners in America
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.320]   for well over a century.
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:07.320]   They too have been driven by the spirit of ceaseless innovation, and we have paid a high
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:08.760]   price.
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:14.100]   The peddlers have shrouded the high and subtler goals of learning which former generations
[00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.720]   accepted and promoted.
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:24.200]   These bringers of the new have traded in the ancient ideal of wisdom for a spurious adjustment
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:30.280]   of mind, settling for fitting us with the most menial of skills needful for the world
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.880]   of the interchangeable part.
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:39.480]   They have decided we are less, not more, than wiser people have hoped humanity might become.
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:47.300]   We are masses to be housed and fed, not minds and souls seeking something beyond ourselves.
[00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:54.440]   Ask anyone today, for instance, to identify the aims of a "liberal education" and expect
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.920]   a long pause.
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:02.880]   Everett Dean Martin, he who informed us of our predilection for new gospels, wrote a
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:07.720]   book in 1926 titled The Meaning of a Liberal Education.
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:13.200]   And in 1973, another scholar produced The Uses of a Liberal Education.
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:18.280]   We might detect in the latter title a falling away from an older ideal.
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:22.760]   Instead of seeking to discern what a liberal education can bring to us, we now ask what
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.680]   we can get out of it.
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.860]   There's a difference.
[00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:32.500]   And the benefits accrued do not exist, apparently, if they cannot be measured, and measured by
[00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:38.120]   tools calibrated by craftsmen out to replicate themselves.
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:41.040]   Standards require standard makers.
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:47.040]   Nonetheless, on the face of it at least, the question of use is a fair one.
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:53.080]   Philosopher Alfred North Whitehead reminded us that any education not useful is wasted.
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:59.120]   An education, he said, must be useful because understanding is useful.
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.940]   But what must we understand?
[00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:06.840]   If education must be useful, what uses are to be served?
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:12.820]   And more importantly, are there differing kinds of use we should acknowledge?
[00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:19.200]   The modern mind, schooled to be practical, stands ill-prepared to wrestle with these
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:23.640]   questions because they are, at bottom, philosophical ones.
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:30.520]   Our practicality has, ironically, rendered us incapable of answering them.
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:37.200]   So, while thinking ourselves a knowing and enlightened lot, we stand deaf to our own
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.960]   ignorance, which has become a white noise.
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:46.640]   Gilded degrees hanging on our walls bear witness to our certified smarts.
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:49.280]   But we have stood Socrates on his head.
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:54.440]   Whereas the only thing that sage Athenian knew was that he knew nothing, the only thing
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:09:01.760]   we don't know, and with far thinner credentials it would seem, is that we know so very little.
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:07.200]   He knows nothing and he thinks he knows everything, George Bernard Shaw put it.
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:10.780]   That points clearly to a political career.
[00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:16.080]   We do not know, in other words, what more reflective ages have deemed the important
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.080]   things.
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:20.840]   And we don't know them because they have not been taught us.
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:27.320]   Our gentle prods to our self-esteem have spurred us to consult only our own druthers in deciding
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:29.280]   what is worth knowing.
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:34.560]   We have adopted the leveling assumptions we've inherited, whatever works for you, and fed
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:40.260]   off intellectual capital earned by others who, we presume, have already done the hard
[00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:41.960]   thinking for us.
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:48.240]   We pride ourselves on self-reliance while following uncritically the roadmaps of others.
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:54.600]   For an independently skeptical people, we ask few questions.
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:59.400]   Milton once wrote that the reform of education is one of the greatest and noblest designs
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:04.280]   that can be thought on, and many have been drawn to the drafting table as willing architects
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.040]   of the future.
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:12.220]   Within this workshop we have hammered out our highest aspirations and ideals.
[00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:17.140]   Yet few pursuits, however noble, promise so little.
[00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:23.160]   The wares are cheap, their shiny surfaces a veneer hiding shoddy work.
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:27.880]   As with most gospels, Martin observed, we are in such a hurry to save souls that we
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:32.280]   would begin proclaiming the new salvation to the nation before pausing to find out what
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:34.560]   education is.
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:41.820]   Unable to explain what education is or is for, we have created state departments of
[00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:48.760]   education out of a desperate hope that what we have not had the wisdom and intellectual
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:54.100]   fortitude to determine in the light of day might emerge miraculously from a flurry of
[00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:59.440]   committee reports, public opinion polls, and bureaucratic fiat.
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:06.520]   So to pen and read, still another tract such as this runs counter to that hope and makes
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:08.820]   for dreary work.
[00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:13.400]   We should shrink from more gospels, further means of deliverance from a predicament we
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:18.680]   do not fully understand, especially when the search is likely to prove less than edifying
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:22.680]   and close on unresolved chords.
[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.440]   I do not intend to offer a new gospel.
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:31.160]   Instead, I hope to direct our gaze behind us so that we may more securely find our footing
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.300]   on the road ahead.
[00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:41.280]   If in fact the past is prologue, it is only the past that can instruct and guide us.
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:47.500]   The present is too close, and the future is but a haze of possibilities and dreams.
[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:53.120]   The future does not yet belong to us.
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:56.640]   We do not lack defenses of traditional education.
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:58.500]   Disquisitions abound.
[00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:01.920]   They offer comfort and guidance to the seeking few.
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:07.320]   Alan Bloom's The Closing of the American Mind set off a radioactive buzz in the late
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:12.000]   1980s, with sales no doubt astounding author and publisher alike.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:18.920]   It was an unlikely bestseller, at once a philosophical excursion and a gripe against a noisy, tawdry
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:19.920]   world.
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:21.560]   But we don't know who read the book.
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:25.960]   It was enough for many simply to buy it and add their voices to the swelling chorus of
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:31.440]   those suspecting a decline in the intellectual quality not only of educated people, but also
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:34.320]   of the world they plan and steer.
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:39.920]   Its presence on the coffee table advertised one's disquiet, becoming for a moment a badge
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:41.760]   of intellectual chic.
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:42.760]   E.D.
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:47.800]   Hirsch's Cultural Literacy described the paucity of hard information today's high
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:54.120]   school graduates are likely to know and to be taught about history, science, and literature.
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:59.440]   Illiterate and semi-literate Americans are condemned not only to poverty, Hirsch wrote,
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:02.880]   but also to the powerlessness of incomprehension.
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:08.480]   Knowing that they do not understand the issues and feeling prey to manipulative oversimplifications,
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:12.400]   they do not trust the system of which they are supposed to be the masters.
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:17.360]   They do not feel themselves to be active participants in our republic, and they often do not turn
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:18.360]   out to vote.
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:24.640]   And of course, for better or worse, many do turn out to vote.
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:27.480]   What we don't know can hurt us.
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:32.800]   With the blitzing of these two books, we began to talk openly not only about 15-year-olds
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:37.360]   who cannot identify the order of American presidents since Franklin Roosevelt, or the
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:41.880]   century in which the American Civil War was fought, but also about 18-year-olds who cannot
[00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:45.720]   read even with ground-level competence.
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:52.200]   Granting that the world has yet to see a golden age in education, we began to ask, what exactly
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.980]   are they doing in those schools?
[00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:56.560]   And why do our schools and colleges graduates
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:05.440]   so smart and promising in so many ways, not seem to know, really know anything of substance?
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:08.840]   They're heavy on proudly held opinions.
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:14.000]   Opinions are always in abundant supply, but light on knowledge.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.760]   Is this, we wondered, the best we can do?
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:20.960]   This we can say.
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:26.160]   Publicly funded ignorance began to seem a positive liability.
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:31.180]   It became the family lunatic we finally consented to bring up in mixed company.
[00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:33.680]   But these books did another salutary thing.
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:38.000]   They directed us to question the uses of the tools at our disposal.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.400]   On the one hand, there is the skill needed to use the proverbial wrench properly and
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:43.680]   efficiently.
[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:49.120]   On the other, the judgment required to use it for right and good purposes.
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:54.560]   Bloom and Hirsch drew us back to fundamentals, throwing light not only on what ought to be
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:15:00.680]   taught in our schools and universities, but on goals, on the kind of citizens we wish
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:05.200]   to create and the kind of polity we wish to engender.
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:09.200]   For education is never neutral.
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:14.640]   Embedded within any course of study lie assumptions about what people ought to know and about
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:16.840]   human nature itself.
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:21.440]   Are we man or machine?
[00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:27.920]   Education is, in the end, an auxiliary of philosophy, an embodiment of aims and ideals.
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:32.840]   It was therefore fruitless for President Clinton to demand that politics stop at the schoolhouse
[00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:34.160]   door.
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:41.440]   Perhaps politics cannot stop there, because philosophy and idealism cannot stop there.
[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:44.640]   And the anxiety spreads.
[00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:51.360]   With each new bit of bad news issued from think tanks and blue-ribbon commissions, the
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:57.360]   same dramatis personae pound out newspaper and magazine commentaries, taking to cable
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:04.120]   talk programs to spout their views and entertain rejoinders from viewers across the country,
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:08.800]   usually with no one understanding the essential matters at stake.
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:14.760]   Watching cable call-in programs is like listening to the desperate yapping of thousands mesmerized
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:17.640]   by the sounds of their own voices.
[00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:23.360]   Back in the mid-1980s, a National Commission on Excellence in Education, an instance of
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:29.440]   grandiloquent dubbing, released a study called "A Nation at Risk," which contended that
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:34.760]   "if an unfriendly foreign power had attempted to impose on America the mediocre educational
[00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:39.400]   performance that exists today, we might have viewed it as an act of war.
[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:42.560]   As it stands, we have allowed this to happen to ourselves.
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:50.600]   We have, in effect, been committing an act of unthinking unilateral educational disarmament."
[00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:55.200]   Whatever the nature of our troubles may be, they are deeply rooted.
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:17:00.360]   But a backward glance at history reveals that we have been here before.
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:05.120]   Nor are our troubles confined to our shores.
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:12.360]   Sir Richard Livingston, once president of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, wrote in 1944
[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:16.120]   on the ferment in England for reform in education.
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:21.080]   The worries were many, he wrote, including the "obvious and increasing importance of
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:26.840]   knowledge to life, a sense of the great possibilities of modern civilization and of its disorders
[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:32.220]   and dangers, the perception that our democracy is very ill-educated, a realization that in
[00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:38.640]   foreign politics between 1919 and 1939 we threw away a great victory with a rapidity
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:43.240]   and completeness perhaps unexampled in history, and that this has been partly due to political
[00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:48.400]   ignorance and the need of extending education if equality of opportunity is to be more than
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.400]   a phrase."
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:54.300]   The parallels to our own day suggest themselves.
[00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:56.280]   But they go further.
[00:17:56.280 --> 00:18:01.280]   Livingston added that the interest given to education in his time was "political and
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:04.480]   social rather than educational."
[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:08.880]   Such interest was, in other words, not intellectual.
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:12.440]   It was not about the mind.
[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:17.280]   Much the same may be said of contemporary schemes to "reform our schools," whether
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:20.700]   inspired by the left or right.
[00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:23.120]   Politics has come with a vengeance.
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:30.240]   But the modern political impulse, the outraged mania for incessant, stupid interference,
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:34.760]   has little to do with intellectual formation and higher aims.
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:40.000]   Those dealing the thrusts and jabs today do not seem fit with the calm, disinterested
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.920]   intelligence distinguishing those of true philosophical temperament.
[00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:47.160]   Battles rage out there.
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:52.180]   Partisans angle provocatively to "empower" hitherto neglected groups, but the struggle
[00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:59.040]   has become a play for power, not a sober philosophical or cultural inquiry.
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:05.680]   Whatever be the relative merits of these labors, we must not fail to note that markedly less
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:12.480]   light is now thrown on matters of actual learning, how students' minds will be altered, formed,
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:16.520]   and filled, and their abilities to think enhanced.
[00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:21.120]   This is modern short-sightedness at its most vexatious.
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:27.080]   The intoxication of politics has poisoned the debate, making it narrow, strained, and
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:31.080]   fraught with hazards to disputants' reputations.
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:38.440]   Dissent carries a high price, especially in the age of the open mind.
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:42.800]   But we are still dogged by a practical question.
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:50.120]   Why do our schools and universities seem to accomplish so little for individual minds?
[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:54.860]   One answer is that instead of doing a few things well, we have tried to do many things
[00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:56.840]   and have done them badly.
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:03.200]   We have striven, historian Jacques Barzun has written, "to make ideal citizens, super-tolerant
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:08.880]   neighbors, agents of world peace and happy family folk at once sexually adept and flawless
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:11.160]   drivers of cars."
[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:16.200]   Our schools have been a place where high hopes have gone to die.
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:23.780]   Education is the tabula rasa on which we inscribe all our social desires and expectations.
[00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:29.520]   But Isocrates, a Greek rhetorician of the fourth century BC, got it right.
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:34.480]   "If all who were engaged in the profession of education," he wrote, "were willing
[00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:39.440]   to state the facts instead of making greater promises than they can possibly fulfill, they
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:43.600]   would not be in such bad repute with the lay public."
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:48.820]   Many centuries later, a tale that ought to serve as an object lesson for today's evangelists
[00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:55.880]   for the new age in education, a German reformer out to amend the crusty old classical curriculum
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:21:00.600]   was eventually thrown into prison and released only after confessing that he could not deliver
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:04.520]   what he had promised, for he had promised too much.
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:06.040]   The Latin stayed.
[00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:10.480]   "Forget education," Barzun has written, clearing the board.
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:15.180]   "Education is a result, a slow growth and hard to judge.
[00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:21.760]   Let us talk rather about teaching and learning, a joint activity that can be provided for,
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:25.320]   though as a nation we have lost the knack of it."
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:28.180]   We have lost the knack of it as a culture too.
[00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:33.920]   We must limit our promises and rein in our expectations.
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:37.920]   But first, we must define our ideals.
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:43.600]   We need to describe the ideal type of human being we wish to see around us.
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:49.960]   Do we wish merely to produce better skilled, smoothly cut cogs in the elaborate machine
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:53.360]   we now call the global economy?
[00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:59.080]   Have we finally determined that super tolerant neighbors and sexually adept, flawless drivers
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:01.500]   are all we can hope to be?
[00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:08.480]   Is this the juncture to which 3,000 years of civilized life have brought us?
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:14.080]   Somehow we think not, and we sense that the ideals adopted from the previous couple of
[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:20.200]   generations stand pale when compared to those of other ages.
[00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:23.760]   History and literature rebuke our self-sufficiency.
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:26.760]   That's one reason why we ought to study them.
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:32.600]   It's not so much that people of olden times were the finest exemplars of higher humanity,
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:39.360]   for they too fell short of their ideals, as must all who aspire to higher things.
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:41.960]   That's what ideals are for.
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:48.000]   It's that we have abandoned those ideals once animating our civilization, refusing
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.800]   to learn them anew with each generation.
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:54.400]   We have assumed their transfer to be automatic.
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:23:00.200]   We have not indeed jettisoned the hope and drive that keep us working for a better world.
[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:01.560]   That's the good news.
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:06.720]   But we have forgotten to cultivate ourselves as individuals.
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:09.560]   We drive by autopilot.
[00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:14.380]   We measure our gross national product, but we are left with a hunch that getting and
[00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:20.200]   spending don't quite make for the fuller life we read about, and fear exists somewhere
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:24.000]   beyond our avarice and ennui.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:30.600]   So we live in an era propitious for a reignited conversation not only about pedagogical methods
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:36.300]   – those quotidian details of teaching and learning – but also about the aims those
[00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:38.320]   methods serve.
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:43.960]   We need to ask first questions, and we need to answer them without political posturing
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:50.640]   – perhaps a Herculean task in a politically charged age.
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:58.400]   We need to freshen our vision, and at least momentarily put our modernity aside and try
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:01.400]   to see the world as others have seen it.
[00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:04.840]   We must try to transcend ourselves.
[00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:10.660]   We are not compelled in doing so to reject modern concerns, but simply to view them with
[00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:11.960]   new eyes.
[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:12.960]   G.K.
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:18.780]   Chesterton once said that there are two ways of getting home, and one of them is never
[00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:20.640]   to have left.
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:23.880]   That last path is shut to us.
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:25.640]   We have strayed too far.
[00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:31.420]   We must circumnavigate the entire world until we arrive where we started, and, as T.S.
[00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:35.520]   Eliot wrote, "know the place for the first time."
[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:39.480]   We need to shore up our foundations.
[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:42.840]   Il faut cultiver notre jardin.
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:47.560]   But I have gone further than I am fit to go, for this is not a case for educational reform
[00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:49.720]   of the garden variety.
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:51.560]   We need sway no public officials.
[00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:55.480]   I have happily abandoned hope for change in that sphere.
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:25:02.960]   Yet we can lengthen our prospect, broaden our view, and clear a path back home.
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:10.280]   We need simply to recommit ourselves individually to a rich and humane heritage long neglected,
[00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:17.520]   the effects of which neglect appear in a diminished, if not impoverished, intellectual and cultural
[00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:18.860]   life.
[00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:24.160]   This is not to be another tiresome case for "educational standards," merely confirming
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:28.320]   assumptions of the intelligentsia about what must be known.
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:30.720]   Let them crunch numbers as they may.
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:37.520]   We must ask not only what ought to be known by educated people, but, given what can be
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:46.000]   known, what should be taught in our schools, and what left to acquire outside school doors.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.120]   It's of paramount importance, for example, whether vocational courses like computer training
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:56.960]   or lifestyle courses like driver's ed and home economics should be placed on par with
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:04.240]   the "purer" (because cultural or theoretical) subjects like French and physics.
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:10.000]   Given the world's fixation on technology and all things financially gainful, that grand
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:16.880]   old fortifying classical curriculum requires not an uncritical re-adoption (of which there's
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:24.240]   no chance anyway), but a sympathetic reappraisal, if for no other reason than that so many men
[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:29.440]   and women of centuries past, who established and refined the standards by which we live
[00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:34.160]   today, held that gem in such high esteem.
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:39.720]   Thus can we regain some sense of history and our place along its timeline.
[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:46.560]   Gratitude, according to Chesterton, is the "truest sign of happiness in individuals."
[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:54.200]   A safe corollary seems, then, to be that a happier society would feel a debt to the past
[00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:59.560]   and its treasures, and this debt would be paid gladly by those taught in the ways of
[00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:02.720]   respect and humility.
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:08.660]   For those without respect and humility stand to these riches as those without a knowledge
[00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:14.180]   of geometry once stood before the gates of Plato's Academy.
[00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:16.660]   They are forever excluded.
[00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:24.140]   Such respect, if not always such humility, classical education fostered for centuries.
[00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:30.200]   It lent an anchoring to intellectual life and provided all educated people, as we now
[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:34.540]   say, with a common set of references.
[00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:39.800]   Or to switch metaphors, it placed a true north on our cultural compass.
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:42.660]   It maintained a horizon.
[00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:45.140]   We could see where we were.
[00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:51.120]   But before we trudge forward, let's clarify a few key words and terms.
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:55.200]   Just what is classical education nowadays?
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:28:02.880]   We find that, in an uninstructed age, the old regimen needs not only defending but also
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:04.560]   defining.
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:09.920]   Once classical education pointed to an elite course of instruction based upon Greek and
[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:14.040]   Latin, the two great languages of the classical world.
[00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:18.960]   But it also delved into the history, philosophy, literature, and art of the Greek and Roman
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:24.840]   worlds, affording over time to the more perspicacious devotees a remarkably high degree of cultural
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:30.200]   understanding, an understanding that endured and marked the learner for life.
[00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:33.400]   Classical education was classical immersion.
[00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:37.280]   Students in the great and exclusive public schools of England were once made to learn
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:42.500]   far more about the archons of Greek city-states and emperors of Rome, and commit to memory
[00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:47.920]   far more lines of Greek and Roman poetry and drama, than they ever had to learn about Tudors
[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:51.400]   and Stuarts, about Chaucer and Shakespeare.
[00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:54.360]   But the languages never took second seat.
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:29:00.320]   Mastering them came first, and doing so became the crowning achievement of a classical education.
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:01.820]   Why?
[00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:06.940]   Because knowledge and information were not quite enough.
[00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:10.740]   Classical education did not set itself to instilling knowledge alone.
[00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:16.040]   It also sought to polish and refine, and neither rigor nor beauty in one's use of language
[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:18.880]   obtained firmly without Greek and Latin.
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:24.480]   Together, they provided both a mental gymnastic and a training in taste.
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:27.680]   Today we use the term licentiously.
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:34.520]   We apply "classic" or "classical" to anything we believe to be excellent and universal.
[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:36.840]   Once I was asked my field of study.
[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:44.240]   "Classics," I replied, to which my interlocutor responded, "Oh, you mean Dickens, Melville,
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:45.240]   and all that?"
[00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:49.160]   A response common and understandable now.
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:55.080]   Sic semper verbis, also the field of classics, while still signifying the old meaning, Greek
[00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:59.840]   and Latin, to most of the intellectually inclined, has been extended to embrace a study of the
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:05.000]   classical world innocent of the languages, a sense we readily recognize in university
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:10.920]   course catalogs as "classical civ" and "classical literature," both customarily
[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:15.500]   indicating often fine courses of readings in translation.
[00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:17.200]   The chains have loosened.
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:21.800]   Thus, nowadays, may classical education refer to something not linked to the classical world
[00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:26.200]   at all, never mind the languages, and get equated with what might once have been called
[00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:29.840]   simply traditional or orthodox education.
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:34.880]   This is schooling based on "classics," on books of the great tradition, an education
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:38.560]   that serves to inform us of the best works of our civilization and to provide us with
[00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:42.580]   models for spotting ethical and aesthetic norms.
[00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:47.880]   These two functions the valuable "great books" programs try to perform.
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:52.280]   Used in this way, classical education describes the quest for what has also been called a
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:58.560]   liberal education, or, more particularly, an education in the humanities.
[00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:03.440]   And now, legions of well-intending homeschoolers rush to put dibs on the term and bask in the
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:06.040]   light of the glory they believe it to exude.
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:10.400]   To many homeschoolers, "classical education" simply means the opposite of whatever is going
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:13.020]   on in those dreaded public schools.
[00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:14.600]   We can sympathize with them.
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:19.160]   I will only say to all these good people that extending "classical" to mark an approach
[00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:23.720]   or course of study without reference to Greek and Latin seems an unnecessarily promiscuous
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:24.920]   usage.
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:27.440]   But I'm afraid we're stuck with it.
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:31.840]   Here I trust that the reader will allow me the archaism of reverting to the older definition
[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:38.040]   of "classical education" as a curriculum grounded upon, if not strictly limited to,
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:42.720]   Greek, Latin, and the study of the civilization from which they arose.
[00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:47.480]   For though my allies have appropriated the term for good purposes, I can find no other
[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:51.360]   agenda that carries the weight of classical study as does "classics," the pursuit
[00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:55.760]   of which results, if we're lucky, in a "classical education."
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:32:00.320]   To use any other term would also break my rule of respecting the past, not to mention
[00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:06.040]   causing a semantic severance with generations of men and women who use the term quite differently
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:08.800]   and, I think, more accurately.
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:12.280]   I'll stick to the antique ways.
[00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:18.680]   Mount Parnassus, a limestone mass hovering over the ancient shrine of Delphi, has stood
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:24.640]   as a prime symbol of poetic inspiration and perfection since the dawn of the West.
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:28.040]   It fixed anxious eyes on the heavens.
[00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:34.360]   The Castalian Spring, being a sacred source of life-sustaining water, trickled far below.
[00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:38.400]   The hushed tones of ritual echoed from its slopes.
[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:44.480]   And over time, it came to embody those things which man, at his best, wishes, and ought
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:46.960]   to wish, to achieve.
[00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:51.160]   It became a sign of his better, divinely inspired self.
[00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:58.920]   To climb Parnassus was to strive after the favor of Apollo and the nine muses Calliope,
[00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:07.640]   Erato, Cleo, Euterpe, Melpomene, Polymnia, Thalia, Terpiscari, Urania, ensconced up there
[00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:09.720]   forever unseen.
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:15.800]   While representing the unattainable for most pilgrims, Parnassus also pointed to those
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:24.000]   treasures bestowed by the muses upon the faithful and diligent ones who wait and work.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:31.040]   And among those gifts most sought was the civilizing, cultivating boon of eloquence,
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:34.320]   of right and beautiful expression.
[00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:40.040]   Throughout the centuries to come, this forbidding image got lifted from its geographical and
[00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:46.160]   mythological settings to be transposed, in the wake of Renaissance humanism, as an emblem
[00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:49.000]   of linguistic flair.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:54.680]   Climbing Parnassus eventually became a code for the painfully glorious exertions of Greek
[00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:56.440]   and Latin.
[00:33:56.440 --> 00:34:02.640]   The hard, precipitous path of classical education ideally led not to knowledge alone, but to
[00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:06.200]   the cultivation of mind and spirit.
[00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:10.960]   Knowledge did not, in and of itself, justify the sweat.
[00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:16.360]   The climb was meant to transform one's intellectual and aesthetic nature as well.
[00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:21.160]   The classical course held sway over the Western mind for centuries, right up until three or
[00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:23.240]   four generations ago.
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:26.720]   Much of our intellectual history from the Dark Ages through the Renaissance and on to
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:33.240]   the modern world witnessed the assiduous spadework of clerics and lay scholars alike reaching
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:39.560]   back to the ancient world to retrieve, preserve, and propagate the wealth of learning and experience
[00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:41.080]   it held.
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:45.000]   And the classical languages enshrining that wealth had to be taught.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:50.120]   Thus, a classical education was the queen of all scholastic endeavors.
[00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:53.640]   It constituted the original humanities curriculum.
[00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:59.800]   Whatever hodgepodge of diverse and disconnected topics humanistic studies have become, their
[00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:05.560]   emaciated children now simply called "the humanities," they were once, first and last,
[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:12.480]   a prolonged inquiry into Greek and Roman achievements in literature, history, thought, and art.
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:16.360]   That path, as I hope to show, is still a valid one to tread.
[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:20.040]   Yet this too we must admit all these centuries later.
[00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:25.520]   Classical claims, while bolstered by tradition and intellectual coherence alike, cannot be
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:28.120]   advanced with proof.
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:31.140]   They are not the stuff of Venn diagrams.
[00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:33.520]   We cannot cash them at a bank.
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:37.880]   A classical education is different in kind to the training of a technician, where the
[00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:41.880]   trained man demonstrates his training with a testable skill.
[00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:48.200]   This, we may say, is training in the narrow sense, not an education.
[00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:53.720]   But many people today, without admitting it, prefer training to education, and they must
[00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:56.080]   have their heart's desire.
[00:35:56.080 --> 00:36:01.320]   Much of the value of classics we must take on the witness of mellowed experience.
[00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:05.880]   Arguing this case now is partly an impressionistic exercise.
[00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:07.320]   It always has been.
[00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:13.040]   A firm knowledge of the classical languages, history, and culture will not of itself create
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:14.080]   virtue.
[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:18.320]   It cannot shine a light into corners we have elected to keep dark, nor into those that
[00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:20.840]   cannot be illumined.
[00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:26.740]   But this knowledge can form the mind and light a path to understanding.
[00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:31.560]   For it is noble to rediscover and attend to the voices of the past.
[00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:38.620]   We ignore them to our peril and to the peril of all those whom we would presume to teach.
[00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:46.260]   Without a finely tuned and oft-nourished sense of the past, both near and distant, we have
[00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:49.440]   no culture.
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:51.860]   And immediately we are thrown into another thicket.
[00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:57.060]   What do we mean by these mushy words "culture" and "cultural"?
[00:36:57.060 --> 00:37:02.220]   This ubiquitous idea, too, requires clarifying, and maybe a little fumigating.
[00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:07.060]   I do not use these words exclusively as we hear them bandied about by many who rant from
[00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:12.500]   the ranks of the politically concerned when discussing ethnicity and multiculturalism.
[00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:16.820]   That is, merely to describe group identities.
[00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:19.460]   Everyone has a "culture" now.
[00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:26.480]   We have African-American culture, Hispanic culture, corporate culture, youth culture.
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:30.540]   This use of the word hails from the halls of anthropology.
[00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:32.580]   If only there it had stayed.
[00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:37.380]   But it slithered forth from the laboratory to infect us all.
[00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:42.580]   From the anthropologists, Barzun has explained, the public picked up the word "culture"
[00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:48.100]   in this overarching meaning and then proceeded to reapply it for various purposes.
[00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:54.420]   For example, the artist is "conditioned by his culture," meaning social circumstances.
[00:37:54.420 --> 00:38:00.220]   He also fights against his culture, meaning certain beliefs and mores.
[00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:07.300]   Culture was a word hot for serving up on a steaming platter to the over-degreed and half-educated.
[00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:13.300]   It not only exfoliates before our eyes, it excuses ignorance and inoculates the ignorant
[00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:18.080]   from any responsibility to know anything beyond their kith and kin.
[00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:20.500]   Culture now makes neurotics.
[00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:22.740]   They are the ones who can't fight back.
[00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:28.000]   Not long after such twists and turns, the term "culture" began to split like an atom,
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.780]   and we have had to cope with the two cultures, the counterculture, ethnic culture, and any
[00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:35.280]   number of subcultures.
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:40.660]   Culture now is any chunk of social reality you like or dislike.
[00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:47.980]   Occasionally I use it in this its sociological sense, though I trust rarely enough and judiciously.
[00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:52.780]   While I do not eschew this newer sense of the word entirely, I wish to restore the older
[00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:56.400]   parlance to a place in our social lexicon.
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:01.260]   Therefore my use of "culture" is often unapologetically evaluative.
[00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:07.100]   It refers to lower and higher, better and best.
[00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:10.480]   A cultural achievement elevates.
[00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:12.580]   It improves.
[00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:19.300]   Once we could talk unselfconsciously of symphony concerts, opera performances, museum exhibitions,
[00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:22.740]   and poetry readings as cultural events.
[00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:25.080]   They did not merely entertain.
[00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:28.740]   They exposed us to something better than we could find elsewhere.
[00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:33.200]   And we hoped that such exposure would make us better as well, healthier intellectually
[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:35.100]   and emotionally.
[00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:41.360]   Now of course this older idea is not quite safe, or at least not safely expressed, because
[00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:46.100]   it attributes higher qualities to some people and things and not to others.
[00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:48.940]   Who are you to tell me what's good?
[00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:53.420]   Mozart's music is not better than rap, just different, we say today.
[00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:56.900]   It's the great democratic hedge.
[00:39:56.900 --> 00:40:03.280]   Here the anthropological invades a realm properly guided by the aesthetic, perverting both thought
[00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:05.100]   and sentiment.
[00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:08.200]   But some judgments cannot be made by a show of hands.
[00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:16.020]   The majority doesn't always rule, nor in some matters, and here's the rub, should
[00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:17.580]   it.
[00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:24.140]   Classical education was thought to improve the learner, not simply to make him more knowledgeable,
[00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:31.300]   or tolerant, or mentally skillful, but better and stronger, just as there survives today
[00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:39.300]   a residual belief that one who has, say, read and digested all of Shakespeare is better,
[00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:42.740]   more insightful than one who has not.
[00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:48.300]   Perhaps this very attribution of quality to those equipped with classical learning poses
[00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:51.580]   the most formidable barrier to its return.
[00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:54.860]   We talk no more about "better people."
[00:40:54.860 --> 00:41:00.780]   No one wishes, and I certainly do not, to revert to rigid class lines, to a time when
[00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:05.280]   only the well-to-do learned Greek and Latin and all they have to offer, leaving the lower
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:07.980]   classes to learn the trades and mop the floors.
[00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:10.620]   Again, no chance of that.
[00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:16.860]   But neither should we confuse contingency with necessity.
[00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:21.940]   That which may cater to the privileged in one period might prime the aspirations of
[00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:23.820]   democracy in another.
[00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:28.840]   Nonetheless, we ought not to shy away from confronting views of former ages simply because
[00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:33.700]   they don't conform to current notions, for doing so exposes us to the most blinding of
[00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:39.620]   parochialisms, the glaring assumption that one's own time, particularly our own with
[00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:44.420]   all its hypersensitivities, is always right.
[00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:49.260]   So here, "culture" often refers to "high culture."
[00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:55.980]   It's about cultivation and refinement, about what makes one thought or act or expression
[00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:58.320]   better than another.
[00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:03.020]   This kind of culture embodies, as I shall repeat later in the words of Farrow Leitz,
[00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:08.780]   the conscious ideal of human perfection and the habitual vision of greatness.
[00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:14.780]   I once heard a tweedy, bespectacled professor of archaeology pause during a lecture on primitive
[00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:20.540]   peoples to remind his class that when he spoke of culture he did not refer—holding to his
[00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:25.940]   eye an imaginary monocle—to Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.
[00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:28.700]   Sometimes I do mean it that way.
[00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:34.100]   Culture is that which climbs high on the scale of human achievement, is not easily apprehensible
[00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:38.320]   to all, and requires patient thought and sympathy.
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:41.060]   We are not born into culture.
[00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:43.140]   We acquire it.
[00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:45.780]   And we can lose it.
[00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:50.500]   Climbing Parnassus once helped to form the unformed mind.
[00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:55.420]   The arduous ascent fostered intellectual and aesthetic culture within those who had endured
[00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:56.780]   the strain.
[00:42:56.780 --> 00:43:01.700]   It helped to bring mental and even emotional order out of chaos.
[00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:05.500]   And a classical training still provides the surest footing for the educated mind and a
[00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:09.660]   high perch from which to view other periods and nations.
[00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:13.820]   The foundations of the modern world are viewed more competently from this height.
[00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:21.140]   Poetry, drama, democracy, idealism, scientific curiosity, and so much else furnishing our
[00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:24.840]   minds are better grasped and better judged.
[00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:31.140]   We drift without classics, floating on our own deracinated, exiguous islands.
[00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:34.160]   And we become fodder for demagogues.
[00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:38.380]   We need not a revolution, but a restoration.
[00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:43.160]   The classical pursuit fosters gratitude for the fruits of the past and feeds the sense
[00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:46.180]   that we stand on the shoulders of giants.
[00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:52.140]   The student of history gains a means of judging other times seriously and fairly.
[00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:58.300]   He learns to see that a civilized culture is a delicately poised edifice, a fragile
[00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:04.620]   creation, erected with monumental exertion, yet easily destroyed.
[00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:09.580]   The historian Christopher Dawson once wrote that culture, in the older sense here, is
[00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:12.020]   "an artificial product.
[00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:17.100]   It is like a city that has been built up laboriously by the work of successive generations, not
[00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:22.160]   a jungle which has grown up spontaneously by the blind pressure of natural forces.
[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:28.100]   It is the essence of culture that it is communicated and acquired, and although it is inherited
[00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:35.220]   by one generation from another, it is a social, not a biological, inheritance, a tradition
[00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:45.420]   of learning, an accumulated capital of knowledge, and one, we may add, always in danger of perishing."
[00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:52.020]   The Greeks dreamed, in the words of Werner Jaeger, of "building a state so skillfully
[00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:58.420]   that it might keep strength and spirit in perpetual equipoise," while recognizing
[00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:04.220]   that "even the most solid of earthly powers must vanish into the air, and that only the
[00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:08.740]   seemingly brittle splendor of the spirit can long endure."
[00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:13.140]   The classical world is a richly instructive model of civilized life.
[00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:20.540]   We are bound as heirs to ask anew what made it great with all its faults, and why it expired
[00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:22.620]   with all its strengths.
[00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:23.940]   Who knows?
[00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:30.620]   We may find ourselves on the decks of our own listing ship someday.
[00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:33.940]   This journey takes us high into the uplands of thought.
[00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:38.560]   Whitehead claimed all modern philosophy to be mere footnotes to Plato.
[00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:42.980]   An expedition into the classical world will lead us to philosophy, that highest of human
[00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:48.820]   quests after the spiritual, and a pursuit Plutarch once called "the head and font
[00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:51.140]   of all education."
[00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:57.260]   We see philosophy wooed in those days when she still held a link, and perhaps a key,
[00:45:57.260 --> 00:45:59.060]   to wisdom.
[00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:05.540]   Matters of ethics, morality, and politics jostled as the vita beata, the good or happy
[00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:12.820]   life is delineated, as it so supremely was during the 5th and 4th centuries BC in Greece,
[00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:18.340]   an age that, according to Livingston, had to face the questions which, now veiled, now
[00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:23.980]   visible, now remote, now insistent, constitute the eternal human problem.
[00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:26.220]   What should men believe about life?
[00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:27.460]   How should they live it?
[00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:31.100]   In what state of society can the good life be best lived?
[00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:34.620]   And how can we create such a state?
[00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:40.780]   B. L. Gildersleeve, an American classicist who flourished a century ago, once said that
[00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:47.260]   while, for the ancients, the actual conduct of life took precedence over its contemplation,
[00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:52.860]   that is, to deep thinking about it, still, the wisdom in forming the good and fruitful
[00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:56.900]   life came of contemplation and humble learning.
[00:46:56.900 --> 00:46:59.420]   This is why we should sup at their table.
[00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:04.260]   It seems to be impossible, Gildersleeve said, to live in constant communion with the first
[00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:10.740]   minds of antiquity and not imbibe something of the spirit of moderation, of self-control,
[00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:14.700]   of cautious wisdom that breathes through their counsels.
[00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:18.860]   For there is no department of human thought or endeavor in which the counsel of antiquity
[00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:22.660]   is not directly or indirectly valuable.
[00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:28.140]   Even if all one has gained from a classical education were to be forgotten in later life,
[00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:33.300]   anyone trained, at least for a time, to view the worlds the Greeks and Romans saw it may
[00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:36.740]   learn to ask pregnant questions.
[00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:41.460]   And even if the ancient answers be rejected, the student, of whatever age, will know what
[00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:48.660]   they are and approach his own world with freshened vision, one no longer blinkered by ideology
[00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:50.620]   and the reigning fashion.
[00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:57.780]   He would have a liberal, because liberating, education indeed.
[00:47:57.780 --> 00:48:02.260]   No longer would he be imprisoned exclusively within the velvet walls of his own world's
[00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:04.620]   preoccupations and fetishes.
[00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:09.300]   No longer would he be just and only a child of his own time.
[00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:15.020]   He might even partake of the divine.
[00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:18.340]   Classical education again needs defending.
[00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:24.900]   We labor, after all, under the modern and, for this reason, rarely challenged belief
[00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:31.380]   that the classical world and its works have little to teach anyone but specialists, scholars,
[00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:33.460]   and teachers of classics.
[00:48:33.460 --> 00:48:35.060]   Let there be no mistake.
[00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:40.540]   For well over a century, classicists themselves have helped to create this fix.
[00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:48.540]   They have encouraged classical teaching, emulating the necessarily precision methods of technicians.
[00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:54.180]   They have tried to habituate classics to the halls of science, and in doing so have ignored
[00:48:54.180 --> 00:48:59.940]   or obscured those humanizing balms many of us believe classics to apply.
[00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:06.460]   If indeed classical study is to consist merely, and for everyone, in nothing but memorizing
[00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:12.340]   grammar or toting up the number of slaves lugging amphorae in the Athens of Pericles,
[00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:17.940]   then truly classics has become a domain of specialists only, warranting no more, though
[00:49:17.940 --> 00:49:23.680]   no less, reverence and respect than any other worthwhile scholarly pursuit.
[00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:28.580]   This is the way many professional classicists would have it be, to which we can say only
[00:49:28.580 --> 00:49:31.140]   that they have their reward.
[00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:38.660]   Here I should draw a distinction between classical scholarship and classical education.
[00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:40.820]   They are not the same thing.
[00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:44.740]   Classical scholarship inhabits a province in which few of us are equipped to travel,
[00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:49.820]   either by training or temperament, as scholarship requires not only devotion to a subject, but
[00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:55.940]   also entails years of painstaking preparation and the fine-tuning of precise judgment.
[00:49:55.940 --> 00:50:01.940]   Fine classical scholars, like fine nuclear physicists, are rare birds.
[00:50:01.940 --> 00:50:04.320]   Would that they were a little rarer.
[00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:10.940]   As with nuclear physicists, few are needed in a healthy, intelligent society.
[00:50:10.940 --> 00:50:17.020]   Classical education, on the other hand, comes as the result of a classical course of study,
[00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:22.060]   usually lasting several years, often though not necessarily through one's undergraduate
[00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:23.660]   days.
[00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:28.940]   Perhaps classical education isn't as profound or as exacting as classical scholarships,
[00:50:28.940 --> 00:50:33.140]   though one may suspect that many tenured classics professors today would be hard-pressed to
[00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:38.980]   compose Greek iambics the way classically trained adolescents once could.
[00:50:38.980 --> 00:50:41.140]   Classical education aims at larger numbers.
[00:50:41.140 --> 00:50:43.900]   It's fit to serve more people.
[00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:47.740]   Some of those blessed with the benefits of an early classical training may be well-suited
[00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:51.340]   to the scholarly life, even if they do not opt for it.
[00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:55.140]   Nonetheless, they will have been transformed by that training.
[00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:57.980]   I don't dismiss the importance of high scholarship.
[00:50:57.980 --> 00:51:03.220]   I owe too much to too many scholars, and there can be no classical education without classical
[00:51:03.220 --> 00:51:04.220]   scholarship.
[00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:07.740]   Indeed, I would hope that a select few of the talented would be attracted to the academy
[00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:14.500]   to teach the languages, edit texts, elucidate ideas, dig shards, and think great thoughts.
[00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:22.520]   But it is primarily classical education, parnassus, not scholarship I argue for in this essay.
[00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:28.100]   The world could do with fewer scholars and more cultivated people.
[00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:33.040]   If classical study is to survive to guide our intellectual life, we must reassert its
[00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:35.960]   cultural significance and value.
[00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:40.780]   Classics must make a difference not just in the way we think, but in the way we live.
[00:51:40.780 --> 00:51:46.180]   Its humanistic roots cut in an era hounded by utilitarian demands.
[00:51:46.180 --> 00:51:50.700]   Classics has found itself in recent decades jockeying to justify its place in the cluttered
[00:51:50.700 --> 00:51:54.420]   academic catalogs to a technologically driven age.
[00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:59.980]   Ours is a time and place where many have decided, through ignorance or neglect, that culture,
[00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:03.180]   whatever it is, will somehow take care of itself.
[00:52:03.180 --> 00:52:09.940]   Yet the Greeks and Romans taught us, by edict and example, the dangers of cultural complacency.
[00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:12.060]   Culture does not breathe on its own.
[00:52:12.060 --> 00:52:15.300]   It is preserved by those convinced of its value.
[00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:17.100]   This is not a new gospel.
[00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:18.780]   It is simply true.
[00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:23.420]   The classical vision has been renewed time and again down the long centuries after being
[00:52:23.420 --> 00:52:28.340]   threatened with extinction by prophets touting their new Jerusalems.
[00:52:28.340 --> 00:52:32.260]   But for students of history, the burden of proof must lie on the shoulders of those who
[00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:34.980]   would deny that vision's value.
[00:52:34.980 --> 00:52:40.100]   The case for classical education is not airtight, nor can it be.
[00:52:40.100 --> 00:52:44.300]   It contains too many provisos, but it deserves another hearing.
[00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:51.020]   Homage has been paid to it before our time, and by finer minds.
[00:52:51.020 --> 00:52:57.380]   Lastly, for a delicate matter, and here I part company with many apologists for classical
[00:52:57.380 --> 00:53:00.620]   education, especially in modern America.
[00:53:00.620 --> 00:53:06.700]   Greek and Latin, this unique and rarified base of education, revered so long by the
[00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:10.260]   best and brightest, is not for everyone.
[00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:17.180]   The tireless study of classics has always been, to put it bluntly, an elite pursuit,
[00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:20.140]   a privilege of a comparative few.
[00:53:20.140 --> 00:53:22.860]   We should not skirt this fact.
[00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:29.320]   Classical education must not be patronizingly defended, must not be sold for its democratizing
[00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:35.020]   traits the way some of our allies spearheading the "great books" have done.
[00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:37.280]   These traits exist.
[00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:41.660]   Knowledge and understanding and taste all serve splendidly the interests of a democratic
[00:53:41.660 --> 00:53:46.940]   people, but they are accidental, not essential.
[00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:49.380]   Classics serves no class.
[00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:52.940]   Tyrants and oligarchs can quote Cicero too.
[00:53:52.940 --> 00:53:56.780]   Critics of classical education have, in one sense, been right for centuries.
[00:53:56.780 --> 00:54:01.940]   Classics is, in at least one inescapable sense, elitist.
[00:54:01.940 --> 00:54:03.300]   But so what?
[00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:07.900]   We may admit this, while also saying that this does not tell the whole story.
[00:54:07.900 --> 00:54:13.780]   Anyone with a modicum of talent and energy can take on large dollops that classics offers.
[00:54:13.780 --> 00:54:16.800]   It is a mansion with many rooms and corridors.
[00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:21.320]   But the indisputable fact is that those of higher culture have perennially constituted
[00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:27.100]   those few at the top who, through their gifts and privileges, have influenced disproportionately
[00:54:27.100 --> 00:54:29.900]   the larger society of which they are members.
[00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:35.340]   Still, I believe that the size of this minority as a proportion of the larger literate populace
[00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:38.140]   need not be infinitesimal.
[00:54:38.140 --> 00:54:42.980]   While initiates into classical learning have always been small in number, that number was
[00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:45.180]   always too small.
[00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:47.740]   Talent is no respecter of social status.
[00:54:47.740 --> 00:54:50.860]   No one with the requisite ability need be left out.
[00:54:50.860 --> 00:54:56.620]   Parnassus can be scaled by anyone with intelligence and curiosity who is also possessed of a doggedness
[00:54:56.620 --> 00:54:58.260]   for detail.
[00:54:58.260 --> 00:55:02.340]   With so much of the climbing gear available now to the disciplined autodidact in the form
[00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:08.500]   of books, films, and computer software, the vistas have never been accessible to so many.
[00:55:08.500 --> 00:55:12.380]   Despite other disadvantages of a world unfriendly to the rigors and elevations of classical
[00:55:12.380 --> 00:55:19.020]   learning, we can in this day bypass the oversights and soft ignorance of the educational "experts"
[00:55:19.020 --> 00:55:23.100]   who have maintained a stranglehold on our schools for generations.
[00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:26.360]   We have the liberty of free agents.
[00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:27.940]   We should use it.
[00:55:27.940 --> 00:55:30.780]   Finally, a concession.
[00:55:30.780 --> 00:55:34.860]   Many wonder whether the classical languages themselves make for an absolutely essential
[00:55:34.860 --> 00:55:37.420]   ingredient in a classical education.
[00:55:37.420 --> 00:55:42.220]   Could someone be classically educated without a reading knowledge of Greek and Latin?
[00:55:42.220 --> 00:55:48.580]   This sticky question, despite dogmatic claims on both sides, should not be answered glibly.
[00:55:48.580 --> 00:55:52.740]   One must probe a little to discover precisely what kind of knowledge the questioner wishes
[00:55:52.740 --> 00:55:54.180]   to gain.
[00:55:54.180 --> 00:55:57.060]   The judgment of history is "no."
[00:55:57.060 --> 00:56:02.180]   And certainly I argue for the full package, the deluxe deal, declensions, conjugations,
[00:56:02.180 --> 00:56:05.620]   syntax, lexicons, verse exercises, and all.
[00:56:05.620 --> 00:56:11.260]   Nonetheless, it is safe to say that we can procure, with enterprise, certain intellectual
[00:56:11.260 --> 00:56:16.820]   and cultural benefits of classics by means other than a formal classical schooling.
[00:56:16.820 --> 00:56:21.540]   Not all knowledge worth having need be worn with scholastic exactitude.
[00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:26.240]   Acute intelligence matched to an active imagination can do wonders.
[00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:28.180]   Many paths can lead us home.
[00:56:28.180 --> 00:56:32.580]   If we can say anything with hopeful certainty about the future of classical education, it
[00:56:32.580 --> 00:56:39.620]   is that there will be many steep and dusty roads back to Rome.
[00:56:39.620 --> 00:56:44.820]   The essay that I have just read to you is the introduction to the book called "Climbing
[00:56:44.820 --> 00:56:53.220]   Parnassus, A New Apologia for Greek and Latin" by author Tracy Lee Simmons, published in
[00:56:53.220 --> 00:57:16.100]   the year 2002.
