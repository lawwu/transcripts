[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920]   what's your view on seed oils?
[00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.780]   Oy.
[00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.100]   No, just, you know, I mean, I'll say mine.
[00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.740]   I like olive oil and butter, coconut oil,
[00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.060]   and things like avocados and some Brazil nuts and walnuts and stuff.
[00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:18.400]   So since I don't count calories, I kind of have an intuitive sense
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.400]   of what I'm taking in, how much fat, how much protein, how much starch,
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.240]   how much, you know, fibrous carbs, et cetera.
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.300]   So for me, like, I wouldn't pick canola oil because I could pick olive oil.
[00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.820]   Right, right.
[00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.660]   And then I make sure it's real olive oil.
[00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.320]   But I don't think seed oils necessarily will kill me,
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.340]   but guess why I know they won't kill me?
[00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.180]   Because I don't eat them.
[00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.920]   We should be eating whole food fats as much as possible, right?
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.860]   Avocados, coconut, nuts and seeds, you know, omega-3 fats from fish,
[00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.700]   olive oil, which is the most minimally processed oil you can get,
[00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:52.920]   extra virgin olive oil.
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.460]   And we're eating nuts and seeds.
[00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.780]   We're getting a lot of omega-6s.
[00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.720]   So the big theory behind seed oils is
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.120]   that it's omega-6 rich.
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.420]   It's imbalanced with omega-3s.
[00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.340]   It causes inflammation.
[00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.880]   The way they're produced and grown is problematic.
[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.600]   They're usually GMO crops like canola oil.
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.400]   They spray lots of chemicals on them.
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.580]   Those chemicals get in the oil.
[00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.960]   They're manufactured in an industrial way that oxidizes them,
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.120]   that uses hexane to get rid of sort of some of the compounds in it,
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.940]   deodorizes them, bleaches them.
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.240]   And then they're easily oxidized.
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.380]   So would I want to eat an industrial food product?
[00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.500]   Probably not.
[00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.440]   Do we know for sure that it's a problem?
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.840]   I think the data is mixed.
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.140]   I mean, there's some studies that show epidemiologically that, you know,
[00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.980]   people who eat more of these plant-based oils or seed oils have reduced risk of diseases.
[00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.700]   So we don't know what they're doing and there's food frequency questionnaires
[00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.000]   and these studies are proving correlation, not causation.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.900]   And what it's replacing.
[00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.520]   Sorry to interrupt here, but, you know,
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.760]   I'll see the data that seed oils are better for people than butter.
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:55.660]   Okay.
[00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.880]   I like grass-fed butter, but I don't eat it in excess.
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:59.260]   Yeah.
[00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.620]   I once joked about that and I like, I made some jokes early on and having a podcast,
[00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.040]   not realizing the implications.
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.500]   But anyway, I'm very careful now.
[00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.720]   I have some butter in moderation.
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.040]   Yeah.
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.460]   But so I could imagine that if you're eating a lot of lard and butter and bacon fat
[00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.840]   and you replace it with seed oils, you'll get healthier.
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.760]   Maybe.
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.280]   Maybe.
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.620]   Maybe.
[00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.100]   But you could imagine, I guess it depends on what else you're ingesting.
[00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.680]   Because the starch-fat combination is the one that gets people, in my opinion.
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.740]   That's right.
[00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:25.000]   That's right.
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.440]   But, right, somebody could be eating a lot of meat and fruit and doing it okay.
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.820]   Don't eat like your butter with a bagel.
[00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:31.940]   Put it on your broccoli.
[00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.740]   Because the saturated fat, refined starch combo is what's killing us.
[00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:43.400]   I wish people would really hear you on this.
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.580]   It's not fat per se.
[00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.260]   It's not starches per se.
[00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.540]   It's the combination of fat and starch, and in particular, fat, starch, and sugar.
[00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.840]   Yeah.
[00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.620]   Well, starch, sugar, starch, and below the neck, your body can't tell if it's a bowl
[00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.080]   of sugar, a bowl of cornflakes, or a bagel, or a bowl of sugar.
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.200]   So if I put a pat of butter on a bowl of white rice, is it that bad?
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.800]   No, not really.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.980]   Okay.
[00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.540]   But if I put a pat of butter on a muffin, it's bad news bears.
[00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:10.140]   Yeah.
[00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.860]   You're doubling down on the sugar, yeah.
[00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:17.420]   And I think, you know, to answer your question about the seed oil, the data's not really
[00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.160]   completely answering this.
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.540]   And it's part of the problem with nutrition.
[00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:21.640]   It's not a nutrition science.
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:27.980]   It's the one large randomized controlled trial that was done on like 9,000 people, not on
[00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.280]   90 people or 50 people or 30 people, which a lot of these studies are, but on 9,000 people
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.980]   that were randomized in a psychiatric hospital.
[00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:52.640]   Now, corn oil is a pure omega-6 oil, as opposed to soybean, which is mixed omega-3, canola mixed
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:53.940]   omega-3, 6 oils.
[00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.980]   And what they found was striking.
[00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:03.940]   They found that the group that had the corn oil, for every 30-point drop in LDL cholesterol,
[00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:11.860]   the risk of death from heart attacks or strokes went up by 22%, which is completely the opposite
[00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.980]   of what we think in medicine, which is LDL is the boogeyman.
[00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.900]   LDL is the bad cholesterol or L for lousy cholesterol.
[00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.260]   It's not so simple.
[00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:27.100]   And I think this oversimplification of, let's say, these C-dolls lower LDL, therefore they're
[00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.400]   good, it's just too simplistic.
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:35.520]   But would I, for example, have a corn oil that was expeller-pressed or that was organic or canola
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.860]   oil that was or sunflower or safflower oil?
[00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:38.100]   Yeah.
[00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.340]   I mean, I'm not worried about those in small amounts.
[00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.620]   But that's not what most people are doing.
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:48.580]   Most people are eating, most of their diet is ultra-processed food, 60% of adults, 67% of kids
[00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.060]   is basically junk food.
[00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.460]   And the major oil in those are these refined oils.
[00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.980]   So is it the oils?
[00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.120]   Is it the junk food?
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.780]   They're just a vehicle for this.
[00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.660]   And we've increased our consumption, for example, of the main seed oil or bean oil, it's not really
[00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:07.520]   a seed, is soybean oil by a thousandfold since 1900.
[00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:13.880]   Now, I'm sort of an evolutionary thinker, I'm like, how are our bodies designed and what
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:14.820]   should we be doing with them?
[00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:20.200]   And you talk a lot about light and that's like, you went to sleep with the sun, you woke up
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.780]   with the sun, it was just how things were.
[00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.080]   And you had circadian rhythms and our whole biological clocks and rhythms are screwed up
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.780]   because of how we live.
[00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.420]   Yeah, well, we evolved under the major constraint of sunrise and sunset.
[00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:31.060]   That's right.
[00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:36.280]   And artificial lighting is a wonderful thing, but I think there's highly processed light.
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.560]   It's devoid of long wavelengths, the eradication basically of incandescent bulbs and all these
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.740]   LEDs and daylight savings times.
[00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.580]   It's really messing people up.
[00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.020]   It means, oh, it's just an hour.
[00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.760]   No, actually, it's your mental health.
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:55.700]   When it comes to the seed oil thing, I actually predict that seed oils will lose.
[00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.520]   I think in the end, it's just obvious.
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.580]   Like, why wouldn't people just say, you know what?
[00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.660]   The seed oil thing may or may not be a problem.
[00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.900]   I'm just going to eat olive oil and a little bit of butter.
[00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.040]   Yeah, that's kind of my view.
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:13.420]   My view is if you have a new to nature kind of compound or an unnaturally high amount of something
[00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.680]   that we're having in our diet, I mean, sugar was always around.
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.720]   We would get honey, whatever.
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.840]   But we'd have 22 teaspoons a year as hunter-gatherers.
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.060]   Now we have that every day for every American.
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:32.820]   If you had a magic wand and you could get rid of seed oils or you could get rid of highly refined sugars in modern American diet, which one would you know?
[00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:33.340]   No contest.
[00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:40.040]   It's starch and sugar that's driving our metabolic crisis, like, by a huge factor, by a huge factor.
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.080]   Does that mean no pasta, no bread?
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.620]   It doesn't mean no, no anything.
[00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.460]   It just means the volume of stuff we're eating.
[00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.400]   It's like we're eating pharmacologic doses.
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:54.480]   It's 152 pounds of sugar and 133 pounds of flour, which has a higher glycemic index than sugar.
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:54.980]   Really?
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.480]   Yeah, well, that's how it's set.
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:01.060]   It's set at white bread as 100 and the sugar's 80 because it's fructose and glucose.
[00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:02.220]   So you have to break that apart.
[00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:08.380]   And so your glycemic load, which is how it affects your blood sugar, fructose doesn't raise your blood sugar.
[00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:09.720]   Glucose raises your blood sugar.
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:17.680]   Glucose raises your blood sugar.
