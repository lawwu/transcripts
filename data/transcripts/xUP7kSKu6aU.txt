[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.640]   All right. What's our next question here?
[00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:09.280]   So we have a follow-up question from Olivia as well, and she took advantage of the new
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.720]   question survey because we get to answer two questions from her back to back.
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.360]   Yes. If you're early in filling in that survey, you're much more likely to get your question
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.700]   answered than a few months from now. So yeah, good advertisement for filling out the question
[00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.600]   survey.
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.240]   So in her book, and she says, "In your book, So Good They Can't Ignore You, you give the
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.200]   following as a reason for leaving a job. It presents few opportunities to distinguish
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.400]   yourself by developing relevant skills that are rare and valuable."
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.840]   She worries that in her job as a product designer, she's repeating the same work instead of getting
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:44.840]   better.
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.720]   She studied literature in college, and as we talked about, she did a part-time master's
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.160]   and well, she's doing a part-time master's in economics right now.
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.440]   These feel much more challenging, like something that you can truly develop expertise in.
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.040]   At the same time, she gets paid a lot as a product designer in tech, so maybe the skill
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.400]   is valuable.
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:12.500]   How can she decide if the first disqualifier applies to her career?
[00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.360]   So just to put this in context, Olivia is referring to, in my book, So Good They Can't
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.760]   Ignore You, I lean heavily on this idea that stop worrying about if you have the exact
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.160]   right job for you, or that you have a passion that has to be matched to your career, and
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.560]   if you don't exactly match it, then you're going to be miserable.
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:36.520]   I argue that many different professional pursuits can be the foundation for a working life that's
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.840]   a great source of satisfaction.
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.080]   But I did give three disqualifiers.
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.560]   Here's three things that tell you that this might not be a job you should stay in.
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.600]   So the first was what Olivia mentioned.
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.200]   You don't really have options to build up skills that can then be used as leverage to
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.600]   shape your career going forward.
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.200]   That was disqualifier number one.
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.800]   I believe disqualifier number two was it conflicted with values.
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:05.440]   So you're working for Philip Morris, and the idea of so many people getting sick from smoking
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.040]   is against your values.
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.880]   And then three, I think, was you don't like the people.
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.800]   These people are just, I can't stand them.
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.160]   I don't mind being an investment banker from a values perspective.
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.720]   I am going to have lots of options because I'll make a lot of money, lots of options
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.840]   if I get really good.
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:23.840]   But you know what?
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.960]   I can't take these people I work with at Goldman.
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.480]   So that'd be number three.
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.480]   All right.
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:37.240]   So she's asking, do I think that first disqualifier applies to her job as a product designer in
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.240]   tech?
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.000]   She's worried.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.600]   Is this something I can keep getting better and getting options, or is it something that
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.800]   I'm just going to eventually have to move on from?
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.560]   What I would suggest in this situation is, and this is a evolution from the way I talked
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.440]   about this back in So Good They Can't Ignore You.
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.280]   So it's been 10 years since that book came out.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.800]   So this is a bit of an evolution.
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:04.560]   I would lean a little bit heavier on a lifestyle centric career planning approach to this question,
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.520]   as opposed to remaining more narrowly focused on just the aspects of the career.
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:16.560]   So in lifestyle centric career planning, you have your vision for what you want your daily
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.760]   experience what you want your life to be like in all different aspects, not just professionally.
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.960]   And then you can work backwards and figure out how your work can help get you to that
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:27.960]   lifestyle.
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:33.020]   So if you have this lifestyle fix, the question then becomes, does this technology product
[00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:39.280]   design career that I'm in, do I see a way to use this to grow in this?
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.720]   Do I see a trajectory here that is going to support this lifestyle I have, this vision
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:45.720]   I have of my lifestyle?
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.720]   All right.
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.920]   And in answering that question, you probably want to look for role models, case studies
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.800]   and examples, people at your company or other companies, freelancers, people on their own,
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.400]   but people within the same orbit of general skills that have done interesting things with
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.400]   it.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.200]   This will elaborate your understanding of what is possible with this job.
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.760]   As you get good, what are the different options of what you can do with this?
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.280]   You mentioned in your elaboration, I'm looking at it now, you say some pretty stark things
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.300]   like only people in their twenties can be a product designer while their mind is fresh.
[00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.120]   There are no product designers in their thirties.
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.220]   Your only chance, your only option is to become a manager.
[00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.600]   But then even then you can only do that during your forties.
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.560]   That's probably not true.
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.360]   I mean, I think you probably need to be more systematic at learning what the different
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:36.240]   possibilities are for this general constellation of skills and not just, okay, within the company
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.920]   you work for and you know, what's the promotion chain here, but for product designers in generally
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.600]   people who work in different industries on product design, people who'd go out on their
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.200]   own people who do freelance.
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:50.440]   Is there people who do this for this type of company and they do it six months out of
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:56.080]   12 and make a pretty good living at it and using that they can live somewhere that's
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.520]   kind of cheap but exotic and interesting on a farm somewhere.
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.520]   I don't know.
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.520]   You got to get out there.
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.760]   You got to get the information and then figure out seeing all these different options.
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.080]   Do I see a way of deploying any of these to get to my image of ideal lifestyle?
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.840]   And if yes, go for it.
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.880]   If no, then yeah, you can say this disqualifier applies.
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:13.880]   So that's my evolution.
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.720]   Let's use lifestyle more and be a little bit less narrowly focused on just what is this
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.720]   job?
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:20.720]   What am I going to get from this job?
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.600]   We're going to go for this job because ultimately what does that matter if it's not serving
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:29.120]   the life that you're actually aiming to achieve?
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.880]   That comes back to when you talk about being a reporter for your own job, essentially,
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:35.880]   you talk about that a lot.
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:36.880]   Yeah.
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.480]   Act as if you're a reporter and figure out what the steps are to do X, Y, Z.
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.480]   Yeah.
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.880]   Like you're writing a book or an article about how people get here in my career.
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:51.160]   Go talk to people, look up people's resumes online, read profiles of people in your industry.
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:56.200]   Yeah, you got to be like, I'm going to write a book about product design and the career
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.440]   possibilities of product design.
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.120]   So it's a research mindset.
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.120]   Yeah.
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.120]   Yeah.
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.120]   Yeah.
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.120]   Yeah.
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:07.120]   Yeah.
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.700]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.700]   (upbeat music)
