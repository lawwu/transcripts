[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.760]   Pastor John, what balance or boundaries should we have regarding our friendships with non-Christians?
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:24.820]   We have to find the line between ignoring two seemingly opposite commands.
[00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.000]   One is, "Do not be deceived.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.160]   Bad company ruins good morals."
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.280]   1 Corinthians 15.33.
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.620]   Or "Your boasting is not good.
[00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.960]   Do you not know a little leaven leavens the whole lump?"
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:54.440]   Paul is talking about tolerating people in the church that you should excommunicate.
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:03.660]   Now on the other side, "Whoever walks with the wise becomes wise, but the companion of
[00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.160]   fools will suffer harm."
[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.160]   Proverbs 13.
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.480]   "Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, stands not in the way of sinners,
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.960]   sits not in the seats of scoffers."
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:20.400]   So you've got all these commands and wisdom proverbs on the one side that say, "Watch
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.840]   out, hanging out with corrupt people can lead to your corruption."
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.840]   Now on the other side, of course, you've got Jesus, who not only ate with tax collectors
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.200]   and sinners, but he was called the friend of tax collectors and sinners because that's
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.760]   in fact what he did so often.
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:46.800]   And you've got Paul saying, "If you take me as me—when I say don't hang out or separate
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.760]   yourself from sexually immoral people—if you think I mean the world, then that won't
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.840]   work because then you'd have to go out of the world."
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:54.840]   1 Corinthians 5.
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.760]   He doesn't mean don't associate with greedy swindlers, idolaters, since then you would
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.000]   need to go out of the world, he says in 1 Corinthians 5.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.520]   So Paul is with Jesus in saying, "No, you're going to be thrown together with these people.
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.520]   You should take opportunities.
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.280]   You should become all things to all people in a biblical way."
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:21.200]   So we've got these two sets of admonitions, and we have to discern which ones apply when.
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.040]   And I would say, ask these two questions.
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.600]   Which way is the transforming influence flowing?
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.700]   When you're with someone, are they being transformed?
[00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.380]   Are you being transformed?
[00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.120]   Are you being drawn to minimize the value of holiness?
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.280]   Are your standards being compromised?
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.280]   Are you being made callous and hard towards things in movies, say, or on television, or
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.400]   in language that you weren't once hard to, but sensitive to?
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.040]   So that's the first question.
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:03.240]   And the second question is, are we loving these people for their sake—that is, that
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.960]   they would come to faith and they would become godly—or do we really love them because
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:17.560]   we love what they enjoy and really just like being with them in their worldliness?
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:24.580]   I think a lot of people justify hanging out with worldly people because they are worldly
[00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.880]   Christians and they feel at home with those worldly Christians.
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.240]   And the things they laugh at, they don't regard as offensive.
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.860]   The things they watch in movies, they don't regard as a problem.
[00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.380]   The language they use, they don't think it's a big deal.
[00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.300]   The way they spend their time, that's the way they'd like to spend their time, which
[00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:49.640]   really shows that they're not loving these people with a Christ-like love that's ready
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.200]   to die to change their behavior and change their patterns.
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.880]   They're just conforming to them and calling it love.
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:05.160]   So those are the two questions that I think help us navigate between bad company corrupts
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.760]   good morals on the one hand, and Jesus eating with tax collectors and sinners on the other
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:11.760]   hand.
