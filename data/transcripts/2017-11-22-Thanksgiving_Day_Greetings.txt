[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:36.280]   Good morning, Radicals, and happy Thanksgiving Day to you.
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.160]   Please forgive my raspy voice.
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.240]   My throat has chosen to inform me that it would like a break.
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:47.720]   And of course, I'm seeking to provide a break for it as we enjoy the Thanksgiving Day holiday
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.200]   here in the United States.
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.960]   But I did want to make an exception here and take a quick moment to greet you and say happy
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.320]   Thanksgiving Day to you and draw one or two encouragement, pieces of encouragement for
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.640]   you from this holiday.
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.040]   The Thanksgiving Day holiday this week in the United States is actually my favorite
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.040]   holiday.
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.920]   And it's a holiday that has great meaning for the simplicity of the idea, the idea of
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.680]   giving thanks to God for all of the great blessings that we have.
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.960]   Financially speaking, if you were looking for one valuable thing that you could do that
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:26.040]   would, I believe in the fullness of time, really transform your life, make a habit of
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.760]   systematically noticing the good things in your life, the blessings in your life, and
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.240]   being thankful for those things.
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.560]   If your heart is filled with gratitude and thanksgiving, it's very hard to maintain some
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.400]   of the negative emotions.
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.120]   It's very hard to maintain fear and anger when your heart is filled with gratitude and
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.120]   thanksgiving.
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:54.720]   And there's probably the best time to sit down and look carefully at your life and consider
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.200]   the many things that we have to be thankful for.
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.160]   Very frequently, we find it easy to forget the many good things that we enjoy until something
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.480]   goes wrong.
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:11.440]   An example that always is very meaningful to me, from time to time, I get a canker sore
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.440]   in my mouth.
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.960]   And I think this is common to all people, but every few months, every six months or
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.240]   so, I probably get a canker sore in my mouth.
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.480]   It turns my mouth into a very painful environment.
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.800]   Makes it hard to eat, makes it hard to swallow.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:34.280]   And during those times, I often reflect on how I've had many, many months of a pleasant
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:40.820]   eating experience, a pain-free mouth, and hadn't stopped to notice it.
[00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:47.760]   So I always try to pay attention when facing adversity or facing something painful, to
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.000]   appreciate it as a blessing to remind me of all the other times.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.720]   But yet, how short-sighted is that?
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.840]   How short-sighted is it to wait for everything to be awful before noticing the things that
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:01.840]   are good?
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.400]   Friends, we live in the greatest time to be alive in the history of the world.
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.640]   Peace and prosperity increasing on all sides.
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.400]   There has never been a time better than today.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.800]   The future is filled with wonderful things.
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.160]   Do you recognize those things?
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.840]   Are you paying attention?
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.120]   Frankly, your life has probably never been better than it is today.
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.040]   Now, certainly, you may be going through a trial.
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.600]   You may be going through a difficult time.
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:41.280]   But if you were to sit down and make an accurate assessment of your life, I'd bet you that
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.560]   you could come up with a whole long list of reasons and ways that your life is better
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.120]   today than it's ever been before.
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.560]   Don't miss the opportunity.
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.320]   You have a choice.
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.080]   You can either dwell on the things that you don't like and pay attention to all the things
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:04.160]   that you think are wrong with your life and with the world, or you can focus on the things
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.900]   that you do like.
[00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:12.280]   And wherever you dwell, wherever your focus continues, you'll see more and more of those
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.280]   things.
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:24.240]   So I want to encourage you, very practically, this Thanksgiving Day, this Thursday, 2017,
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.160]   do you have a heart filled with gratitude?
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.200]   Do you see the abundance that you're enjoying on all sides?
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:39.560]   If not, start making a list of reasons to be grateful, to be thankful.
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:45.920]   If there's something in your life that you don't think is all that great, start looking
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.480]   for the things that are great about it.
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.100]   Years ago, I remember just two stories.
[00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.600]   One came from Zig Ziglar, he used to tell a story of a woman that he interacted with.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.800]   And this woman came up to him at a seminar and she said to him, "I hate my job.
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.840]   Can you help me?"
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.240]   And his advice to her after a little bit of interaction was, "Go home and make a list
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.880]   of everything that you love about your job."
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.760]   She did it and it transformed her working life.
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:20.240]   Because when you start focusing on the things that you love, you start to see more and more
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.480]   things to focus on.
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:27.600]   There's no reason to close your eyes to the things that are hard, the things that are
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.600]   difficult.
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.320]   But it's all a matter of where you focus.
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.280]   Focus on the things that are great.
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:39.120]   Another example that Darren Hardy shared one time was with regard to a man that he encouraged
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.560]   to do this in his marriage.
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:47.000]   A man and his wife were deeply struggling, angry at each other, frustrated at each other.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.760]   He gave the man the advice to go and to buy a journal and every day to write a journal
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:58.440]   entry of something that he was thankful for about his wife and to make a gratitude journal.
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.080]   That practice transformed his marriage.
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.080]   Because instead of looking for everything that was wrong with his wife, he looked for
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:10.240]   everything that was right with her, everything that was fantastic.
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.920]   And I've applied the same thing in other areas of my life as well and I encourage you.
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.440]   I hope that your list is overflowing.
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:23.360]   I hope that you have many blessings in your life for which you can be thankful.
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.200]   If you don't, start making a list.
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.360]   Start counting your blessings and making a list systematically.
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:38.760]   It has the potential to transform your experience of life.
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.280]   Whatever you focus on grows.
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.560]   Focus on reasons to be thankful, reasons to be grateful.
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:50.880]   You'll find more and more reasons to be thankful, more and more reasons to be grateful.
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.720]   Focus on reasons to be miserable.
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.240]   Your destiny is assured.
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.000]   I close this short message to you.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:07.240]   I thought it would be interesting to you for me to read President Abraham Lincoln's 1863
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.640]   Thanksgiving Day Proclamation.
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:14.440]   If you know anything about the history of Thanksgiving, it has a few different components
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:21.680]   in its history from early American history, a few different political movements.
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:26.920]   As with most things, it's a mixture of myth and fact.
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:33.320]   But in thinking about Thanksgiving, I pulled up again Lincoln's Thanksgiving Day Proclamation
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:39.440]   where prior to 1863, the different states and different parts of the United States celebrated
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:42.520]   Thanksgiving Day differently on different dates.
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:50.360]   And in 1863, almost as a political movement, Abraham Lincoln was trying to use, as any
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:59.920]   president does, he was trying to use the circumstances of the day to try to build more unity, especially
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:02.280]   around him and his actions.
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:07.720]   But I thought that this proclamation, which is pretty short, was really remarkable to
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:16.600]   read and in many ways it echoes themes that I see repeated in today's world as well.
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:21.360]   So without further commentary, I'll just read you this short presidential proclamation from
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.360]   President Lincoln.
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:26.480]   Washington, DC, October 3, 1863.
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:30.680]   By the President of the United States of America, a proclamation.
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:34.980]   The year that is drawing towards its close has been filled with the blessings of fruitful
[00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:37.880]   fields and healthful skies.
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:42.320]   To these bounties, which are so constantly enjoyed that we are prone to forget the source
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:48.000]   from which they come, others have been added, which are of so extraordinary a nature that
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.240]   they cannot fail to penetrate and soften even the heart which is habitually insensible to
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:57.760]   the ever watchful providence of Almighty God.
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:04.520]   In the midst of a civil war of unequaled magnitude and severity, which has sometimes seemed to
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:09.840]   foreign states to invite and to provoke their aggression, peace has been preserved with
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:16.400]   all nations, order has been maintained, the laws have been respected and obeyed, and harmony
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:20.720]   has prevailed everywhere except in the theater of military conflict.
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:24.880]   While that theater has been greatly contracted by the advancing armies and navies of the
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:30.520]   Union, needful diversions of wealth and of strength from the fields of peaceful industry
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:35.840]   to the national defense have not arrested the plow, the shuttle, or the ship.
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:42.000]   The axe has enlarged the borders of our settlements, and the mines, as well as iron and coal as
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.840]   of the precious metals, have yielded even more abundantly than heretofore.
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:53.040]   Population has steadily increased, notwithstanding the waste that has been made in the camp,
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:58.540]   the siege, and the battlefield, and the country, rejoicing in the consciousness of augmented
[00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:04.320]   strength and vigor, is permitted to expect continuance of years with large increase of
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.880]   freedom.
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:11.480]   No human counsel hath devised, nor hath any mortal hand worked out these great things.
[00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:16.280]   They are the gracious gifts of the Most High God, who, while dealing with us in anger for
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:20.440]   our sins, hath nevertheless remembered mercy.
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:27.880]   It has seemed to me fit and proper that they should be solemnly, reverently, and gratefully
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:32.760]   acknowledged as with one heart and one voice by the whole American people.
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:37.400]   I do therefore invite my fellow citizens in every part of the United States, and also
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:43.160]   those who are at sea and those who are sojourning in foreign lands, to set apart and observe
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:48.560]   the last Thursday of November next as a day of thanksgiving and praise to our beneficent
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.920]   Father who dwelleth in the heavens.
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:55.840]   And I recommend to them that, while offering up the ascriptions justly due to Him for such
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:01.160]   singular deliverances and blessings, they do also, with humble penitence for our national
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:07.640]   perverseness and disobedience, commend to His tender care all those who have become
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:13.920]   widows, orphans, mourners, or sufferers in the lamentable civil strife in which we are
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:20.760]   unavoidably engaged, and fervently implore the interposition of the Almighty Hand to
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:26.440]   heal the wounds of the nation, and to restore it as soon as may be consistent with the divine
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:34.160]   purposes to the full enjoyment of peace, harmony, tranquility, and union.
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:38.000]   And testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.400]   States to be affixed, done of the city of Washington the third day of October, in the
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:50.600]   year of our Lord, 1863, and of the independence of the United States, the 88th, by the President
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:54.400]   Abraham Lincoln.
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:58.680]   If I could, I would invite each and every one of you over to my home this week, and
[00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:02.280]   I would serve you the best food that I can make.
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:07.560]   And I would love to listen to you and hear about the many blessings of your life and
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:10.480]   share with you the many of mine.
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:18.120]   But in the same vein as President Lincoln said those many years ago, since I can't do
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:22.960]   that, I encourage you, create the tradition in your own home.
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:27.920]   Fill your home with love and joy and laughter.
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:30.320]   Prepare the best food that you can.
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:37.200]   Go and invite every person that you can.
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.760]   Make your table full.
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:41.140]   Go and find all of the people who are lonely.
[00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:43.800]   Go and find the people who are hungry.
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:48.880]   Fill your home with everybody that you can find, especially those who are in need.
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:56.320]   And may you enjoy a Thanksgiving Day filled with a heart truly filled with thanksgiving
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:10.520]   and gratitude for our many blessings.
