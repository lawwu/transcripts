[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.640]   Paul's second epistle to the Corinthians, the fourth chapter and the sixth verse.
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:18.080]   The sixth verse in the fourth chapter of Paul's second epistle to the Corinthians.
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:27.240]   "For God, who commended the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:34.560]   to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ."
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:41.960]   "For God, who commended the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:49.400]   to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ."
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:55.800]   The apostle here, as you remember from the reading at the beginning, gives us one of
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:03.920]   those few autobiographical passages that are to be found in his various writings.
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:11.480]   He refers to himself and to his own ministry, and he had a special reason for doing so.
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:19.920]   However, what is of interest to us is that in doing that, he seems once more to give
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:27.640]   us an account of his own conversion and of that great and dramatic and remarkable thing
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:34.640]   that happened to him as he was travelling down from Jerusalem to Damascus.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.620]   Now many of us have been considering together this great question of the conversion of this
[00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.960]   apostle for a number of Sunday nights.
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.280]   We have been doing so in order that we might learn from it the nature of conversion, the
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:56.240]   principles that govern it, in order that we may test and examine ourselves, and in order
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.560]   that we may know certainly and of assurity that what happened to him has happened to
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.800]   us.
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.000]   So we have analysed it, we have taken it in detail, we have considered the hindrances
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.960]   and the obstacles to conversion, we have considered the central, vital thing itself, which means
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:22.360]   meeting with the Lord Jesus Christ, and we have also considered some of the consequences
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:29.680]   of that, because the Scriptures are very careful to provide us with a number of tests which
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.400]   we can apply to ourselves in order that we may know for certain whether we are truly
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.600]   Christian or not.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.600]   The Bible has a great deal to tell us of what it calls false spirits.
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.120]   We are told not to trust every spirit, but to test the spirits in order to discover whether
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.760]   they are truly of God.
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.480]   There are even false Christs, it tells us, anti-Christs, those who in a way profess
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.440]   the name of Christ but essentially deny him.
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:09.840]   So we are told to prove all things and to hold fast only to that which is good.
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:16.400]   And as I say, we have been trying to do this in detail.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.720]   Now having done that, it seemed to me that it would be a very good thing for us once
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:30.160]   more to look at it as a whole, lest we become lost in the various details.
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.440]   And here in this statement, not only in this sixth verse but in the verses really that
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:42.680]   lead up to it, the apostle again gives us a view of it, he gives us a description of
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.680]   it.
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.760]   Of course it was something that he never forgot.
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.400]   It was such a vital turning point in his life and in his story.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.720]   This man, you remember, who had been brought up as a Pharisee and who had the very best
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.560]   training that a Pharisee could ever have, this man who had excelled all others in his
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:09.440]   knowledge of the law and in his zeal for the law and as he thought his zeal for God, this
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.760]   man who had hated the name of Christ and who had hated Christianity and who had hated the
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:20.380]   Christian church and Christian people and who imagined that he was doing God's service
[00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:29.940]   by trying to destroy them, you remember this man, this persecuting Jew, this arrogant Pharisee,
[00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:36.000]   this man who had gone to the authorities and asked for letters giving him the right to
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.720]   go down to Damascus to apprehend and to arrest the Christians worshipping there in order
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.800]   that he might bring them to trial and to destruction.
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:52.200]   You remember how he sets off upon his journey, breathing out threatenings and slaughter in
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.480]   a mad fury against Christ and his message.
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:04.340]   Do you remember how on that road he there suddenly about noonday saw that light in the
[00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:10.220]   heaven above the brightest shining of the sun and saw the face of the risen Lord Jesus
[00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:18.620]   Christ and how he fell on his back to the ground in helplessness and uttered his famous
[00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.980]   words "Who art thou Lord?"
[00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.460]   And how the answer came back "I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.
[00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:29.460]   It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks."
[00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.460]   And then he said "What wilt thou have me to do Lord?"
[00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:38.780]   And the reply came back "You must go to Damascus and then it shall be told thee what
[00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.500]   thou shalt do."
[00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:46.140]   And you remember that in all that we saw that we are face to face with this climactic, dramatic
[00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:55.060]   event which took place in this man's experience and turned him right round and sent him off
[00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:01.420]   as the greatest preacher and evangelist of the gospel that the church and the world have
[00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:02.420]   ever known.
[00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:08.860]   Well now I say it's not surprising that this man from time to time looks back upon
[00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:13.580]   that and here he's doing that very thing in this verse that we're looking at this
[00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.300]   evening.
[00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:22.620]   This is why he says "I'm preaching because of what God has done to me.
[00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:27.820]   Because God has given me this knowledge, he's made me a Christian and has sent me out to
[00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:31.100]   tell others about it."
[00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:40.820]   Now you notice that in giving an account of this great event, in describing his conversion,
[00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:48.420]   in telling us what it is that has happened to him, the apostle makes use of two pictures.
[00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:52.620]   The first picture he makes use of obviously is the one to which I've just been to that
[00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:57.020]   which happened to him himself on the road to Damascus.
[00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:06.340]   The light shining upon the darkness, the knowledge of the glory of God, yes, in the face of Jesus
[00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:08.700]   Christ.
[00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:11.980]   He never forgot that face.
[00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:16.500]   Everything had come to him through the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.500]   He saw the risen Lord.
[00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.460]   It wasn't a vision.
[00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:27.980]   It was an exceptional view of the risen glorified Lord that was given to this man in order that
[00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:34.500]   he might be an apostle and in order that he thereby might be a witness of the resurrection.
[00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.980]   It wasn't a vision I say.
[00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:42.700]   He really did see the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:45.300]   And he refers to that here.
[00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:51.860]   He puts it partly then in terms of his experience on the road to Damascus.
[00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:59.220]   The light shining and the face, the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:05.460]   But you notice that he couples with it another idea, and the two things of course are very
[00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:06.460]   similar.
[00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:12.660]   The thing he couples with it of course is an account of the creation of the world.
[00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:20.420]   He says God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness hath shined in our hearts.
[00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:24.320]   Now that takes us back, doesn't it, to the very beginning of the book of Genesis where
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.680]   you read this.
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:31.900]   In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
[00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:40.420]   And the earth was without form and vile, and darkness was upon the face of the deep.
[00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:45.420]   And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the water.
[00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:50.380]   And God said, "Let there be light."
[00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:53.220]   And there was light.
[00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:58.220]   And God saw the light that it was good and divided the light from the darkness.
[00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:02.220]   And God called the light day and the darkness he called night.
[00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:06.740]   And the evening and the morning were the first day.
[00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:13.100]   That is the beginning of the account of the creation of the world.
[00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:16.300]   God commanded the light.
[00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:18.540]   God said, "Let there be light."
[00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:20.980]   And there was light.
[00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:27.980]   And that was the first move, the first step in the entire creation of the world.
[00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:34.740]   Now you see in this verse that we are considering tonight, the apostle in giving an account
[00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:38.340]   of himself as a Christian.
[00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:45.980]   And in telling us as to how it was that he became a Christian, takes those two ideas,
[00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:50.380]   his own experience on the road to Damascus, and that which happened at the creation of
[00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:55.260]   the world at the very beginning, and he blends them together.
[00:09:55.260 --> 00:10:02.700]   And through this double picture he gives us this very vivid representation and portrayal
[00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:08.260]   of what it is that happens when a man becomes a Christian.
[00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:13.300]   Now I want to consider it with you in the light of this picture.
[00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:18.500]   You see the controlling idea again is this.
[00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:23.460]   The apostle wants to give us an impression of the profundity of the change.
[00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:29.620]   Oh, to become a Christian is a very profound thing.
[00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:33.020]   Oh, to become a Christian is not a superficial thing.
[00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:34.980]   It's not an easy thing.
[00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:39.060]   It isn't something that happens on the surface.
[00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:45.740]   It is the profoundest change that can ever take place in anybody's life and experience.
[00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:50.980]   Now the apostle not only says that here, he says it everywhere else.
[00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:55.460]   You see according to this apostolic teaching, and it's exactly the same in the teaching
[00:10:55.460 --> 00:11:04.580]   of all the other biblical writers, when a man becomes a Christian, when one is taken
[00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:10.540]   from the world into the church, if you like, when one ceases to be an unbeliever and becomes
[00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:18.900]   a believer, what takes place is as big and as profound as this, that nothing less than
[00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:26.380]   an idea of creation is adequate to convey the idea.
[00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:30.940]   The apostle goes on using this same figure, you remember, in the next chapter, in the
[00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.460]   17th verse of the fifth chapter of this epistle.
[00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:40.260]   He says, "Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature."
[00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:46.860]   Some would prefer to translate it, "If any man be in Christ, he is a new creation."
[00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:56.260]   And it's exactly what our Lord, you remember, said to Nicodemus, "You must be born again.
[00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.780]   You must be regenerated."
[00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:04.180]   Now I say that becoming a Christian, therefore, must never be thought of as something which
[00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:09.860]   is superficial, merely a step, a simple step which someone takes.
[00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:15.300]   Becoming really a Christian is comparable to a creation.
[00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:24.020]   The action of God when he made the world out of nothing and said, "Let there be light."
[00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:31.180]   So that again, you see, as we examine ourselves, we must do so in the light of some such statement
[00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:34.380]   as that.
[00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:41.700]   Are we aware of a working of God within us which reminds us of the very creation of the
[00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:44.700]   world?
[00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:49.580]   Are we aware that there is something about us which differentiates us from those who
[00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:52.820]   don't claim to be Christians?
[00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:57.780]   Which can only be described adequately in terms of this, that God who made the world
[00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:03.340]   out of nothing and commended the light to shine out of darkness, has shined in our hearts,
[00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:08.460]   has done something comparable.
[00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:14.860]   Now we spent an evening a few Sunday nights ago in considering Paul's astonishment.
[00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:17.500]   It's all here again, isn't it?
[00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:22.820]   I say again, my friends, that unless we are astonished at what we are, unless we are astonished
[00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:29.580]   at what God has done to us, I would suggest that we again examine the foundations and
[00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:33.180]   make sure whether we are Christian at all.
[00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:34.660]   The apostle says, "This is it.
[00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:36.300]   This is what has happened to me.
[00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:41.220]   It's the same God who acted like that, who has acted in me.
[00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:45.780]   And I am what I am because God has done this to me."
[00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:52.780]   Well now then, very well, let us take this great conception, this profound change which
[00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:57.220]   takes place in the soul and makes it Christian.
[00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:01.940]   And let us try to measure it in terms of this picture.
[00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:04.340]   What is it the apostle is really teaching us?
[00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:09.380]   Well I think that you will agree with me that we can deduce the following very legitimately.
[00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:13.020]   Indeed we are driven to do so.
[00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:20.700]   He first of all presents us in this picture with the state of men by nature.
[00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:29.140]   He first of all gives us a representation of men as he is born into this world and without
[00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:33.100]   the effect of the gospel upon him.
[00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:38.780]   And you notice that with regard to that he has got two things to say.
[00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:46.300]   The first thing he tells us about men by nature is that he is in a state of darkness and he
[00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:50.380]   is in a state of ignorance.
[00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:59.740]   God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, or if you like, into the darkness,
[00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:04.940]   light darkness, hath shined, he says, into our hearts.
[00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:06.140]   What for?
[00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:10.060]   To give the light of the knowledge.
[00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:14.580]   Knowledge as over against ignorance.
[00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:22.100]   Now there I say is the basic postulate of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:28.660]   Men by nature, untouched and unaffected by the gospel, by the power of God in the gospel,
[00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:33.380]   is in a state of darkness, he is in a state of ignorance.
[00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:36.660]   Take up the other comparison, if you like, the creation of the world.
[00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:42.940]   Man as he is by nature is exactly as the world was before God said, "Let there be light."
[00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:46.900]   Darkness we are told brooded over the face of the deep.
[00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:54.860]   It was a state of chaos, a state of darkness, a complete absence of light.
[00:15:54.860 --> 00:16:01.660]   Now obviously it is very fundamental that we should be clear about this.
[00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:06.060]   And we have no excuse if we are not clear about it because the Bible is full of this
[00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:08.660]   sort of teaching.
[00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:13.140]   How frequently does it represent the coming of the gospel, the coming of Christ into the
[00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:15.820]   world in terms of light?
[00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:19.940]   Go back to the beginning of your gospels and you'll find that it puts it like this, "The
[00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:24.060]   people that sat in darkness have seen a great light."
[00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:30.340]   There's the idea, sitting in darkness and they see the light.
[00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:36.140]   This self-same apostle tells us that those that be drunken are be drunken in the night.
[00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:40.460]   The Bible talks about the hidden works of darkness.
[00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:44.860]   We read in the third chapter of John, "This is the condemnation that light is come into
[00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:51.620]   the world and men love darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil."
[00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:53.740]   You've got it everywhere.
[00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:54.740]   Light and darkness.
[00:16:54.740 --> 00:17:00.300]   It's always this comparison of the creation, the first step in which is the coming of the
[00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:05.900]   light and the separating of the day and the night.
[00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:10.500]   Well now what does it mean by this picture?
[00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:16.580]   When I say that man as he is by nature is in a state of darkness and in a state of ignorance,
[00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:18.020]   what exactly do I mean?
[00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:22.340]   Well let me put it in this form.
[00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:28.460]   Man is in a state of spiritual ignorance.
[00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:32.380]   Obviously man has a great deal of knowledge.
[00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:35.660]   Man knows many things.
[00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:41.620]   Our world is full of books, it's full of people who are reading, and everybody is out
[00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:44.140]   for information and knowledge and instruction.
[00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:46.820]   There's a great deal of knowledge in the world.
[00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:50.140]   The Bible doesn't dispute that, it doesn't deny that.
[00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:54.480]   It has nothing to say against scientific development and advance.
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:57.860]   It has nothing to say about the increase in culture and in knowledge.
[00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:01.600]   It grants it all, it admits it all.
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:08.000]   But what it does say from beginning to end is this, that however much man may know and
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:16.700]   however great the knowledge that he is amassed, left to himself and until he becomes a Christian,
[00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:22.100]   he is in a state of spiritual ignorance and darkness.
[00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:23.780]   He has no light at all.
[00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:24.780]   About what?
[00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:25.780]   Well here are some of the things.
[00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:32.100]   According to the Bible, a man who is not a Christian really is in the dark and is ignorant
[00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:37.900]   about himself and about his own true nature.
[00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:41.420]   He's ignorant even about men.
[00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:45.060]   And I suggest to you that this is something which is very obvious in this modern world
[00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:46.460]   of ours.
[00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:52.980]   Take the average conception of men and as to what man is.
[00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:56.980]   How do we think of men instinctively?
[00:18:56.980 --> 00:19:01.440]   What is the view of men taken by the vast majority of people in the world tonight?
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:05.860]   And I'm not merely thinking of those people who never use their minds at all and who live
[00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:09.140]   simply as animals to eat and drink and things like that.
[00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:12.040]   I'm thinking of the best thinkers.
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:13.300]   What is their view of men?
[00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:20.900]   Still they leave out the highest and the greatest thing in men which is his soul, his spirit.
[00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:27.660]   There is an ignorance and a darkness about the very nature and being and constitution
[00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:29.900]   of men.
[00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:31.620]   Man is regarded as an animal.
[00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:36.580]   He's regarded as a reasoning animal, a clever animal, an animal that's developed a little
[00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:40.420]   bit more than the other animals, but they stop at the animal level and at the animal
[00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:43.380]   conception.
[00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:47.660]   And the real tragedy and the essence of the trouble in the world tonight is that man doesn't
[00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:51.140]   realize the truth about himself.
[00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:55.500]   He thinks of himself as just a creature who is nothing but a conglomeration of lusts and
[00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:57.140]   passions and desires.
[00:19:57.140 --> 00:19:59.520]   He's interested in eating and drinking and pleasure.
[00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:01.020]   He wants certain things.
[00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:05.420]   That's his view of himself.
[00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:12.020]   And because that is his view of himself, he lives as he does.
[00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:17.180]   The explanation of the sin and the shame and the trouble in the world tonight is finally
[00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:23.140]   man's totally inadequate realization of the truth about himself.
[00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:30.180]   Oh, my dear friends, if man only knew what man is, there'd never be another war.
[00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:34.740]   If man only saw himself as he was made by God and as the Bible depicts him, he'd never
[00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:38.580]   be taking life as he does.
[00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:41.220]   Men wouldn't deal with one another as they do.
[00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:42.900]   Life wouldn't be in the chaotic condition.
[00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:47.660]   It is if man only realized the truth about man.
[00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:50.500]   But that's the final tragedy.
[00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:54.380]   And what makes it a tragedy, of course, is this.
[00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:59.620]   What really heightens the tragedy is that man, in his blindness and in his ignorance,
[00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:05.580]   thinks that he's got a marvelous new conception of man superior to that of the Bible.
[00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:09.980]   And he ridicules the Bible and he laughs at it as something that keeps a man down and
[00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:13.820]   keeps him as a child.
[00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:18.100]   The fact of the matter is that there is no view or conception of man in the world tonight
[00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:23.940]   that anywhere approaches the biblical view, which tells us that man is made in the image
[00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:32.060]   of God, fashioned and patterned after God himself, whatever that may mean in detail.
[00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:38.660]   Man is a creature made by God and meant for God and meant for correspondence with God,
[00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:44.260]   made the Lord of the creation, meant to live as a prince.
[00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:48.740]   But how different is the view of the average person of men tonight?
[00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:49.740]   Why?
[00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:50.740]   Well, he's ignorant about men.
[00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:53.860]   He's in darkness about his own constitution.
[00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:58.060]   His own being, his own nature.
[00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:02.100]   And because of that initial misconception, of course, he is equally ignorant about his
[00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:09.620]   life in this world and about the purpose of life in this world.
[00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:15.060]   Have you ever stopped for a moment and sat down and asked yourselves these questions?
[00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:16.060]   What is life?
[00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:17.060]   What's it for?
[00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:18.060]   What's it mean?
[00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:19.060]   What's it all about?
[00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:21.940]   What's it designed unto?
[00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:28.380]   Now I say that the man who is not a Christian is in darkness about that.
[00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:31.720]   He very rarely stops even to consider it.
[00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:36.500]   He just goes on from hour to hour and from day to day and never looks at himself from
[00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:40.700]   the outside and asks himself, "Well, what is it all about?
[00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:44.060]   Why am I here and what am I meant to be?"
[00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:45.840]   He's in ignorance about that.
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:49.380]   He doesn't even consider it.
[00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:54.380]   And going along still further, we see his appalling ignorance about God and about men's
[00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:59.500]   relationship to God.
[00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:04.700]   Paul says here that when he became a Christian, what happened to him was that the light of
[00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:11.480]   the knowledge of the glory of God came to him.
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:13.900]   And is there anything more appalling than this?
[00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:20.980]   The ignorance of mankind of God and of the glory of God?
[00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:23.720]   What does the man who's not a Christian know about God?
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:28.780]   He simply mentions the name of God to swear, to curse, to blaspheme.
[00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:31.020]   It's a word that he uses without thinking.
[00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:36.060]   What does he really know about God?
[00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:41.180]   The psalmist says the heavens declare the glory of God.
[00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:44.460]   Does man without Christ see it?
[00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:48.980]   Does he see God and the knowledge of God and the glory of God everywhere in creation, around
[00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:50.500]   and about him?
[00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:56.620]   The great almighty eternal God who sits upon the universe and who controls everything.
[00:23:56.620 --> 00:24:00.860]   What does man who's not a Christian know about this God?
[00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:03.880]   Yeah, let me ask another question.
[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:07.780]   What does he care about this God?
[00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:10.780]   That's the darkness I'm speaking about.
[00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:14.300]   That's the ignorance which I'm trying to emphasize.
[00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:19.340]   Think of the teeming masses of men and women in this world this evening who are passing
[00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:24.700]   their time in sheer pleasure, in animal enjoyment, and things even worse.
[00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:25.700]   Think of them.
[00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:32.300]   There they are with never a thought about God, never a moment given to contemplation
[00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:36.340]   of him, this great eternal almighty being.
[00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:41.660]   They live as if he was not and as if he didn't exist at all, the appalling ignorance and
[00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:48.540]   darkness of men with respect to God.
[00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:56.300]   Is it surprising that the apostle uses these terms, darkness and ignorance?
[00:24:56.300 --> 00:25:03.420]   And then of course added to this comes the next thing inevitably, man's eternal destiny.
[00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:08.260]   He doesn't know himself, he doesn't see the meaning of life, he's forgotten God,
[00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:17.260]   and obviously therefore he's utterly in the dark as to his own destiny.
[00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:26.740]   And the end of life in this world and death and what lies beyond it.
[00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:31.100]   Am I exaggerating when I say that this is the cause of the trouble that men is in, ignorance
[00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:36.900]   and darkness about these things?
[00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:43.060]   Do you ask me to believe that the average person would go on living as he does if he
[00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:52.460]   really understood that it is appointed unto men once to die and after death the judgment?
[00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:58.340]   Does man really know that when he ends this life in this world and shuffles off this mortal
[00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:06.940]   coil that he'll stand before his maker and creator in a final judgment and that there
[00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:12.300]   is an eternal destiny awaiting him on the one side or on the other?
[00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:15.380]   Is the world aware of that?
[00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:20.780]   Could the world go on living as it does if it did know that?
[00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:26.380]   My dear friends, there is no answer.
[00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:30.780]   Man is in a state of gross darkness.
[00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:35.860]   He is ignorant, unutterably ignorant, about these most vital things.
[00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:42.100]   Oh, I know he has this amazing knowledge about the atom, he understands philosophy and various
[00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:48.620]   other things, but what boots it all when with regard to these things he's in gross darkness
[00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:55.060]   and in appalling ignorance?
[00:26:55.060 --> 00:27:03.700]   I am asserting this, I say, once more on the authority of the Bible, not only about those
[00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:09.620]   who obviously never take any trouble at all to think, but even about the best and the
[00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:13.540]   highest thinkers of the world.
[00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:17.700]   Have you ever heard the story, I wonder, of something that happened here in London about
[00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:23.100]   a hundred and fifty years ago?
[00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:27.620]   There was a great Prime Minister in this country in those days and his name was William Pitt
[00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:32.060]   the Younger.
[00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:38.460]   He had a very great friend called William Wilberforce, the great pioneer and leader
[00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:41.500]   in the anti-slavery movement, the abolition of slavery.
[00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:45.660]   You remember the name?
[00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:53.740]   William Wilberforce, as you know, was a great Christian man who had undergone this vital
[00:27:53.740 --> 00:28:01.460]   experience of conversion, who had seen himself as a sinner and who had seen that his only
[00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:06.220]   hope was to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and his work for him.
[00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:10.400]   He was a great Christian man.
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:17.340]   He was a great and lifelong friend of William Pitt, the Prime Minister.
[00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:23.500]   William Pitt was a formal Christian, by which I mean that he went to the house of God now
[00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:32.580]   and again, as such great men so often do, on state occasions and things like that, but
[00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:39.500]   he hadn't the vital experience of his friend William Wilberforce.
[00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:44.980]   On one occasion Wilberforce took William Pitt to listen to a certain preacher who then preached
[00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:50.820]   here in London called Richard Cecil.
[00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:57.100]   Nothing gave Wilberforce greater delight than to listen to Cecil because of his spiritual
[00:28:57.100 --> 00:29:03.340]   preaching, because of his outlining of the gospel and its mighty works.
[00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:08.140]   He was so anxious that his friend the Prime Minister should go and listen to Cecil.
[00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:12.360]   He'd often asked him, and somehow there was always an excuse, but at last the day
[00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:17.060]   came when William Pitt said he'd go and he went with William Wilberforce to listen
[00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:20.180]   to Richard Cecil.
[00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:25.540]   Wilberforce was delighted, and that morning, as it happened to be, Cecil was preaching
[00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:33.020]   at his very best and outlining the glories and the wonders of this great salvation.
[00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:39.620]   And Wilberforce's heart was ravished and his mind was delighted, and he wondered what
[00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:44.740]   was happening to his friend the great Prime Minister.
[00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:50.780]   They got eventually out of the service, but before William Wilberforce had an opportunity
[00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:57.700]   of saying anything to William Pitt, Pitt said to Wilberforce, "You know, Wilberforce,"
[00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:01.740]   he said, "I did my best to listen to that man.
[00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:05.980]   I really did concentrate with the whole of my being, but you know," he said, "I
[00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:12.380]   haven't the slightest idea as to what he's been talking about.
[00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:15.340]   Need I explain what I mean?
[00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:21.300]   You can be a very great man and a very great Prime Minister, yet you can be spiritually
[00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:27.620]   dead and suffering from gross darkness and complete ignorance of spiritual truth."
[00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:36.820]   No doubt Pitt, in many ways, was an abler man and a bigger man than William Wilberforce,
[00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:42.340]   but when you come face to face with these things, Wilberforce had lightened knowledge.
[00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:49.820]   Pitt was in darkness and utter ignorance.
[00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:54.460]   And that's the only distinction the Bible is interested in.
[00:30:54.460 --> 00:31:00.780]   And its proclamation is that man, as he is by nature, is blind, is dark, is ignorant.
[00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:02.380]   He doesn't know these things.
[00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:04.020]   He doesn't take an interest in them.
[00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:05.380]   They mean nothing to him.
[00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:06.700]   They're boring to him.
[00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:11.300]   He doesn't know what the preacher's talking about.
[00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:21.620]   Ignorance and darkness, and perhaps supremely ignorant of this, that he is blinded by the
[00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:30.140]   God of this world and held in slavery and serfdom by him, and that all his vaunted freedom
[00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:36.620]   and liberty is nothing but a liberty within the limits imposed upon him by the God of
[00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:39.580]   this world of whom the apostle here speaks.
[00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:41.620]   Well, that's the first thing.
[00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:44.380]   Let me hurry to the second thing.
[00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:49.180]   The second thing, of course, that characterizes man by nature in the light of this illustration,
[00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:54.700]   this picture, is obviously chaos.
[00:31:54.700 --> 00:32:01.780]   We read there at the beginning of Genesis that the world was without form and vibe.
[00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:03.820]   It was in a chaotic condition.
[00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:09.540]   Matter as it then existed had no order and no arrangement whatsoever.
[00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:11.440]   It was without form.
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:18.260]   It was absolutely void, empty in that sense.
[00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:23.100]   The apostle uses this particular picture and illustration in order to convey that truth
[00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:30.140]   to us concerning man as he is in life in this world without the light of the knowledge of
[00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:33.900]   the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:38.580]   Let me put it bluntly in a phrase.
[00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:43.060]   Life without Christ is chaos.
[00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:45.380]   It's just chaotic.
[00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:47.380]   Now can I substantiate that statement?
[00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:52.380]   Well I suggest to you that I can.
[00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:56.140]   To start with, it has no form whatsoever.
[00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:58.700]   It has no shape.
[00:32:58.700 --> 00:32:59.700]   There is no order.
[00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:04.340]   There is no arrangement about it.
[00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:10.300]   And as you look at life today and as you read your newspapers and your books and your journals,
[00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:14.140]   doesn't that shout at you?
[00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:18.940]   Don't you get this impression that the people are indeed, as the scriptures put it elsewhere,
[00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:20.740]   using a different picture?
[00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:24.700]   As sheep without a shepherd, there doesn't seem to be any purpose.
[00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:26.940]   Everything seems to be aimless.
[00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:28.220]   Let us eat, drink, and be merry.
[00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:30.220]   You see, for tomorrow we die.
[00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:31.860]   They've got no purpose in life.
[00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:33.140]   They've got no direction.
[00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:36.340]   They've got no objective.
[00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:40.860]   There isn't a shape to the life of the non-Christian.
[00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:42.180]   He doesn't know what's happening.
[00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:48.700]   He doesn't understand it, and nobody else can.
[00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:53.460]   Life without Christ is self-contradictory.
[00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:58.220]   People defend themselves at one point and then go and deny that very thing at another
[00:33:58.220 --> 00:33:59.220]   point.
[00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:01.500]   They condemn certain people for doing certain things.
[00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:03.740]   They don't see that they do it themselves.
[00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:06.780]   That's the statement of the epistle to the Romans about them.
[00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:09.820]   The thing is contradictory.
[00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:16.500]   Without form, quite void, with warring, fighting elements, that's what produces chaos, isn't
[00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:19.140]   it?
[00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:20.860]   Don't we use the term in that way?
[00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:26.100]   We say about certain situations, "The whole place was absolutely chaotic," we say.
[00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:30.060]   It may have been in the home when something exceptional was taking place.
[00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:33.220]   It may have been at a railway station when there was a breakdown.
[00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:35.060]   It may have been an accident on the road.
[00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:37.620]   We said everything was in a state of chaos.
[00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:40.660]   Things were coming and going somewhere across the road.
[00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:42.580]   Everything we say is absolutely chaotic.
[00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:44.580]   You couldn't make sense or meaning of it.
[00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:51.860]   Life, we are told, without Christ is like that.
[00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:56.140]   And isn't the life of men like that individually?
[00:34:56.140 --> 00:34:58.980]   There are warring elements.
[00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:01.100]   We want to be good and then we are bad.
[00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:04.740]   We decide to be better and we become worse.
[00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:06.940]   There is that within us which wants purity.
[00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:09.780]   There is that within us which delights in lust.
[00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:13.780]   That's chaos.
[00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:16.040]   We want to be good and bad at the same time.
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:19.620]   We want heaven and yet we want hell in this world.
[00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:23.340]   Our whole life is chaotic and contradictory and confusing.
[00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:29.460]   The whole state of men is that of confusion.
[00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:33.540]   And the result of that is, of course, that nothing is produced.
[00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:39.580]   While the world, the material elements of the world were like that before God commended
[00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:45.460]   the light to shine out of darkness, there was no grass, nothing grew, there was no life,
[00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:47.940]   there was no production.
[00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:52.140]   Chaotic conditions always are unproductive.
[00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:55.540]   Nothing can happen because of this contradictory element.
[00:35:55.540 --> 00:36:03.620]   Everything fighting against everything else and everything reduced to a state of disorder.
[00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:09.940]   And that is the state of men apart from Jesus Christ.
[00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:15.140]   Oh my dear friends, I don't stand here simply to paint pictures.
[00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:22.020]   This is a very personal gospel so I don't hesitate to put this personal question.
[00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:27.020]   What's the state of your life at this moment?
[00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:29.120]   Is it ordered?
[00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:31.160]   Is it whole?
[00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:34.860]   Is it guided by reason, by understanding?
[00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:37.580]   Is it productive?
[00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:40.620]   Do you know where you are?
[00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:46.100]   Is there really an objective and a goal in your life or are you just a victim of circumstance
[00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:50.260]   and chance, the victim of other people and what they do and what they think and what
[00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:54.100]   they say?
[00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:57.700]   Where is your life?
[00:36:57.700 --> 00:37:04.140]   So many people have to admit and to confess, they say, "I'm in an awful mess."
[00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:07.240]   And they're saying the truth.
[00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:10.100]   They say, "My life has gone to pieces.
[00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:12.580]   I'm in an utterly chaotic condition."
[00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:16.900]   And we are told that life apart from Christ is like that.
[00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:21.620]   It's darkness and ignorance and it's chaos.
[00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:27.100]   And what we are told here is that men in that condition can do nothing whatsoever about
[00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:30.340]   it.
[00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:33.580]   He cannot, of course, because he's not even aware of it.
[00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:37.140]   His ignorance prevents him.
[00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:42.780]   But still more, the apostle says here that even if a man were told something about it,
[00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:47.980]   he still cannot because he says, "If our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are
[00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:56.340]   lost in whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the
[00:37:56.340 --> 00:38:05.780]   light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine into them."
[00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:15.420]   And there is man in the darkness, in the ignorance, in the chaos.
[00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:22.820]   And I say that he remains there until the God who commanded the light to shine out of
[00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:28.900]   darkness shines in his heart to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the
[00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:30.740]   face of Jesus Christ.
[00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:37.380]   Haven't we been seeing it as we've looked at the case of this man, Paul?
[00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:43.380]   It was there on the road to Damascus he saw himself and his condition.
[00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:52.380]   It was there he saw Christ and the result was, well, exactly what he tells us here.
[00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:58.060]   The first thing that happens is that one is given light.
[00:38:58.060 --> 00:39:02.300]   God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness has shined in our hearts.
[00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:03.300]   What for?
[00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:09.460]   To give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:15.340]   My dear friend, to be a Christian means that you have received certain knowledge.
[00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:17.420]   It isn't merely experience.
[00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:24.180]   It isn't experience, but it's experience born of knowledge, light of the knowledge
[00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:28.180]   of the glory of God.
[00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:30.260]   And that is what had happened to this man.
[00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:36.740]   He was given this knowledge, this light, this instruction about himself and his condition
[00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:42.180]   and his relationship to God and his utter hopelessness and helplessness.
[00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:51.340]   And then, in the face of Jesus Christ, he saw the way out of it all.
[00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:58.420]   The one who had come to deliver him and to set him free, to bring him pardon and to reconcile
[00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:03.740]   him to God.
[00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:10.300]   And this is the only hope for the individual and the only hope for the world this night.
[00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:19.100]   The light, the knowledge, the understanding that comes and comes alone in and through
[00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:22.860]   our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:25.780]   Paul saw him and everything changed.
[00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:27.420]   He knew his sins forgiven.
[00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:29.500]   He knew he was reconciled to God.
[00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:31.120]   He became a child of God.
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:37.020]   It was the knowledge of Jesus Christ and the atoning death, the resurrection that gave
[00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:42.620]   him the knowledge, and all was changed.
[00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:48.820]   And it's that that I want to emphasize as I close this evening.
[00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:57.780]   The result of knowing and believing on the Lord Jesus Christ is that chaos is replaced
[00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:01.500]   by order.
[00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:05.420]   And what a wonderful thing this is.
[00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:08.020]   Order in thought.
[00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:13.140]   I said that the man who is not a Christian is lacking in his knowledge, in his ideas
[00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:15.620]   about life.
[00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:22.620]   But when the light of Christ comes, a man's life becomes ordered and primarily in the
[00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:26.500]   matter of thought.
[00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:32.060]   One begins to see life steadily and to see it whole.
[00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:37.300]   One begins to understand the whole object and purpose of life.
[00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:41.900]   One begins to see why things are as they are in this world.
[00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:49.260]   One can see now that one's misery and wretchedness and failure are due to sin, due to the estrangement
[00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:54.660]   from God, due to the influence of the devil, Satan.
[00:41:54.660 --> 00:42:02.500]   And one can see that the whole world is as it is because of this activity.
[00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:08.260]   So that one is no longer perplexed and finds it difficult to understand the state of one's
[00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:11.020]   own soul and the state of the whole world.
[00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:19.900]   There is an explanation of the world in the Bible and in the Bible alone.
[00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:29.820]   But given this light and this knowledge in Christ, given this new life in Christ, life
[00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:35.620]   no longer becomes aimless and pointless.
[00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:43.420]   The Christian is a man who sees himself as but a journeyman, as a stranger, a traveller,
[00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:48.460]   a sojourner in this life and in this world.
[00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:52.540]   He realizes that he's a child of eternity.
[00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:54.140]   This isn't the only world.
[00:42:54.140 --> 00:43:00.060]   He begins to know about another world, the world about which William Pitt was so ignorant.
[00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:01.860]   The Christian knows about it.
[00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:07.820]   Listen to Paul putting it, "Our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a
[00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:14.740]   far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory while we look not at the things which are
[00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:18.580]   seen but at the things which are not seen.
[00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:24.980]   For the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal."
[00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:26.620]   What is my secret, says Paul?
[00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:27.620]   It's this.
[00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:35.580]   I know that I belong to a life and to a world that are unseen.
[00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:37.740]   He once knew this world only.
[00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:39.500]   He now knows about another.
[00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:41.580]   His spiritual eyes have been opened.
[00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:43.380]   He saw Christ from heaven.
[00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:47.340]   The world of spirit and of reality has been opened to him.
[00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:53.300]   This world he sees as a passing world and it is.
[00:43:53.300 --> 00:44:03.740]   Princes, the kings, the great ones of this world, they come and go, princes and lords,
[00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:06.100]   may flourish or may fade.
[00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:11.140]   A breath can make them as a breath hath made.
[00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:16.380]   The Christian has a view of this world and its pomp and its glory and its ceremony.
[00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:21.380]   He sees it dying, disappearing.
[00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:29.220]   He knows that the boast of heraldry and the pomp of power and all that beauty, all that
[00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:33.660]   wealth air gave, await a like the inevitable hour.
[00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:37.780]   The paths of glory lead back to the grave.
[00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:41.980]   Wait in this world, yes, but it's coming to an end.
[00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:46.620]   What then?
[00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:51.940]   The Christian knows he's seen through this world.
[00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:54.420]   He's seen beyond this world.
[00:44:54.420 --> 00:45:01.100]   He sees the blessed hope, the heaven of God awaiting him so his life becomes a purposeful
[00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:02.100]   life.
[00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:04.260]   He says this is the life of contradictions.
[00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:05.660]   I don't belong to it.
[00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:07.540]   It influences me and I fall.
[00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:09.140]   Nevertheless I'm a child of God.
[00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:10.940]   I get up and I go on.
[00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:11.940]   This isn't all.
[00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:13.660]   This is transient, evanescent.
[00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:14.660]   I follow on.
[00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:15.660]   I'm with Christ.
[00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:20.300]   I'll go after him.
[00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:24.700]   His life becomes an ordered life.
[00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:28.940]   Did you notice what Paul tells us here about his experience?
[00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:36.140]   If ever a man was surrounded by trials and tribulations and troubles, it was this apostle.
[00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:38.980]   Read this chapter again and read his list.
[00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:41.460]   Everything's going against him, round and about him.
[00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:42.540]   Is he chaotic?
[00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:43.540]   Not at all.
[00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:52.260]   He's in a world of chaos, but he sees straight through it and he walks straight through it.
[00:45:52.260 --> 00:46:00.060]   Though the world around him is chaotic and contradictory, he is in a state of order and
[00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:01.060]   of peace.
[00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:07.820]   There is a purpose in his life and a goal for his destiny.
[00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:14.460]   And the result of all this is, of course, that his life becomes disciplined and controlled.
[00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:18.140]   He sees sin for what it is.
[00:46:18.140 --> 00:46:24.980]   He doesn't merely see the paint and the powder and the garish signs and all the joviality.
[00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:29.460]   He sees the hand of the devil and of hell behind it all.
[00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:35.580]   He sees the destruction to which it's leading.
[00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:43.980]   The Christian is like Moses, of whom we are told this, that he preferred to suffer affliction
[00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:51.020]   with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season.
[00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:52.020]   He's disciplined.
[00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:53.020]   He's controlled.
[00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:55.780]   He sees things for what they are.
[00:46:55.780 --> 00:46:57.140]   He sees behind them.
[00:46:57.140 --> 00:46:59.100]   He sees the principle involved.
[00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:01.980]   So he disciplines, he controls his life.
[00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:09.660]   He's searching for holiness and for cleanliness and purity.
[00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:16.340]   And at the center of it all, he's enjoying a great peace.
[00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:22.980]   He knows something about a peace of God that passeth all understanding, of which the world
[00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:25.360]   can never rob him.
[00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:26.540]   It can despise him.
[00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:28.220]   It can persecute him.
[00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:29.500]   It can laugh at him.
[00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:31.260]   It can throw him into prisons.
[00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:32.260]   It can execute him.
[00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:34.780]   Still he has this peace.
[00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:36.520]   He knows where he's going.
[00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:38.500]   He knows in whom he has believed.
[00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:44.220]   The order, the discipline remain.
[00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:49.340]   He is no longer a victim of circumstance and chance.
[00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:57.260]   He cares not what the so-called slings and arrows of outrageous fortune may do to him.
[00:47:57.260 --> 00:47:59.340]   There's a plan in his life.
[00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:01.760]   There's an order in his being.
[00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:04.580]   He sees things clearly.
[00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:07.740]   He's got his eye on the invisible realities.
[00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:12.660]   He says the things that are seen are temporal, the things which are not seen are eternal,
[00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:16.500]   and he keeps his gaze steadfastly fixed upon them.
[00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:18.180]   And on he goes.
[00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:21.740]   What's the cause of it all?
[00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:26.500]   It is the light that has shined out of darkness.
[00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:31.620]   He has had a knowledge of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:36.700]   He is a man who says to himself, "The one thing that matters to me is my relationship
[00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:38.980]   to God.
[00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:43.900]   Men and women round and about me will all be soon dead as I shall be dead myself.
[00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:46.900]   I care not that they laugh at me in the office tomorrow morning.
[00:48:46.900 --> 00:48:52.220]   I care not that I may lose my professional status, that I become a pauper.
[00:48:52.220 --> 00:48:53.220]   I care not.
[00:48:53.220 --> 00:48:56.820]   Let the whole world mock and laugh and jeer.
[00:48:56.820 --> 00:49:05.140]   If I'm right with God, all is well with my soul."
[00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:07.980]   That's the position of the Christian.
[00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:15.180]   The light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ has reduced
[00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:28.780]   the chaos to order, the formless void waste has become a garden of the Lord, a paradise
[00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:34.460]   within his central, innermost being.
[00:49:34.460 --> 00:49:43.940]   My dear friend, is that your condition?
[00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:50.620]   I can put it all in one question.
[00:49:50.620 --> 00:50:04.540]   Is the one big thing in your life at this moment your relationship to God?
[00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:07.580]   That's the test.
[00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:16.900]   If that is not central, if that isn't the biggest thing in your mind and in your life,
[00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:22.980]   well then I say you have not had the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the
[00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:28.500]   face of Jesus Christ.
[00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:33.940]   And if you haven't, this is what Paul says about you.
[00:50:33.940 --> 00:50:46.020]   If our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost, in whom the God of this world hath
[00:50:46.020 --> 00:50:53.500]   blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ,
[00:50:53.500 --> 00:51:00.460]   who is the image of God, should shine into them.
[00:51:00.460 --> 00:51:09.980]   Once this light comes and gives a man knowledge of God, he desires nothing else.
[00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:14.140]   That is everything, that is all.
[00:51:14.140 --> 00:51:20.700]   And in Christ it is shining in this world tonight.
[00:51:20.700 --> 00:51:26.340]   He came into it nearly two thousand long years ago.
[00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:31.020]   It's shining in the babe of Bethlehem.
[00:51:31.020 --> 00:51:36.220]   It's shining in the boy at the age of twelve there in the temple.
[00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:40.620]   It's shining in the young man who begins to preach at the age of thirty.
[00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:46.140]   It's shining in all its radiance and its glory from the cross.
[00:51:46.140 --> 00:51:53.300]   It's shining even in the grave and on the resurrection morn.
[00:51:53.300 --> 00:52:00.500]   It is shining in this world still through the operation of the Holy Spirit.
[00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:05.420]   My dear friend, have you seen it even here tonight?
[00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:10.900]   That is all I am called to do, to stand here and allow this light of the knowledge of the
[00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:16.820]   glory of God in the face of Christ to pass through me to you.
[00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:22.140]   It's my privilege to be a little lamp and nothing else.
[00:52:22.140 --> 00:52:30.100]   Have you seen the light of God upon yourself and your relationship to him?
[00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:37.580]   Yea, I ask you, have you seen the light in the face of Christ which tells you that though
[00:52:37.580 --> 00:52:44.780]   you may have been dark and ignorant and sinful and vile and lost until this moment, that
[00:52:44.780 --> 00:52:53.220]   in him you can be saved and redeemed, your sins forgiven, reconciled to God, made a child
[00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:58.860]   of God and given a glimpse of the glory that awaits you?
[00:52:58.860 --> 00:53:04.940]   And you'll be able to become like Paul and the chaos will be replaced by order and you'll
[00:53:04.940 --> 00:53:11.660]   march in the light of this glorious knowledge, whatever may happen in the world round and
[00:53:11.660 --> 00:53:14.580]   about you.
[00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:18.500]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
