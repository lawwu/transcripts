[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Well, we serve an international audience on APJ.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.640]   Listeners join us from across the globe, whether through our English episodes or in the dozen
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.920]   or so languages that this podcast gets translated into.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.520]   Some of our questions might not make sense to our listeners in the States, and that's
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.480]   likely true today.
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.480]   And that's all right.
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.720]   Here's our email today.
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.860]   Hello, Pastor John and Tony.
[00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.040]   This is Takozani from the Gatting region of South Africa.
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.460]   I have listened to Ask Pastor John for two years and grown a lot spiritually over that
[00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:34.460]   time.
[00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.960]   My question stems from a popular belief that we have here in South Africa.
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.920]   People here believe in ancestral consultation.
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.420]   When a person dies, their spirit or soul doesn't go to God immediately.
[00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.040]   It roams around where they died.
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.320]   The family must go to that spot and fetch the spirit using a tree.
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.240]   This is a popular belief, and several Christians here hold to these superstitions.
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.540]   Once the spirit is fetched, the body can be buried, and only then does the spirit go to
[00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.680]   God and can the person finally rest in peace.
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.320]   Later, relatives will visit the grave or set up a shrine in their home where they consult
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.160]   with these dead parents or grandparents, not to worship them, but to periodically establish
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:18.080]   communication to receive from them messages through dreams or visions.
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.960]   Pastor John, what does the Bible say about communicating with ancestors?
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.640]   What the Bible says may be summed up like this.
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:36.800]   Don't pursue communication with the dead because pursuing messages from the dead is
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:45.920]   evidence that biblical truth about God is either not understood or not believed.
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:55.840]   And in either case, God is dishonored by the practice of seeking messages from the dead.
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:03.680]   Therefore, Christians should not do it, and they should be taught from the Bible why this
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:12.880]   practice dishonors God and should be encouraged to believe what the Bible teaches about God
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.840]   so that their practices honor Him, glorify Him.
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:25.600]   So what's the biblical teaching about God that I have in mind when I say, "If you seek
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.320]   these messages from the dead, you either don't know those teachings or you don't believe
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.320]   them."
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.440]   Here are four things about God that needs to be taught and known.
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:48.200]   One, when a person dies, God takes his soul out of the world immediately, either to himself
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.900]   or to a place of torment.
[00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:59.220]   No soul separated from the body is allowed to remain on earth and roam about after death.
[00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.520]   Jesus said to the thief on the cross, "Today you will be with me in paradise."
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.800]   No intermediate state, no roaming around Jerusalem.
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.200]   Luke 16 describes the death of the poor man Lazarus and the rich man.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.760]   Immediately one goes to Abraham's presence in heaven and the other to a place of torment
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.300]   and a great gulf is fixed between them.
[00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.760]   Their souls are not left on earth.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:30.080]   In Philippians 1, Paul says that his death puts him in the presence of Christ.
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:37.400]   In 2 Corinthians 5, perhaps the clearest text of all, it says, "Apart from the body, at
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.800]   home with the Lord."
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.200]   No gap.
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:48.560]   It does not say, "Apart from the body, at home in the neighborhood for a few days."
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:56.520]   So that part of the practice in South Africa is based on a misunderstanding of God's action
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.960]   in dealing with the dead.
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:05.800]   Second, God explicitly forbids consulting with the dead.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:14.760]   Isaiah 8, verse 19, "When they say to you, 'Inquire of the mediums and the necromancers
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:22.600]   who chirp and mutter,' should not a people inquire of their God?
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:28.640]   Should they inquire of the dead on behalf of the living?"
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.360]   And the answer is clearly no.
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.280]   So we don't need to wonder what God thinks of this practice.
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.040]   He says, "Don't do it."
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:47.840]   And behind the prohibition is the rationale about God's sufficiency and his honor in communicating
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:54.440]   to us what we need, "Should not a people inquire of their God?"
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:01.200]   That's the third point about God that is misunderstood or disbelieved by those who seek messages
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.200]   from the dead.
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.200]   So let's go to number three.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.280]   So number two was just an explicit prohibition.
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:19.240]   Number three, God has shown that he himself—not ancestors, not angels, not mediums—he himself
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:26.200]   is the one who provides us with what we need to know in order to live a fruitful, God-honoring
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.600]   Christian life.
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:33.880]   That's the point of Isaiah 8, verse 19, when the prophet says, "Should not a people inquire
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.820]   of their God?"
[00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:36.820]   He knows.
[00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:37.820]   He's enough.
[00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:38.820]   He's wise.
[00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:39.820]   He's willing.
[00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:45.680]   You can hear in that question, it's unthinkable that you would treat your living God as somehow
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:52.640]   unwilling to tell you what you need to know in order to live for his glory.
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:06:00.560]   That God would be so unable or unwilling to give his people what they need that they are
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:08.980]   forced to communicate with the dead as if dead, sinful, finite, fallible creatures could
[00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:16.520]   be more useful than God, who made heaven and earth and knows all things and is all wise
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.840]   and rules all things and loves his children.
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:29.840]   The New Testament tells us at least three things about the generosity of God's communication
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.120]   with his children.
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:41.760]   One, Hebrews 1, verses 1 and 2, God has spoken to us by his Son.
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:46.560]   Jesus Christ is the decisive Word of God.
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:53.600]   All the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are in him, and he is gloriously portrayed
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:07:00.640]   in the New Testament for our understanding and our enjoyment and our following.
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:08.360]   Number two, God told the apostles that he would guide them into all truth when they
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:13.320]   taught the church what to believe and how to live, and then he called their teaching
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:20.660]   the foundation of the church, Ephesians 2.20, and he called their faith the faith once for
[00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:24.520]   all delivered to the saints, Jude 1.3.
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:29.600]   We have the fullness of the apostolic teaching in the New Testament.
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:38.240]   Third, God told us in 2 Timothy 3.16 that all the scriptures are his inspired Word and
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:46.320]   that they are profitable to equip the man of God for every good work.
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:52.520]   Through the scriptures, God has given us the revelation we need to do the good works he
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.840]   calls us to do.
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:08:05.040]   So, seeking messages from ancestors, the Bible teaches, is a dishonor to God who has communicated
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:14.280]   so lavishly with us about all the things we need to live the way he wants us to live.
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:23.240]   And then finally, seeking messages from ancestors implies an unbelief in the glorious implications
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:33.040]   for God's children that God's providence is all-controlling and all-pervasive, namely,
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:40.200]   that he works all things by that providence for our good as we trust him.
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:46.960]   The apostle Paul taught us that since God did not spare his own Son but gave him up
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:54.440]   for us all, he will certainly give us all things with him, all the things we need to
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:09:00.200]   know, all the things we need to have in order to honor God and do his will.
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:06.560]   And the whole Bible teaches us that God is absolutely in control of all demons and all
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:14.560]   spirits and all locusts and worms and viruses and bacteria and plants and fish and lions
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:22.020]   and witch doctors and drought and famine and rain and floods and wind and earthquakes and
[00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:25.360]   diseases and life and death.
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:34.480]   God's providence, his purposeful sovereignty, is absolutely, pervasively in control of all
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:35.480]   things.
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:44.120]   So there's nothing that messages from the ancestors can do that would make it safer
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:50.800]   or better than what our Heavenly Father is pledged to do for us because Jesus died for
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:51.800]   us.
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:10:01.280]   So, the biblical position is don't pursue communication with the dead because pursuing
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:08.400]   messages from the dead is evidence that biblical truth about God is either not understood or
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.400]   not believed.
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:12.640]   And in either case, God is dishonored.
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.800]   For truths, we need to know.
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:19.320]   God takes the dead immediately out of the world.
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:23.280]   God explicitly forbids communication with the dead.
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:30.680]   God has shown that he himself is the one who provides us what we need to know what we need
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:32.440]   to know.
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:36.760]   God's providence governs everything for our good.
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:37.960]   Yeah, amen.
[00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:44.000]   It dishonors God as a direct offense to him and the sufficiency of what he has said to
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   us.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.300]   And if you want to study this theme more fully for yourself and make this connection for
[00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:53.840]   yourself in the Bible, I would offer up to you Isaiah 819, which we saw earlier.
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:59.600]   And within its context of Isaiah 8 verses 11 to 22, study all that text, Isaiah 8, 11
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:00.600]   to 22.
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:06.440]   Also consider studying Deuteronomy 18, 11 in its broader context of Deuteronomy 18 verses
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:07.680]   9 to 22.
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:14.880]   These are key texts here, Isaiah 8 verses 11 to 22 and Deuteronomy 18 verses 9 to 22.
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.960]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.560]   And thanks for joining us today.
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:26.120]   If you want to ask Pastor John, email your question to me at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:32.480]   Well is the hobby of watercolor painting a wartime waste of time and money?
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.920]   That's the question of next time.
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:38.600]   And with it, I'll ask, how many seashells does John Piper have in his house?
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.440]   It's a related question, trust me.
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.000]   Both of them are up next time.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reike.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.240]   We'll see you Thursday.
