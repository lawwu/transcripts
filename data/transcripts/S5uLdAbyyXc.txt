[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.000]   Can Alcoholics Anonymous break my addiction?
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.360]   It's a question from a listener named Tanya.
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.620]   Dear Pastor John, I am five years sober from alcohol
[00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.000]   because I went to AA and was miraculously delivered
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.800]   from the desire to drink.
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.880]   I was and am a born again believer.
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.220]   I listen to and read much of your content.
[00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.860]   However, I'm now hearing that it is wrong
[00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.160]   for a Christian to attend AA.
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.860]   I only wanna do the right thing
[00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:30.960]   before the Lord.
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.600]   I have entered a deeper relationship with God through AA
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.740]   and am always at liberty to declare
[00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.120]   that my higher power is Jesus Christ.
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.560]   I would greatly appreciate your thoughts on this matter.
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.040]   Pastor John, what potential role can social programs play
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.040]   in really helping to bring genuine change
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.180]   to the Christian life?
[00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.100]   The roots of Alcoholics Anonymous
[00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.080]   are in the Christian tradition.
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.920]   The founders, Bill Wilson and Bob Smith,
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.300]   were members of a Christian revival organization
[00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.720]   called the Oxford Group.
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.380]   So even though the movement, the AA movement now,
[00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.660]   is non-sectarian, it's not surprising, therefore,
[00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.120]   that the 12 steps are all, so to speak,
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.640]   like the Christian shell where the nut of Christ
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:23.740]   has been removed.
[00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.880]   With this much outward similarity
[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.940]   to the way Christians overcome sin,
[00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.680]   it's not surprising to me that the 12 steps have
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.680]   and can be amazingly helpful for those moving out
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.520]   of addiction to alcohol.
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.900]   And my guess is that most of our listeners
[00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.040]   will never have read all of the 12 steps.
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.160]   Some, for sure, have.
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.200]   So I want to read them, all of them.
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.360]   It'll only take a minute.
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.580]   They're very short.
[00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.600]   I want to read them and then say something to Tanya
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.080]   about her situation.
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.080]   Number one, we admit we are powerless over alcohol
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.580]   and that our lives are unmanageable.
[00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.580]   Two, we come to be aware of a power greater than ourselves
[00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.900]   and only it can restore us to sanity.
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.960]   Three, we make a decision to turn our will and lives
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.920]   over to the care of God as we understand Him.
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.580]   Four, we take a personal inventory of strengths
[00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.200]   and weaknesses of character.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.720]   Five, we admit to God and to ourselves
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.360]   and to another human being the exact nature of our wrong.
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.360]   Six, we become willing to look at our negative qualities
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.920]   and admit our defects of character.
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.460]   Seven, we humbly ask God as we understand Him
[00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.940]   to remove our shortcomings.
[00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.640]   Eight, we make a list of people we have harmed
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.640]   and are willing to apologize and right our wrongs.
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.360]   Nine, we set about making amends for those wrongs.
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.040]   10, we continue to take personal inventory
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.560]   and when we are wrong, to promptly admit it.
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.920]   11, we reach out to God and accept
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.360]   that He has a plan for our life.
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.600]   12, assuming we have experienced a spiritual awakening
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.240]   that comes as a result of completing the 11 steps,
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.100]   we carry the message of AA to other addicts
[00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:45.100]   and practice the principles of AA in our daily affairs.
[00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.480]   Those are the 12 steps.
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.940]   So my first response to Tanya's situation
[00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.940]   is to give thanks to God that He has used AA
[00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.880]   in her deliverance from bondage to alcohol.
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.340]   I'm thankful that has happened.
[00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:07.600]   This does not surprise me and it does not worry me.
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.320]   I praise God for it.
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.920]   What would worry me is if Tanya
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.920]   did not see the serious shortcomings of the 12 steps
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:24.460]   and seek to make those up, make up for them,
[00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.800]   in her ongoing warfare with sin
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.380]   in some kind of good, solid, healthy church
[00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.800]   and in her own study of Scripture.
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.680]   I would not require Tanya to keep away from these meetings.
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.520]   That wouldn't be my first approach.
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.800]   I wouldn't say, "You can't go there anymore."
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.760]   I would encourage her to go deep with Scripture,
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.120]   probably with the help of a good, older woman
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.920]   who knows her Scripture well and a good, solid church,
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.920]   to see the full picture of how God provides
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.760]   for our warfare with sin, including alcoholism.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.760]   And then, if I were her, I would seek to fight the battle
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.120]   alongside fellow Christians who share the same vision
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.200]   of biblical sanctification.
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.560]   And I hope she has a good church
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.480]   where she could find that kind of camaraderie
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.240]   in warfare against sin.
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.720]   And they don't all have to be alcoholics.
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.960]   All of us have besetting sins.
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.960]   And we have the same kinds of strategies in the Bible.
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.080]   The most serious omission,
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.920]   so here's what she should recognize and be concerned about.
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.480]   The most serious omission of AA
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:54.280]   is not that the higher power is unnamed.
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.840]   Tanya says that she sees Jesus as her higher power.
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.640]   Well, that's good.
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:05.640]   But the most glaring omission is the entire transaction
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:10.800]   between God and man in Christ Jesus at the cross.
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.080]   The cross is missing.
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.440]   The atonement for sin is missing.
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.440]   And that is because the greatest problem
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.160]   of humankind is missing, namely, not alcoholism,
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:29.160]   not the hurt we have done others, but sin against God.
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.920]   And the outrage it is in dishonoring God.
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.760]   The greatest problem that has to be solved
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.000]   in every human life, everywhere on this planet,
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.600]   no matter what tribe, language, culture it is,
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.400]   the greatest problem that has to be solved in every life
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.760]   is the just and holy wrath of God against us
[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:55.600]   because of our dishonoring God in our sins against Him.
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:00.240]   Without this, a grasp of this vertical alienation
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:04.840]   between us and God and the price paid on the cross
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:09.000]   to overcome that alienation, without this,
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   even adding the name God or Jesus to the higher power
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.640]   will become a religious technique
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:21.240]   rather than an act of redemption or ransom
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:24.760]   by means of the death of Jesus, paying for our sins
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:27.600]   and providing our perfect righteousness
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.760]   and acceptance with God.
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.260]   The essence of the Christian warfare with sin,
[00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.760]   which is missing from Alcoholics Anonymous,
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.840]   the essence of the Christian warfare with sin
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:45.840]   is that we fight sin as justified sinners.
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:51.640]   That is, we fight as blood-bought, forgiven children of God
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:55.080]   based on the work of Christ alone.
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:59.200]   We come to see the death and resurrection of Jesus
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:03.520]   as our only hope of acceptance with God.
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:04.640]   That's a fundamental problem,
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.840]   acceptance with God, peace with God.
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:11.640]   And then, because we are accepted and forgiven,
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.720]   because of Christ alone,
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:17.880]   we can make progress in fighting actual sin.
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:22.120]   So my prayer is that Tanya and all others
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:27.120]   who have found help in AA would give thanks to God
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:31.960]   for his great grace in using AA to help them.
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:36.960]   And then, my prayer is that they would go deep
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:41.720]   into the distinctive, precious, powerful way
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:46.720]   that the Bible glorifies Christ and his cross
[00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:52.460]   in how we fight sin as blood-bought, justified,
[00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:55.340]   forgiven children of God.
[00:08:55.340 --> 00:09:00.340]   Paul says in Titus 2:14 that Christ gave himself for us
[00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:04.220]   to redeem us from all lawlessness
[00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:09.220]   and to purify for himself a people for his own possession
[00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:11.100]   who are zealous for good works.
[00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:16.100]   In other words, Jesus shed his blood to deliver alcoholics
[00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:22.100]   and the rest of us from whatever bondage holds us fast.
[00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.900]   That's the meaning of the blood of Christ,
[00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:26.860]   to deliver us from those.
[00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:31.860]   So our great aim should be to glorify Christ and his cross
[00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:37.580]   by defeating our sins with the power
[00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:42.500]   of that blood and righteousness.
[00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:43.820]   - Amen and amen.
[00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:46.660]   As the old hymn says, and as you like to remind us a lot,
[00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:51.380]   Pastor John, he breaks the power of canceled sin.
[00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:53.420]   A justification is so important here.
[00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:55.420]   Thank you, Pastor John, for that reminder.
[00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:57.060]   And great question, Tanya.
[00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:58.860]   Thank you for sending it in.
