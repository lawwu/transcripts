[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.320]   We are still continuing, as most of you will remember, the 16th verse in the 8th chapter
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:18.160]   of Paul's epistle to the Romans. The 16th verse in the 8th chapter. "The Spirit itself
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:27.400]   beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God." Now we've arrived
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:34.520]   at a point at which we've seen something of the nature, the character of this great
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:42.040]   experience which comes to all who know what it is to have the Spirit testifying with their
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:50.240]   spirits that they are the children of God. And last Friday night we spent most of our
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:59.920]   time in showing and proving how this is something which has been taught in various centuries
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:08.080]   of the Protestant era in particular by men of different schools of theology, men of different
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:14.760]   types of character and of temperament, and of almost everything else. There is this strange
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:22.920]   and curious unanimity with regard to the character of this experience.
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.920]   Now there is just one further bit of evidence I've got to put before you, but I can deal
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:34.240]   with it in a few minutes. I've completely failed to have time to include it last week,
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.000]   but I think it's important that we should realize the completeness of the evidence.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.680]   We looked at the Puritans, we looked at the two sections into which Methodism divided
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:54.560]   in the eighteenth century, we saw the great testimony from the representative of the Baptists
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:01.360]   in terms of Charles Haddon Spurgeon, and we saw Presbyterians in America, Congregationalists
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.680]   like Jonathan Edwards, and so on. Well now, to make this evidence complete, I would just
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.680]   like to remind you of how the early great teachers amongst the people commonly known
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:21.120]   as Plymouth Brethren also taught the same thing. Take for instance J. M. Darby. He has
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:28.480]   a book on The Sealing with the Spirit, and in page 18 of that you will read this. He
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.680]   says that it's quite clear that a person may be born again and not have received the
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:42.920]   Holy Ghost. He says this is perfectly certain according to the Scriptures. And then he proceeds
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.800]   to quote the various Scriptures which we've considered ourselves, Acts 2, Acts 8, Acts
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:56.760]   10 and 11, and Acts 19, and other Scriptures. Now there is a specific statement by the great
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:03.320]   J. M. Darby, the real originator of the Brethren. Then there was another very famous teacher
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.640]   amongst them. You will often see his books with just his initials on them to indicate
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:16.040]   the authorship, C. H. M., which stands for C. H. Mackintosh. He is a teacher greatly
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:24.600]   revered amongst the Brethren, and in his works known as Things New and Old in Volume 10,
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:37.800]   and on page 198 you'll read this. We consider Acts 19, 1 to 7, does most clearly show that
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:48.160]   persons may be disciples and believers and yet not be sealed with the Holy Ghost. Now
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.160]   that's perfectly clear, isn't it? C. H. Mackintosh says it's perfectly clear from
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:04:00.160]   Acts 19, 1 to 7, that to be a Christian is one thing, to be sealed is another. That you
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.760]   can be a Christian without knowing the sealing. You can be a believer, you can be a disciple,
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:12.640]   and yet not know the sealing of the Spirit. And then the third and the last of these great
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:18.120]   teachers amongst the early Brethren, whom I'm quoting, is a man called William Kelly.
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.120]   He's still read very extensively by the Brethren and others. They're reissuing, republishing
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.880]   his works at the present time. Now he's got a book on the New Testament doctrine of the
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:37.720]   Holy Spirit. It was first published in 1867, and in that edition on page 161, pages 161
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:49.240]   and 162, you find that he contrasts the reception of the Holy Spirit with belief and repentance.
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:55.800]   Belief and repentance, he says, are possible without receiving the Holy Spirit in this
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:01.400]   special sense. Of course, you can't believe at all without the Holy Spirit. You can't
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.080]   be a Christian without the Holy Spirit being in you. We've seen that so clearly in the
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.320]   ninth verse of this chapter. "If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:16.280]   of these." So that when he and all the others talk about the reception of the Spirit, they're
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.080]   talking about the receiving of the Spirit in the sense that the apostles received him
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:27.720]   on the day of Pentecost. And those people in Samaria received him after Peter and John
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:33.880]   had come down. And those people in Ephesus received him after Paul, having already baptized
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.360]   them, laid his hands upon them, and they received the Holy Ghost. He's using it in that sense.
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:49.320]   And this is what he says, "It is a subsequent operation. It is an additional, separate blessing.
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:58.280]   It is a privilege founded upon faith, already actively working in the heart. So far is it
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:05.600]   from being true that a man receives the gift of the Holy Ghost the moment that he believes,
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:12.200]   but it may well be doubted whether there ever was such a case since the world began. I do
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:19.200]   not mean to deny that the gift of the Holy Ghost may be practically on the same occasion,
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:27.320]   but never in the same moment." Now that's as explicit and as clear, surely, as anything
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:33.040]   can possibly be. So there you've got these three great teachers amongst the early brethren,
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:39.440]   J. N. Darby, C. H. McIntosh, and William Kelly, agreeing with all the authorities I quoted
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:45.440]   to you last Friday evening and on previous occasions, and all that we have seen ourselves
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:50.480]   from our study of the Scripture. Very well, then. We are now in a position to sum it up
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:59.640]   by saying that it is clear, therefore, that this is a distinct and separate experience,
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:07.400]   that it is something intensely experimental, and that a man can know for certain whether
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:15.140]   he has ever received this witness of the Spirit or this sealing of the Spirit. It's not something
[00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:21.680]   that is outside the realm of consciousness. It is not something non-experimental. But
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:28.640]   indeed it is highly experimental. And as we've seen from the various accounts here in the
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:33.880]   Scriptures and from others throughout the centuries, it is something that once a man
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:38.920]   has known it that he can never forget. If it has only happened to a man once, he will
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:48.120]   always look back to it as the highest point which he ever reached in his Christian experience.
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:56.920]   Now, it seems to me that we, therefore, must be clear about this. I've referred again in
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:01.920]   passing to those clear statements of it in the Book of the Acts of the Apostles. There
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:07.200]   is one, perhaps, which I have not emphasized as I should have done. I think I just mentioned
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:15.560]   it, but it should receive a little further emphasis, and that is, of course, in the case
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:25.120]   of the Apostle Paul himself. Now, it is quite clear that he not only saw the Lord Jesus
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:34.440]   Christ on the road to Damascus, but that he also believed on him and in him there on that
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:42.000]   road to Damascus. But it is equally clear that he was not baptized with the Holy Ghost
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:49.040]   until three days later. You remember, we are told that he was three days without sight,
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:53.200]   neither did he eat nor drink. I'm reading the ninth verse of the ninth chapter of the
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:57.840]   Book of the Acts of the Apostles. Then you remember that Ananias, a certain disciple
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:07.080]   of Damascus, was told by the Lord to go to the Apostle Paul. And he eventually went and
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:12.560]   found him in that street called Strait, you remember. And this is what I read in verse
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:19.600]   17. "And Ananias went his way and entered into the house. And putting his hands on him,
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:27.640]   brother Saul, the Lord even Jesus, that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:38.560]   sent me that thou mightest receive thy sight and be filled with the Holy Ghost. And immediately
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:45.080]   there fell from his eyes as it had been scaled, and he received sight forthwith, and arose
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:51.760]   and was baptized." So that even in the case of the great Apostle himself, the same thing
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:58.320]   is evident as it is in the other cases. Now that case of Paul is one which is very often
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:04.080]   forgotten by people. They take Acts 2 and they take Acts 8 and they take Acts 10 and
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:10.400]   they take Acts 19. But the Apostle himself is as clear an illustration of this essential
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:18.840]   distinction between believing and this receiving of the Holy Spirit, which means being baptized
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:24.400]   with the Spirit, being sealed by the Spirit. They are entirely different experiences.
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:29.520]   And the one other that I wanted to refer to is the question that is put by the Apostle
[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:36.160]   Paul to the Galatians in the third chapter of that epistle and in the second verse. He
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:40.640]   starts off by saying, "O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:46.760]   obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:55.920]   you? This only would I learn of you. Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:02.240]   by the hearing of faith?" Now you notice this question. He doesn't say, "Did you become
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:07.320]   believers or did you become Christians by the works of the law or by the hearing of
[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:12.560]   faith?" No. What he asks is, "Did you receive the Spirit?" Clearly indicating that there
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:19.800]   is a difference between the two. If the Apostle had taught that every Christian of necessity
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:25.040]   receives the Spirit at his conversion, at his rebirth, on his becoming a Christian,
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:29.720]   well then the question to ask is, "When you became Christians, did you become Christians
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:36.400]   as the result of the works of the law or by the hearing of faith?" If he regarded the
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:41.800]   things as being identical and simultaneous, this would not be the form that the question
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:48.080]   would take. He would put it in that more general form. But he puts it here, of course, in exactly
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:54.240]   the same way as he did to those people he found at Ephesus. "Did you receive the Holy
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:12:00.000]   Ghost when you believed?" It's another way of saying that. "Received he the Spirit by
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.420]   the works of the law or by the hearing of faith?" And indeed the same thing is suggested
[00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:11.600]   by the fourteenth verse in that same third chapter of the epistle to the Galatians. He
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:17.960]   says, "Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us. For
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:24.160]   it is written, 'Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree,' that the blessing of
[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:33.640]   Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ, that we might receive the promise
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:41.480]   of the Spirit through faith." Now there it is once more. Not merely that we become Christians,
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:47.720]   but that we, Gentile believers as well as those who were Jews, might receive this great
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:51.880]   promise of the Spirit, the promise of the Father, the thing that had been promised right
[00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:58.360]   through the Old Testament, and which we find referred to again in John 7, 37-39. The Spirit
[00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:05.800]   was not yet given because the Jesus was not yet glorified. This great promise of the Spirit
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:13.560]   in profusion, giving this great clarity, this great understanding and insight, and this
[00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:20.920]   great feeling of assurance and of certainty with regard to our standing and our relationship
[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:29.840]   to God. Very well, then. There it is. We find it not only in the Scriptures, but we find
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:36.240]   it, I say, held by men, teachers in the Church whom God has honored, belonging to all sections
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:41.400]   of the Christian Church, cutting right across all the divisions and the distinctions and
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:49.640]   all the theologies. Here they seem to be one. Your Strict Baptist and your John Wesley,
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:54.540]   Jonathan Edwards and D. L. Moody. It does not matter. Great intellects, men of much
[00:13:54.540 --> 00:14:00.080]   lesser intellects, great outstanding people in the Church, more ordinary people in the
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:06.120]   Church. We have seen that it is common to all, and therefore it is a most striking and
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:12.840]   a most marvelous thing. It helps us to understand its unique character and its givenness. It
[00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:20.240]   is not the result of what we do. It is something that God himself does to us. Very well. Now
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:24.200]   then, we have got to leave the experience itself at that point, and we come on to our
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:31.760]   next point, which is this one. How can we differentiate between this great and glorious
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:42.720]   experience and counterfeit experiences? Now we have got to do this. The moment we emphasize
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:51.320]   the experimental or the experiential character of anything that is taught in the Scripture,
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:59.120]   we are at once, of course, exposing ourselves to this particular danger. The devil, the
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:05.200]   adversary, always comes in at this point, and particularly so when it is a matter of
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:13.880]   experience and of feeling, and when the sensibilities are involved. And therefore I say it is of
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:19.680]   urgent and of vital importance that we should be quite clear about this. The New Testament
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:27.480]   exalts us to do this, to test the spirits, to try the spirits, to prove the spirits.
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:33.200]   The teaching is that every spirit is not of God. There is a spirit of Antichrist. There
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:39.880]   is a false spirit. And these false spirits have manifested their activities even in the
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:48.040]   days of the early Church herself. So they were exalted to test and to prove and to try.
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:54.320]   And therefore it is incumbent upon us to do exactly the same thing. But of course, once
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:16:01.060]   more, not only does the teaching of the Scripture itself urge us to do this, the subsequent
[00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:08.760]   history of the Christian Church makes it absolutely imperative. Because as you read the long story
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:13.660]   of the Church, you will find that there is nothing which has been perhaps a more frequent
[00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:21.300]   source of trouble than the way in which people have gone to certain excesses and extravagances,
[00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:28.640]   and have tended to bring the whole Christian cause into disrepute and into derision.
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:36.960]   Now this, I say, is something which has been going on really more or less right through
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:43.940]   the centuries. I could illustrate it at the time of the Reformation. I could illustrate
[00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:50.840]   it still more easily at the time of the Puritan awakening of the seventeenth century. You
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:58.600]   see there were people on one edge of the Puritan movement who taught and taught, in my opinion,
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:05.100]   very rightly, the importance of an experience of the Spirit in this way. But they tended
[00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:11.520]   to go too far. They tended to go to mysticism, and they tended to go to excesses. This happened
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:16.640]   amongst many of the early Quakers who arose at that time. In other words, the moment you
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:21.940]   begin to put emphasis upon experience, the devil will tend to drive people to extremes.
[00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:27.520]   And that makes it absolutely essential that all such experiences should be examined. The
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:32.840]   same thing happened in the eighteenth century. The evangelical revival of the eighteenth
[00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:40.640]   century was a very, very experimental movement. That is, perhaps, the great difference between
[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:47.760]   it and the general run of the Puritan experience in the previous century. The whole emphasis
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:54.300]   of Whitefield and the Westmills was upon assurance, upon this active experience of the Spirit.
[00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:59.120]   They taught this spiritual life, the life of God in the souls of men. And the result
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:03.440]   was that there were people in their time in the same way who tended to go off into these
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:09.280]   extravagances and excesses. And, of course, the same thing has been happening also in
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:15.520]   this century, and it certainly happened in the last century. I think I once before commended
[00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:21.720]   to you a book which was written on certain freak religious movements in the United States
[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:28.240]   of America in the last century. It's been published under two different titles, but
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:36.040]   it's the same book. One title is Group Movements and Experiments in Guidance. The other has
[00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:40.560]   a title—I can't remember the adjective, but it's something to do with the suggestion
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:47.720]   of freak religious movements, the author being Ray Strachey. There were all sorts of strange
[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:52.720]   movements that arose. Some of them have since become cults. I don't want to go into that
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:57.960]   this evening. But now, it is for this reason, therefore, that we have very carefully to
[00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:06.520]   test this. You see, what the devil does is this. If he can give us a counterfeit experience
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:13.840]   and persuade us that we have the true experience, we shall no longer seek the true experience.
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:21.240]   Not only that, we will get into a state which, as I am going to show you, is one of self-satisfaction,
[00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:26.800]   and we'll never grow. And as the false and spurious experience is always accompanied
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:32.200]   by the opposite of that which accompanies the true, obviously the devil will have led
[00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:36.560]   us astray. If, therefore, having listened to all I've been trying to say, you have
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:41.960]   come to the conclusion, "Now then, I want above everything to know this experience of
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:46.840]   the Spirit testifying with my spirit. I wish I could have the experience that John Preston
[00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:53.000]   describes or John Flavel or any one of them." The moment you begin to think like that, the
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:58.440]   devil will be there and he will be anxious to supply you with a counterfeit.
[00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:05.160]   Now, you see the importance of looking at this. There are no doubt some people listening
[00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:11.200]   to me now who say, having heard that, "Quite right. I've always thought of that." And
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:16.120]   there's no danger of my ever seeking this experience. The only safe thing to do is to
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:20.640]   have nothing to do with experiences at all. Stick to the Word, be a man of the Word. Don't
[00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:24.880]   you go seeking these experiences. You never know what will happen to you. Very well, my
[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:30.000]   friend, if you say that, all I say to you is this. You are guilty of the terrible sin
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:37.200]   of quenching the Spirit. It's a terrible thing to quench the Spirit. That's exactly
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:42.120]   what it means. Because you are afraid. You say, "I'm not going to have this. I'm
[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:46.320]   not interested." You're saying that you're not interested in something that God is holding
[00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:50.880]   before you, something that God teaches in His Word, something that God has demonstrated
[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:57.200]   through His great saints. If you just want to live a nice little self-contained, respectable
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:03.320]   little Christian life, well, all right, you go on. You're quenching the Spirit. You
[00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:09.560]   are robbing yourself of the most glorious aspect of the Christian faith. You are deliberately
[00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:15.000]   turning your back upon the teaching of the Scripture. And not only that, you will suffer
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:21.880]   for it. But still more important, perhaps, you are standing between the Christian church
[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:28.020]   and revival. And thereby, you are standing between many who are outside in the world
[00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:33.960]   and an experience of the power of salvation. It's a very terrible and a very serious
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:38.880]   thing to do. But I'm emphasizing it because I know there are such people. There are people
[00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:43.120]   who say today, "We don't want revival. When revival comes, you know, things happen.
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:47.760]   And we don't want that. We like everything to be done decently and in order." That's
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:54.800]   quenching the Spirit. To refuse anything that is offered in the Word of God because you
[00:21:54.800 --> 00:22:03.600]   are afraid of certain or possible consequences is a most grievous sin. And it will, of necessity
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:10.420]   and undoubtedly, bear the punishment that it deserves. But now, the way to face this
[00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:15.620]   is not to turn your back upon it. It is to be certain as to the difference between the
[00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:22.360]   true and the false. Because there is the danger of false experiences, you don't shut out
[00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:28.040]   all experience. No, no. What you do is to seek the true experience and to make certain
[00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:34.380]   that you know how to tell the difference between the two. Well, now then, what are the differences?
[00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:40.280]   And I have decided to adopt what is the common Puritan classification. I'm borrowing their
[00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:48.120]   divisions because I can't think of a better one. They say that you can partly test the
[00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:55.760]   difference between the true and the spurious by looking at what they call the antecedents.
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:23:02.020]   What is it that went before the experience? And that's very good. Now, they mean something
[00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:10.400]   like this. That if you examine the person before this experience came, it will tell
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:14.320]   you a good deal as to whether it's the right or the wrong experience. Of course, sometimes
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:21.120]   you can't do that. Sometimes, as we've seen, and as William Kelly has reminded us
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:26.920]   this evening, the believing and the receiving of this may be almost simultaneous. So then
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:33.120]   you can't talk much about the antecedents. But that's exceptional. In most cases,
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:40.840]   speaking generally, there is a clear time interval between becoming Christian and knowing
[00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:47.400]   this testimony or sealing of the Spirit. And therefore, you are able to concentrate on
[00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:57.320]   the antecedents. What are they? Well, here are the true antecedents. A sense of sin and
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:06.880]   a sense of failure. If you've had a sense of sin and a sense of failure, a sense of
[00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:17.000]   weariness, a sense of emptiness, a sense of soul need. If you've known a longing for
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:24.880]   assurance, if you've known a longing for power and ability, well, it's very good
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:32.640]   presumptive evidence that the experience which you've had is a true experience. If, on
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:36.040]   the other hand, you come and talk about some marvelous experience you've had, but had
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:40.640]   never known what it was before to be grieved about your sin, if you'd never known a
[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:45.360]   spirit of heaviness, if you'd never known a spirit of mourning, if you'd never been
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:52.640]   seeking, if you'd never really had a deep hunger, well, then I say it is presumptive
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:57.800]   evidence that your experience is not a true one. It doesn't prove it, but it's very
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:07.960]   valuable evidence. Those whose experiences I've been reading out to you are unanimous
[00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:15.240]   in saying that they'd always known that preliminary stage. There had been much prayer,
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:21.760]   there had been much diligent seeking of this witness of the Spirit. They, in some shape
[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:27.720]   or form, every one of them, had been uttering the cry which I often quote from this pulpit,
[00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:35.080]   found in a line of a hymn, "Tell me thou art mine, O Savior, grant me an assurance
[00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:41.480]   clear." That's their desire. That's the thing they've been longing for, and they've
[00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:47.280]   expressed their desire to God and to the Lord Jesus Christ in prayer. "Tell me thou art
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:56.440]   mine, O Savior, grant me an assurance clear." These people have known what it is then to
[00:25:56.440 --> 00:26:06.160]   be seeking it and praying for it and longing for it and diligently going after it. And
[00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:10.200]   in addition to that, they've proved the genuineness of their seeking and the genuineness
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:18.120]   of their condition by holy living. They have done everything they can to perfect holiness
[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:23.680]   in the fear of God. They've not just gone on living anyhow somehow, or just asking God
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:31.160]   to give them this blessing. No, no. They've realized that this experience comes as a kind
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:36.920]   of seal upon the fact that we are the children of God and therefore holy. And therefore,
[00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:42.440]   they've realized that they must do everything they can to please him. They've been careful
[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:48.400]   about their lives. They haven't been negligent and careless. No, no, they've walked warily,
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:53.000]   they've walked carefully. They've said, "If I'm asking this great boon and blessing
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.520]   from God, well then I must prove that I'm a dutiful child." Not that they've believed
[00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:03.120]   that because they're living a good life it's bound to happen. No, but, well, if I
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:11.800]   may use the obvious illustration again, when we were all children, if we wanted an extra
[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:18.240]   gift from our parents, well we were all very careful to be on our best behavior, weren't
[00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:22.680]   we? We knew perfectly well that if we'd been mischievous or doing something that was
[00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:27.280]   wrong, there was no point in going to ask for an extra penny. It was a penny in those
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:32.920]   days. There was no point in doing that, we shouldn't have it. No, no, we had enough
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:39.040]   sense, enough common sense to know that if we wanted some special favor from a father
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:44.400]   or a mother, well, we were on our best behavior. We had a right as it were to ask for it. Well,
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:51.280]   it's exactly the same in the Christian life. So if you find somebody coming along who says
[00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:56.080]   that he or she has had some marvelous experience, but you knew that you'd been watching them,
[00:27:56.080 --> 00:28:00.880]   you'd been living amongst them, and you knew perfectly well that there was no effort
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:06.240]   after holiness or striving after godliness in their lives, well, you were very right
[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:14.200]   to have all your queries up and all your questions, your right to be on guard. The antecedents
[00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:20.880]   are tremendously important. There's no question about that. The universal experience
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:27.600]   teaches that, as indeed does the Word of God itself. The Holy Spirit seals his own work,
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:31.560]   and the Holy Spirit isn't going to grant this sealing to a man who's behaving badly
[00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:37.400]   and who's an undutiful child of God? Not at all. He would be as it were almost contradicting
[00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:46.400]   himself. It's something that is obvious. But now come to the accompaniments of the
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:52.880]   experience. Leave the antecedents, come to the accompaniments. What do we find here?
[00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:59.280]   Well, let's take the false, the spurious experiences first. You will generally find
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:05.160]   that the people who have had the false experience will tell you that it came to them entirely
[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:12.040]   independent of the Word of God. It's a curious thing, this, but it's almost invariable.
[00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:17.240]   Not absolutely invariable, but almost. They don't talk about the Scripture, they don't
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:23.400]   talk about the Word of God. What they've had has come entirely independently of this.
[00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:30.000]   That's already a most valuable point. I would say you're 75% on the road to saying
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:36.880]   this is the false. Now, that of course was the thing that stood out most obviously in
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:45.160]   the 17th century. The Quakers and some of the others, on the extreme wing of the Puritans,
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:48.800]   they tended to depreciate the Word of God. They didn't need it, they'd got the inner
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:53.680]   light, the Spirit was speaking directly to them. They were not interested in the Scripture.
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:59.080]   I've known many people like that. I remember a poor fellow saying once in a discussion
[00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:03.840]   meeting, he'd had a wonderful conversion, there was no question about that at all. But
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:10.000]   I remember his saying once, he didn't care what Paul or anybody else said, he knew. That's
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:15.600]   the kind of thing that happens. It's an experience that is independent of and apart
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:18.800]   from the Word. Then you'll find another very characteristic
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:25.800]   thing is this. They've got a great deal to say about visions or ecstasies or signs.
[00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:32.200]   They're always interested in the phenomena. They've seen a ball of light, or they've
[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:38.360]   seen an appearance of the Lord Jesus Christ. There's a great emphasis always upon the
[00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:45.360]   phenomenal aspect of it. This striking, dramatic thing that has happened to them, and this
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:52.360]   physical, this semi-physical element, as it were, always comes in. But the emphasis, and
[00:30:52.360 --> 00:31:00.200]   this is the thing, is always on the phenomena. Most characteristic, then, the devil is never
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:05.600]   as clever as he thinks he is. He always makes this mistake, and his mistake is always to
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:11.800]   overdo the thing. He always overdoes it. You see, it's like this. These people sort of
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:15.800]   say to you, "Did you see a ball of fire? If you didn't, oh, well, of course, we all
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:20.360]   have feelings, feelings, but I actually saw it." That's the emphasis, this exaggeration.
[00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:29.320]   It's always overdone, with that physical aspect included. They talk a lot about physical
[00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:36.880]   frustrations, or things like that, or that they sensed something. They talk graphically,
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:41.600]   some of them, about a sensation of a hot iron passing through them, or an electric current,
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:46.380]   or something like that. Now, that's what I mean by talking about this physical aspect.
[00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:52.480]   That side of it is always very prominent in the false, and their emphasis is upon that.
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:57.560]   The result of this is, of course, that they're always very excited, excited about the thing
[00:31:57.560 --> 00:32:06.120]   itself, and always ready to boast about it, and to emphasize this kind of pseudo or semi-physical
[00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:17.600]   aspect, the phenomenal side of the experience. Now, there is the false. But look at the truth,
[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:25.560]   and you'll find the exact opposite. Here, it is almost invariably with or through the
[00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:32.040]   world. We've already dealt with this. Not invariably, it can come without it. But generally
[00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:37.280]   speaking, the word is very prominent. If it isn't when you're actually reading it,
[00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:42.120]   or if it isn't when you're actually listening to a sermon, it is generally that the Spirit
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:48.000]   reminds you of a portion of Scripture, brings it back to you. It is generally in terms of
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:54.320]   Scriptural teaching, rather than something entirely independent of that. It makes you
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:33:04.080]   recollect the teaching of the Scripture. And in any case, it is always something that confirms
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:10.440]   the teaching of the Scripture. It's always directly in accord with it. It's the Spirit
[00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:15.480]   who gives the word. It is the Spirit who gives this testimony. Obviously, they're in agreement,
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:21.480]   and they work together, and each points to the other. That's a very good test also.
[00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:30.040]   But then of course I come to something which is of very great and central importance. The
[00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:41.040]   hallmark almost of the true experience is a sense of awe, accompanied with it a sense
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:52.760]   of unworthiness. Why? Well, because the Holy Spirit is the Holy Spirit. And when he comes
[00:33:52.760 --> 00:34:01.320]   in great power, as he does in this experience, he gives us some impression of the glory and
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:09.280]   the greatness and the majesty and the holiness of God. You noticed it came out in all the
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:17.000]   experiences. It came out also in that sixth chapter of Isaiah, which we read at the beginning.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:23.120]   When Isaiah was given this glimpse of the glory of God, what did he say? He said, "Woe
[00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:30.640]   is me, for I am undone, for I am a man of unclean lips." What happened to John on the
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:36.600]   Isle of Patmos? He says, you know, that he was in the Spirit. Why does he say that? Well,
[00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:41.000]   because he wasn't always in the Spirit. The Spirit was always in him, but this was
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   something quite exceptional. This was this peculiar operation of the Spirit. "I was
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:51.320]   in the Spirit on the Sabbath day," says John. In other words, it was this kind of
[00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:57.200]   experience. And you remember how he describes it. But what was the effect? He says, "When
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:07.960]   I saw him, I fell down as one dead." Why? Well, not so much in fear as in awe. The sight
[00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:15.600]   of the glory, the majesty, the wonderful character of it all. And the moment a man sees this,
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:20.040]   and that is invariably what the Holy Spirit does, one is at once not only filled with
[00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:27.000]   a sense of awe, but with utter unworthiness, a feeling of sinfulness. They are all agreed
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:32.040]   about this. The first thing the Holy Spirit does is to make you see the blackness of your
[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:36.560]   own heart, your own sinfulness. At one and the same time, you are being given this great
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:44.000]   assurance and you feel totally unworthy of it. Accompanied with this, of course, is a
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:52.840]   great sense of thankfulness that such an experience has been vouchsafed unto you, that God has
[00:35:52.840 --> 00:36:01.680]   been so gracious. Another ingredient which is invariable is this, that the Lord Jesus
[00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:09.360]   Christ is glorified. He taught that, didn't he? He said that he'd send the Spirit and
[00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:14.440]   that the Spirit would glorify him. "He shall glorify me," he said. "He shall not speak
[00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:19.360]   of himself," that means that he doesn't speak out of himself, "but he shall take the things,"
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:25.640]   he says, "my things and reveal them unto you. He shall glorify me." Oh, this is a most wonderful
[00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:30.840]   test, this, and it never fails. If what you've had makes you think of the experience and
[00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:38.320]   what you felt and sensed, and has no reference to the Lord Jesus Christ, well then, my dear
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:43.680]   friend, you have every reason to think it is the false and the spurious experience.
[00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:49.040]   He has been given to glorify Christ, and the greater the power with which he comes, the
[00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:53.680]   greater will be your knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ. Now, this is a very interesting
[00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:59.960]   thing in connection with revival. And a revival, you see, is nothing but a large number of
[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:05.160]   people having this experience at the same time. That's exactly what a revival is. It's
[00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:10.920]   the Spirit coming in this great power upon people and giving them this assurance. But
[00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:18.320]   you know what they sing about in revival? It's quite a universal thing. They don't
[00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:24.240]   sing so much about the Holy Spirit. They sing about the Lord Jesus Christ. That was the
[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:28.880]   great characteristic of the hymns of the 18th century. Have you noticed Charles Wesley?
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:35.760]   All his greatest hymns are about the Lord Jesus Christ. So were those of William Cowper.
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:42.200]   So are all the hymns of that great period. It's the same in 1859. It was the same in
[00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:47.680]   Wales in 1904 and 5. The singing was about the Lord Jesus Christ and his blood and his
[00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:55.840]   death, and the power of Christ. Of necessity, the outpouring of the Spirit leads to an outburst
[00:37:55.840 --> 00:38:01.120]   of praise and of glorifying of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:06.360]   And again, another very good test is this. Not so much that I felt a kind of electric
[00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:13.760]   current going through my body as I'm given a great sense of God's love to me. The love
[00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:20.640]   of God shed abroad in my heart. And I'm amazed and astonished at it, and can scarcely
[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:27.960]   believe it. Another thing is this. The sense of the glory that awaits me and the inheritance
[00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:35.200]   for which I am being prepared. Now the apostle, you notice, in this very context, goes on
[00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:41.240]   to that, and as he must. "The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are
[00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:49.560]   children of God. And if children, then heirs, heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ.
[00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:53.960]   If so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together." So it's
[00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:58.640]   almost an invariable accompaniment of this experience that one is given a glimpse of
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:06.240]   that inheritance and of the glory, and that one becomes very concerned about that. So
[00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:11.840]   you find so many of them saying that they felt that they were lifted right out of time,
[00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:15.120]   that they didn't seem to belong any longer to time. John Flavel, you remember, tells
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:20.160]   us he even forgot about his wife and children, forgot everything. All he knew was that he
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:24.480]   was a child of God, that he was destined for that glory, and he wanted to get there. I
[00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:29.240]   gave you other examples of people desiring exactly the same thing. Now that's what the
[00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:35.080]   apostle is teaching here. "If children, then heirs, heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ."
[00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:41.080]   And not only that. "Whatever your circumstances may be at the time, you may be desperately
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:46.960]   ill, as some of them were. You may have everything going against you. You may be dying. You may
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:52.240]   have lost all your goods. You may be persecuted. Anything terrible may be happening to you.
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:57.000]   But this is what happens to you. You are able to say with the apostle, 'I reckon that
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:02.640]   the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which
[00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:09.600]   shall be revealed unto us.' You are made independent of your circumstances and conditions.
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:15.080]   You are so certain that you are going to that glory that in a sense nothing else matters
[00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:22.240]   to you." Very well. There are the main differences in the accompaniments of this experience.
[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:27.640]   And you apply every one of them to test any experience that you may happen to have had.
[00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:32.600]   Let me say just a word before I close about the consequences. They're obviously again
[00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:41.360]   most important. In the case of the false experience, the consequence is pride. Pride. Talking about
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:49.200]   this experience, bursting about it, with all this emphasis on the phenomenal side. And
[00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:57.880]   accompanying it, a glibness. A glibness. A sense of false security. A negligence in the
[00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:01.880]   life. You see, you've had this great experience without seeking it and without striving after
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:05.680]   holiness. Well, why should you bother to do so now? You've got it, it's happened to
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:11.040]   you, you are all right. There is always this glibness, and I would say almost at the same
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:18.040]   time this hardness, this self-satisfaction. It never rings true. There's no humility
[00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:27.040]   about it, either at the time or afterwards. But a carnal self-satisfaction and a delight
[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:33.520]   in bursting to others about this wonderful thing that has happened to you. The true,
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:38.040]   of course, the consequences of the true are the exact opposite. Did you notice that D.
[00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:42.520]   L. Moody said that he scarcely ever referred to that thing which happened to him as he
[00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:47.640]   walked down Wall Street in New York City that afternoon when the Holy Spirit came upon him?
[00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:53.200]   He scarcely ever mentioned it. Why? Well, it was too sacred. The holiness, he was almost
[00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:59.960]   afraid to. And the others, the Puritans, said exactly the same thing. They all agreed in
[00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:08.320]   this. They said it is much more easily known than it is described. The thing is so transcendent.
[00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:14.160]   You can't describe it in a sense. You know it. The love of Jesus, what it is, none but
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:18.960]   his loved ones know. And they find it very difficult to put it into words. But the men
[00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:25.280]   with a false experience get no such difficulty. The artifact of the devil, this exaggeration.
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:29.000]   You can describe the ball of fire and the electric current and all the rest of it, of
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.400]   course. But you see, it is by definition a part of this that it is very difficult to
[00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:40.720]   describe it. So you don't go around bursting about it. It's this hidden manna, it's
[00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:48.760]   this white stone. It is this secret transaction, as it were, between your Heavenly Father and
[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:54.240]   yourself, between the Son and yourself, between the Holy Spirit and yourself. And you don't
[00:42:54.240 --> 00:43:01.200]   talk about it. You don't cast your pearls before swine. You don't parade this in the
[00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:06.640]   same way as anybody who knows anything about love for a person doesn't parade it. These
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:11.640]   people who address everybody as dear and darling don't regard anybody as dear or darling.
[00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:15.960]   Or they couldn't use the term so easily. Of course they don't. They don't know anything
[00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:20.800]   about it. It's the false, it's the make-believe, it's the counterfeit, it's the spurious,
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:27.920]   it's the devil. No, no. There's an essential difference here. Ah, but the characteristics,
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:34.720]   the consequences of this true experience are a great love to God and a desire to please
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:40.720]   Him. You see, when the Spirit bears witness with you as Spirit, you will then, of necessity,
[00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:46.960]   be crying, "Abba, Father, also." You can't have this without the Abba, Father, though
[00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:52.800]   you can have the Abba, Father, without this. But this always leads to this. He is telling
[00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:58.240]   you in this unusual way, His love to you, and back goes your love to Him. It's inevitable.
[00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:04.480]   We love Him because He first loved us. It's that to the nth degree. And it leads to a
[00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:12.960]   deeper view of sin, I say. To a greater hatred of sin. "Woe is me." Ah, you've seen the
[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:18.840]   holiness and you've seen your own ugliness and vileness, your own dumb. You feel the
[00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:23.360]   need of cleansing and you do all you can about it yourself. Deeper view of sin, deeper hatred
[00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:30.800]   of sin, greater carefulness in the life. A desire to serve God and the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:39.640]   utterly and absolutely. What else now, then? I'm concerned about these next. A freedom
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:47.800]   in prayer that we've never known before, both in private and in public. That's a very
[00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:54.240]   good test, that. You cannot know this witness of the Spirit with you as Spirit without being
[00:44:54.240 --> 00:45:02.680]   set free. And free in prayer, free in worship, praise, adoration. It's true of private prayer,
[00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:07.320]   it is equally true of public prayer. There's no difficulty in getting people to prayer
[00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:11.800]   meetings in a revival. There's no difficulty in persuading them to take part in a revival.
[00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:16.200]   There are no long pauses between prayers in revival. There is a freedom of the Spirit.
[00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:21.920]   Why? Well, because the man is full, and full of this sense of wonder, love, and praise.
[00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:29.520]   He also knows spiritual power. He's aware of a power in his conversation, in his testimony.
[00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:33.520]   He's aware of a power in his preaching that he never knew before. He was preaching correctly
[00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:37.800]   before. He knew what it was at times to be given ease and freedom. But not like this.
[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:43.320]   This is new. He's looking on, as it were. He's aware that it is the power of the Holy
[00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:51.880]   Spirit. And accompanying all this, of course, you lose your fear of men. You lose your fear
[00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:57.480]   of life, as Paul goes on to say here. You see it all in Peter, the craven Peter who
[00:45:57.480 --> 00:46:02.160]   denied his Lord just at the time of the cross because he was afraid of death. Look at his
[00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:06.560]   boldness on the day of Pentecost and ever afterwards. That's it. And Paul, though he
[00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:14.680]   knew weakness, fear, and much trembling, spoke with great boldness and authority. There it
[00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:20.640]   is. And last of all, I would say this. And perhaps
[00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:27.360]   it's one of the most subtle tests of all. The man who's ever known this is a man whose
[00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:34.520]   supreme desire is to know more of this. I put it in terms of the Apostle's statement
[00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:42.880]   in Philippians 3, 10 and 11. What is the supreme desire of the Apostle Paul? Sometimes it's
[00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:51.920]   unsurprising, but this is how he puts it. "That I may know him and the power of his
[00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:56.960]   resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death, if
[00:46:56.960 --> 00:47:05.400]   by any means I might attain unto the resurrection from among the dead." If you, I say, know
[00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:14.200]   anything about this, your supreme desire will be to know the Lord Jesus Christ still more
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:24.920]   intimately, still more personally, still more powerfully. In other words, I believe that
[00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:30.360]   the prayer of a man who has ever known this witness of the Spirit, this sealing of the
[00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:38.720]   Spirit, is the prayer that was so dear to the heart of that great man of God, Hudson
[00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:43.640]   Taylor, who founded the China Inland Mission. You remember his prayer, found on a sheet
[00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:49.440]   of paper in his Bible when he died. "Lord Jesus, make thyself to me a living, bright
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:57.520]   reality, more present to faith's vision keen than any outward object seen, more dear, more
[00:47:57.520 --> 00:48:07.480]   intimately nigh than ye the sweetest earthly tithe." Oh, once a man has known anything
[00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:15.160]   about this experience, he says to me, "To live is Christ, to die is gain." He says
[00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:25.680]   with Count Zinzendorf, "I have one passion, and one passion only. It is he." To have
[00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:31.360]   a glimpse of him, to have this knowledge of him and our relationship to him, means that
[00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:40.680]   ever after this is the supreme passion and desire of the soul. Not to have wonderful
[00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:45.160]   experiences, not to be able to speak with tongues or do this or that, oh, but to know
[00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:53.240]   him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made
[00:48:53.240 --> 00:49:02.360]   conformable unto his death. Let us pray.
[00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:11.440]   O Lord our God, we thank thee once more for the riches of thy grace. For all thou dost
[00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:20.720]   make possible for us in and through thy dear Son. We thank thee at this moment especially
[00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:28.200]   for thy word and its teaching and its warnings and all that it enables us to do. O God, make
[00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:36.480]   us wise in these matters, but above all we humbly beseech thee, manifest thyself unto
[00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:51.920]   us more of thyself. O grant us hour by hour. Tell me thou art mine, O Savior. Grant me
[00:49:51.920 --> 00:50:03.160]   an assurance clear. Banish all my dark misgivings. O Lord, hear the cry of every honest and true
[00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:10.640]   heart in thy presence that longs thus for thee.
[00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:17.000]   And now may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship and
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:24.040]   the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night throughout
[00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:32.240]   the remainder of this hour's short uncertain earthly life and pilgrimage. And until we
[00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:41.280]   shall see him face to face and be like him. Amen.
[00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:45.360]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones. All of
