[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.900]   - Well, as Thursday's episode ended last week, Pastor John,
[00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.180]   you had just begun to talk to us about the joy of learning.
[00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.700]   We'll never understand your model for lifelong learning
[00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.500]   or for education if we leave the affections
[00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.760]   and the emotions out of the equation.
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.000]   I mean, it just won't make sense.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.600]   And this explains why the words joy and feeling,
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.220]   terms of emotion and affection,
[00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.960]   are terms that we see all over your older book titled,
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.600]   "Think, the Life of the Mind and the Love of God."
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.280]   In that book, in "Think," you mentioned those two terms,
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.940]   joy and feeling, 110 times.
[00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.760]   Closely linking proper thinking with proper feeling.
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.020]   That book, "Think," is 12 and a half years old now.
[00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.600]   So I was eager to see how often you use those terms
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.880]   of joy and feeling in this new book.
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.000]   And they dominate even more.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.760]   The words joy and feeling appear 357 times in your new book,
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.200]   "Foundations for Lifelong Learning,
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.600]   "Education in Serious Joy."
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.520]   Those two terms, joy and feeling,
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.000]   are all over this new book,
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.900]   to the point that you make this claim explicitly, quote,
[00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.920]   "Some people think that emotions are marginal
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.840]   "in the task of education.
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.520]   "We regard them as essential," end quote.
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.720]   Unpack this, what essential role does joy and feeling play
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.440]   in Bible learning and in all of our learning?
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.680]   - This is so important.
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.360]   So, so important for understanding
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.400]   the nature of true education.
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.600]   When I try to help people understand what we are doing
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.240]   at Bethlehem College and Seminary, or in my life,
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.240]   I regularly mention these six habits of mind and heart
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.760]   that we're trying to build into the lives of our students,
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.480]   or that I'm trying to build into my own life.
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.880]   Both college students and seminary students,
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.960]   and everybody else who will listen,
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.440]   we don't think education is mainly
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.000]   the imparting of information,
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.360]   or mainly the training in a technical skill,
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.360]   but mainly it's the formation of a mature disciple of Christ
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.720]   who can go on learning for a lifetime of wisdom and wonder
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.000]   in whatever vocation God calls them.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.440]   So, when I'm trying to help folks understand what we do,
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.440]   I mention these six habits, observation, understanding,
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.080]   evaluation, feeling, alarm bells go off,
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.800]   application, expression.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.480]   And the order is really important.
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.440]   It makes a huge difference because these habits
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.720]   are governed by a Christ-exalting, God-centered,
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.880]   Bible-saturated worldview.
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.520]   So, first we observe accurately.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.000]   We're honest people.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.840]   Then we understand truly what we've observed.
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.480]   Then we evaluate fairly on the basis
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.800]   of accurate observation and true understanding.
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.040]   Then we feel appropriately.
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.720]   Then in all the ways of wisdom,
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.800]   we apply what we have observed and understood
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.600]   and evaluated and felt,
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.000]   and then we give expression with our mouth
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.760]   and in writing in compelling ways that glorify God
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.320]   and bring blessing to people.
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.840]   And what I find is that it's the fourth habit
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.400]   of mind and heart that puzzles people,
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.160]   causes them to have a question mark on their face.
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.840]   And it's the one that you're asking about, feeling,
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.840]   namely joy or feeling or whatever appropriate emotions
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.200]   should arise as one is observing
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.680]   and understanding and evaluating.
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.280]   So we observe, we understand, we evaluate,
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.080]   and then I say, we feel, we feel appropriately.
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.520]   And people wonder, really, really?
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.080]   I mean, one of your six aims of a college education
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.600]   or a seminary education is feeling?
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.360]   And the answer is a resounding and unashamed yes.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.920]   I mean, when all is said and done in education,
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.720]   this may be the one habit of mind
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.720]   that distinguishes true education
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.560]   from artificial intelligence.
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:53.240]   At one level, computers observe, understand,
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.360]   evaluate, apply, express,
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.200]   but no computer will ever love or hate
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.720]   or admire or hope or rejoice or sympathize.
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.000]   No matter what emotional words the computer speaks out,
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.880]   doesn't matter what they say, it's not going to happen.
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.920]   These are distinctively human acts
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.000]   of the God-created image of God's soul,
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.640]   and they are all important in the Bible.
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:28.480]   The number one commandment in the Bible
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.560]   is not know the Lord your God,
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.560]   but love the Lord your God with all your heart, all of it,
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.840]   all your heart.
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.400]   And Paul said,
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.080]   "Let those who do not have love for the Lord be anathema."
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.600]   He said that the whole Old Testament was written
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.600]   that we might have hope and emotion, hope.
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:02.320]   Over and over, we are commanded to rejoice in the Lord,
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.880]   to serve the Lord with gladness.
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.200]   We are commanded to weep with those who weep
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.320]   and rejoice with those who rejoice.
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:15.320]   We're commanded to be tender-hearted, tender-hearted.
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.600]   That's not a thought, it's a feeling.
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.160]   And to feel compassion, these are not optional.
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.920]   They're not peripheral in the Bible.
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:27.360]   They are essential to being a whole human being,
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.920]   an educated human being, to being a Christian.
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:36.920]   Nobody is saved by thinking true thoughts about God
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:41.160]   or even believing true things about God.
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:46.080]   The devil believes more true things about God than we do
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.280]   because he knows more than we know about God.
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.800]   But he hates them all.
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.920]   He hates these things about God that he knows.
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:54.840]   He hates them.
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.120]   That's a feeling, he hates them.
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.480]   That's the main issue in life.
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.480]   It's the main issue, it's not a peripheral issue.
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.160]   It's not what he thinks that's the problem.
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.920]   He feels all the wrong things.
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.040]   That's what makes him the devil.
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.480]   And shall we neglect in education
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:16.880]   the very thing that sets us apart from the demons?
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:21.080]   The very thing that fulfills the great commandment,
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.960]   shall we neglect it?
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:27.360]   The very thing that shows we're not mere walking computers.
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:31.080]   We are humans created in the image of God.
[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:36.080]   So yes, yes, yes, yes, we seek to build into our own lives
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:42.840]   and the lives of our students and our APJ listeners right now
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:47.840]   the habits of observing accurately, understanding truly,
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:51.400]   evaluating fairly, and I wish I could scream it
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:56.040]   from the housetops, feeling appropriately,
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:59.560]   and then applying wisely and expressing compellingly.
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.920]   And when we say feeling appropriately,
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:09.040]   we mean there are healthy, mature, and virtuous emotions
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:14.680]   in response to different realities.
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:19.680]   And there are unhealthy, immature, and evil emotions
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:23.280]   in responding to different realities.
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:28.280]   It's evil, evil to rejoice over the spreading of a lie.
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:33.920]   It's a sign of mental unhealth not to feel empathy
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:39.400]   for a fellow Christian languishing in prison for his faith.
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:45.520]   It's a sign of emotional immaturity to giggle
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:48.400]   at a slip up in a public communication.
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:53.880]   This is the real stuff of education.
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:56.880]   Knowledge is good, knowledge is necessary,
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:58.680]   love is better.
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.640]   A critical mind is a gift.
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:06.640]   A well-formed soul with deep and virtuous emotions
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:09.080]   is a greater gift.
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.640]   C.S. Lewis, we love Lewis,
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.960]   wrote about education in "The Abolition of Man."
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:18.080]   Alan Jacobs in his biography of Lewis
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:21.880]   sums up Lewis's point in "The Abolition of Man" like this,
[00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:25.880]   "Lewis passionately believed that education
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:28.160]   is not about providing information
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:33.160]   so much as cultivating habits of the heart,
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:38.560]   producing men with chests, as he put it
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.320]   in his book, "The Abolition of Man."
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:45.760]   That is, so here's his explanation of men with chests,
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:49.160]   people who not only think,
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:54.160]   as they should, but respond as they should
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:58.000]   instinctively and emotionally
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   to the challenges and blessings the world offers them.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.200]   To which I say, exactly, exactly.
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:11.720]   Education aims at right thinking about the world
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:15.320]   and right emotional responses to the world.
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:20.320]   Now, of course, once we say that and believe that,
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:23.880]   we are launched into the massive question
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:27.040]   of what makes a feeling virtuous.
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:30.280]   This is why secular colleges and universities
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:35.280]   cannot state the aims of their education the way we do.
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:39.360]   They cannot say that their aim is to build
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.040]   into their students' lives the habit
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.760]   of forming virtuous feelings
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:45.440]   because there's no consensus in the universities
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.760]   about what makes a feeling virtuous.
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:50.960]   Say a feeling about sex outside marriage,
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.600]   a feeling about trying to change your sex,
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:57.320]   a feeling about killing unborn children,
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:59.760]   a feeling about certain economic strategies,
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:04.560]   feelings about Jesus Christ and the way of salvation.
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:07.640]   They have no way that they can agree
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:10.640]   on what is a virtuous feeling in response
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:13.000]   to those massive realities,
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.720]   which is a tragedy when you think about it.
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:19.480]   That our kids are being educated in institutions
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:24.000]   that cannot state their goals that way.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.240]   The fact that in this new book,
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:29.080]   "Foundations of Lifelong Learning,"
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:31.680]   I include an entire chapter
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:36.680]   on the lifelong educational goal of appropriate feelings,
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:41.600]   virtuous feelings, that only makes sense.
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:45.080]   The existence of that chapter only makes sense
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.600]   because I believe in radically Christian,
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:50.880]   Bible-saturated, Christ-exalting education.
[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:55.160]   This podcast, that book, Bethlehem College and Seminary,
[00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.600]   all of this, all my life,
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:01.560]   aims at cultivating the mental and emotional habit
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:04.160]   of experiencing virtuous feelings.
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:09.160]   A virtuous feeling in response to an accurately observed,
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:14.680]   rightly understood, truly evaluated object
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:16.640]   is a glorious thing.
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:20.280]   A virtuous feeling is a glorious thing.
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:24.680]   A virtuous feeling is an authentic overflow
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:28.880]   of the good treasure of the heart of faith.
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:32.960]   A virtuous feeling is shaped and intensified
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:37.040]   and limited by the fruit of the Holy Spirit.
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:42.040]   A virtuous feeling is an expression of love to God
[00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:47.160]   and people, even when it is hatred of evil.
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:53.520]   A virtuous feeling is a Christ-exalting feeling.
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:59.120]   We are not well-educated people
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:03.000]   until we can respond to reality
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   in healthy, mature, virtuous, appropriate ways
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.960]   as we feel appropriately.
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:16.680]   That will include abhorrence of what is evil,
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:18.480]   Romans 12.9.
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:22.520]   It will include sympathy for the suffering, Romans 12.15.
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:26.680]   It will include fear of any hint of unbelief
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.800]   rising in my heart, Romans 11.20.
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:33.720]   It will include overflowing joy
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:37.440]   in response to the gospel of the grace of God,
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:40.680]   2 Corinthians 8, verse two.
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:45.320]   That's why the subtitle of the new book
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:50.320]   is "Education in Serious, Serious Joy."
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:54.280]   Joy will be the dominant feeling
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.040]   for the Christian in this life,
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:00.600]   but in a world like ours,
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:05.560]   it will be serious, even sorrowful joy.
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:09.360]   - Yeah, education exists for virtuous feeling.
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:14.080]   Christ-exalting education, this podcast, the new book,
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:17.760]   Bethlehem College and Seminary, all of this, all my life,
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:21.600]   aims at cultivating the mental and emotional habit
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.520]   of experiencing virtuous feeling.
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:29.320]   A virtuous feeling in response to an accurately observed,
[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:34.320]   rightly understood, truly evaluated object, end quote.
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:38.720]   That is a mouthful, but that's a game changer as well
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:41.560]   when it comes to considering schools and academic options
[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:46.560]   for education for yourself or for your young adult.
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:49.440]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thanks for joining us today.
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:52.240]   If you want to ask Pastor John, type out your question
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.360]   as briefly as possible, please,
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:57.440]   and email it to me at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:00.520]   Well, our episode up next on Thursday
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:03.120]   lands on a national holiday for us here in the States,
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:04.440]   Thanksgiving.
[00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:05.560]   Thanksgiving is Thursday,
[00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:08.280]   but Thanksgiving is for all of us all the time,
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:10.600]   and we return with a fitting question
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:14.600]   from a listener on Romans 1:21,
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:17.520]   and how our Godward thanksgiving,
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:20.640]   or lack of Godward thanksgiving,
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:25.200]   shapes the entire trajectory of our lives.
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:27.720]   Paul makes this claim in Romans 1.
[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:32.720]   So how is the story of your life told by your thanksgiving?
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.440]   We'll find out Thursday.
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:35.400]   We'll see you then.
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:38.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.600]   (upbeat music)
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:50.600]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
