[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   I'm here at SHEPCON 2024. Can you guys introduce yourself?
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Yeah, my name is Lance Burrows, and I'm an associate pastor at Countryside Bible Church in South Lake, Texas.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   All right, and how about you?
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   I'm Jonathan Anderson. I'm also one of the pastors at Countryside there in South Lake.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   All right, awesome. And you guys have been reading the LSB a little bit. What do you think?
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   Yeah, we've been working through the LSB off and on for the last few years that it's been out.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   And to answer your question, I might want to take it a different direction just in terms of the readability of the typesetting.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   I think I've told you before in our conversations that in my view, out of all of the Bibles that you can get,
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   the LSB and what you guys have done in terms of typesetting and the clarity of the page and the organization of the text,
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   I do think it's by far the best. And that's the truth.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   How about yourself?
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   Yeah, I mean, I appreciate tons about the LSB translation.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   I think as a pastor in our church, what I've appreciated most is just the high standard and commitment to excellence in translation that exalts the Word.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   You know, we want our congregation to know that God's Word is exalted, and we have a high view of it,
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   and it's to be treated with the utmost respect and clarity.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   And to have a translation that really reflects that is huge.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   So, yeah, really grateful for it and appreciate it personally and as a pastor.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   Hey, well, we appreciate you guys at Countryside.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   You guys are doing incredible ministry.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   We hear so many good things, so thank you guys for your faithful service and your love for Christ.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   We appreciate it.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   Yeah, thanks, Gary.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Thank you.
