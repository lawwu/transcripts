[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440]   I'm Cal Newport and this is Deep Questions,
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:12.120]   episode 202.
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.120]   I'm here in my Deep Work HQ,
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.120]   joined by my producer, Jesse.
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.680]   Jesse, before I forget, I have a unsolicited plug
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.040]   I want to do.
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.640]   A friend of mine and a friend of the show,
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.360]   Steve Magnus, has a new book out.
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.480]   The name might sound familiar.
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.920]   He was on the show in an episode we did a while ago.
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.400]   Him and Brad Stolberg, they do a podcast together
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.200]   called The Growth Equation.
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.240]   They came on my show and we talked about Matt Crawford's
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.720]   book.
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.400]   So if that name sounds familiar, that's
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.000]   probably where you've heard it from.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   Anyways, he has a new book out with a title that I think
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.920]   everyone will quickly see why I like this book.
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.680]   It's a very Cal Newport approved title.
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.240]   It is called Do Hard Things.
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.200]   So sort of a cool title.
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.520]   Anyways, good book.
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.960]   Steve is a world class runner and a running coach.
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.760]   And so he brings an expertise from actually helping people
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.280]   do demonstrably hard things to this question of how do you
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.600]   actually tackle big challenges.
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.120]   And he pushes back on a lot of the sort
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.560]   of conventional wisdom of just be tough
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.960]   and show no weakness, just get after it.
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.400]   And he has a much more sort of nuanced, sophisticated view
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.400]   of how people get through hard things
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.520]   and accomplish hard things.
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.280]   So check out Steve's newest book.
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.120]   Have you worked out with him before?
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.440]   No.
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.240]   So I'm in a writers--
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.960]   I have a couple of writers groups I'm in.
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.360]   But I'm in a writers group with Steve.
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.200]   And there's five of us in the group.
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.080]   Three of them are serious runners.
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.360]   And they're always talking about their serious running.
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.320]   And three of them have run on a semi-regular basis
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.000]   with Gladwell, who's also a very serious runner.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.080]   And having talked to them about what they do
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.560]   and about their runs with Gladwell,
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.440]   I'm convinced if I was ever invited
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.840]   to go on a run with Gladwell, I would be dead probably.
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.880]   You could take him down the rower, though.
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:11.480]   Take him down the rower.
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.640]   Yeah, I have more body mass.
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.120]   I can really get that wheel moving.
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.720]   So anyways, yeah, it's like a bunch
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.680]   of really serious, like, ex-college runners,
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.840]   and then me and Brad Stolberg, the meatheads who hop and pop
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.720]   if we try to run.
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.440]   Row and clean, CrossFit style.
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.040]   Exactly.
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.920]   I'm going to row clean, lift heavy weights.
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:30.640]   Oh, well.
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.100]   Here's the other milestone, Jesse.
[00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.040]   This is the last time I will be recording
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.280]   this podcast in my 30s.
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.720]   Tomorrow is the day when I join Jesse
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.560]   as an old man in our 40s.
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.040]   Jesse crossed a milestone a month or two ago.
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.360]   And so there we are.
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.280]   So I talk about this on the show sometimes.
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.680]   I always have a set of goals for each birthday
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.600]   that I work on throughout the year, usually
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.960]   about halfway through the year, I start working towards.
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.960]   And it's project whatever year it is.
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.400]   Project 38, Project 39, Project 40.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.760]   So I'm coming up to that deadline.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.960]   It's tomorrow, the day after I'm recording this.
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.600]   I think it's gone pretty well.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.360]   The big issue with my birthday project this year
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.840]   is the advantage of my actual birth date,
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.120]   which is June 23, is that as a professor on the semester
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.560]   system, I'm usually done with my semester by early May.
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.320]   And there's this nice, long six-week period
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.520]   where my kids are largely still in school
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.040]   and I have more free time.
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:40.360]   And it's really a period where I finalize the things on my goal
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.840]   list for my birthday.
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.240]   That all got disrupted this year.
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.480]   A, I had some travel in that period.
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.600]   So that disrupted it to some degree.
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.520]   And then we had COVID go through the family.
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.360]   That disrupted it as well.
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.200]   So I might actually extend--
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.640]   maybe I'll try to extend the deadline a little bit past
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.920]   my birthday.
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.920]   Because that's my beautiful period,
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.120]   to actually get things done.
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.240]   But I think it's gone pretty well.
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:13.080]   I won't go through all of my birthday project goals.
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.200]   But I'm looking at my list here.
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.400]   There are some fitness goals I had, including the rower
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.400]   goal we talked about.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.480]   And there are some weightlifting goals.
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.120]   I hit them.
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.720]   I had a big list of sort of boring goals.
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.120]   These were just if you're going to be a grown-up in middle age,
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.880]   there are things--
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:28.960]   I just wanted to get worked out.
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:29.840]   This is boring stuff.
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.800]   But getting our estate and wills figured out,
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.920]   moving over to a financial planner
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.040]   that is going to automate a lot of the finances,
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.680]   hiring someone to just go through and throw out
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.320]   all my old clothes and just buy reasonable adult clothes for me
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.720]   so I don't have to worry about it.
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.280]   So there's a whole long list of things
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.040]   like that that I got through.
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.120]   There's some-- I can't get into specifics,
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.920]   but some professional disruptions and goals
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:01.160]   that emerged during this last year that you can't force it.
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.120]   But there are things lurking.
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.320]   There might be some interesting configuration
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.120]   shifts in my professional life that I'm looking forward to.
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.720]   I couldn't get them done by 40.
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.040]   Wheels are in motion.
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.200]   Things are complicated.
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.000]   I can't force it.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.720]   But I'm pretty happy, I would say, Jesse.
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.160]   I'm pretty happy with hitting my goals
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.320]   or getting close to the goals I had for turning 40.
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.840]   Some made some big changes.
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.520]   Some big changes are coming.
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.720]   Look, I don't want to give away my professional goals.
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.880]   I'll just say it has something to do with professional HVAC
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.680]   installation.
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.840]   What's the matter with your current wardrobe?
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:43.040]   I just had random clothes that didn't fit well.
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.880]   And I can't deal with that.
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.240]   I don't have any skill or interest.
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.880]   But I'm more and more among camera.
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:57.520]   And I'm on stages and cameras and TV and video podcast.
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.040]   And I have to do publicity tours and stuff like this.
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.960]   And I realized I should probably wear clothes
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.480]   that fit or this or that.
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.680]   And so I just hired a guy.
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:08.480]   How's that going?
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.760]   I think I'm doing fine.
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.320]   Yeah.
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:16.040]   He flew out and he goes out and sets up the
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.040]   dressing rooms ahead of time the day before.
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.600]   And then you show up and it's just like all of
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.560]   these clothes and you just go through it.
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.520]   It doesn't do this, not this, not this, do this.
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.080]   The whole day was like an eight hour day.
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.160]   Eight hour day.
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.600]   Oh yeah.
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.200]   I'm talking, we're going from scratch here.
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.760]   Shorts, jeans, t-shirts, formal shirts, a new suit.
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:35.720]   Flip flops.
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:36.640]   Basically.
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.880]   Four new pairs of shoes.
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.440]   I was like, whatever you need to do,
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.520]   I don't want to think about it.
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.240]   Just make it happen.
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.160]   Did you talk to this guy about any of his other clients?
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:51.720]   I did.
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:52.960]   He must have some interesting ones.
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:53.400]   He does.
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:59.040]   Well, so he specializes in men, which is more rare.
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:04.520]   Most of the, if you look at "stylists" who work with men,
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:09.640]   98% of that is corporate stuff.
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:13.000]   98% of it, if you find like, I am a stylist that works with men,
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.240]   it is, OK, you just got promoted to CTO of your large Beltway
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.920]   Bandit whatever company.
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.040]   And you have to wear the right suits and the right shirts.
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:23.720]   And they're busy.
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:24.480]   And like, I don't want to think about it.
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.400]   I got to look.
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.720]   I'm going to these clients who are trying
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:27.880]   to sign these big deals.
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:31.440]   And I'm going overseas to sign a deal with a German whatever
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:31.960]   manufacturer.
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.160]   And that's what most male stylists are,
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.560]   is we will get you the right haircut and suit and tie
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.160]   so you don't have to worry about that.
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:44.320]   This guy is one of the few that deals with not just that.
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:47.480]   I talked to, honestly, like a lot of his clients are tech
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:53.480]   bros who like emerged from--
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.200]   I don't know what that says about me.
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:58.920]   But they emerged from the basement.
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:01.520]   They've been just coding their whole life.
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.840]   And they exited their company.
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.320]   And they're a deck of millionaires.
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.760]   And they're like, I should probably dress like a grown up.
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:11.160]   And I want to talk to girls, basically, or some of that.
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.480]   And then also, he said, some of their clients are just--
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:16.720]   again, people, they've worked hard careers.
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.960]   Maybe they're going through a transition later in life.
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.960]   They're downgrading their careers or whatever.
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.320]   And they're like, you know what?
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:24.960]   I never really thought about my clothes.
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:28.040]   I just worn the same business casual.
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.280]   So there's probably a lot of midlife crisis-y stuff
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:30.920]   in there, too.
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:31.400]   Yeah.
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:32.560]   Yeah, I guess I fit right in.
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:34.240]   I was honestly like, I don't care much.
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.720]   I just need to-- if I go on camera,
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:37.760]   I want to look reasonable.
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.360]   If I go on stage or I'm in a documentary
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:44.360]   or around more well-known people,
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.320]   I do a little more TV now, this type of stuff.
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.920]   I was like, I don't know how to do this.
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.520]   But I should have a blazer that fits,
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:53.600]   that's interesting with a shirt, whatever.
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:54.800]   Whatever, folks.
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:55.840]   You got it done.
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:56.480]   I got it done.
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:56.960]   Check it off.
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:57.680]   Checklist.
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.320]   Checklist.
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.440]   All right, well, we got a good show.
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.360]   We got a 20-minute fashion segment
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:06.160]   where I'm just going to come through the HQ
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.600]   and show off different t-shirts I bought.
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.760]   By the way, hey, the one thing we did not replace--
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.600]   I did not need anyone to help me with this--
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.120]   is the podcast shirt.
[00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:18.520]   This shirt is only used for the podcast
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:21.440]   because it's just the color is just right for the backdrop.
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:24.160]   And you don't notice the shadow of the microphone on it.
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.640]   This shirt is only used for that purpose.
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.680]   It was my podcast shirt.
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.360]   That I needed no help with.
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.680]   Did you show them that shirt?
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.040]   I showed them the podcast shirt.
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.280]   Are you approved?
[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:39.520]   Yeah, I'm approved.
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:41.760]   I wore the podcast shirt on--
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.080]   I did a Netflix show in the podcast shirt as well.
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:48.560]   So the podcast shirt has been on Netflix and on here.
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:51.960]   I may have wore it to do Charlemagne, the God show
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.280]   on Comedy Central.
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.480]   So it's been on Comedy Central, on Netflix.
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:56.920]   Yeah, I'm getting my money's worth.
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.800]   It's funny, when I do the thumbnails for your YouTube
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.720]   channel, I'm always taking screenshots.
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.760]   And you always have the same shirt on.
[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:04.800]   I'm telling you, man, you'd think it'd be easy.
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.280]   But when you have a black backdrop and the type
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.560]   of lighting we have, I don't know.
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:11.880]   We've tried different shirts.
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:12.720]   It doesn't work.
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.120]   I don't know.
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.680]   Secrets.
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.320]   It's like Lex.
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.560]   Same suit.
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:21.400]   It's the Lex move.
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.560]   All right, well, we have a good show.
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:24.840]   Enough of that nonsense.
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:25.920]   We got written questions.
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.640]   We got calls.
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:31.120]   I have a habit tune-up I want to do a little later.
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:35.400]   But first, I want to do a quick news reaction,
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:40.440]   because I find this article to be a confirmation of something
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.360]   I've been talking about on this show, something
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:43.520]   that I have been predicting.
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:47.920]   And now we see experts who are confirming
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:49.280]   what I've been talking about.
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.840]   So here's the article.
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:52.680]   This came to me in my interesting account,
[00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:54.800]   a.com email address.
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:59.280]   It's from June 16, so a week or two ago.
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:03.720]   And it's TikTok, an executive from TikTok
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:06.960]   that is, to some degree, dunking on Facebook.
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.200]   And I won't get into details what they're saying here.
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.440]   And if you're watching this on YouTube,
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.560]   you'll be able to see the article.
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:15.360]   If you're listening, I'll tell you what's on the screen.
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:19.480]   All right, so they are quoting in this article
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:23.480]   a executive from TikTok, their president of Global Business
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.360]   Solutions.
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:27.760]   And he's making a clear distinction
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:30.600]   between TikTok and Facebook that I have made before.
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.520]   So this executive named Blake Chanley
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:36.360]   says, "Facebook is a social platform.
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.160]   They built all their algorithms based on the social graph.
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.440]   That is their core competency.
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:44.360]   Ours is not."
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.960]   All right, he goes on to clarify, what is TikTok?
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:50.000]   "We are an entertainment platform.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.360]   The difference is significant.
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:55.640]   It's a massive difference."
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:57.960]   Now, this is something I've talked about multiple times
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:01.720]   before on this show, this idea that TikTok and its popularity
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.680]   actually represents an important transition
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:08.000]   in the landscape of these attention economy apps.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.080]   And I actually think it is a positive transition.
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:14.400]   So it's easy instinctually, if you're a social media skeptic,
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.360]   to look at TikTok and everyone looking at this
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:18.160]   and the 600 million users and be like, oh, man,
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.120]   we're going down the same road.
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.560]   But I actually think it's positive.
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:23.080]   And this is why, what this executive is saying.
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:26.560]   TikTok is not playing the same game as Facebook.
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:29.000]   It is not a social company.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.160]   Their revenue stream is not based off
[00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.640]   of monetizing a social graph.
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:37.160]   It provides entertainment, straight to the brainstem
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:37.960]   entertainment.
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:40.440]   If you are bored, if you are trying
[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:43.840]   to escape a moment of existential despair,
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:46.120]   whatever the circumstance that wants you to get out
[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:48.920]   of your current moment, you pull up TikTok's app.
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:51.280]   It's these short videos, algorithmically optimized
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:51.960]   and selected.
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.600]   Boom, boom, boom, one after another.
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.560]   They hit these buttons in your brainstem.
[00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:58.640]   Slack jaw, drool coming out of the side of your mouth,
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:00.800]   just locked in, distracted.
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:04.400]   They are just optimizing, distracting entertainment.
[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:07.840]   No attempt to say, here's what your friend is up to.
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:09.840]   Here's an article that was shared by your cousin.
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:14.000]   Forget all that, just straight to the brainstem entertainment.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.320]   What the executive is saying is that Facebook, that's
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.720]   not what they were, but they're trying to do this.
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:21.400]   This is the premise of this article,
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:26.720]   is that Facebook is trying to, as I previewed they were,
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:30.760]   increasingly shift over towards this TikTok model.
[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:33.200]   Let me just put a quote here from the article.
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.640]   Facebook plans to modify its primary feed
[00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:38.200]   to look more like TikTok by recommending more content,
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:42.120]   regardless of whether it's shared by friends.
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.720]   And of course, why are they doing this?
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:45.040]   Because they are struggling.
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:46.560]   Here's the numbers from the article.
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:48.880]   The parent company of Facebook, Meta's stock price
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:52.440]   is down 52% this year, underperforming the Nasdaq,
[00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:55.040]   which only dropped 32%.
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:57.160]   In April, they said revenue in the second quarter
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:58.520]   could drop from a year earlier.
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:13:59.800]   That'd be the first time that's ever happened.
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:00.960]   So Facebook is struggling.
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.280]   They see TikTok being successful.
[00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:04.080]   Like, let's be more like TikTok.
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:07.400]   I think as I've said before, that is the beginning
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:11.680]   of the end for the social media platform monopolies.
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:16.240]   The one thing 2010 Facebook,
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.080]   when it was really starting to get humming,
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:20.960]   the one thing it had going for it was network effects.
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:24.880]   The people you know are on here.
[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:27.760]   If the primary use of this network is to connect with
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.760]   and see what people you know are up to,
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:31.240]   you have to come to our network
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:32.560]   and no one can compete with us
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:34.640]   because no one is gonna be able to get everyone you know
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:35.480]   onto their network.
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:36.320]   That is very hard.
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:39.240]   Once we've locked in with our first mover advantage,
[00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:42.160]   your cousin, your roommate, your brother, your sister,
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:43.680]   they're all on here.
[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.160]   We have this first mover advantage.
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.520]   You have to use our network
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:48.440]   because that's where the people you know are.
[00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:50.400]   As soon as you move out of the game
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.120]   of connecting the people you know,
[00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:55.000]   facilitating the sharing of information
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.440]   between people who already know each other.
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:57.860]   Once you move out of that game
[00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:01.680]   and move to the alternative game of brainstem manipulation,
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:06.900]   peer distraction, maximizing time on screen,
[00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:08.440]   we are the thing you wanna look at
[00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.200]   when you're trying to escape the current moment,
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.560]   you lose that advantage.
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:16.720]   It no longer matters that my cousin, my roommates,
[00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:18.280]   my brother, my sister are on your platform.
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:19.320]   If all I'm doing on that,
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:21.660]   as it says right here in this article,
[00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:26.000]   is seeing content recommended by an algorithm
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.600]   that has nothing to do with what's going on with my friends.
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:29.940]   So yes, maybe in the short term,
[00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:32.720]   it'll help Facebook stave off some of its numbers drops
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.920]   because they'll get more time on screen.
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:37.240]   But as I've said before, and I wanna emphasize again,
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:39.840]   the biggest conclusion of this shift among these players
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:42.000]   is that you are now in a competitive pool
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.600]   where you don't have the powerful network effects
[00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.880]   of people I specifically know need to be on there,
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:48.600]   and you are competing with anyone else
[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:51.240]   who's trying to provide entertainment and distraction.
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:53.560]   That is a very competitive pool,
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:56.380]   and it is a pool in which I think it is gonna be impossible
[00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:59.040]   for any one company to dominate in the way that,
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:01.660]   let's say a Facebook or an Instagram or a Twitter
[00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:03.860]   dominated our attention five, six years ago.
[00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:08.000]   If you are just an app on my phone that can distract me,
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.140]   that app is next to my podcast player.
[00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:13.760]   That app is next to YouTube videos.
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:16.560]   That app is next to video streamers
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:20.280]   investing billions of dollars in high-end entertainment
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:22.640]   that can come at me and be like any,
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:26.820]   unlike anything else that we have seen before.
[00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:31.000]   $200 million episodic series is competing with that,
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.420]   is competing with video games.
[00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:35.560]   It's competing with books and audio books.
[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:38.800]   It's competing with other activities you might do
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:40.080]   in the analog world.
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:41.800]   That is a much more competitive space.
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:43.320]   And I think once you're in that pool
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:47.000]   where all we're offering is distraction entertainment,
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.680]   all we're trying to do is to get eyes on screen,
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:53.080]   necessarily people's digital interactions
[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.900]   are going to fragment and go more niche.
[00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:57.520]   There is no reason for there to be a dominant player.
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:58.860]   TikTok is having a moment,
[00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:00.980]   but there's no reason for it to have to be
[00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:02.280]   something that everyone uses.
[00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:03.160]   Most people don't.
[00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:06.640]   It's popular, but there's no big issue if you don't.
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.080]   In a world of just distraction,
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:09.760]   people are going to fragment or segment
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:13.140]   towards distractions that they like in particular.
[00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:15.640]   You're really into a certain type of sports.
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:17.660]   Well, you're listening to that type of sports radio
[00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:20.440]   and podcasts by athletes in that sports.
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:23.200]   Maybe you're a political conservative
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:26.040]   and you're over in like the Ben Shapiro ecosystem,
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:28.120]   which has its own videos and its own shows
[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:30.320]   all about stuff that you're interested in.
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:32.680]   Maybe you're a board game enthusiast.
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:34.640]   There's a place for that.
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.440]   Maybe you're a Cal Newport type.
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:37.880]   You're interested in deep life
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:39.560]   and getting away from the more distracted living.
[00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:42.000]   So we have my videos, my podcast, my books.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.480]   It necessarily fragments once you no longer
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:47.160]   have the binding glue of the activity you're doing
[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:49.400]   requires people you know to be here.
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:51.620]   So I've been saying this, this article confirms it.
[00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:53.560]   Here it is, the head of TikTok saying,
[00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:55.560]   not the head, but an executive at TikTok saying,
[00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:57.660]   Facebook is trying to become more like us
[00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:00.580]   because they want their views to go up.
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:03.560]   But good luck.
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:04.720]   And I think he's right.
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:05.640]   You know, good luck.
[00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:07.120]   If you try to become an entertainment company,
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:08.240]   you compete with everyone else.
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:09.520]   So I see that as positive.
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:12.340]   I like TikTok, not actually using it,
[00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:13.680]   but I like what it's doing.
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:17.040]   TikTok is causing these other platforms
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:20.800]   that so had us captured and had such a capture on our culture
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:22.960]   is causing them to accidentally knock the legs
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:24.680]   out of their own proverbial table.
[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:28.000]   Get a short-term gain at the,
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.020]   in exchange for their long-term downfall,
[00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:31.720]   which I think is good.
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:33.320]   Social media universalism,
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:35.300]   when there was three platforms everyone had to use,
[00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:36.320]   I think we've seen for now,
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:37.960]   it was bad for our civic culture.
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:39.480]   It was bad for our mental health.
[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:41.580]   It was bad for our ability to do anything else.
[00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:42.860]   I don't like that moment
[00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:44.920]   where we all had to use three platforms.
[00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:47.200]   Too much control, too much power,
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:49.560]   too much negative externalities.
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:50.840]   So this is good.
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:55.640]   Beginning of the end for that era of monopolies.
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:58.760]   So we shall see.
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:02.420]   You know what they said in this article, Jesse,
[00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:04.460]   I thought it was a good analogy.
[00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:06.440]   They said, "Facebook," TikTok was saying,
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:09.140]   "Facebook will never succeed at being TikTok
[00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:12.220]   because you can't shift core competencies."
[00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:13.620]   And the analogy they gave
[00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:16.020]   is when Google tried to compete with Facebook.
[00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:17.340]   So remember Google Plus?
[00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:19.260]   - Vaguely now that you say that.
[00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:22.380]   - Yeah, they put, Google spent millions and millions.
[00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:25.060]   This was during Facebook's rise.
[00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:25.900]   Like, we want to do that.
[00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:26.740]   They spent all this money
[00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:27.940]   and they had a huge advantage too.
[00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:29.020]   Google had a huge advantage.
[00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:31.660]   If we can just make Google Plus native
[00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:34.460]   to all of these Google apps that everyone's already using,
[00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:38.060]   Gmail, the calendars, and they did, and it still failed.
[00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:39.060]   And the reason why it failed
[00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:42.100]   is because Facebook had been built from the ground up
[00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:43.380]   to be a social graph company.
[00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:44.460]   They just did it really well.
[00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:46.500]   Google had not, and they could never get over there.
[00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:47.380]   And so in this article,
[00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:48.820]   the TikTok executive is saying,
[00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:49.660]   "Good luck.
[00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:51.820]   You're gonna be the Google Plus of these short videos.
[00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:52.780]   We know how to do it.
[00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:54.400]   Our whole company's built around it.
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:55.940]   You don't, it'll never be as good.
[00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:57.240]   You're not gonna peel people off."
[00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:59.460]   But I like the fact that they're going to
[00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:01.660]   batter up their ship against the shore here
[00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:04.120]   trying to do it because, man,
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:08.640]   we need to get past this moment of two platforms.
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:11.460]   - Did you listen to Zuckerberg's interviews
[00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:14.240]   with your buddy Lex and Tim?
[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:15.080]   - Yes.
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:16.780]   I listened to the Lex one.
[00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:18.060]   - He's on with Tim too.
[00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:18.900]   - Yeah.
[00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:19.980]   I think whichever one came out first,
[00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:20.980]   I listened to the Lex one.
[00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:21.820]   - Lex came out first.
[00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:23.260]   - It's the problem with doing a tour like this
[00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:24.140]   for someone like that.
[00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:25.580]   And then I was thinking,
[00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:28.000]   I don't know if I need to listen to...
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:28.840]   - It's like a book tour.
[00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:30.040]   - Yeah, I don't need to listen to him again
[00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:30.880]   on another show,
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:32.480]   though I'm sure Tim's interview was good as well.
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:33.320]   Yeah.
[00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:35.900]   Yeah, it was interesting.
[00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:37.920]   - He'll want to be on your show soon.
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:40.180]   - See, I'm not of this school of thought,
[00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:41.320]   this like Zuckerberg.
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:43.280]   I think I'm with Lex on this.
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:46.800]   Zuckerberg is not the devil, you know?
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:49.080]   And I don't like the narrative.
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:53.800]   So I've been a big opponent of some of these services.
[00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:58.240]   It's not because I think they're nefarious, right?
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.420]   I don't think Zuckerberg is the devil.
[00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:01.960]   I think it's too simplistic
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:04.460]   when we have to try to contrive these plot lines
[00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:06.940]   of like they're purposefully ignoring all this harm
[00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:09.660]   they're doing because they're so evil or this or that.
[00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:10.580]   I don't think that's the case.
[00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:13.700]   I just think social media universalism,
[00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:14.740]   which I can't blame them.
[00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:15.820]   I mean, hey, if everyone's using this,
[00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:16.980]   we want to grow as big as possible.
[00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:18.260]   I just think it was bad for our culture,
[00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:19.460]   this moment of universalism
[00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:23.020]   where everyone felt like they had to use the platforms.
[00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:25.100]   I think that is a problem.
[00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:26.820]   I think if you have a platform everyone is using,
[00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:28.540]   there's nothing you can do that's going to prevent that
[00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:30.940]   from probably having lots of negative externalities.
[00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:32.280]   I don't think a lot of those are planned.
[00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:34.980]   I mean, I think Facebook, they try to solve these problems.
[00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:36.140]   They spend a lot of money on it.
[00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:38.020]   Like, we'll do anything you say we should do.
[00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:39.800]   It's a losing battle
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:44.140]   because if you have 600 million daily active users
[00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:46.060]   from all sorts of walks of life all over the world,
[00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:47.460]   it's like an impossible challenge
[00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:49.260]   to make that into some sort of interesting.
[00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:52.220]   The only solution in that is segmentation.
[00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:54.100]   No problem having small groups of people
[00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:55.760]   figuring out how they want to interact,
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:57.220]   what their standards are, what their norms.
[00:21:57.220 --> 00:21:59.060]   That works out fine.
[00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:03.140]   600 million people, it's not natural.
[00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:03.960]   Yeah.
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:06.420]   - Do you think he wants to work for the rest of his life?
[00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:07.260]   - I don't know.
[00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:09.780]   I mean, don't bet against him long-term.
[00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:12.900]   All I say is he's one of the only CEOs
[00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:16.380]   from that boom, that second internet boom period
[00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:17.460]   who's still CEO.
[00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:19.380]   But he's young.
[00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:20.220]   - Yeah.
[00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:22.540]   - You gotta be a bit of a killer.
[00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:23.380]   - Yeah.
[00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:24.220]   - Right?
[00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:26.020]   To be running that company at 22,
[00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:27.460]   how do you survive that?
[00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:29.900]   With the investor pressure to stay in charge?
[00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:33.040]   I mean, he's gotta be a ruthless guy.
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:37.100]   That is a hard Game of Thrones-style challenge.
[00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:39.700]   The Google guys didn't last.
[00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:41.780]   The Instagram guys didn't last.
[00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:43.980]   The Twitter founders didn't last.
[00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:45.380]   Dorsey was out of there.
[00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:48.740]   It's very difficult to run a company,
[00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:50.580]   start a company in your young 20s,
[00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:52.980]   have it become a $500 billion company
[00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:54.360]   and still be the CEO.
[00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:55.700]   That means you're cracking skulls
[00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:57.100]   and stabbing people in the ribs
[00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:59.420]   as they're in the back room of the castle throne room.
[00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:01.780]   That's not just you're a nice guy working hard.
[00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:02.780]   I think you have a business,
[00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:04.220]   there's some sort of business instinct there.
[00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:05.460]   That's very difficult to do.
[00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:06.900]   Steve Jobs got kicked out.
[00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:07.740]   No one makes it.
[00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:09.860]   Gates is the only other person I can think of.
[00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:11.580]   Bill Gates is the only person I can think,
[00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:13.900]   well, maybe Larry Ellison.
[00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:16.260]   There's other examples, but Gates is who comes to mind.
[00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:18.660]   Gates started Microsoft as a kid.
[00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:21.940]   And almost identical situation to Zuckerberg.
[00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:25.100]   Dropping out of Harvard after his sophomore year,
[00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:27.340]   it's exactly the same as Zuckerberg.
[00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:30.300]   And he held onto that company
[00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:33.060]   until he was ready to leave 30 years later.
[00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:35.620]   So Gates and Zuckerberg, Zuckerberg is Gatesian.
[00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:36.460]   - Amazon.
[00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:40.060]   - Yeah, Bezos was older when he, you know.
[00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:42.820]   He was youngish, but he was at D.E. Shaw
[00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:44.900]   sort of analyzing the industry
[00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:47.620]   and was trying to figure out
[00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:50.860]   how do we make a play for e-commerce and the internet?
[00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:52.580]   And he had no connection to books other than he just,
[00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:55.100]   so D.E. Shaw is this kind of weird, cool,
[00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:56.780]   quantitative investment fund.
[00:23:56.780 --> 00:24:00.420]   They give people free reign
[00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:01.660]   and they hire only the smartest people.
[00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:03.500]   But he was like very systematically,
[00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:06.700]   how do we make e-commerce a thing?
[00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:07.900]   And he worked all the numbers.
[00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:09.580]   It was like books.
[00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:10.980]   Books, the way it works,
[00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:12.940]   and the warehouses and the shipping,
[00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:14.300]   like we can make books work.
[00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:17.100]   But you're right, Bezos was another example
[00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:19.940]   of he held on.
[00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:21.460]   - It kind of goes along with Mark
[00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:22.420]   and him working all the time.
[00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:23.940]   It's kind of like what you were talking about
[00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:25.820]   when you answered that question in an earlier episode
[00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:30.500]   about just people always wanting to work
[00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:32.700]   and be doing stuff.
[00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:33.700]   It's kind of like that.
[00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:35.820]   - Yeah, yeah, they're driven guys.
[00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:37.820]   I mean, Zuckerberg does all these challenges.
[00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:38.660]   - Yeah.
[00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:40.420]   - You know, the personal challenges,
[00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:42.740]   like I'm going to learn a language
[00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:44.260]   or master this skill
[00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:48.020]   or only not eat meat for a year.
[00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:49.380]   It's like on top of his work,
[00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:50.700]   he's constantly giving himself
[00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:51.940]   other types of personal challenges.
[00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:54.180]   I mean, that's rare.
[00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:56.500]   Again, to stay in charge of a company like that,
[00:24:56.500 --> 00:25:00.460]   to have the extra energy to do what you do.
[00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:04.780]   Though I don't think Facebook is long for this world,
[00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:06.220]   but what can you do?
[00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:10.620]   I mean, they rode that moment as well as you could.
[00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:16.020]   And they did not successfully evolve beyond that.
[00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:17.460]   I think Google was better at that.
[00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:18.460]   Amazon was better at that.
[00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:19.940]   They evolved very aggressively.
[00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:22.820]   I think Facebook kind of doubled down
[00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:26.660]   on just being a social media platform monopoly.
[00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:28.060]   And we want to do that well.
[00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:31.500]   I don't know how long that'll last.
[00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:32.540]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:33.980]   All right.
[00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:36.580]   Well, speaking of good companies,
[00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:37.780]   let me tell you about a couple of sponsors
[00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:40.620]   before we get into the meat of our questions.
[00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:44.260]   First sponsor is a longtime friend of the show, Blinkist.
[00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:49.940]   So as I like to say, ideas are power.
[00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:55.660]   Ideas are the major currency in our current world.
[00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:57.740]   And the best source of ideas is books.
[00:25:57.740 --> 00:25:59.620]   Where else can you get an encapsulation
[00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:01.140]   of someone spending years and years
[00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:02.980]   thinking about something really hard
[00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:04.860]   and capturing as carefully as possible
[00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:05.820]   all of their thoughts on this
[00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:07.420]   that you can then consume in a week?
[00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:10.700]   Books are the best place to get the best, most nuanced ideas.
[00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:13.060]   The problem is books take a while to read.
[00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:15.300]   How do you figure out which books to read?
[00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:17.420]   You use Blinkist.
[00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:22.140]   Blinkist has 15-minute summaries,
[00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:24.620]   which you can either read or listen to,
[00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:27.420]   of over 5,000 nonfiction titles
[00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:29.780]   spreading over 27 categories,
[00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:33.740]   including recent best sellers.
[00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:36.700]   This allows you to very quickly take a book
[00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:39.180]   you're interested in, get the main ideas,
[00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:40.820]   and either say, "That's all I need to know.
[00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:41.980]   I know how to talk about this,"
[00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:43.660]   or, "This sounds fascinating. Let me buy it."
[00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:45.020]   It is your filtering mechanism
[00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:46.820]   for figuring out which books to buy.
[00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:49.820]   It is a technique for quickly mastering
[00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:52.260]   a broad category of ideas.
[00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:54.260]   If you are serious about the idea game,
[00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:57.380]   Blinkist is a tool that you need to have,
[00:26:57.380 --> 00:26:59.500]   whether you're trying to break down a book
[00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:01.140]   like "The Blockchain Revolution"
[00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:03.900]   or figuring out what Yuval Harari's "Homo Deus"
[00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:05.820]   is really about, Blinkist.
[00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:08.020]   Let's get into it. Let's figure it out.
[00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:09.940]   Figure out what we need to do next.
[00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:11.660]   So right now, Blinkist has a special offer
[00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:13.220]   just for our audience.
[00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:15.660]   Go to blinkist.com/deep

[00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:20.300]   and get 25% off a Blinkist premium membership.
[00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:25.300]   That's Blinkist, spelled B-L-I-N-K-I-S-T,
[00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:27.780]   blinkist.com/deep to get 25% off
[00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:30.540]   and a seven-day free trial,
[00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:33.100]   blinkist.com/deep.
[00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:36.260]   Let me tell you about another sponsor.
[00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:38.260]   Jesse, this was a company that I did not know
[00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:39.740]   this technology existed.
[00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:41.460]   This is one of these situations
[00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:45.220]   where you imagine you wish this technology existed,
[00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:46.260]   you assume it doesn't,
[00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:48.900]   and then you find out that a company has done it.
[00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:50.380]   And that is exactly what happened
[00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:53.540]   when I first encountered 8sleep.
[00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:58.440]   So you know, good sleep is the ultimate game changer,
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:01.820]   but one of the issues that people have with sleep
[00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:04.060]   is temperature.
[00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:06.460]   More than 30% of Americans circle with sleep
[00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:09.340]   and temperature is one of the main reasons for this.
[00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:12.140]   I, for example, sleep hot.
[00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:14.040]   I need things cool to sleep.
[00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:16.580]   I have a hard time sleeping when it is hot.
[00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:17.840]   Ever since I was a kid,
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:22.840]   I would have a fan just blasting straight on me.
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:26.140]   So sleep temperature is important to me.
[00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:27.980]   That is why I was excited
[00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:30.380]   when I got the box arrived at my house
[00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:34.220]   with my own 8sleep pod cover.
[00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:36.120]   It's the most advanced solution on the market
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:37.540]   for thermoregulation.
[00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:39.160]   It pairs dynamic cooling and heating
[00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:40.320]   with biometric tracking.
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:41.940]   You can add the cover to any mattress
[00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:45.140]   and start sleeping as cool as 55 degrees,
[00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:48.200]   or if you are a weird masochist,
[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:51.660]   as hot as 110 degrees Fahrenheit.
[00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:54.320]   You can do each side of the bed differently.
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:55.740]   So you put this cover on,
[00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:58.140]   then you have this mechanism next to your bed,
[00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:00.060]   and there's these tubing that goes to the bed
[00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:02.260]   and it makes the temperature go up and down.
[00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:03.980]   Really cool technology.
[00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:06.960]   I'd never slept on a cooled mattress before,
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:08.180]   and I loved it.
[00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:09.620]   I'm not the only one.
[00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:11.540]   Clinical data shows that 8sleep users
[00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:15.180]   experience up to 19% increase in recovery,
[00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:18.260]   a 32% improvement in sleep quality,
[00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:21.660]   and a 34% more deep sleep.
[00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:24.660]   Jesse, we need some sort of 8sleep technology
[00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:26.420]   for the podcast studio.
[00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:27.500]   Like a cooled podcast.
[00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:28.660]   You know I run hot.
[00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:31.740]   Jesse thinks that I keep this place like an icebox.
[00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:32.580]   - They all do.
[00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:35.300]   Like all the studios keep it cold for when people talk.
[00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:37.020]   I always have to wear long sleeves.
[00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:40.740]   - I was doing a podcast once with a sports announcer,
[00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:44.660]   I guess would be the right word.
[00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:47.440]   And I was telling her about like, yeah, I overheat.
[00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:49.840]   And she's like, you know what they do for college football?
[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:51.340]   Because you know, a lot of these college football games,
[00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:53.500]   they broadcast outside.
[00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:57.200]   And the games, if you're in Ohio in September,
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:59.660]   it can be, you know, really hot.
[00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:00.940]   She said some of these guys,
[00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:02.620]   because they have to wear the suits to look nice on camera,
[00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:03.460]   but it's hot outside.
[00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:04.280]   It's like, how do you do that?
[00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:06.140]   Because I overheat, I can imagine it being this real issue.
[00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:09.260]   She said they have these air conditioner vents
[00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:10.920]   that blast up their suit.
[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:14.980]   And that's what allows them when it's, you know, 96 degrees
[00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:17.900]   and they're, you know, trying to cover the Gators game
[00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:19.740]   down in Miami or something like that.
[00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:23.300]   They have air conditioners like coming out up their suits
[00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:25.820]   so they can be doing the outside broadcast.
[00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:27.540]   So all I'm saying is-
[00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:29.980]   - You need an eight sleeve for the HQ.
[00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:32.380]   - I could just like wrap one around my shoulder.
[00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:33.700]   That'd be great.
[00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:34.940]   Not to go on a divergence here,
[00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:37.820]   but I like collecting other stories of people who overheat
[00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:39.080]   so I don't feel alone.
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:41.180]   I heard Rob Lowe talking about this.
[00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:46.180]   As he got more clout in his career,
[00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:48.460]   he's learned a lot of times you're filming shows,
[00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:50.700]   they're filming them outdoors in LA in the Valley
[00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:52.780]   and it's super hot and like you're dressed for winter
[00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:56.980]   because they're doing, you know, La Brea as stand in
[00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:59.980]   for some Christmas time in Vermont or something like that.
[00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:03.040]   He now demands, and I appreciate this,
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:06.320]   it's basically an air conditioned phone booth
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:07.680]   that's right there.
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:10.480]   So in between takes, he goes and stands,
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:13.660]   he can stand in like an air conditioned box
[00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:15.500]   and just come out to do his take
[00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:18.020]   so that he's not overheating
[00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:20.580]   just standing out there in the sun all day.
[00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:21.580]   I love that.
[00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:23.620]   I want one of those for my classroom at Georgetown.
[00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:25.420]   Some of the rooms don't have good air conditioning
[00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:27.940]   and when like September, man, it's brutal in there.
[00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:29.220]   I want an air conditioned booth.
[00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:31.420]   I can just go and stand in and just sort of shine through
[00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:34.740]   onto my slides with a laser pointer.
[00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:35.580]   - Blanket right in there too.
[00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:37.020]   - The Eight Sleep Blanket,
[00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:39.460]   which what I'm trying to say here,
[00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:41.220]   let me bring this all together.
[00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:43.940]   Go to eightsleep.com/deep
[00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:46.660]   to redeem exclusive 4th of July savings
[00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:49.500]   and start sleeping cool this summer.
[00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:51.780]   Eight Sleep currently ships within the US,
[00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:52.900]   Canada and the UK,
[00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:55.220]   as well as select countries in the EU and Australia.
[00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:57.520]   That's eightsleep.com/deep.
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:00.460]   If you are like me or Rob Lowe
[00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:04.520]   or the announcers for college football,
[00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:07.340]   you need something to help you thermoregulate,
[00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:09.420]   Eight Sleep was made for us.
[00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:13.620]   All right, Jess, let's do some questions.
[00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:16.580]   We're kind of a long one here.
[00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:18.080]   This one comes from Steve.
[00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:21.860]   Steve says, "In the 90s,
[00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:26.140]   I had a plan to get my PhD in exercise physiology
[00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:27.460]   to teach and dive deep
[00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:29.840]   into human performance testing research.
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:32.940]   Unfortunately, I allowed my significant other at the time
[00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:34.780]   to convince me otherwise,
[00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:37.680]   which led me down a path of ever changing careers,
[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:39.140]   always taking different jobs
[00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:42.080]   to maintain some sort of financial security.
[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:44.180]   At the age of 53,
[00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:47.100]   and after listening to most of your Deep Questions episodes,
[00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:50.480]   I now have the confidence and motivation to go back to school
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:52.380]   to achieve my previously stated goals.
[00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:54.680]   However, after doing the math,
[00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:59.080]   I would be 60 by the time I graduate with a PhD,
[00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:01.580]   which would leave me maybe 10 to 15 years
[00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:03.400]   to work before retiring.
[00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:06.360]   One alternative is to start
[00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:09.880]   a small human performance testing lab as a side gig,
[00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:11.900]   slowly building up a strong client base
[00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:14.340]   while maintaining my day job as an office manager
[00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:18.920]   for a major Southern California university."
[00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:21.220]   All right, so that's the question.
[00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:25.420]   At the age of 53, do you go get your PhD
[00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:27.820]   because you have this idea
[00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:32.820]   for some sort of performance testing lab vision
[00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:34.340]   that you could run?
[00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:38.320]   Well, Steve, regardless of your age,
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:41.820]   my graduate school advice applies here.
[00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:43.380]   My graduate school advice says,
[00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:46.180]   "Never start a graduate program
[00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:47.740]   unless you have clear evidence
[00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:49.520]   that the specific degree you're gonna get
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:51.340]   at the specific school that you're gonna get it
[00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:54.540]   is needed to unlock a specific step in your career
[00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:57.240]   that is appealing to you."
[00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:58.680]   That you've gotten to a point where you say,
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:00.840]   "I see this thing I wanna do.
[00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:02.540]   This is why I wanna do that.
[00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:04.080]   But if I can get this degree here,
[00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:05.780]   I can do it, otherwise I can't."
[00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:09.520]   I am not a big believer in get the degree
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:11.780]   to see what options it opens up.
[00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:13.040]   Now, you have a bit of an idea
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:14.240]   about what you wanna do with this PhD,
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:16.520]   but I think it is too vague to qualify.
[00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:18.780]   I mean, just based off of your question wording,
[00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:19.720]   so I'm extrapolating here,
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:21.420]   but just based off your question wording,
[00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:24.080]   you have this idea that there's some startup
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:26.180]   with a human performance testing lab
[00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:27.820]   that could be interesting.
[00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:28.920]   That is super vague.
[00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:31.220]   I would not spend six or seven years getting a PhD
[00:34:31.220 --> 00:34:32.820]   with the idea that like maybe that will help me
[00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:34.580]   do this thing that's kind of vague.
[00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:39.280]   I think your side hustle exploration approach
[00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:41.620]   is probably the right one here.
[00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:45.040]   So keeping your good job,
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:48.620]   starting to explore what would this mean?
[00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:52.540]   What you even mean by human performance testing lab?
[00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:53.880]   What are the real opportunities here?
[00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:54.980]   What are the real demands here?
[00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:56.480]   And there's two things you'd wanna capture
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:58.540]   from this experimentation on your side.
[00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:01.920]   One, using money as a neutral indicator of value.
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.280]   Can you actually get clients?
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:05.180]   Can you actually get people to give you money
[00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:06.520]   for something along these lines?
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:08.220]   That's a great indicator about whether or not
[00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:10.120]   the idea has value or not.
[00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:11.780]   Everyone will tell you your idea is good,
[00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:14.920]   but they will only give you money if it actually is.
[00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:17.780]   Two, it allows you to actually explore the contours
[00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:19.620]   of this new territory.
[00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:21.080]   That what exactly do you mean
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:22.420]   by human performance testing lab?
[00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:23.980]   You probably aren't quite sure.
[00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:26.680]   What is the market opportunity here?
[00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:27.580]   Is it consulting?
[00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:28.420]   Is it content?
[00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:29.440]   Is it working with other companies?
[00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:30.720]   You need to figure that all out
[00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:32.580]   before you go get a degree for seven years.
[00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:34.780]   I want you to be at the point where you say,
[00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:38.020]   we're rocking and rolling and I'm being held back,
[00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:40.180]   just being held back by not having this degree.
[00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:41.440]   I could just see if I had it.
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:42.440]   I could do this.
[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:43.920]   I'm so close, but I can't do this
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:45.240]   because I don't know how to do this.
[00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:46.520]   I want you to be at that point
[00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:51.080]   before you pull the trigger on any sort of higher education.
[00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:53.740]   So start exploring, Steve,
[00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:57.080]   and don't get that PhD until you have to have it.
[00:35:57.080 --> 00:35:58.320]   - What would be, outside of your own,
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:01.180]   what would be a good example of that,
[00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:05.580]   getting a PhD, like clearly elevating your career?
[00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:06.420]   - I mean, it's a good question
[00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:07.580]   'cause PhDs are very specific.
[00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:11.240]   So obviously, academic, you wanna be a professor.
[00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:12.640]   Then you're gonna need a PhD.
[00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:14.080]   We have a question about this coming up.
[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:16.320]   And so if you're gonna be a professor,
[00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:17.320]   you do need a PhD,
[00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:18.880]   but that's where the second part of this is,
[00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:21.320]   this degree from this program is what I need
[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:22.940]   becomes important.
[00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:25.340]   'Cause if you say, I would love to be an MIT professor,
[00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:26.580]   so I'm just gonna go get a PhD.
[00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:27.420]   It's like, well, wait a second,
[00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:29.920]   you better be getting a PhD from a top two program
[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:32.820]   or it's not gonna be the right thing.
[00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:37.120]   I have this issue also with a lot of military
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:40.520]   and recent vets that I talked to who are using their GI bill.
[00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:43.200]   And I think there's a lot of predatory online degrees
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:45.160]   where they come in like, hey, get your online MBA
[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:47.760]   and we'll suck out your GI bill benefits for it.
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:50.500]   And it's convenient and you kind of do it on the side.
[00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:52.460]   And it turns out that the employers down the road say,
[00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:54.520]   I don't know what this online MBA is.
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:56.460]   And you just wasted your money.
[00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:58.920]   So the specific degree matters.
[00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:02.920]   There's other fields that have specific PhD requirements.
[00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:07.920]   So in biomed, biomed research, working for a drug company,
[00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:12.120]   you wanna be on, I have a colleague whose wife
[00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:17.120]   works on respiratory virus vaccines at Moderna.
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:22.960]   So we always tell him, your job for the rest of our culture
[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:25.860]   is to make sure your wife is completely unburdened
[00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:27.720]   because we need her working on that.
[00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:29.600]   You can help the culture.
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:30.760]   But if you want a job like that,
[00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:34.660]   that it's not an academic job, but you need a PhD for that,
[00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:36.860]   be very careful about PhDs
[00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:38.800]   is sort of the way I think about it.
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:40.760]   Like in computer science, this used to,
[00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:44.460]   I mean, this has shifted, but the traditional thinking
[00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:46.640]   in computer science, for example,
[00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:50.100]   is if you're just looking at going to industry
[00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:53.960]   and making salary, getting a master's degree,
[00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:55.500]   especially if you do a five-year program
[00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:57.560]   where you just, you start your master's classes
[00:37:57.560 --> 00:37:59.900]   as an undergrad and just add an extra year.
[00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:01.540]   So you do five years and you get an undergrad
[00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:03.140]   and a master's degree.
[00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:06.040]   From a pure economic perspective, it's probably worth it
[00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:08.700]   because with the master's degree,
[00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:11.240]   your starting salary is up here,
[00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:13.500]   with the undergrad, it's down here.
[00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:16.540]   And in the time it takes you to get that master's degree,
[00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:17.660]   you couldn't catch up.
[00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:19.300]   So you do start out ahead.
[00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:21.960]   The math often, or at least it didn't back in my day,
[00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:24.300]   work out for getting a PhD and going to industry.
[00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:27.540]   So if you spend five years to get a PhD
[00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:29.800]   and then you go to work at Google,
[00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:30.640]   you're gonna get paid more.
[00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:32.260]   Your starting salary will be more
[00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:34.660]   than someone coming in with a master's degree.
[00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:36.560]   But it took you five more years.
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:38.160]   And in those five more years,
[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:39.800]   the person who started with the master's degree
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:42.960]   has been promoted enough that they're making a lot more
[00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:44.100]   than you are coming in.
[00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:46.460]   So you actually have to account for the time
[00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:47.300]   it takes to get the degree.
[00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:49.160]   So that was always the conventional wisdom.
[00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:50.540]   There is one exception right now
[00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:52.540]   that's AI and machine learning.
[00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:57.540]   If you are able to get a PhD from a real star in the field
[00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:03.440]   in a relevant artificial intelligence topic
[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:04.840]   where you are doing,
[00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:09.360]   moving the avant-garde of the field forward type research,
[00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:13.600]   like I'm moving forward what's possible with deep learning.
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:15.860]   I'm working with Greg Hinton in Toronto
[00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:17.700]   and we're sort of innovating the field.
[00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:20.800]   Those, some of those PhD students are getting close to
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:24.460]   or exceeding seven figure salary offers.
[00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:26.240]   So in some fields like AI,
[00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:30.520]   where actually being able to produce original research
[00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:32.540]   is gonna be a huge competitive advantage,
[00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:34.320]   then a PhD might be different.
[00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:35.840]   But if you're gonna go into a development job
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:36.840]   or an executive job,
[00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:38.580]   then in computer science,
[00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:40.280]   it's not really worth getting a PhD.
[00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:41.980]   So just be wary about it.
[00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:43.080]   Just go in with your eyes open.
[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:46.040]   You have to just, you need evidence.
[00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:47.840]   This is the type of thing I wanna do.
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:50.220]   I know for a fact it requires a PhD to do it.
[00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:52.540]   I know for a fact the quality and competitiveness
[00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:53.620]   of the program I'm gonna go to
[00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:55.740]   will satisfy what's necessary there.
[00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:57.480]   You just want clarity.
[00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:01.680]   Never use graduate degrees as a delaying function,
[00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:05.680]   as a generic option opening function.
[00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:07.140]   No, no, it should be very specific.
[00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:09.240]   It should be solving a very specific goal.
[00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:13.580]   All right, I got another question here.
[00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:15.080]   This one comes from Chad.
[00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:18.440]   We've talked about this one a lot, so I can go fast here.
[00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:19.980]   Chad says, "Do you have two shutdowns
[00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:22.120]   "if you split your day job and your side hustle
[00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:24.140]   "with family time in the middle?"
[00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:29.140]   No, you have a real shutdown after the first block of work.
[00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:30.840]   You close all the open loops
[00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:32.680]   and you set up the work you're gonna do
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:33.720]   during your second shift,
[00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:36.200]   your side hustle work you're gonna do in the evening.
[00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:37.520]   You get that all ready.
[00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:38.720]   And then you do a full shutdown,
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:39.840]   schedule shutdown complete,
[00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:41.800]   do the checkbox and then time block planner.
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:44.140]   Then when you get to your second shift,
[00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:45.120]   you know what you're doing,
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:47.960]   you turn on, you do it, you finish, you turn off.
[00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:49.400]   The only nuance I wanna add to this, Chad,
[00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:50.960]   the reason why I'm coming back to this question
[00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:53.560]   is I was talking about this issue.
[00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:56.160]   I was on someone else's podcast yesterday.
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:58.000]   I recorded an interview and we were talking about this.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.600]   And there's a wrinkle that came up that I wanna add here,
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:04.360]   which is if you're doing this two shift style work,
[00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:10.320]   if you create new open loops in the second shift,
[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:12.680]   it's a problem and you're gonna need another full shutdown.
[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:14.940]   So for example, if you're working on your side hustle
[00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:17.360]   in the evening and you're doing emails
[00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:20.460]   and looking at an inbox and making plans,
[00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:22.680]   you could create a lot more open loops
[00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:24.600]   that are gonna require a new shutdown.
[00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:26.800]   So what I recommend for people
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:29.160]   who are mainly working on their day job during the day
[00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:31.880]   and doing work on a side hustle in the evening,
[00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:35.000]   so like the Steve's performance testing lab,
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.980]   or you're writing a novel or something like that,
[00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:40.600]   is any open loop generating activities.
[00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:44.000]   So email, scheduling, et cetera.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.200]   Do that during the daytime.
[00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:48.840]   Purify what you do during the evening second shift
[00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:53.800]   just to be the pure putting the mental metal
[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:54.740]   to the grindstone.
[00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:59.000]   I'm writing, I'm coding, I'm producing.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.480]   Make that more focused.
[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:02.800]   So any type of open loop generating interaction
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:04.560]   do during your day job,
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:07.080]   so that when you do your shutdown at the end of the day,
[00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:11.880]   it also is closing down your second side hustle job.
[00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:13.600]   You're looking at your plan for the rest of the week.
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:14.520]   What am I doing tonight?
[00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:15.760]   That's okay.
[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:17.220]   Do I have any emails I need to answer?
[00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:18.440]   So that when you do evening work,
[00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:20.800]   if you can keep the evening work just pure work
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:22.040]   without the interaction open loops,
[00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:22.880]   it's going to be a lot better.
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:24.000]   So you only need one shutdown,
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.760]   but that's the caveat I'll give you, Chad.
[00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:29.160]   Don't create new open loops in the second shift.
[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:31.800]   - And for new listeners,
[00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:34.480]   you don't do shutdowns on the weekends, right?
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:37.400]   - No, no, you shut down hard at the end of the week.
[00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:39.560]   Here's where I'm gonna pick up again on Monday,
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:42.320]   and you don't have to worry about that type of thing
[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:43.320]   during the weekend.
[00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:44.380]   And if you do weekend work,
[00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:47.720]   like I often write on Sunday mornings, it's purified.
[00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:48.920]   I'm not looking at email.
[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:49.840]   I'm not on my calendar.
[00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:51.040]   I'm not generating new open loops.
[00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:54.160]   It's, you know, I'm at Bevco.
[00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:55.720]   Here's my calendar.
[00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:56.560]   I know my calendar.
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:57.400]   Here's my Scrivener.
[00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:58.220]   Here's my writing.
[00:42:58.220 --> 00:42:59.160]   And you just purify it.
[00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:02.080]   Speaking of Bevco, by the way,
[00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:03.560]   the coffee shop down the road,
[00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:07.640]   because we have a workman in our house this whole week
[00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:09.560]   because they're working on the study,
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:11.400]   which is looking awesome, by the way.
[00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:14.040]   I'm at Bevco every day.
[00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:15.160]   It's too much.
[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:16.480]   I think they're worried about me.
[00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:20.120]   I'm eating breakfast and writing at Bevco
[00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:21.820]   every single day this week so far.
[00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:23.760]   I don't know. - That's good.
[00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:24.580]   - I guess it's good.
[00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:25.420]   I worry I'm there too much.
[00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:26.760]   - There's a lot of different places to sit in there.
[00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:28.080]   You probably sit inside, outside.
[00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:29.400]   - I sit inside.
[00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:30.240]   - All the time?
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:32.960]   - Yeah, I sit in, because the inside's not as,
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:34.740]   I mean, it gets kind of crowded.
[00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:36.400]   I don't know, people are pretty COVID-y around here.
[00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:39.480]   So like the outside's all crammed, you know,
[00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:41.580]   so it's a little bit quieter in the inside.
[00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:44.200]   But every day, it feels like a lot.
[00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:46.440]   But you know, it's just, our house is full of people.
[00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:49.200]   We have three unrelated teams that we just,
[00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:50.720]   it's just so many people in our house.
[00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:52.320]   - Some of these coffee shops
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:54.880]   have monthly memberships you can buy.
[00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:56.360]   - Yeah.
[00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:59.040]   - If Bevco had one of those, you could get in on that.
[00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:01.640]   - I would say, and I would conservatively estimate
[00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:04.920]   my monthly spending at Bevco, and this is just ballpark,
[00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:06.880]   is $17,000 a month.
[00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:12.420]   Just conservatively, if I had to guess.
[00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:16.160]   I think in the business plan, there's like a pie chart
[00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:18.080]   and like 2/3 of the pie chart
[00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:20.280]   is just labeled with a picture of me.
[00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:23.800]   Like it's at the core, at the core of their business plan.
[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:25.720]   But I need a place to go, and it's nearby,
[00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:27.280]   and I know everyone there.
[00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:29.040]   - Yeah, it's fun. - You can refill your coffee
[00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:30.040]   and it's good.
[00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:32.040]   All right, let's do a call.
[00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:34.240]   I think we have a good call here.
[00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:35.060]   - All right, sounds good.
[00:44:35.060 --> 00:44:37.920]   This is about the good life versus the deep life.
[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:39.720]   - Could you elaborate more on the differences
[00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:42.400]   between the good life versus the deep life?
[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:44.320]   In episode 200, you touched on it,
[00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:46.000]   saying that the good life is virtuous,
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.880]   ethical, and meaningful,
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:51.000]   while the deep life is notable and remarkable.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.800]   I'm particularly interested in the notion
[00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:55.240]   that the latter is a subset of the former.
[00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:56.080]   Thanks so much.
[00:44:56.080 --> 00:44:59.120]   - Oh yeah, it's a good question.
[00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:03.080]   The distinction is not absolute.
[00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:05.600]   So I often get letters about this.
[00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:10.600]   But the last thing you said is a useful way, I think,
[00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:13.360]   of comparing and contrasting the good life
[00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:14.840]   versus the deep life is this idea
[00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:18.400]   that the deep life is a subset
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:22.680]   of the possibilities for a good life.
[00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:26.520]   And so just to take another swing
[00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:28.000]   at defining these distinctions,
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.480]   when I'm thinking about the good life,
[00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:33.800]   I'm thinking Aristotle, I'm thinking eudaimonia,
[00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:36.600]   I'm thinking the attempts in antiquity
[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:41.040]   to try to understand human flourishing.
[00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:43.040]   And usually these concepts had something to do,
[00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:48.040]   obviously virtue was a big part of it, living life virtuously.
[00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:50.920]   Aristotle cared a lot about,
[00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:53.120]   I guess you could call it temperance or moderation.
[00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:54.480]   So in the Nicomachean Ethics,
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:57.640]   he often talks about on many of these character traits,
[00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:01.600]   there's extremes and where you wanna be is in the middle.
[00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:06.120]   So you don't wanna be incredibly stingy,
[00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:11.120]   but you also don't wanna be debt piling, spending freely.
[00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:12.640]   You wanna be somewhere in the middle.
[00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:14.720]   So there's some notion of temperance or moderation
[00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:16.280]   that came up in these notions.
[00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:19.080]   And then some notion of flourishing, eudaimonic flourishing,
[00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:23.120]   which is taking the talents or abilities you have
[00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:27.240]   and pushing them to actually see them,
[00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:30.400]   their potential expressed in the world.
[00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:33.280]   You're athletic, you wanna harness that skill
[00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:37.800]   and push your athletic abilities to a limit.
[00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:39.680]   You have a sharp mind,
[00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:41.080]   you wanna actually take in ideas
[00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:43.360]   and produce things of value.
[00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:44.720]   So those are the elements of the good life
[00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:49.440]   in the sort of the ancient Greek definition of it.
[00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:52.400]   The deep life is a good life,
[00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:54.160]   but it has other components to it.
[00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:55.000]   So there's good lives
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:56.080]   that don't have these components to it.
[00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:58.640]   So it's a good life where you also have
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:00.920]   this other component of remarkability.
[00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:03.760]   So like we can think about the deep life
[00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:06.600]   where we wanna use this framework as a good life
[00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:11.600]   that is augmented with some notion of remarkability.
[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:14.200]   It's notable, people look at it and say,
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:16.120]   "That's really interesting."
[00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:18.400]   That is not someone who is gonna go to their deathbed
[00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:20.920]   and say, "Man, I wasted this time."
[00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:23.480]   It is a remarkable life in the literal sense
[00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:25.760]   of that people remark like, "That's very interesting."
[00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:28.120]   And the core of doing that,
[00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:31.120]   at least provisionally I argue that the core of doing that
[00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:33.920]   is radical shifts to align to your value.
[00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:35.160]   So a deep life is a good life
[00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:37.440]   where you also make some sort of radical shift
[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:39.960]   to the way your life actually unfolds,
[00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:43.280]   where you live, what type of work you do,
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:45.280]   your commitment to community,
[00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:47.040]   your commitment to theology or philosophy.
[00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:48.800]   There's some aspects of your life
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:51.200]   that you have pushed radically
[00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:54.960]   towards fulfilling something that you really value.
[00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:56.640]   There's something in that radicality
[00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:58.440]   in pursuit of your values that makes a good life,
[00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:01.400]   not just good, but also deep.
[00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:04.960]   That's why we're attracted to not just presence,
[00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:06.840]   but the monks.
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:09.040]   And we read the seven-story mountain
[00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:11.600]   and going to the monastery.
[00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:14.320]   It's radical alignment in pursuit of this thing
[00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:15.280]   that really matters.
[00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:17.960]   It's why we get attracted to the person
[00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:22.560]   who leaves the stressful soul-deadening job
[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:27.320]   and they have the craftsman workshop that they're in.
[00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:30.200]   It's a radical move to align their values.
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:32.920]   That moving to the small town
[00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:35.000]   and enmeshing yourself with the community
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:36.560]   and living a simpler life.
[00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:39.000]   Barbara Kingsolver in "Animal Vegetable Miracle"
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   saying we're gonna move to a farm for a year
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:45.520]   and only eat what we can grow ourselves or buy from nearby.
[00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:47.080]   That type of thing resonates
[00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:52.040]   because it's a radical shift in pursuit of what you value.
[00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:54.600]   So a deep life is not necessary to have a good life.
[00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:56.240]   It's just a particular approach,
[00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:58.520]   but it's an approach that right now in our current moment,
[00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:02.600]   I think has a lot of momentum behind it.
[00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:05.680]   This was one of the impacts of the pandemic
[00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:09.720]   was people being very reflective of their lives,
[00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:11.760]   realizing they have a lot more agency
[00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:14.000]   than they before realized,
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.480]   realizing that you can make major shifts
[00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:20.880]   and life still goes on, that it's possible,
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:23.320]   and starting to care about what do I really care about?
[00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:25.520]   And so I think the post-pandemic moment
[00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:27.760]   is one in which this particular configuration
[00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:31.120]   of the good life, one that's built around radical shifts,
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:33.080]   is one that is catching more and more attention
[00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:34.200]   it's having this moment.
[00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:35.680]   So that's why I'm thinking about it.
[00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:38.400]   And that's why in theory, I'll be writing a book about it
[00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:40.800]   at some point in the next couple of years.
[00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:41.640]   So there we go.
[00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:44.920]   That's my second attempt to differentiate the good life
[00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:45.880]   from the deep life.
[00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:51.280]   All right, well, why don't we get technical?
[00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:54.160]   We haven't done a good old-fashioned habit tune-up
[00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:55.040]   in a while.
[00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:57.360]   For those who don't remember,
[00:49:57.360 --> 00:49:59.800]   the habit tune-up segment is one where I take a piece
[00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:01.880]   of advice that I have given before,
[00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:03.360]   and we just get into the weeds a little bit.
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:06.480]   So let's get into the weeds, get a little bit technical
[00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:08.600]   about some specific productivity advice.
[00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:13.600]   I have an email-related habit to talk about
[00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:15.760]   in today's segment.
[00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:18.400]   It's an idea that I first introduced in my book,
[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:23.400]   "Deep Work," where I gave it the incredibly compelling
[00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:28.080]   and sexy name of process-centric email.
[00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:31.240]   So what is process-centric email?
[00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:32.560]   Let me step back first.
[00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:35.760]   My preamble to getting to the tactic here
[00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:39.600]   is pushing for a little bit more clarity on the question
[00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:43.700]   of what is it about email that we dislike?
[00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:46.000]   This is something I think a lot of people get wrong.
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:47.440]   I get a lot of messages from people that say,
[00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:49.680]   "Yeah, I love this idea of digital minimalism
[00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:54.120]   "because I hate how when I go into my email inbox,
[00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:56.720]   "there's all of these newsletters.
[00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:58.640]   "And I'm gonna simplify and unsubscribe
[00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:00.040]   "from a lot of newsletters."
[00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:02.880]   All right, that's fine if you wanna do it.
[00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:04.960]   Too many newsletters is not your problem with email.
[00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:08.500]   Other people say, "Yeah, I have all of these announcements
[00:51:08.500 --> 00:51:12.220]   "and notices and promotional emails from every company
[00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:14.420]   "that I've ever bought something for.
[00:51:14.420 --> 00:51:19.340]   "My employer sends out 17 announcements a day,
[00:51:19.340 --> 00:51:21.220]   "new parking things, new programs.
[00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:23.000]   "There's all these announcement emails
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:24.520]   "they clutter up my inbox."
[00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:25.520]   Yeah, it's annoying.
[00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:27.720]   It's not the problem with email.
[00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:30.200]   Some people say, "Yeah, everyone is always shooting me
[00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:31.840]   "these questions.
[00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:32.940]   "Hey, what time is that meeting tomorrow?
[00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:34.120]   "What about this?"
[00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:35.480]   And that's annoying.
[00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:38.560]   Like, can't we just talk next time we see each other?
[00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:40.600]   But short questions that can be answered,
[00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:45.680]   two o'clock, the client's name is this, here's the link.
[00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:48.300]   That's also not the problem with email.
[00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:51.140]   If all of email was a combination of newsletters,
[00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:52.360]   announcements and promotions,
[00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:54.200]   and short questions that could be answered,
[00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:57.800]   we would have no problem with our inboxes.
[00:51:57.800 --> 00:51:59.840]   It really doesn't stress us out that much
[00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:01.000]   to see too many newsletters.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:02.240]   You can just archive.
[00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:04.560]   It doesn't stress us out that much
[00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:06.120]   to see too many promotional announcements,
[00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:08.200]   just boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, right?
[00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:09.400]   You just delete and archive them.
[00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:10.760]   It's actually kind of fulfilling.
[00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:12.120]   It's easy to do.
[00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:13.440]   It feels like you're making progress.
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:15.960]   We don't get stressed out by questions we can answer
[00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:17.820]   immediately with a short response.
[00:52:17.820 --> 00:52:19.420]   It's very productive.
[00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:20.260]   Let me give you the answer to this,
[00:52:20.260 --> 00:52:21.080]   let me give you the answer to this,
[00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:21.920]   let me give you the answer to this.
[00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:24.880]   If all email was 20 minutes twice a day,
[00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:25.920]   would be on top of it,
[00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:27.560]   there'd be a little burst of productivity,
[00:52:27.560 --> 00:52:29.640]   it would be something that'd be positive.
[00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:32.560]   The real productivity poison
[00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:35.700]   that's frothing around in that email inbox
[00:52:35.700 --> 00:52:40.640]   is messages that initiate back and forth interaction.
[00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:45.640]   That is above all else,
[00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:50.640]   the source of almost every piece of cognitive distress
[00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:52.880]   that we feel from email.
[00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:54.320]   Not a newsletter, not an announcement,
[00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:56.440]   not what time is the meeting tomorrow.
[00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:58.160]   It's the email that says,
[00:52:58.160 --> 00:53:00.600]   we should probably make a plan
[00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:02.540]   for the client coming tomorrow.
[00:53:02.540 --> 00:53:07.200]   Or what are we gonna do to get this thing ready
[00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:08.640]   for next Monday?
[00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:12.200]   The message that is gonna begin back and forth,
[00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:14.880]   back and forth, like, well, when should we do that?
[00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:15.720]   And what about next week?
[00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:16.900]   Oh, next week doesn't work.
[00:53:16.900 --> 00:53:19.120]   Let me CC in Jesse and ask him
[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:21.640]   if he remembers when this has back and forth,
[00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:23.560]   back and forth, unscheduled ad hoc,
[00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:26.180]   back and forth interactive conversation
[00:53:26.180 --> 00:53:27.540]   delivered through emails,
[00:53:27.540 --> 00:53:29.320]   working towards trying to figure out something
[00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:30.360]   or achieve some goal.
[00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:33.900]   That is the main productivity poison in our inboxes.
[00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:34.980]   Why?
[00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:36.760]   It brings with it two demands.
[00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:39.800]   One, that's more than anything else
[00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:41.200]   what keeps you coming back to your inbox
[00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:42.320]   again and again and again,
[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:43.640]   because you have to service
[00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:45.620]   these back and forth conversations.
[00:53:45.620 --> 00:53:47.680]   If five messages have to get back and forth
[00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:48.980]   before we can get a resolution,
[00:53:48.980 --> 00:53:52.060]   and we need that resolution by the end of the day,
[00:53:52.060 --> 00:53:54.500]   I can't wait three hours for message number two,
[00:53:54.500 --> 00:53:56.900]   'cause we have to fit in all five messages.
[00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:58.300]   So back and forth conversations
[00:53:58.300 --> 00:54:01.440]   require much more frequent inbox checking.
[00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:03.420]   'Cause I gotta see when the latest message comes in
[00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:04.760]   so I can bounce it back.
[00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:05.840]   And you gotta see when that comes in
[00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:06.740]   so you can bounce it back to me.
[00:54:06.740 --> 00:54:08.840]   And I have to see that pretty soon after and bounce it back.
[00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:10.160]   We check our inboxes all the time,
[00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:13.120]   not because we know there's new newsletters in there,
[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:15.880]   not because there's promotions from Levi's we wanna see.
[00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:17.600]   It's because we have back and forth conversations
[00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:18.740]   we have to service.
[00:54:18.740 --> 00:54:21.140]   The second reason why these are productivity poison
[00:54:21.140 --> 00:54:22.640]   is that these are the conversations
[00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:25.200]   that bring with it the dreaded ambiguity.
[00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:27.200]   I don't know how to answer this.
[00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:30.080]   It's where you get the,
[00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:33.080]   can you figure out how to, you know,
[00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:35.620]   fix this issue we have with the budget?
[00:54:35.620 --> 00:54:37.520]   And you're like, I don't know how to do that.
[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:40.240]   And now I guess I can afford this as someone else
[00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:42.160]   or I'll do obligation hot potato
[00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:44.060]   and shoot off a question to someone else
[00:54:44.060 --> 00:54:46.100]   just to get it off my plate and wait for it to come back.
[00:54:46.100 --> 00:54:47.760]   I have to like talk to different people
[00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:48.760]   and see what they tell me.
[00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:51.760]   You've created a, they create these major open loops
[00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:53.980]   in terms of our obligation storage systems.
[00:54:53.980 --> 00:54:55.960]   And it's a real source of stress and distress.
[00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:58.560]   If you feel anxious checking your inbox,
[00:54:58.560 --> 00:54:59.560]   going through your inbox,
[00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:02.000]   these are the type of messages that create that anxiety.
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:04.280]   They're like, oh my God, I don't know.
[00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:05.440]   I don't know how to fix the budget.
[00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:06.280]   I don't really know how this works.
[00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:08.920]   I don't even really know who I should talk to about this.
[00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:10.600]   I guess I'm gonna have to start sending messages
[00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:12.240]   and like kind of letting this thing unfold
[00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:14.080]   and keep checking this throughout the day.
[00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:17.180]   So those are the productivity poison.
[00:55:17.180 --> 00:55:20.120]   So if you wanna make your experience with your inbox better,
[00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:22.440]   it is these back and forth interactive
[00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:25.000]   ambiguous conversations that you have to tame.
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:28.960]   That is what process centric emailing is all about.
[00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:30.720]   The idea is simple.
[00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:32.600]   When you see a message arrive
[00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:35.700]   that is initiating one of these long back and forths,
[00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:39.740]   your first entrance into this conversation,
[00:55:39.740 --> 00:55:41.480]   your first message into this conversation
[00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:45.560]   should include in it a proposal
[00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:49.400]   for the process by which this whole collaboration
[00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:50.760]   ending in the goal being achieved
[00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:53.020]   of this conversation is going to happen.
[00:55:53.020 --> 00:55:54.860]   You say how it's gonna happen
[00:55:54.860 --> 00:55:56.420]   so it doesn't just default to like,
[00:55:56.420 --> 00:55:58.120]   let's just keep going back and forth.
[00:55:58.120 --> 00:56:00.600]   You declare, this is how I think this should happen.
[00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:03.640]   Oh, we have to figure out what to do about this client.
[00:56:03.640 --> 00:56:06.280]   Okay, well, here's what I suggest.
[00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:08.920]   We have this meeting coming up on Wednesday.
[00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:10.680]   Let's add time to talk to that.
[00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:13.520]   I'm gonna, before we get to that meeting,
[00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:15.960]   talk to Susan to make sure that we understand
[00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:19.520]   the full whatever, the full process
[00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:22.240]   for what we need to do to onboard the client.
[00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:24.320]   We'll talk about this in the last five minutes
[00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:27.160]   of the meeting and make a plan going forward.
[00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:28.800]   Or you say, okay, here's what we need to do.
[00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:31.320]   You're right, we do have to figure out
[00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:32.280]   when we're gonna meet.
[00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:33.760]   Here's what we'll do.
[00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:37.880]   I have listed here, whatever, 15 times.
[00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:41.640]   Jesse, you then highlight the times that work for you
[00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:43.940]   and then you forward it onto the third person
[00:56:43.940 --> 00:56:46.000]   and you select one of those that works
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:49.360]   and put that just into an invite and send it to all of us
[00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:50.880]   and we don't even have to discuss anymore.
[00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:52.360]   What I'm talking about here is processes
[00:56:52.360 --> 00:56:54.360]   that gets the thing done.
[00:56:54.360 --> 00:56:57.080]   The thing that this conversation is gonna lead towards
[00:56:57.080 --> 00:57:00.280]   gets you to done without ambiguity
[00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:02.760]   and without having to just wait for messages to arrive
[00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:04.860]   and respond to them and go back and forth.
[00:57:04.860 --> 00:57:08.800]   Process-centric emailing is a little bit stilted.
[00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:11.900]   It's not very casual.
[00:57:11.900 --> 00:57:13.520]   So typically the people who use this
[00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:16.600]   will have a casual message with emoticons
[00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:17.760]   and all the other stuff,
[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:20.600]   but then have the pretty detailed thing below.
[00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:22.360]   You can blame it on me.
[00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:23.440]   So sorry for the formality,
[00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:27.360]   I've been listening too much Cal Newport, but it works.
[00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:29.120]   And it takes a little bit more time up front
[00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:30.200]   because you have to figure out,
[00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:33.200]   whoa, what's the right way to get to done?
[00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:35.980]   What's the right way to get the done here?
[00:57:35.980 --> 00:57:37.440]   And you gotta think it through
[00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:38.800]   and you gotta explain it to people
[00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:40.800]   and you might have some extra work to do to set it up.
[00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:43.040]   Here's the Google Doc, here's the Doodle.
[00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:44.600]   Here's how it's gonna unfold.
[00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:46.640]   I've set up an office hours.
[00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:47.840]   It takes more work,
[00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:51.000]   but it is almost always worth spending 10 or 15 more minutes
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:52.660]   at the beginning of an exchange
[00:57:52.660 --> 00:57:55.720]   than it is to have 10 or 15 messages you have to respond to.
[00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:57.280]   10 or 15 minutes right now
[00:57:57.280 --> 00:58:00.040]   takes away 10 or 15 minutes from your day,
[00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:01.840]   but 10 to 15 messages,
[00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:04.320]   each of which is requiring five inbox checks
[00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:06.280]   while you wait for it,
[00:58:06.280 --> 00:58:10.600]   that's gonna be 50 to 75 inbox checks over the next few days
[00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:11.920]   which is way more damaging
[00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:15.200]   than you adding 10 minutes right now to what you're doing.
[00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:17.520]   So I'm a big believer in process-centric emailing.
[00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:20.080]   And of course, if you find yourself,
[00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:20.960]   it's a bonus,
[00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:23.600]   proposing the same process again and again
[00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:26.400]   because the same type of work happens again and again,
[00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:27.860]   then you can just codify that.
[00:58:27.860 --> 00:58:28.880]   You know what?
[00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:31.120]   We do this client onboarding all the time.
[00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:33.440]   Why don't we all just agree this is how we do it?
[00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:34.680]   And so you don't even have to write out
[00:58:34.680 --> 00:58:35.680]   the whole process every time.
[00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:38.020]   So it's also a good way to unearth
[00:58:38.020 --> 00:58:40.180]   or make legible repeated work
[00:58:40.180 --> 00:58:41.920]   and get good processes in place.
[00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:42.760]   So just remember that.
[00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:44.720]   Ongoing interactive conversations,
[00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:46.520]   that is the thing that kills us in our inbox.
[00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:48.160]   That's the thing you should care about.
[00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:50.400]   That is the thing you should be willing to do
[00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:53.740]   almost anything to vanquish.
[00:58:53.740 --> 00:58:55.480]   It really is productivity poison.
[00:58:55.480 --> 00:59:02.360]   All right, well, let's talk real quickly.
[00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:03.520]   I have two sponsors I wanna mention
[00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:06.420]   before we get to a couple more questions I enjoy.
[00:59:06.420 --> 00:59:11.420]   This first sponsor is My Body Tutor, T-U-T-O-R,
[00:59:11.420 --> 00:59:16.560]   founded by Adam Gilbert, Adam Gilbert.
[00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:17.820]   Why is that Gil-Bort?
[00:59:17.820 --> 00:59:21.840]   Gilbert, who I've known for many years
[00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:24.280]   used to be the fitness advice guy
[00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:27.360]   on the early days of the study hack blogs.
[00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:28.520]   His company, My Body Tutor,
[00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:30.960]   is a 100% online coaching program
[00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:33.480]   that solves the biggest problem in health and fitness,
[00:59:33.480 --> 00:59:35.920]   lack of consistency.
[00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:37.640]   And they do this by simplifying the process
[00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:39.280]   into practical, sustainable behaviors.
[00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:40.960]   And then, and this is key,
[00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:43.960]   giving you daily accountability and support
[00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:45.040]   to stick to your plan.
[00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:46.360]   So when you use My Body Tutor,
[00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:48.840]   you have this app where you check in every day.
[00:59:48.840 --> 00:59:51.600]   Here's what I ate, here's what I did.
[00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:53.840]   And there is a coach that is assigned to you
[00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:55.720]   that sees that and then comes back to you
[00:59:55.720 --> 00:59:57.040]   at the end of the day and says,
[00:59:57.040 --> 00:59:59.880]   "I read your report, here's my feedback.
[00:59:59.880 --> 01:00:01.680]   "Looking good, don't worry about this,
[01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:04.080]   "worry about this, here's some suggestions."
[01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:06.480]   So the coach builds the plan for you
[01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:09.200]   and then checks in with you every day
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:11.540]   about whether or not you are achieving it.
[01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:14.320]   So in my case, for example,
[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:16.800]   you call up the My Body Tutor coach
[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:20.880]   and you say, "I need the Skarsgård Viking body.
[01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:23.000]   "I have six months to get there,
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.220]   "but it is very important to me
[01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:29.680]   "that I look like a Viking with crazy trapezius muscles."
[01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:30.900]   - 45 minutes a day.
[01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:31.740]   - That's what it is.
[01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:34.100]   I went back, I finished watching that movie, by the way,
[01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:35.860]   and it's not that they made his,
[01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:37.580]   they weren't doing superhero body,
[01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:39.940]   but something about him was like really eye-catching.
[01:00:39.940 --> 01:00:41.880]   What it was is, what's this muscle
[01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:43.420]   that goes up to your neck, trapezius?
[01:00:43.420 --> 01:00:44.260]   - Yeah.
[01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:46.740]   - Yeah, they gave him a beast trapezius
[01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:49.700]   so that he would walk with his sword or whatever
[01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:51.060]   with just like this,
[01:00:51.060 --> 01:00:54.620]   looks like he's wearing a backpack on his back.
[01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:57.100]   That's the type of thing My Body Tutor can help you with
[01:00:57.100 --> 01:00:59.000]   or whatever else your goal is.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.700]   You have a coach, you talk to the coach
[01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:04.460]   every day, they make a plan, the accountability,
[01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:06.820]   it's all online, it's a brilliant idea.
[01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:08.860]   I know Adam's crushing it with this company
[01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:11.180]   and I'm not surprised.
[01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:13.980]   So here's the thing, if you sign up for My Body Tutor,
[01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:17.420]   tell them that you came from deep questions,
[01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:19.380]   tell them that Cal Newport sent you,
[01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:20.620]   they'll know what that means
[01:01:20.620 --> 01:01:24.780]   and they will give you $50 off your first month.
[01:01:24.780 --> 01:01:27.940]   Just mention me when you sign up.
[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:33.320]   We were at a dinner last night with someone
[01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:39.160]   who didn't realize Chris Pratt had a whole movie career
[01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:41.120]   after "Parks and Recreation"
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:44.520]   and she didn't know that he had gotten
[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:46.480]   to this super good shape to do superhero movies
[01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:47.400]   and "Jurassic World" movies.
[01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:48.440]   She just remembered, she's like,
[01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:50.320]   "Isn't he the like kind of overweight,
[01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:52.920]   "like fun guy on 'Parks and Rec'?"
[01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:56.120]   And so I loaded up a photo to show her
[01:01:56.120 --> 01:02:00.400]   and it was a kind of a glass drop, a glass drop moment.
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:01.960]   I went down the rabbit hole, Chris Pratt's my,
[01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:04.060]   if I looked over, he was my height
[01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:05.720]   and at his peak in "Parks and Rec"
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:08.780]   he was weighing in 80 pounds more than I weigh in right now.
[01:02:08.780 --> 01:02:11.960]   And I'm not like a super slim guy.
[01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:16.660]   And now he is stronger than that, he is lighter than that.
[01:02:16.660 --> 01:02:19.920]   If you sign up for a superhero movie,
[01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:22.560]   I went down a rabbit hole in Chris Pratt, it turned out--
[01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:24.000]   - At the dinner?
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.600]   - No, this was before.
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:26.800]   I had gone down this rabbit hole before,
[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:28.400]   so I had this queued up.
[01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:31.120]   I don't know why I went down this rabbit hole,
[01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:32.800]   but the first time he had to cut all the weight
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:34.840]   was to be in "Zero Dark Thirty"
[01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:36.600]   where he played a member of SEAL Team Six.
[01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:37.440]   - Good movie.
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:39.280]   - Yeah, but he did it on his own.
[01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:41.520]   So he was like, "I'm just gonna do it on my own."
[01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:42.520]   He's like, "I'm just gonna stop eating
[01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:47.520]   "and do 500 pushups a day and like just do crazy stuff."
[01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:49.040]   Destroyed his body,
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:50.740]   ended up having to get shoulder surgery.
[01:02:50.740 --> 01:02:51.580]   - Really? - Yeah.
[01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:53.160]   Because he was just like, "I'll just stop eating
[01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:56.360]   "and then just go like wild mode every day,"
[01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:58.260]   and destroyed his body.
[01:02:58.260 --> 01:03:00.600]   So then when it came time, he got the Marvel movie,
[01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:03.320]   he's like, "Oh, I should hire somebody."
[01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:04.800]   And like, they have ways of doing this,
[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:06.080]   like professional trainers, like,
[01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:07.040]   "Here's what you should eat."
[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:09.280]   And they make it so you don't wanna blow out.
[01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:13.340]   It turns out this is one of the really major concerns
[01:03:13.340 --> 01:03:15.040]   when they're doing this training for these movies
[01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:16.320]   is if you get injured,
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:18.320]   this could be a $20 million mistake.
[01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:21.080]   If you get injured and you have to push filming
[01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:24.400]   of a $200 million movie for six weeks
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:26.040]   because you tore your rotator cuff,
[01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:27.260]   it's like a really big deal.
[01:03:27.260 --> 01:03:29.320]   So now it's like, if you have to get in shape
[01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:30.160]   for one of these movies,
[01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:33.560]   it's like we are gonna handhold you every step of the way
[01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:35.240]   'cause we want you to get strong, yes,
[01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:39.120]   but we also can't have you ripping a pack or something
[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:41.240]   and we can't film because they have to pick things up
[01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:42.080]   and throw things.
[01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:44.600]   So let that all be,
[01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:46.520]   this is why you need something like My Body Tutor.
[01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:47.520]   Like whether you're trying to get in shape
[01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:48.600]   for a Marvel movie or whatever,
[01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:50.640]   or a wedding or whatever you're trying to do,
[01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:53.800]   this all comes back to you want a pro helping you.
[01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:54.640]   Don't just stop.
[01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:55.720]   - 40th birthday party.
[01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:58.300]   - Yeah, just don't, yeah, 40th birthday party
[01:03:58.300 --> 01:04:00.920]   where I come bursting out in the Viking outfit
[01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:02.520]   from the beginning of the Northmen.
[01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:03.480]   - On the rower.
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:06.080]   - On the rower with a giant trapezius muscle.
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:08.840]   Don't do that on your own, you need help.
[01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:10.340]   So either get Chris Pratt,
[01:04:10.340 --> 01:04:13.660]   the "Scars Guard" guy or My Body Tutor.
[01:04:13.660 --> 01:04:14.560]   Those are your three choices,
[01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:16.520]   but only one of those choices will give you $50
[01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:18.880]   off your first month if you mention my podcast.
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:21.520]   I also wanna talk about another sponsor,
[01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:22.360]   Wren,
[01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:26.080]   W-R-E-N,
[01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:28.600]   which is a startup that's making it easy
[01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:31.000]   for everyone to make a meaningful difference
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.800]   in the climates crisis.
[01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:36.120]   So right now, Wren is focused on monthly subscriptions
[01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:38.480]   where you calculate your carbon footprint,
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:41.240]   then offset it by supporting awesome climate projects
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:42.840]   that plant trees, protect forest,
[01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:44.480]   and remove CO2 from the sky.
[01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:47.200]   So you can be offsetting the carbon you're putting out,
[01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:49.400]   investing some of the money you're making
[01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:50.600]   as you generate all this carbon
[01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:53.380]   and trying to offset it somewhere else.
[01:04:53.380 --> 01:04:56.400]   Their goal is to unlock the collective action
[01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:58.720]   of millions of individuals to drive the systemic change
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:00.920]   needed to end the climate crisis.
[01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:02.060]   It says here, Jesse,
[01:05:02.060 --> 01:05:05.200]   the inspiration, I don't know if you know this,
[01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:06.640]   the inspiration for this company,
[01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:09.280]   what motivated the founders to start it was,
[01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:11.040]   I'm reading here,
[01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:13.560]   watching Jesse drive by
[01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:18.820]   in his 1978 Ford pickup truck.
[01:05:18.820 --> 01:05:21.920]   And a tear fell from their eyes
[01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:25.760]   as they watched the birds fall from the trees dead,
[01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:28.920]   the squirrels paralyzed in the smog
[01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:30.640]   coming out of the back of that car,
[01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:32.160]   and it catalyzed them.
[01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:35.000]   They said, we have to solve the climate crisis.
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.800]   So little known fact,
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:40.560]   Jesse's pickup truck motivated Wren's fight
[01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:41.640]   against climate change.
[01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:43.560]   - Go ahead and count out.
[01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:45.240]   - Yeah, they don't have enough digits
[01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:50.240]   in their online carbon footprint calculator for you.
[01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:51.780]   There's not enough digits, it's the problem.
[01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:53.980]   It's like the odometer rolls over.
[01:05:53.980 --> 01:05:55.660]   Yeah, when you upload a picture of your truck,
[01:05:55.660 --> 01:06:00.120]   it just gives up, the server crashes.
[01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:04.040]   Right, so Wren, anyways, that nonsense.
[01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:05.780]   Signing up for Wren is an easy way
[01:06:05.780 --> 01:06:08.320]   to do something meaningful about the climate crisis,
[01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:10.740]   much of which has been caused by Jesse.
[01:06:10.740 --> 01:06:11.780]   So you go to their website,
[01:06:11.780 --> 01:06:14.420]   you calculate your personal carbon footprint,
[01:06:14.420 --> 01:06:16.380]   and you choose the projects right there.
[01:06:16.380 --> 01:06:18.860]   It shows you how much carbon that's offsetting.
[01:06:18.860 --> 01:06:21.180]   You can pay a monthly subscription.
[01:06:21.180 --> 01:06:25.940]   It makes it simple for you to actually take some action.
[01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:28.460]   So it's gonna take all of us to end the climate crisis.
[01:06:28.460 --> 01:06:30.500]   It's gonna take all of us to prevent the damage
[01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:32.340]   or push back on the damage caused by Jesse's truck.
[01:06:32.340 --> 01:06:34.860]   So do your part today by signing up for Wren,
[01:06:34.860 --> 01:06:36.800]   that's W-R-E-N.
[01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:41.800]   Go to wren.co/deep to sign up.
[01:06:42.860 --> 01:06:44.380]   And if you do that slash deep,
[01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:48.460]   they will plant an extra 10 trees in your name.
[01:06:48.460 --> 01:06:53.460]   So that's W-R-E-N.co/deep, start making a difference.
[01:06:53.460 --> 01:07:01.380]   I think a Wren's a type of bird, right?
[01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:02.700]   - Think so. - W-R, yeah.
[01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:06.940]   Also a couple more questions here.
[01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:11.340]   I got one from Lucy, who writes in to say,
[01:07:11.340 --> 01:07:13.540]   "Hi Cal, I'm about to finish my PhD
[01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:18.100]   "and decided to try to build a career in academia.
[01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:20.780]   "Now you've emphasized a couple of times
[01:07:20.780 --> 01:07:24.380]   "that choosing a great lab and famous/knowledgeable/
[01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:27.060]   "connected supervisor was an important step.
[01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:29.140]   "Unfortunately, it was not the case for me.
[01:07:29.140 --> 01:07:30.700]   "Even though I had high grades and a good profile,
[01:07:30.700 --> 01:07:32.380]   "my choice of graduate programs were limited
[01:07:32.380 --> 01:07:35.380]   "by my unstable temporary residency situation.
[01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:37.040]   "I ended up doing a PhD with a professor
[01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:39.260]   "who barely helped me.
[01:07:39.260 --> 01:07:41.040]   "He is a nice guy, but not very knowledgeable
[01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:43.180]   "and did not improve or increase my publications
[01:07:43.180 --> 01:07:45.620]   "or contributed to my growth as a researcher.
[01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:48.340]   "Regardless of the situation,
[01:07:48.340 --> 01:07:51.060]   "I managed to publish a few papers of uncertain quality
[01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:53.400]   "and learned quite a deal through my own efforts.
[01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:57.660]   "My question is, do you think I still can succeed
[01:07:57.660 --> 01:08:01.520]   "in an academic world, even if my start was not the best?
[01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:05.100]   "Where would you recommend to focus my efforts?"
[01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:10.880]   Well, Lucy, academic world can mean a lot of things.
[01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:16.640]   So if what we're talking about is a tenure-track position
[01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:18.660]   at a well-known university,
[01:08:18.660 --> 01:08:21.040]   sort of the classic image we have of a professor,
[01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:22.640]   you have some graduate students,
[01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:26.260]   you have the patches on your tweed jacket,
[01:08:26.260 --> 01:08:27.680]   you lecture to the big lecture halls
[01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:29.860]   at a selective university,
[01:08:29.860 --> 01:08:35.240]   the issue is you're starting from a very hard position.
[01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:38.000]   The reason why I push,
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:41.940]   get the most famous professor at the best school possible
[01:08:41.940 --> 01:08:45.200]   is that these are incredibly competitive jobs to get.
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:47.280]   And the thing that matters more than anything else
[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:48.400]   is your research.
[01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:50.760]   Are you producing great work in great places
[01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:52.700]   that's generating attention and citations?
[01:08:52.700 --> 01:08:55.440]   That's what they're hiring you to do at your school.
[01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:57.580]   The reason why a famous advisor is useful
[01:08:57.580 --> 01:08:59.360]   is not because the advisor is famous,
[01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:00.840]   but because they're famous
[01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:04.140]   because they know how to publish really impactful papers
[01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:06.040]   and they will teach you how to do that.
[01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:10.560]   Learn from the people who are already doing
[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:11.920]   what it is you wanna do.
[01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:14.040]   This competitiveness is so much
[01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:17.120]   that I got a private message recently from a student
[01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:20.640]   who said, "Look, I wanna go to grad school in CS,
[01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:22.420]   "I wanna be a professor.
[01:09:22.420 --> 01:09:23.920]   "I have a grad school offer from Princeton,
[01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:25.960]   "I have a grad school offer from MIT."
[01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:28.440]   And he's like, "I'm kind of leaning towards Princeton."
[01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:29.740]   He was giving his reasons.
[01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:32.240]   And I could empathize.
[01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:33.300]   When I applied to grad school,
[01:09:33.300 --> 01:09:35.660]   I also got into Princeton and MIT.
[01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:38.580]   Those were both on my choices.
[01:09:38.580 --> 01:09:40.620]   And he was trying to nudge me towards
[01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:43.500]   saying go to Princeton.
[01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:45.620]   And honestly, I came back to him, I was like,
[01:09:45.620 --> 01:09:48.260]   "Look, man, this is not your coming of age.
[01:09:48.260 --> 01:09:50.920]   "I'm 18 going off to undergrad year experience.
[01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:53.420]   "For what you wanna study, MIT is tops.
[01:09:53.420 --> 01:09:54.620]   "Go to the best school."
[01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:57.120]   And he was going on about,
[01:09:57.120 --> 01:09:58.340]   "I like the atmosphere,
[01:09:58.340 --> 01:10:00.580]   "the more intellectual literary atmosphere of Princeton."
[01:10:00.580 --> 01:10:02.800]   Like live in Harvard Square, that's what I did.
[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:06.700]   Go to MIT, live in Harvard Square, buy books,
[01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:08.320]   but just go to the best possible school
[01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:09.540]   and get the best possible advisor
[01:10:09.540 --> 01:10:10.760]   'cause it is so competitive out there.
[01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:12.740]   You gotta study at the best place you can.
[01:10:12.740 --> 01:10:14.840]   You gotta study with the very best people you can.
[01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:17.180]   You gotta produce the best papers you can.
[01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:20.240]   It's like training for a professional athletic job.
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:22.260]   I don't care what town you like better
[01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:24.040]   or what campus fits your mood better.
[01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:25.740]   You go to the best trainer you possibly can
[01:10:25.740 --> 01:10:27.140]   because it's so competitive.
[01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:29.720]   Hundreds of people applying
[01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:31.760]   for every one of these positions.
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:34.040]   So I don't know if this is like a downer
[01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:37.280]   or a tough love pipe response,
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:39.480]   but those types of jobs are very difficult
[01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:41.880]   if you're not already coming out of a top place.
[01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:47.100]   Something that might help here is a postdoc.
[01:10:47.100 --> 01:10:48.760]   If you could get a postdoc at a good place
[01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:53.220]   and kill it on the research in that first year as a postdoc,
[01:10:53.220 --> 01:10:55.400]   that could open up opportunities.
[01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:56.660]   There's two things here, though,
[01:10:56.660 --> 01:10:58.880]   I wanna warn you against.
[01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:01.320]   One is the idea of,
[01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:04.800]   I will go to a school that I don't wanna go to, right?
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:07.640]   So it's a non-tenure track or it's tenure track,
[01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:09.920]   but they don't care at all about research,
[01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:11.000]   it's super heavy load,
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.240]   and I will earn my way into a better position.
[01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:16.700]   That is very, very difficult.
[01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:18.960]   It is hard to make that type of jump.
[01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:21.680]   If you go to a heavy teaching load school
[01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:24.120]   where they don't really care much about research,
[01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:26.440]   it's gonna be very hard to distinguish yourself there
[01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:29.220]   and jump up into a better school.
[01:11:29.220 --> 01:11:31.140]   Because remember, the better schools have their pick
[01:11:31.140 --> 01:11:33.840]   of the very best people coming out of programs.
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:37.380]   Often when better schools are hiring stars,
[01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:39.700]   they're hiring away from other good schools
[01:11:39.700 --> 01:11:41.780]   and leveraging things like that person
[01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:43.340]   wants to come to your location.
[01:11:43.340 --> 01:11:46.620]   It is just real, it happens, but it's really rare.
[01:11:46.620 --> 01:11:48.860]   And the one exception is the very top schools
[01:11:48.860 --> 01:11:53.140]   in some fields basically use an all-star methods,
[01:11:53.140 --> 01:11:55.980]   like MIT will do this in computer science or mathematics.
[01:11:56.680 --> 01:11:59.640]   They won't hire from within,
[01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:00.880]   their students have to go off
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:02.400]   and they'll watch really good schools
[01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:03.520]   that are right below them
[01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:05.600]   and just wait to see who pops off as a star
[01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:07.120]   and they'll say, "All right, come back."
[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:08.440]   So MIT will do that.
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:10.920]   You'll be at a really good school
[01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:12.760]   and then MIT will call you essentially
[01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:14.640]   and be like, "Oh, you got a MacArthur,
[01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:16.540]   "you got a whatever, great."
[01:12:16.540 --> 01:12:17.520]   Now you can come back to MIT,
[01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:18.660]   we'll give you a professorship.
[01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:20.360]   But what you don't see is someone going
[01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:23.960]   to a non-research focused heavy teaching load school
[01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:26.020]   and have a Princeton or an MIT say,
[01:12:26.020 --> 01:12:26.900]   "You've been doing great work,"
[01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:29.380]   because there's no time to do it, it's crushing.
[01:12:29.380 --> 01:12:33.540]   And also be wary about letting your desire for academia
[01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:38.060]   pull you into a exploitative adjunct type situation.
[01:12:38.060 --> 01:12:39.980]   Again, it's also very rare that you're gonna jump
[01:12:39.980 --> 01:12:40.980]   from one of those situations
[01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:44.300]   into a classic tenure track type academic position.
[01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:46.900]   So I wanna warn you from traps
[01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:48.140]   and give you the reality check
[01:12:48.140 --> 01:12:50.300]   that for this very narrow definition of academia,
[01:12:50.300 --> 01:12:51.560]   and it might not be what you're talking about,
[01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:53.180]   but for this very narrow definition
[01:12:53.180 --> 01:12:56.060]   of the TV movie portrayal of academia,
[01:12:56.060 --> 01:12:59.660]   tenure track at a well-known university doing research,
[01:12:59.660 --> 01:13:01.200]   they're hard jobs to get.
[01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:05.620]   And you need to have produced really good research.
[01:13:05.620 --> 01:13:07.340]   So if you have a way to do that in a postdoc,
[01:13:07.340 --> 01:13:08.460]   if you're right on the precipice
[01:13:08.460 --> 01:13:10.140]   of doing something really important,
[01:13:10.140 --> 01:13:13.520]   writing the killer book, getting out those killer articles,
[01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:14.540]   that's what you should do.
[01:13:14.540 --> 01:13:15.500]   That's what they're gonna care about,
[01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:16.700]   articles, articles, articles.
[01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:18.660]   So if you can do that, do that.
[01:13:18.660 --> 01:13:21.020]   If that doesn't seem like it's in the cards,
[01:13:21.020 --> 01:13:22.340]   then I'm just saying be wary
[01:13:22.340 --> 01:13:24.300]   because there's a lot of traps out here
[01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:26.380]   where someone will tell you a story,
[01:13:26.380 --> 01:13:27.940]   will come do this,
[01:13:27.940 --> 01:13:29.620]   and then you can jump to what you wanna do
[01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:30.460]   a little bit later,
[01:13:30.460 --> 01:13:32.500]   and that jump can be pretty hard to make.
[01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:35.940]   I hope that wasn't too much of a downer, Jesse, but.
[01:13:35.940 --> 01:13:36.780]   - That was a good answer.
[01:13:36.780 --> 01:13:39.940]   With your break now, are you still writing papers?
[01:13:39.940 --> 01:13:41.060]   - Yeah.
[01:13:41.060 --> 01:13:41.900]   Yeah, thanks. - So you still have
[01:13:41.900 --> 01:13:42.720]   a break here? - I'm still writing
[01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:43.560]   some papers.
[01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:46.660]   Yeah, my doctoral student's presenting a paper next week.
[01:13:46.660 --> 01:13:49.140]   No, no, in, I'm mixing up trips,
[01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:53.100]   a little later in July at a conference.
[01:13:53.100 --> 01:13:55.340]   And yeah, so I'm still writing some papers.
[01:13:55.340 --> 01:13:56.420]   - So that's different writing time
[01:13:56.420 --> 01:13:59.300]   than your morning book writing,
[01:13:59.300 --> 01:14:00.580]   New Yorker writing time, right?
[01:14:00.580 --> 01:14:01.620]   - That's different, yeah.
[01:14:01.620 --> 01:14:03.020]   Like I'm not actively writing
[01:14:03.020 --> 01:14:04.820]   any research papers right now.
[01:14:04.820 --> 01:14:05.660]   - Got it.
[01:14:05.660 --> 01:14:07.820]   - But like my doctoral student's working on his dissertation,
[01:14:07.820 --> 01:14:09.220]   so we're doing, you know,
[01:14:09.220 --> 01:14:10.060]   I'm looking at drafts.
[01:14:10.060 --> 01:14:11.900]   In fact, I'm talking to him right after this,
[01:14:11.900 --> 01:14:13.260]   so some of that's going on.
[01:14:13.260 --> 01:14:15.780]   Yeah, so like this summer,
[01:14:15.780 --> 01:14:19.740]   I'm really kind of locked into non-academic writing.
[01:14:19.740 --> 01:14:21.140]   But I still do some of that.
[01:14:21.140 --> 01:14:23.780]   I used to do a lot of it.
[01:14:23.780 --> 01:14:24.700]   - Yeah. - Like that's how you get,
[01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:26.520]   when I was coming into Georgetown,
[01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:28.420]   I had a lot of papers.
[01:14:28.420 --> 01:14:29.420]   I don't know what my count is now,
[01:14:29.420 --> 01:14:30.820]   but I think I have something,
[01:14:30.820 --> 01:14:33.120]   academic peer-reviewed computer science papers,
[01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:35.260]   probably 75.
[01:14:35.260 --> 01:14:36.080]   - Wow.
[01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:39.460]   - Yeah, and then if you add up citations,
[01:14:39.460 --> 01:14:41.820]   four or 5,000 citations,
[01:14:41.820 --> 01:14:43.660]   I mean, it's just, it's a hard work.
[01:14:43.660 --> 01:14:45.340]   They're like, get the job and get tenure.
[01:14:45.340 --> 01:14:48.660]   And I did early tenure is, you know,
[01:14:48.660 --> 01:14:50.900]   a four to five paper a year pace in computer science.
[01:14:50.900 --> 01:14:53.060]   Like it was just, that's what I was doing.
[01:14:53.060 --> 01:14:55.120]   Yeah, that takes time.
[01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:58.620]   All right, let's do, where are we at?
[01:14:58.620 --> 01:14:59.620]   We have time, let's do a call.
[01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:01.180]   Let's do one more call,
[01:15:01.180 --> 01:15:03.500]   and then we can call it quits for today.
[01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:05.500]   - Sounds good, we got a call from a monk.
[01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:09.100]   - Cal, I'm inspired by your work, thank you.
[01:15:09.100 --> 01:15:10.860]   My name is Etienne,
[01:15:10.860 --> 01:15:14.340]   and I'm a Benedictine monk in the United States.
[01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:18.220]   The idea of deep work and the deep life
[01:15:18.220 --> 01:15:21.440]   is really resonant with me.
[01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:26.300]   Part of my work is educating and forming young men
[01:15:26.300 --> 01:15:29.040]   to become leaders in the Catholic church.
[01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:33.020]   I wish to model and teach them deep work,
[01:15:33.020 --> 01:15:36.440]   slow productivity, the deep life,
[01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:38.740]   digital minimalism, et cetera.
[01:15:38.740 --> 01:15:43.160]   Do you have thoughts on how I might be a good mentor
[01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:47.500]   and teacher for these principles to these young men?
[01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:49.340]   Again, thank you very much.
[01:15:49.340 --> 01:15:54.060]   - Well, it's a good question.
[01:15:54.060 --> 01:15:58.340]   I mean, certainly young men as a demographic
[01:15:58.340 --> 01:16:02.620]   are often in this day and age hungry for guidance.
[01:16:02.620 --> 01:16:07.500]   So it is a demographic group that is open
[01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:10.220]   to being inspired, open to being guided.
[01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:13.520]   And when they're not, when they're left adrift,
[01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:16.000]   negative things happen as a consequence.
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:20.360]   So I'm glad you're involved in being a guiding light
[01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:21.760]   to this particular group.
[01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:25.000]   I think one thing that's helpful,
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:26.520]   so I'm thinking about, I mean, I advise,
[01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:29.320]   when I get messages from a lot of people,
[01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:30.800]   but when I'm thinking about the advice I give
[01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:32.800]   to young men in particular,
[01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:36.160]   I think having the frame of the deep life
[01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:38.100]   is a helpful starting place.
[01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:41.160]   So saying, okay, you're committing to this goal
[01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:43.460]   that you want to live a deep life.
[01:16:43.460 --> 01:16:46.040]   You don't wanna live a life that is haphazard.
[01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:47.720]   You don't wanna live a life that is arbitrary
[01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:51.180]   or at the whims of distraction or the noise of our culture,
[01:16:51.180 --> 01:16:53.180]   that you instead wanna live a life that is intentional
[01:16:53.180 --> 01:16:55.180]   and considered and remarkable in the sense
[01:16:55.180 --> 01:16:57.060]   that it makes people turn their head
[01:16:57.060 --> 01:16:58.020]   and catch their attention.
[01:16:58.020 --> 01:17:00.580]   Oh, that's something, that's something.
[01:17:00.580 --> 01:17:03.160]   That is highly appealing to a lot of young men.
[01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:04.360]   And I think laying out that framework,
[01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:05.400]   okay, how do we do this?
[01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:07.380]   And making it clear that this is gonna require discipline
[01:17:07.380 --> 01:17:10.340]   and hard work, that is all fantastic.
[01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:12.880]   That is a charge we want.
[01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:15.460]   Give me a challenge.
[01:17:15.460 --> 01:17:17.780]   I wanna have to rise to a challenge.
[01:17:17.780 --> 01:17:19.100]   So that is all good.
[01:17:19.100 --> 01:17:21.100]   The other part of the deep life framework
[01:17:21.100 --> 01:17:23.660]   that I think is for good men, good for young men
[01:17:23.660 --> 01:17:27.340]   is that it has these multiple elements to it.
[01:17:27.340 --> 01:17:32.340]   We often get stuck on just one aspect of good living.
[01:17:32.340 --> 01:17:33.780]   We neglect the others.
[01:17:33.780 --> 01:17:35.620]   We get obsessed about career,
[01:17:35.620 --> 01:17:39.700]   but we fall behind on our philosophical
[01:17:39.700 --> 01:17:40.840]   or theological growth.
[01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:43.100]   We fall behind on leadership or community,
[01:17:43.100 --> 01:17:47.020]   or we get really obsessed about theology.
[01:17:47.020 --> 01:17:49.280]   We're going through the process of becoming a monk
[01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:51.500]   and forget the importance of community
[01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:52.580]   or the importance of craft.
[01:17:52.580 --> 01:17:55.160]   So this notion that we have various areas of life
[01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:57.860]   that all require service, I think that is very useful.
[01:17:57.860 --> 01:18:01.000]   And we know the areas I often talk about is craft.
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.960]   So what you actually do and create is community,
[01:18:04.900 --> 01:18:06.980]   being a leader and sacrificing non-trivial time
[01:18:06.980 --> 01:18:09.500]   and energy on behalf of other people,
[01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:12.020]   constitution, that is your health, that is your fitness,
[01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:13.820]   contemplation, that's gonna be philosophy,
[01:18:13.820 --> 01:18:17.300]   that's gonna be theology, really making that important,
[01:18:17.300 --> 01:18:18.660]   making that important part of your life.
[01:18:18.660 --> 01:18:20.740]   And then I often do throw in celebration,
[01:18:20.740 --> 01:18:23.940]   the ability to build up taste and kind of stewardship
[01:18:23.940 --> 01:18:26.300]   and just gratitude for things that are good in the world
[01:18:26.300 --> 01:18:27.740]   and in your life and things you can go
[01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:29.260]   and just get pure enjoyment out of.
[01:18:29.260 --> 01:18:30.900]   Breaking that down, here are five things.
[01:18:30.900 --> 01:18:32.680]   Each of these requires attention.
[01:18:33.620 --> 01:18:35.420]   Each of these requires cultivation,
[01:18:35.420 --> 01:18:40.180]   is a message that young people and young men in particular
[01:18:40.180 --> 01:18:41.420]   really resonate with.
[01:18:41.420 --> 01:18:42.260]   And then you work through,
[01:18:42.260 --> 01:18:43.700]   let's do keystone habits in each
[01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:45.500]   and let's go through each of these one by one
[01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:47.100]   and we can spend six weeks in each
[01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:49.420]   and do a preliminary overhaul of that part of your life.
[01:18:49.420 --> 01:18:51.100]   Let's overhaul your eating
[01:18:51.100 --> 01:18:53.260]   and get some real serious fitness going here,
[01:18:53.260 --> 01:18:54.780]   have some discipline there.
[01:18:54.780 --> 01:18:56.080]   How about your theological mind?
[01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:57.140]   How about your philosophical mind?
[01:18:57.140 --> 01:18:58.100]   You need to start reading books.
[01:18:58.100 --> 01:18:59.940]   You need to stop, you can get off that phone,
[01:18:59.940 --> 01:19:02.300]   you need to read, you need a half hour a day.
[01:19:02.300 --> 01:19:03.780]   Here's what you're gonna read.
[01:19:03.780 --> 01:19:04.860]   We're gonna talk about it.
[01:19:04.860 --> 01:19:07.220]   You have to expand your mind.
[01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:08.940]   You have to open, okay, there we go.
[01:19:08.940 --> 01:19:09.940]   We're working on that as well.
[01:19:09.940 --> 01:19:10.800]   Leadership and community.
[01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:12.220]   What are you doing to make the life
[01:19:12.220 --> 01:19:13.740]   of people around you better?
[01:19:13.740 --> 01:19:15.260]   Are you spending time thinking about it every day?
[01:19:15.260 --> 01:19:16.380]   Do you lead anything?
[01:19:16.380 --> 01:19:19.380]   Where are you leading other people
[01:19:19.380 --> 01:19:20.380]   towards somewhere better
[01:19:20.380 --> 01:19:23.300]   where you're sacrificing your own time and energy?
[01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:24.380]   These things are important
[01:19:24.380 --> 01:19:26.780]   and it's all different areas you're focusing on.
[01:19:26.780 --> 01:19:28.220]   When you focus on the craft piece,
[01:19:28.220 --> 01:19:30.340]   that's where deep work and concentration
[01:19:30.340 --> 01:19:31.660]   and focus and diligence
[01:19:31.660 --> 01:19:33.940]   and all of that comes into play, slow productivity.
[01:19:33.940 --> 01:19:36.420]   So as you move through these different buckets,
[01:19:36.420 --> 01:19:37.300]   these different areas,
[01:19:37.300 --> 01:19:39.420]   all sorts of different learning can happen.
[01:19:39.420 --> 01:19:41.240]   But it's that overall pursuit.
[01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:44.580]   I want with discipline and intention
[01:19:44.580 --> 01:19:46.460]   to make my life into something deep and remarkable.
[01:19:46.460 --> 01:19:50.620]   That pursuit is like water
[01:19:50.620 --> 01:19:52.300]   to the explorer lost in the desert
[01:19:52.300 --> 01:19:56.340]   when we're talking about young men in today's culture.
[01:19:56.340 --> 01:19:59.160]   So I think that's the way I would go about it.
[01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:01.040]   And I would really challenge them.
[01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:03.720]   In each of these areas,
[01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:05.200]   don't just do the easy, do the hard.
[01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:08.440]   And I'll tell you, there are so many positive side effects
[01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:11.520]   of systematically trying to cultivate this life,
[01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:12.720]   especially if you're young
[01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:14.320]   and especially if you're adrift.
[01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:17.560]   The excessive video game playing,
[01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:20.520]   the excessive phone scrolling,
[01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:23.000]   the pornography, the excessive drinking,
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:27.040]   all of these things that can afflict the 23 and adrift,
[01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:29.200]   they naturally just start to dissipate
[01:20:30.280 --> 01:20:31.880]   when you have these more important things
[01:20:31.880 --> 01:20:33.320]   that you're starting to work on,
[01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:35.400]   you're getting that feeling of success on them.
[01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:37.560]   You're getting that feeling of efficacy.
[01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:41.520]   You're getting that feeling of autonomy and meaning.
[01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:44.160]   And it transforms the whole way you think about the life.
[01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:48.320]   It transforms the troll on the Twitter
[01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:52.200]   who's just angry and looking for attention
[01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:54.660]   into a leader in their town,
[01:20:54.660 --> 01:20:55.880]   into a real deep thinker
[01:20:55.880 --> 01:20:57.900]   who ends up contributing something really interesting
[01:20:57.900 --> 01:20:58.840]   to the world of ideas.
[01:20:58.840 --> 01:21:00.160]   As someone who is in good shape
[01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:03.440]   so they can be there for their family, for their community
[01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:05.040]   through thick and thin into older age,
[01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:06.480]   there's so many things good to come out of it.
[01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:08.240]   So I'm glad you're thinking about this.
[01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:10.160]   That's how I would do it.
[01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:11.960]   Challenge, discipline, intention,
[01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:13.440]   all aimed towards the deep life,
[01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:16.800]   break into the categories, do my whole framework there.
[01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:19.280]   I think young men are hungry for it
[01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:22.620]   and I think they will be quite receptive.
[01:21:22.620 --> 01:21:27.440]   All right, Jessie, I think that's a good variety
[01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:28.280]   of questions here.
[01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:29.600]   We're coming up on the 120 mark.
[01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:33.320]   So that's as good a time of any to wrap things up.
[01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:35.520]   So thank you everyone who submitted questions.

[01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:44.480]   what you see, I should say,
[01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:46.960]   videos of the full episodes and clips
