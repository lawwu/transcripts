[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960]   - When we were out in the lobby,
[00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.320]   you mentioned that you have a breathing exercise,
[00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.440]   a coherence breathing exercise
[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.320]   that you thought might be useful for us to do now
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.560]   and perhaps for some of the listeners to join in.
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.540]   - Yeah, let's do it.
[00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.120]   And then if you want to talk about it after we can.
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.960]   - Sounds good.
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.360]   - The reason I started doing this
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.320]   is I have relatively low heart rate variability
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.020]   and you want to have a higher one.
[00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.200]   So I looked at all the things
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.280]   that can raise your heart rate variability
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.600]   and I started doing this breathing technique specifically
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.820]   for heart rate variability, then it went up.
[00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:33.660]   - Awesome.
[00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.080]   - So it's tested.
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.920]   - Great.
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.520]   - Let's do it together here.
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.280]   It'll say, take a deep breath.
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.560]   And then when you'll hear the sound of a,
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.240]   if you follow me for the first inhale and exhale,
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.640]   you'll know what sound means.
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.500]   - And you do this eyes closed typically?
[00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.340]   - I do it eyes closed.
[00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.960]   - Okay, we'll close our eyes.
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:52.800]   - Thank you.

[00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.340]   (inhales and exhales loudly)

[00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.840]   (exhales loudly)
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:35.960]   - That was five minutes.
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.160]   - I like that.
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.240]   - Feels nice, doesn't it?
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.080]   - Yeah.
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:45.080]   I notice I don't spontaneously breathe at that cadence.
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.660]   I breathe quite a bit faster.
[00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:52.100]   So especially on the exhale.
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.200]   So once I got into a rhythm of it,
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:00.340]   yeah, the mind just goes pseudo random for me.
[00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:01.180]   What about for you?
[00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:02.720]   Does your mind tend to go one place?
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:03.560]   - I do.
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.640]   Now I count.
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.560]   So the reason I knew it was five minutes
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.700]   is because it's six breaths per minute.
[00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:15.640]   And I counted five, one, one, one, two, one, three,
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:19.360]   one, four, one, five, one, six, two, one.
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.360]   So I was occupied with a task.
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.000]   - How often do you do that?
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.600]   - At least once and sometimes twice a day.
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:29.020]   I aim for 10 minutes a day,
[00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:30.880]   but if I get to 20 minutes a day,
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:35.880]   it's noticeable in my heart rate variability results.
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.440]   - Do you do the coherence breathing
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.600]   at a particular times of day
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.120]   or just whenever it occurs to you?
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.680]   - I think it depends on where I am
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.200]   and what else is going on in my life.
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:51.200]   So I had a window of a very specific thing that I was doing.
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:54.320]   I would do coherent breathing and I would do squats,
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:57.680]   just air squats in one location
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.160]   where I didn't have any other equipment.
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:05.160]   And then I found a way where I was doing treading water,
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.160]   which you got to experience with me.
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.960]   I would tread water and then after treading water,
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.400]   I would get out of the pool, sit in the sun
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.960]   and do the coherent breathing.
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:16.140]   (upbeat music)
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:21.060]   (upbeat music)
