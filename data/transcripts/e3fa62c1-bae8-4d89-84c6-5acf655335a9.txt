[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:27.720]   In a previous episode, I talked in passing about how I wanted to do these shorter episodes
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.520]   that I wanted to call "Side Notes."
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:36.280]   These are going to consist of things that just come to my mind, probably current events,
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.280]   etc.
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.120]   That I just want to comment on speedily and that also doesn't require a lengthy episode.
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:50.640]   But my goal is to not comment just merely to comment, but to do so in a way and within
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.880]   a framework that does justice to truth and reality.
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:05.840]   So on this side note, I want to dig into the reality of the inconspicuous servants.
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.560]   So in order to do that correctly, let me read from 1 Corinthians 12, 22-25.
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:20.860]   1 Corinthians 12, 22-25 reading from the Legacy Standard Bible says this, "On the contrary,
[00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:27.180]   how much more is it that the members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary,
[00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:34.920]   and those members of the body which we think as less honorable, on these we bestow more
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.120]   abundant honor, and our less presentable members become much more presentable, whereas our
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.820]   presentable members have no such need.
[00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.960]   But God has so composed the body, giving more abundant honor to that member which lacked,
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.060]   so that there may be no division in the body, but that the members may have the same care
[00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.060]   for one another."
[00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.260]   A couple of things to note here, in verse 22 Paul writes, "How much more is it that
[00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:08.660]   the members of the body which seem to be weaker, not that they actually are, but how much more
[00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.340]   that they seem."
[00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.860]   So the body parts that may seem weaker to us are not weaker objectively.
[00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.860]   That is merely our perception.
[00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.520]   This thought is expanded in the next verse, in verse 23 Paul writes, "That those members
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:30.000]   of the body we think as less honorable, not that they actually are, but that we think
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.160]   as less honorable.
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:39.840]   On these same body parts, we bestow more abundant honor, and our less presentable members become
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.880]   much more presentable."
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.820]   And you know, I could totally attest to the veracity of these statements on an experiential
[00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:48.820]   level.
[00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.540]   So let me explain what I mean by that.
[00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.100]   When I was contemplating becoming an elder, one of the many things that I knew would change
[00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:02.180]   when I became an elder was that I would naturally become more visible.
[00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.340]   Along with that, certain things come with the territory.
[00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.340]   Part of that territory is that people would thank me for various things, and my hidden
[00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.020]   works would become, well, less hidden.
[00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.020]   And don't get me wrong.
[00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.220]   I'm absolutely not scolding people that thank me.
[00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.940]   That would just be weird.
[00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.180]   People thank me to encourage me, and I appreciate that.
[00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:30.940]   However, some of the most rewarding times in my life were those times when I was in
[00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:40.260]   charge of the so-called "less honorable" ministries, the so-called "weaker" ministries.
[00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:48.300]   And it was so rewarding because there was no struggle in my heart as to why I was doing
[00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.420]   what I was doing.
[00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.340]   There was no struggle because people didn't want to do it.
[00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.900]   So for me to do it, there wasn't really a struggle as to why.
[00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.460]   I didn't really need to question my motives, right?
[00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.940]   There was a need, and it was going to be filled.
[00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.260]   Matthew 6, 5-6, although it's talking about prayer, the principle applies here.
[00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:14.260]   Jesus states in Matthew 6, verses 5-6, He says, "And when you pray, you are not to
[00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.340]   be like the hypocrites, for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and on the street
[00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.180]   corners so that they may be seen by men.
[00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.580]   Truly, I say to you, they have their reward in full.
[00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:34.500]   But you, when you pray, go into your inner room, and when you have shut your door, pray
[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.860]   to your Father who is in secret, and your Father who sees what is done in secret will
[00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.500]   reward you."
[00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:49.060]   You know, there are some servant teams that have a long wait list, but there are many
[00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:55.220]   servant teams that we would never even dream of serving, and not because we don't have
[00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:02.300]   the capacity, but because, quite frankly, we see it as beneath us.
[00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:08.980]   To many of us, it is offensive to even suggest we serve in these ministries, but that is
[00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:16.380]   a far, far cry from God's own heart, a far cry from God's own perspective.
[00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:24.540]   1 Samuel 16, 7 states this, "For God does not see as man sees, since man looks at the
[00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:30.340]   outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart."
[00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:36.500]   And if it is indeed the case that we will only serve in certain capacities, what do
[00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:41.260]   you think that states about your actual maturity?
[00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:47.700]   I'm not talking about your own perceived maturity, I'm talking about your actual maturity.
[00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:52.860]   Do you think that God doesn't see your own heart?
[00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:58.820]   So my admonition to all of us who are willing to listen is this, let's seek to have that
[00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:05.620]   perspective, that mindset, that God is the only audience we need to please, that being
[00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:11.620]   in the minority sometimes when you serve doesn't discount the importance of your particular
[00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:18.540]   ministry, that God is a God who sees and rewards, and that alone makes inconspicuous service
[00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:26.220]   all the more necessary, that makes it all the more only what we need.
[00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:31.060]   In Matthew 6, 2, Jesus is talking about secret prayer, but again, the same principle applies
[00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.220]   to secret service to God.
[00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:38.540]   He says this, "Therefore, when you give to the poor, do not sound a trumpet before you
[00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:43.020]   as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may be glorified
[00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:44.020]   by men.
[00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:50.900]   Truly, I say to you, they have their reward in full."
[00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:57.540]   The people who are committed to secret service, knowing God sees, understands this verse in
[00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:01.340]   a way very few of us do.
[00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:04.940]   They know the Lord looks at the heart.
[00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:09.540]   So because of that, no ministry is beneath them.
[00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:14.940]   So to all you inconspicuous servants, I want to say to you, be encouraged.
[00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:19.900]   You know how to persevere when it seems like you're the only one who cares about the ministries
[00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:23.460]   that you're involved in, that constantly need new volunteers.
[00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:28.540]   You understand how to process frustration without belittling everyone else.
[00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:31.340]   You're okay with doing the thankless jobs.
[00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:37.620]   And on the final accounting of all things, your works will vindicate the way you've chosen
[00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:41.060]   to spend your time.
[00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:46.820]   Repeating 1 Corinthians 12, 23 to 24, "And those members of the body, which we think
[00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:54.540]   as less honorable, on these we bestow more abundant honor, and our less presentable members
[00:07:54.540 --> 00:08:00.020]   become much more presentable, whereas our more presentable members have no such need.
[00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:08.820]   For God has composed the body, giving more abundant honor to that member which lacked."
[00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:12.020]   I want to give a shout out to some of the more inconspicuous servants.
[00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:16.500]   And as I give this shout out, I know there are many, many more that I'm missing.
[00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:21.780]   And if that is you, you are genuinely glad that I'm missing you, right?
[00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:28.060]   So with that said, my brother Aaron Go has done just an awesome job in leading logistics.
[00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:32.060]   Martin Mao has been a beast leading cleanup.
[00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:36.100]   Brian Pomona Kim has been a stud with parking.
[00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:37.700]   Now I'm not saying these guys are sinless.
[00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:41.660]   I'm not saying they've reached the pinnacle of sanctification.
[00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:44.920]   And it doesn't mean that if they ever leave these teams, they're somehow falling away
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.500]   or less mature.
[00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.220]   I just want to take some time to recognize them.
[00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:56.620]   As Paul writes, "Bestow more abundant honor."
[00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:58.640]   This is James Hong, and I'm signing off.
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:05.640]   [Music]
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:18.640]   [End]
