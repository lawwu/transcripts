[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.440]   Well, over a dozen email questions have arrived in the inbox from listeners who want to better
[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.180]   understand Jesus's parable in the first half of Luke 16.
[00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.220]   Isn't Jesus celebrating dishonesty?
[00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:17.740]   It seems to be the case.
[00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.780]   Matt in Oklahoma writes in to ask us this question.
[00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:21.780]   Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:27.580]   How do you understand and explain the parable of the dishonest manager in Luke 16, 1-13?
[00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.860]   This one is a real head scratcher for me.
[00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.260]   What does it mean and what are the implications for Christians today?
[00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.580]   Let's put the parable in front of us because my guess is a lot of folks don't know the
[00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.500]   specifics of what he's referring to.
[00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:47.440]   And as I read just a few verses of this parable, be asking the question, now what's the positive
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.740]   lesson Jesus might draw out of sinful behavior?
[00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.740]   Because that's the issue here.
[00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:55.900]   So here's what it says.
[00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.980]   Jesus said to his disciples, "There was a rich man who had a manager," like a steward
[00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:07.780]   who ran his business, "and charges were brought to him that this man," this manager, "was
[00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.860]   wasting his possessions.
[00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.380]   And he called him and said to him, 'What is this I hear about you?
[00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.100]   Turn in the account of your management.
[00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.420]   You can no longer be manager.'"
[00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.660]   In other words, you're fired.
[00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:24.100]   "And the manager said to himself, 'Whoa, what shall I do?
[00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:30.100]   Since my master is taking away my management, I'm not strong enough to dig and I'm ashamed
[00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.940]   to beg.
[00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.620]   So I have decided what to do so that when I am removed from the management, people will
[00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.460]   receive me into their houses.'"
[00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:41.460]   So here's what he does.
[00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.580]   "Summoning his master's debtors one by one, he said to the first one, 'How much do you
[00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:46.580]   owe my master?'
[00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.700]   And he said, 'A hundred measures of oil.'
[00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.060]   And he said, 'Take your bill quickly and write down fifty, not a hundred.'
[00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.460]   Then he said to another, 'How much do you owe my master?'
[00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.500]   He said, 'A hundred measures of wheat.'
[00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.260]   He said, 'Take your bill quickly and write eighty.'
[00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:09.020]   The master," when he found out about this, "the master commended the dishonest manager
[00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.820]   for his shrewdness."
[00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.440]   End of parable.
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.780]   So you see the situation.
[00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:22.100]   A manager's fired, but before he leaves, he negotiates with the creditors of the owner,
[00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:30.220]   the debtors of the owner, to sign new contracts so that they owe the owner less than they
[00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.220]   really do.
[00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.340]   They think that's cool.
[00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:42.300]   And the manager hopes that these debtors will feel obliged to him so that when he's jobless,
[00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.980]   they'll help him out.
[00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:51.580]   So the deceitful manager uses his wits to figure out a way to manipulate money so as
[00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.340]   to secure his future.
[00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.860]   That's the gist.
[00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.740]   We don't know how the story really ends, what happens after this encounter.
[00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:06.300]   We just know that when the master found out how clever this guy was, he said something
[00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.980]   like, 'Well, that's clever.
[00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.060]   That was shrewd.'
[00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.340]   Now what will Jesus fasten on with the parable?
[00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.580]   He makes two comments.
[00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:24.340]   Number one, verse eight, "The sons of this world"—that's the unbelievers, people who
[00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:30.460]   don't follow Jesus—"the sons of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their
[00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.940]   own generation than the sons of light."
[00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.500]   I think the point of saying that is this.
[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:44.540]   It may be true, you poor, benighted Christians who don't know how to be smart in this world's
[00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:45.540]   affairs.
[00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.460]   That may be true, but guess what?
[00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:55.060]   It is utterly insignificant compared to the wisdom I am about to teach you in the next
[00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.380]   verse about how to use money to secure your future, namely your ultimate future, your
[00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:01.940]   eternal future.
[00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.780]   So okay, so maybe you aren't that shrewd when it comes to the stock market, but guess
[00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:07.780]   what?
[00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:08.780]   Who cares?
[00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:09.780]   Who cares?
[00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.540]   You've got a billion years to enjoy your investment.
[00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.580]   These folks, they're going to lose theirs in 80.
[00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:16.580]   And here's what he says.
[00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:22.620]   This is the next, second thing he says, next verse, verse nine, "You think that was shrewd?"
[00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:23.620]   This is my paraphrase.
[00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.060]   "You think that was shrewd?
[00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.060]   Let me tell you what's shrewd."
[00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:34.540]   And here's what he says, "I tell you, make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous
[00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:44.500]   wealth so that when it fails, they may receive you into eternal dwellings."
[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:50.940]   So there are two pointers in that verse to show why this is infinitely more shrewd, infinitely
[00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.020]   more wise than the shrewdness of the deceitful manager.
[00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:01.340]   Number one, the first clue is eternal, the word eternal, that they may receive you into
[00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:02.620]   eternal dwellings.
[00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:08.900]   In other words, Jesus is telling these disciples not just to secure their earthly future.
[00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:09.900]   That's all this guy could do.
[00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.480]   Hopefully they'll, you know, give me a little help when I'm jobless.
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:18.860]   This is Jesus' way of saying, "You need help with your joblessness in eternity, and I'm
[00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:24.700]   telling you how to have a house, a place to live with joy and satisfaction in fellowship
[00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.860]   with God's people forever.
[00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.100]   That's the way to use your money.
[00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.220]   Use your money to secure that."
[00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:32.340]   That's the first clue, eternal.
[00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:38.420]   Here's the second pointer, the little phrase, "When it fails."
[00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:42.820]   In other words, all this so-called shrewdness of the deceitful manager is going to come
[00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:48.300]   to nothing because it's based on wealth that will fail.
[00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:54.740]   So Jesus is saying, "Use money," when he calls it unrighteous mammon or unrighteous
[00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.240]   wealth, he simply means this is part of the unrighteous world in which you live.
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:06.840]   Take hold of it and use it for eternal spiritual purposes, namely to provide security in eternity.
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:07.840]   And what does that mean?
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:08.840]   What does that mean?
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:09.840]   How do you do that?
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:15.600]   How do you use money to secure eternal dwellings with friends?
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:23.240]   And the clue is, when you look at that phrase, "When it fails," it triggers the word "fails"
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.800]   back in Luke 12:33.
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.960]   Here's what that says.
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:34.600]   "Sell your possessions, give to the needy, provide yourselves with money bags that do
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:43.080]   not grow old, where they treasure in the heavens, that does not fail, where no thief approaches
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.840]   and no moth destroys."
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.640]   That's Luke 12:33.
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:57.920]   So making friends with money means using your money to meet people's needs.
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:03.240]   That's the way to lay up treasure in heaven that does not fail.
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:09.280]   Or as Jesus says in Luke 16, "Some of those people will be converted and will go before
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:16.480]   you into heaven and welcome you there with great joy to join them in eternal dwelling."
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.360]   So here's the basic point.
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:27.100]   Don't worry about being a shrewd investor in this age where you can only provide a future
[00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:28.840]   that will fail.
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:33.800]   Instead, be a really shrewd investor.
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:41.600]   Invest in people's lives by using your resources to do as much good as you can for the glory
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:48.560]   of God and the eternal good of others who will go before you and welcome you home.
