[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.680]   In episode 92, we talked about a recent event in the news.
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.840]   NBA star Jason Collins came out and announced that he's gay,
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.240]   becoming the first openly gay professional athlete in American team sports,
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.880]   at least in male sports.
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.800]   And he also claims to be a Christian.
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.520]   That same day, ESPN analyst Chris Broussard responded by saying, quote,
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.000]   if you're openly living in unrepentant sin, whatever it may be,
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.800]   not just homosexuality, I believe that's walking in open rebellion to God and
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.200]   to Jesus Christ, end quote.
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.720]   For this statement, Broussard got called things like unkind, hateful, abusive,
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.200]   a bigot, and intolerant.
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.320]   So here's the follow up question, Pastor John.
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.480]   Is this hostile response to Broussard for calling homosexuality a sin and
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.880]   an offense to God a sign of things to come in the United States?
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.760]   >> It is a sign of things to come, though I want to be very careful not
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:05.760]   to presume that I know the final outcome in this century or the next.
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.640]   Meaning, I do think there is biblical warrant and
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.440]   cultural warrant to expect things to get worse.
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:20.480]   In other words, expect more sin to be flaunted more openly and
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.960]   more biblical truth to be criticized more severely.
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.760]   I think that's very, very likely.
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.920]   But that doesn't say anything about whether God might step in
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:40.040]   at the very darkest hour and pour out his Holy Spirit upon his church and
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.880]   then upon the world through his church and call people to repentance such that
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.520]   a stunning awakening and turning happens.
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.320]   So when I say yes, I think things are going to get worse.
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.200]   I don't hold that long term with any great conviction because I don't know what
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.280]   God's plan is in this age short of the second coming.
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.360]   But it might be helpful for me to give the biblical reason why I think
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.440]   things are going to get worse.
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.960]   It says in Jude 1, you must remember, beloved,
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.040]   the predictions of the apostles of the Lord when they said,
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.520]   in the last time there will be scoffers following their own ungodly passions.
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.720]   Now, I know that we live in the last times already, but
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.080]   they're picturing a significant, it seems,
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.680]   outcropping of scoffing kind of ungodly
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.680]   giving over of yourself to passions near the end of time.
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.400]   Or 2 Timothy, the time is coming when people will not endure sound teaching,
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.280]   but having itching ears, they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.080]   their own passions and will turn away from listening to the truth and
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.560]   wander off into myths.
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.480]   So Paul saw a time coming when that would be worse than it was in his
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.160]   own time, even though it was bad then.
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.400]   Same thing in 2 Thessalonians, that there's a man of lawlessness coming
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.560]   by the activity of Satan with power and false signs and wonders and
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.120]   wicked deception.
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.720]   So I think that the picture in the Bible is that toward the end of this age,
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.040]   things get really bleak.
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.720]   The implication of that is that we shouldn't be surprised.
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.240]   Jesus said, a disciple is not above his teacher,
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.960]   a servant is not above his master.
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.800]   If they have called the master of the house, namely me, Beelzebul,
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.120]   how much more will they malign those of his household?
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.920]   And so Jesus is saying, "Look, don't expect to be treated better than I
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.520]   was treated, and I'm going to be crucified."
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.520]   And that's what Peter says in his epistle is, "Don't think of strange brothers
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.600]   when a fiery ordeal should come upon you."
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:02.240]   So the upshot of this for the church, I think, is that we not become embittered
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:08.120]   or cranky, but that we return good for evil, that we love our enemies,
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.520]   that we boldly proclaim the gospel and make the main thing the main thing,
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.840]   that we expose the darkness.
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.240]   In fact, I'm not sure many people know that Ephesians 5.11 is in the Bible
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:25.760]   because it says, "Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness,
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.560]   but instead expose them."
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:35.200]   And I think the exposure happens not mainly by having a website that is totally
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.800]   negative and just points out problem, problem, problem.
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:43.840]   Mainly, darkness is exposed by light, by contrast.
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:49.640]   And so making the gospel the main thing and heralding the good news of kingdom
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:54.160]   truth and the work of Christ on behalf of sinners and the power of the gospel and the
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:59.920]   power of the Holy Spirit to change people so that we love the world.
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.840]   And that word "love" just brings one more thing to my mind.
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:12.720]   I preached a sermon, what, several weeks ago in which I saw this passage in 2 John
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:19.960]   where he says, "Many deceivers have gone out into the world who do not confess the
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.120]   coming of Christ."
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:28.640]   And he said that was the ground for why the church should love each other more,
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.280]   each other more.
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:38.240]   So he said it like this, "This is love that we walk according to His commandments.
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.120]   This is the commandment, just as you heard from the beginning,
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:46.880]   that you should walk in it, love one another, for," that's the ground,
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.320]   "many deceivers have gone out into the world."
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:55.440]   And I said to the church, "Isn't it remarkable that the more pessimistic you
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:00.600]   feel about the world, the more you should love your brother,
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.000]   the more you should love Christians because there's something about a loving,
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:11.320]   caring, happy body of people that protects them from the infection of the world and
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:16.480]   the bitterness of the world and the anger and immorality of the world?"
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:21.920]   So I think the upshot, Tony, of all this is that we should pray for the coming
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.480]   of the Lord in two senses.
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.400]   The ultimate coming, maranatha, come Lord Jesus.
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.080]   Oh, how we would like this world to be transformed into a beautiful portrayal
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.080]   of Christ.
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:38.440]   But we also mean pray for His powerful in-breaking now.
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:44.040]   Don't give up on your church or your denomination or the city you live in,
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.400]   thinking, "Well, no revival could happen here.
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.800]   No reformation could happen here."
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.480]   How do you know God is sovereign?
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.880]   All things are possible with the Lord.
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.040]   - Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.480]   The sermon mentioned earlier is titled, "Life Together at the End of the Age,"
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:03.040]   and it was preached on February 25th, 2013, and you can find it at
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.880]   desiringgod.org.
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:05.760]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:06.520]   Thanks for listening.
