[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.800]   Hi, here I'm going to explain how to and why to use Overleaf and LaTeX for your scientific
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:15.560]   paper either to contribute to somebody else's paper or to create your own paper.
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:21.680]   So to get started we would go to Overleaf.com and create an account or log in and you'll
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.440]   find yourself with a screen that looks something like this or else if somebody sent you an
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:34.040]   email with a link to access their paper just click on it.
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:41.360]   Once you click on a paper you'll see a screen which looks something like this.
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.420]   To create your own paper from scratch generally I would suggest going to Google and typing
[00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:53.320]   in Overleaf and template and the kind of thing you're creating such as a pre-print and generally
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.940]   that will give you access to their gallery where you can click on the kind of paper you
[00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.860]   want to create and say Open as template.
[00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.040]   So in either case you're going to end up in a screen that looks like this.
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.760]   So this is a different way to creating papers to using something like Microsoft Word which
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.800]   we might be more familiar with and at first it honestly looks a bit terrifying.
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.920]   There's all this code that you see in front of you.
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.360]   And the trick is basically to ignore all that code, this LaTeX code.
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:37.260]   Instead just find the bit where it says begin document and start typing.
[00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:44.200]   So here's a section where it says begin abstract and I can start typing in my abstract.
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.160]   And then you can create sections so these are just chapters and you can start typing
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.080]   in your sections.
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.980]   And then at any point you can see what that's going to look like by clicking on this little
[00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:05.880]   arrow and saying recompile and what that does is it creates a PDF.
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.360]   And so as you can see it's created a nicely formatted paper for us.
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:22.120]   Now basically you don't have to do any formatting really yourself in terms of document formatting.
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.680]   You just type in this is the abstract, these are the sections and so forth and it will
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.860]   automatically format it for you, create your references for you and so forth.
[00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.720]   So this is one of the big benefits of using LaTeX and Overleaf for doing this is that
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.440]   there's just a lot less time and hassle for you to think about.
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.600]   You can just focus on typing your paper.
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.240]   There's two ways you can type your paper.
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:54.320]   One is by typing into this source view which is a bit more scary looking or you can type
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.800]   into the rich text view which is a bit less scary looking.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:07.340]   Generally speaking pretty much everybody I know spends 99% of their time in the source
[00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.340]   view.
[00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:15.560]   In the end they're both places you just type what you want to type.
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.480]   And yeah I would suggest like not looking really at what it looks like too often.
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:29.360]   Just focus on putting your information, your text to your paper in here and then yeah just
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.840]   from time to time you can always scooch over and look at the compiled PDF.
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:41.800]   The only place I tend to sometimes use rich text is if I want to insert one of these things
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.760]   bold, italics, a numbered list or a bullet point list.
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.440]   For example as I've done here let's create our own one.
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:04:04.440]   So here is a bullet list and then you just hit this first, second, okay.
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.720]   And so that's what it looks like in our rich text view.
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:16.040]   If you go to the source view you can see it's used some LaTeX code.
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.980]   So another way of creating things like bullet lists is just to copy and paste something
[00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.640]   that's already there.
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:33.200]   So if we go and have a look at the compiled LaTeX here you can see a bulleted list has
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.320]   been there.
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:43.740]   So the main thing you need to know is yeah just type stuff and it will appear.
[00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:50.640]   The second thing then to know is how to do citations.
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:58.920]   So one of the really nice things about doing citations with LaTeX and Overleaf is that
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:04.680]   you don't have to worry about citation styles or anything like that or keeping your numbers
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.560]   up to date or all of that kind of stuff.
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.580]   That is all done automatically for you.
[00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.200]   So there are two ways to create a citation.
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:20.240]   Basically everything in LaTeX which is a command starts with a backslash and to create a backslash
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.120]   you type backslash site and then there's two ways you can cite.
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:30.840]   You can either cite inside the text of a paragraph that will be site T or in parentheses at the
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:38.960]   end of a sentence that will be site P and in either case you then type open curly brace
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.520]   and you'll have a big long list of your citations here.
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:58.480]   So for example if I click on this one and then if I have a look at my document, here
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.360]   the citation has appeared and you'll see it's appeared here and then if I scroll to the
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:08.960]   end you'll also see it has appeared here.
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:14.640]   So where did all those list of possible things to cite come from?
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.520]   They come from a separate file.
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.360]   There's basically two files you care about.
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:25.240]   The .tech file here is the thing you type into and then the .bib file here is the thing
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.000]   that contains all your citations.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   And here they all are.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.720]   So you can see there's one per line so here's one citation, here's one citation.
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.680]   These are in a format called bibtech.
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.640]   If somebody's already created your bibliography for you, you won't have to worry about creating
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:54.480]   this or you need to know is that in general each citation has a name like this, L1-2020-doctors.
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.600]   Generally speaking if you use the approach I'll describe in a moment, the names of your
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:07.120]   citations will be the first author's surname, then the year of the reference, and then the
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.480]   first word of its title.
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:10.640]   So this is quite handy, right?
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:17.880]   So for example we wanted to cite this thing here, post-acute COVID-19 syndrome from now
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:31.200]   Bandian 2021, then we would just start typing "site" and then we'd start typing now "Bandian"
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:35.000]   and here it is 2021 post.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:46.640]   And so if we have a look at what that's put into our document, there it is, it's added
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:52.600]   to our reference list and you can see here it is in the document itself, now Bandian
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:56.760]   and it creates hyperlinks and all that kind of stuff for you in the PDF so if you click
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:05.480]   here it jumps straight to the reference and so forth so that's all pretty handy.
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:09.440]   So why would you use site P versus site T?
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:14.740]   Well the reason why is that, here's an example of site T, site T is something that you would
[00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:17.880]   use in the body of your text.
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:26.280]   So for example, half of our et al. 2021 estimated the full impact etc. so that's site T because
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:31.320]   it's in the text and so it's the format it creates is to show the name and then the year
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:36.200]   and then so you can put this straight in the text like this as opposed to site P which
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:40.700]   puts it in parentheses, that would go at the end of a sentence like this, continue the
[00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:46.160]   vaccination rollout to 90% throughout the year, brackets and there's a citation and
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:51.440]   notice you can put more than one reference with a comma between, you can put as many
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:56.240]   as you like so that's why you see each one here and again I could click on it and it
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:01.000]   would jump straight to that reference.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:10.720]   Okay, so here's, actually if you look here I've got the two citation styles in a list
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.520]   so we can take a look at what they look like.
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:19.480]   So here are the two citation styles, that's the site T style and that's the site P style
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:23.680]   and things like exactly what kind of parentheses or brackets are used and stuff like that will
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:29.360]   depend on what template you've selected and that's very easy to change later so you can
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:35.000]   just up replace the template at any time and your whole document will be updated for that
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   template.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   So if you change which journal you're submitting to, you just stick it into a new template
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.920]   and away you go.
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:50.640]   Okay, so finally how do you add stuff to the bibliography that's not already there, just
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:55.320]   add stuff to the bibliography that's not already there, my strong suggestion is to use Google
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:10:02.680]   Scholar. So Google Scholar is at scholar.google.com, the first thing you should do is click on
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:10.440]   these little lines and click settings and turn on the thing that says show links to
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:13.360]   import citations into bibtech.
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:20.800]   Okay, and so now that we've done that we can search for a paper so let's say I want a paper
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:27.040]   about clams. So I would go like so, let's say yes giant clams that's the paper I want.
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:34.440]   So if I want to add this to my bibliography, I just click import into bibtech, I'm not
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:45.560]   a robot, and then select that copy and we go back to bibliography and paste it at the
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:54.200]   end, like so. And as you can see, it's used that approach I described, surname, year,
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:11:02.120]   first word of the title. So if I now want to insert that into my text, I could say for
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:15.960]   example site in the text, what's his name, Yong, wrote about giant clams. There we go.
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:28.440]   And so if you want to see what that's going to look like, recompile. And here it is, Yong
[00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:37.920]   wrote about giant clams and I can click it and I can see, yep, here it is in my reference
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:46.640]   section. Okay, so that's basically it. Then finally if you want to download the compiled
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:55.120]   version of your paper, you can go menu, download PDF, or to submit it as LaTeX, you can download
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:12:00.800]   source and then you could submit it from there. Oh, and then I guess the other useful thing
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:07.520]   to show you is how to work collaboratively. So you can click the share button to share
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:12.880]   the paper with your collaborators and you can all edit it at the same time. You'll see
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:20.440]   each other's edits. And then to add comments or to track changes, just click review. And
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:31.440]   I'll say track changes is on for everybody. And so now if I start typing, it focuses on
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:39.820]   the Great Barrier Reef. And you'll see here, it shows that I added, it focuses on the Great
[00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:45.040]   Barrier Reef. And so other people will see Jeremy Howard added this. And so then anybody
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:50.920]   can click accept or reject. And then the other thing I could do is I could double click on
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:13:02.240]   a word, for example, and say add comment. What about oysters? And then other people could
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:14.440]   reply to that and so forth. Okay. So then I can go resolve, I could go reject, turn off
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:22.880]   change tracking. And so this review button just shows the review appears and disappears.
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:28.320]   And if you click overview, it will show you all of the changes and you can go through
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:34.200]   and check all of them out. Great, I think that's about everything I wanted to show. So hopefully
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:40.620]   this helps you get started with using LaTeX and Overleaf. And you find this a good way
[00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:47.320]   to write papers. Personally, I found it really saved me a lot of time. So hopefully it helps
