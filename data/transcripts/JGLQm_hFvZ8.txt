[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.320]   All right.
[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:06.320]   Let's keep rolling here.
[00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:10.800]   We got a question from Pythicus.
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.600]   Pythicus says, is it rational to quit your job
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.520]   if it implies a potential harm to society?
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.960]   And some pretty hairy details here.
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.800]   This is actually a structural engineer.
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.440]   Let me see here.
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.760]   Or whatever.
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.000]   He's working-- he's supervising a project
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.520]   on building apartment towers.
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.720]   And he thinks there's a problem, a design flaw,
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.840]   in the towers that under very rare circumstances
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.920]   could be catastrophic.
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.360]   And he's being ignored within his company
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.000]   when he brings this up.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.560]   All right.
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.720]   So let me give you a general and a specific response
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.560]   to this issue.
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.000]   In general, in my book, So Good They Can't Ignore You,
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.440]   I talk about disqualifiers for a job, things
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.840]   that if they are true is a perfectly valid reason to say,
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.080]   I'm going to go to a new job.
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.400]   And the reason why I have those disqualifiers in the book
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.120]   is that a big idea in that book is
[00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.240]   that we're too quick to switch jobs and to quit.
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.960]   We care too much about, does this job match my passion?
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.120]   Do I love the work every day?
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.160]   And it's an unrealistic and naive view
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.480]   of how people actually craft real meaning in their work.
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.840]   And so the book, in general, discourages very quick job
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.360]   switching.
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.920]   But I was like, look, there's some clear disqualifiers.
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:34.920]   That means you got to get out of there.
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.300]   And one of those disqualifiers is
[00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.000]   that the work actively goes against your values.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Do not stay in a job if it is actually
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.920]   corroding your own values.
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.560]   If you think there is something that's
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.480]   happening that's illegal, for sure get out of there.
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.360]   If you think there's something that happens
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.480]   that's perfectly legal but is bad for society,
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.360]   you got to get out of there.
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.320]   Because that will corrode at your soul
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.880]   if you're doing work that goes against what
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.000]   you think is important.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.320]   Now let's get really specific here.
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.720]   Formally registering your complaint all the way up
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.720]   the ladder at the company you really need to do,
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.560]   this is important.
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.280]   If that's not working to formally register
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.720]   that complaint outside the company,
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.080]   you're probably ethically obligated to do that as well.
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.840]   Basically some whistleblowing behavior.
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.120]   Now I get the hesitation because you're not quite sure
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.640]   that this is an issue.
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.120]   You're actually not the head engineer,
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.680]   but you see this could be an issue
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.000]   and you think they're not paying enough attention to it.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.720]   There's probably an ethical obligation here
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.160]   to make sure that the right people who do not
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.040]   have conflicts of interest have all the information you've
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.360]   given them.
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.320]   And if even after all of that, people are like,
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.280]   I think it's fine, then maybe this issue is not
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.360]   what you think it is.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.120]   But you do, I think in your specific case,
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.440]   have an obligation to not just think about whether or not
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.960]   you want to leave this company, but make sure that this issue
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.880]   is something that the right people have seen.
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.640]   So that's not the easiest thing, Pythicus,
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.080]   but do the hard thing here.
