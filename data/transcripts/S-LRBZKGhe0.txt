[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   (Music)
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:11.880]   God's glory is a big deal in scripture and that makes it a big deal to us here at Desiring God and over the years
[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.100]   here are just a few ways Pastor John has described the importance of the glory of God. He said things like this,
[00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:27.600]   "The vindication of God's glory is the ground of our salvation and the exaltation of God's glory is the goal of our salvation."
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.800]   In another place he said this, "God's glory is the goal of all things."
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.560]   In another place he said this, "God's glory is the unifying goal of all history."
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:44.400]   In another place he said, "God's glory is the source and sum of all full and lasting joy."
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:50.520]   And on and on. These are strong words, but what exactly is God's glory? What do we mean by that?
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:57.320]   It's a question Pastor John sought to answer in his sermon, "To Him be glory forevermore," preached on December 17th,
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.160]   2006. Here's a clip of what he said.
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:07.760]   Defining the glory of God is is impossible, I say, because it's more like the word
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.560]   "beauty" than the word
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.200]   "basketball."
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.840]   So if somebody says they've never heard of a basketball,
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.640]   they don't know what a basketball is and they say define a basketball,
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.640]   that would not be hard for you to do. You would use your hands and you'd say, "Well,
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.200]   it's like a round thing made out of leather or rubber and
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.320]   about 10 or 9 inches in diameter." And you blow it up, you inflate it
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.600]   so it's pretty hard, and then you can bounce it like this and you can throw it to people and
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.800]   you can run while you're bouncing it. And then there's this hoop at the end,
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.400]   used to be called, used to be a basket, and you try to throw the ball through the hoop.
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.280]   And that's why it's called a basket ball. And they'd have a really good idea.
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.200]   They'd be able to spot one, tell it from a soccer ball or a football.
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.960]   You can't do that with the word "beauty."
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.040]   There are some words in our vocabulary
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:11.040]   which we can communicate with, not because we can say them, but because we see them.
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:17.480]   And that's it. We can point. We can point. And if we point at enough things and see enough things together, say, "That's it.
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.000]   That's it. That's it." We might be able to have a common sense of beauty,
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.360]   but you try to put beauty, the word "beauty," into words, it'd be very, very difficult.
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.960]   Same thing with the word "glory." So how shall I do it? We've got to try, because we just can't
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.720]   leave it for people to fill up on their own.
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.000]   So here's the way I'm going to try to do it. I'm going to take it and
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.720]   contrast it biblically with the word "holy" and
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.480]   ask,
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:55.000]   "What's the difference between the holiness of God and the glory of God?" And in doing that, I think we'll get a little handle on
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.280]   the nature of
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.320]   this term, "the glory of God."
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:05.440]   So that's the way I'm going to try to do it. In the holiness of God is, I think,
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.280]   His
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.600]   being in a class by Himself in His perfection and
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:19.120]   greatness and worth. His perfection and His greatness and His worth are of such a
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.760]   distinct and separated - you've been taught that
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:29.000]   "holy" means separate - distinct and separated that He's in a class by Himself.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.960]   Infinite perfections,
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.040]   infinite greatness, and infinite worth.
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.880]   His holiness is what He is as God that nobody else is.
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.120]   It's His
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.120]   quality of perfection
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.400]   that can't be improved upon, that can't be imitated, that is
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.960]   incomparable, that determines all that He is and is determined by nothing from outside
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.960]   Him. It signifies His
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.280]   infinite worth, His intrinsic,
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.160]   infinite
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.160]   value.
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.440]   Now,
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.440]   when Isaiah
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.960]   6 3 says that angels are crying,
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.320]   "Holy,
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.800]   holy,
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.800]   holy is the Lord God Almighty,"
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.480]   the next thing they say is this,
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:32.200]   "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty. The whole earth is full of His," and you might have expected them to say,
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:38.280]   "Holiness!" And He doesn't say holiness. He says glory.
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:48.120]   "Intrinsically holy, intrinsically holy, intrinsically holy, and the whole earth is full of His
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.680]   glory."
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.680]   From which I
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:58.200]   stab at a definition by saying the glory of God is the
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:04.680]   manifest beauty of His holiness. It's the going public of His holiness.
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:10.560]   It's the way He puts His holiness on display for people to apprehend.
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.560]   So,
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.960]   the glory of God is the holiness of God made
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.560]   manifest. Listen to this word from Leviticus 10 3.
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:27.240]   God says, "I will be shown to be holy
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.600]   among those who are near me, and
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:37.160]   before all the people I will be glorified. I will be shown
[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.200]   to be
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.720]   holy. And
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.840]   among all the people," say it another way, "I will be
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:54.200]   glorified." So to see, to apprehend, and to reckon with His holiness and in some sense
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:59.200]   perceive it is to see glory. And thus to
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.440]   glorify Him. So here's an attempt at a definition.
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.800]   The glory of God is the
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.520]   infinite beauty and
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.160]   greatness of
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.160]   God's manifold
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:20.640]   perfections. The infinite beauty, and I'm focusing on the the manifestation of
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:24.840]   His character and His worth and His
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:29.120]   attributes, all of His perfections and greatness are
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:37.600]   beautiful as they are seen, and there are many of them. That's why I use the word manifold.
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:43.920]   So here it is in another sentence. The glory of God is the infinite beauty and greatness of
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.680]   His manifold
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.800]   perfections.
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.200]   In the same sermon, Pastor John went on to conclude like this.
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.560]   The heavens are telling the glory of God.
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:00.760]   Psalm 19.1. What does that mean? It means He's shouting at us.
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:08.480]   He shouts with clouds. He shouts with blue expanse. He shouts with gold on the horizons.
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:13.040]   He shouts with galaxies and stars. He's shouting, "I
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.000]   am
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.360]   glorious.
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:21.280]   Open your eyes. It's like this, only better if you know me." And
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.840]   the Bible says,
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.000]   "Holy,
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.320]   holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty.
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:35.800]   The whole earth is full of His glory." If you had eyes to see in this room,
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.720]   you would see the glory of God
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.800]   everywhere.
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.240]   We need eyes.
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.240]   We need eyes more than we need anything.
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:49.640]   The God of this world has blinded the minds of unbelievers to keep them from seeing the light of the knowledge of the
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:52.000]   glory of
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.160]   Christ in the gospel.
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.480]   So I ask,
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:00.760]   do you see it? Do you love it? You were made for this.
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:04.560]   Deep down in your heart, if you're a
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:11.440]   totally disinterested person sitting there tonight, you're just eager for the service to be over, there will come a day,
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.440]   I hope tonight,
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:14.960]   when
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:21.360]   enough of the crust is scraped off that you will say, "I'm made for this.
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:24.880]   This is why I exist to see that.
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:31.400]   Everything is pointing to that. All the glory that I thought was so attractive is going there.
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.440]   This is all husks and ashes.
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:38.080]   He was right. The Bible was right. Jesus was right."
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:42.080]   I hope it will not be too late when that happens for you.
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:50.600]   That clip was taken from John Piper's sermon, "To Him be Glory Forevermore," preached on December 17th, 2006.
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:55.160]   You can find that entire sermon at Zerringod.org. And speaking of God's glory,
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:09:02.440]   it reminds me of an episode of this podcast we recorded titled, "Natural Disasters and Pastoral Ministry," episode number 113.
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:09.080]   I asked Pastor John why he chooses to tweet and blog in the midst of destructive natural disasters like tornadoes and hurricanes, and
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:16.160]   there he talks about pastoring a church into the glory of God. Check it out in the podcast archive. That was episode number 113.
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:23.960]   Another interesting episode on God's glory is titled, "Is God a Needy Vacuum Trying to Suck Praise Out of Us?" That was episode number 293.
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:27.960]   There, Pastor John addresses some public criticism head-on.
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:34.440]   Specifically, if God is glory-centered, does this create a sort of self-glorifying black hole in New Calvinism?
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:39.480]   Thanks for listening to this podcast. I'm your host Tony Reinke, and we will be back tomorrow.
