[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.240]   Well, in our local churches, we believe God raises up a few qualified men to lead.
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:16.400]   Not all men in a church are called to pastor, just a few men, but only males serve as elders,
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.360]   according to the blueprints we find in the pastoral epistles in the New Testament.
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.520]   So then, it leads to a question today about the role of women teaching pastors in seminaries.
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.880]   Scott, a podcast listener, writes in to ask it, "Dear Pastor John, I am a seminary student
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.000]   at an Orthodox but interdenominational school in the United States.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.800]   I share your complimentary understanding of God's design for male and female roles and
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.000]   relationships in the home and in the church.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.300]   On that basis, I have recently doubted whether or not my seminary ought to allow women to
[00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.200]   teach pastors in training.
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.200]   What do you think?
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.480]   Should women be hired as seminary professors? What is your best case?"
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:04.920]   So I am going to answer this question as best I can on the assumption that the Bible teaches
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:16.400]   that churches should be led by a team of spiritual, humble, biblically qualified men—see, especially
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.120]   1 Timothy 2.12.
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:30.000]   In other words, I'm going to base my argument about the seminary on the assumption of complementarianism,
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.880]   which I think is not merely an assumption but a well-founded, historic understanding
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.280]   of Scripture.
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.920]   Probably the best defense of that position still with regard to women teaching and preaching
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.880]   in the church would be Tom Schreiner and Andreas Kastenberger's Women in the Church.
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:03.160]   So just to be clear, the issue is not whether women attend seminary in one of its programs
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.880]   and get the best biblical grounding possible in Scripture.
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:16.620]   The issue is whether women should be models, mentors, and teachers for those preparing
[00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.800]   for a role that is biblically designed for spiritual men.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.760]   That's the way I'm posing the question.
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.600]   And you can hear in that sentence another assumption about the nature of what I think
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:37.240]   seminary teaching should be—namely, not just the transfer of information.
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.720]   Machines can do that.
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:48.020]   But the formation of a man for the pastoral role by those who in their teaching embody
[00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:54.300]   that role and model that role and inspire for that role through their active involvement
[00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.100]   as elder qualified men in the church.
[00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:03.380]   That's my belief about what makes for the best seminary teaching.
[00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:09.220]   When a student with a pastoral call arrives at the level of seminary preparation, something
[00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:16.820]   is different from what was happening in college education and in high school education, at
[00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.020]   least usually it is.
[00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:24.820]   Not only has he moved beyond the adolescent years of transition from boyhood to manhood,
[00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:33.460]   but he's now submitting himself to a community of teachers who, by their precept and example,
[00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:43.000]   are called to shape his mind and his heart for vocational pastoral ministry.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.740]   One difference between the former influences that shape the youth and the influence of
[00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:57.020]   the seminary is that seminary education is woven throughout with the vocational pastoral
[00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.020]   viewpoint.
[00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:05.500]   Everything is studied, or I think should be studied, with a view to how it may edify the
[00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:11.420]   church and advance the gospel through the pastoral role in the ministry of the church.
[00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:18.100]   Samuel Miller, one of the founders of Princeton Seminary, said, "A professor's example
[00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:26.060]   as a devoted, laborious, faithful minister was above all else a requisite for his successful
[00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.900]   training of ministers."
[00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:36.380]   Now this implies that seminary teachers be more than competent historians, competent
[00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:43.060]   linguists, competent exegetes or educators or theologians.
[00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:51.060]   The proper demand on the seminary teacher is to be an example, a mentor, a guide, an
[00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:57.620]   embodiment of the pastoral office in preparing men to fill the pastoral office.
[00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:03.220]   And therefore, the attempt—this happens, I've documented this, in fact I'm drawing
[00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:09.220]   a lot of what I'm saying from a paper that I wrote back in 1995 about women teaching
[00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:19.100]   in our own seminary in my denomination—the attempt to distinguish the seminary teaching
[00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:28.060]   role from the pastoral teaching role in such a way that biblical restriction to men does
[00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:35.420]   not apply to the seminary teaching results in a serious inconsistency.
[00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:36.540]   That's my argument.
[00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.540]   The inconsistency is this.
[00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:48.320]   The more one succeeds in distinguishing the seminary teacher from the pastor teacher,
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:56.260]   the more one fails to provide the kind of seminary education enriched by the modeling
[00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.320]   of experienced pastor mentors.
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:07.280]   In other words, in seeking to justify women teacher mentors for aspiring pastors, one
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:16.440]   will be hard put to stress that they're not in the same category as pastors and thus,
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.000]   as we believe, out of step with Scriptures.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.340]   Or let me put it another way, in the form of a question.
[00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:32.240]   If it is unbiblical to have women as pastors, how can it be biblical to have women who function
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:39.840]   in formal teaching and mentoring capacities to train and fit pastors for the very calling
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.000]   from which the mentors themselves are excluded?
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   I don't think that works.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.360]   The issue is always that inconsistency.
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:56.960]   If you strive to carve up teaching in such a way that it's suitable for women, it ceases
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:01.260]   to be suitable as seminary teaching.
[00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:09.240]   So closing word, the issue as always is not competence of women teachers or intelligence
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:12.040]   or knowledge or pedagogical skill.
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.460]   It's never competence.
[00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.160]   It's not the issue in the home, in leadership.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.860]   It's not the issue in the church, in leadership.
[00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:20.300]   It's not the issue in the seminary, in leadership.
[00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:28.100]   The issue here at the seminary level is very largely the nature of the seminary teaching
[00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.240]   office.
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.000]   What do we aim for it to be?
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:39.960]   Is it conceived as example and model and embodiment of pastoral vision or not?
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:44.440]   That will lead us in how we staff our seminary faculty.
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.840]   This is all very interesting.
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.000]   Thank you for the question, Scott.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.920]   Thank you for addressing this, Pastor John.
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:53.280]   And thank you to everyone who's listening.
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.880]   This is not just an issue for leaders.
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:08:02.240]   This is an issue that really gets at the heart of how roles work in the home and in the church
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.300]   and starting to think through some of the real practical implications of what it means
[00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:06.300]   to be complimentary.
[00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.400]   And thank you guys for raising the question.
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.860]   Thank you, Pastor John, again for addressing it here.
[00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:13.020]   Thanks for listening and making the podcast part of your week.

[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.600]   question you may have about gender and roles in the home and church, something that you
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:23.600]   want clarified.
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:29.240]   You can do all that through our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:32.800]   Well speaking of controversial questions, next time we have another one.
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:37.340]   We hear from a podcast listener who wants to know if it's fair for God to base a soul's
[00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:43.380]   eternal destiny on merely one lifespan, say 70 years of life.
[00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:48.140]   Is it even fair or is it unfair to draw out eternal consequences for such a brief span
[00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:49.140]   of time?
[00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:52.020]   I'll ask John Piper that on Wednesday when we return.
[00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:53.020]   I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:54.300]   Thanks for listening and we'll see you then.
