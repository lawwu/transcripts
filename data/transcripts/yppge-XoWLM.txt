[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.340]   - What is quantum mechanics?
[00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:07.820]   - Quantum mechanics is the paradigm of physics
[00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:10.260]   that came into being in the early part of the 20th century
[00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.100]   that replaced classical mechanics.
[00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.160]   And it replaced classical mechanics in a weird way
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.820]   that we're still coming to terms with.
[00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.540]   So in classical mechanics, you have an object,
[00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.940]   it has a location, it has a velocity,
[00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.340]   and if you know the location and velocity
[00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.180]   of everything in the world,
[00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.600]   you can say what everything's gonna do.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.840]   Quantum mechanics has an aspect of it
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.080]   that is kind of on the same lines.
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.640]   There's something called the quantum state
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.440]   or the wave function.
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.280]   And there's an equation governing
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.600]   what the quantum state does.
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.440]   So it's very much like classical mechanics.
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.080]   The wave function is different.
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.360]   It's sort of a wave.
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.400]   It's a vector in a huge dimensional vector space
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.780]   rather than a position and a velocity,
[00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.440]   but okay, that's a detail.
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.120]   And the equation is the Schrodinger equation,
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.080]   not Newton's laws, but okay, again, a detail.
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.840]   Where quantum mechanics really becomes weird and different
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.400]   is that there's a whole nother set of rules
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.760]   in our textbook formulation of quantum mechanics
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.280]   in addition to saying that there's a quantum state
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.480]   and it evolves in time.
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.880]   And all these new rules have to do with what happens
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.240]   when you look at the system,
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.520]   when you observe it, when you measure it.
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.000]   In classical mechanics, there were no rules
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.880]   about observing.
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.720]   You just look at it and you see what's going on.
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:18.960]   That was it, right?
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.200]   In quantum mechanics, the way we teach it,
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.200]   there's something profoundly fundamental
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.600]   about the act of measurement or observation
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.560]   and the system dramatically changes its state.
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.320]   Even though it has a wave function,
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.360]   like the electron in an atom is not orbiting in a circle,
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.840]   it's sort of spread out in a cloud.
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.840]   When you look at it, you don't see that cloud.
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:39.880]   When you look at it,
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.220]   it looks like a particle with a location.
[00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.040]   So it dramatically changes its state right away.
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.640]   And the effects of that change can be instantly seen
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.440]   in what the electron does next.
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.540]   So that's the, again, we need to be careful
[00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.040]   because we don't agree on what quantum mechanics says.
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.280]   So that's why I need to say like in the textbook view,
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.120]   et cetera, right?
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.560]   But in the textbook view,
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.960]   quantum mechanics, unlike any other theory of physics,
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.080]   places, gives a fundamental role to the act of measurement.
