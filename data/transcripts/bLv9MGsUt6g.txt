[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280]   First principles is kind of a physics way of looking at the world.
[00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:08.560]   You boil things down to the most fundamental truths and say, "Okay, what are we sure is
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:09.820]   true?"
[00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:11.840]   And then reason up from there.
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.520]   Somebody could say, in fact people do, that battery packs are really expensive and that's
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.520]   just the way they'll always be because that's the way they've been in the past.
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.520]   No, that's pretty dumb.
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:28.120]   If you apply that reasoning to anything new, you wouldn't be able to ever get to that new
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.120]   thing.
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.920]   So first principles would be to say, "Okay, what are the material constituents of the
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:32.920]   batteries?
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.040]   What is the spot market value of the material constituents?"
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.400]   So you can say, "Okay, it's got cobalt, nickel, aluminum, carbon, and some polymers for separation
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.560]   and a steel can.
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.160]   If we bought that in London Metal Exchange, what would each of those things cost?"
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.880]   Like, "Oh, it's like $80 per kilowatt hour."
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:53.160]   So clearly you just need to think of clever ways to take those materials and combine them
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.240]   into the shape of a battery cell and you can have batteries that are much, much cheaper
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.880]   than anyone realizes.
