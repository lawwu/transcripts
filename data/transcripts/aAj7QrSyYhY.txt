[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.800]   - Welcome back to this new week on the podcast.
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.400]   Well, the Bible says Christians have been saved in the past.
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.440]   We have been saved.
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.580]   And it says we will be saved in the future.
[00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.500]   And it says we are being saved right now, being saved.
[00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.880]   We're gonna look at that last one, the present tense one,
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.440]   today in a question from a listener named Jessica.
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.000]   Hello, Pastor John, thank you for answering
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.560]   so many questions on this podcast.
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.700]   Here's mine.
[00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.820]   I recently read 1 Corinthians 1:18 with new eyes.
[00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.920]   I noticed that the word saved in my King James version
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.400]   is translated as being saved
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.540]   in many other modern translations.
[00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.100]   I've heard this explained by teachers
[00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.420]   with the following rationale for being saved.
[00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.320]   Number one, we were eternally saved
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.360]   from judgment of our sin,
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.560]   as Jesus paid it all on the cross, past tense.
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.760]   Number two, we are presently being saved
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.360]   from behaving sinfully by walking in the spirit.
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.300]   And number three, we will be saved
[00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.600]   from a world filled with sin
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.000]   after our life on earth is over
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.760]   and we are given our glorified bodies.
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.520]   The church mainly addresses the fact
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.300]   that we have been saved, past tense.
[00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.200]   But can you explain to me the second one
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.200]   in 1 Corinthians 1:18 that we are being saved right now?
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.960]   - Let's nail down past salvation and future salvation
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.920]   and then focus on what the Bible means
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.040]   by our being saved in between those two acts of salvation.
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.700]   But let's be clear from the beginning
[00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.700]   that all three stages of salvation were secured,
[00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:52.560]   purchased by the decisive act of God in Christ on the cross.
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.520]   All three, not just the past.
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.800]   Now here's the utterly glorious foundation
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.480]   for that statement, Romans 8:32.
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.240]   Maybe my favorite verse in the Bible.
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.240]   "He who did not spare his own son,
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.680]   "but gave him up for us all," now that's the cross.
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.240]   "How will he not also with him
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.440]   "graciously give us all things?"
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.160]   Now here's the meaning.
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.160]   Because of the cross, every aspect of salvation
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.600]   will most certainly come to God's people,
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.180]   past, present, future.
[00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.560]   So whether past, present, or future,
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.880]   we are not talking about three different foundations
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.000]   of salvation, but the different applications
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.840]   of the one achieved foundation, Jesus Christ,
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.080]   crucified for sinners.
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.120]   So first, past salvation.
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.120]   Ephesians 2, 8, "By grace you have been saved,
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.240]   "through faith."
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.520]   This is not your own doing.
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.260]   "It is the gift of God, not a result of works,
[00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.220]   "so that no one may boast,
[00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.440]   "for we are his workmanship created," that's past,
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.720]   created, your new creation.
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:15.960]   You were created.
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.120]   That was a point in time at the new birth.
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.320]   Created in Christ Jesus for good works,
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.960]   that's ongoing, which God prepared before him
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.160]   that we should walk in them.
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.760]   So the decisive work is done the moment we believed
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.120]   we were united to Christ, we're justified in him,
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.160]   we're forgiven, adopted, we became new creatures,
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.640]   and we're once for all saved, to the uttermost,
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.520]   as Hebrews 7, 25 says.
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.680]   Now that past salvation, Paul says,
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.680]   is the absolute guarantee of our future salvation.
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:00.960]   And usually that future salvation is spoken of as a rescue
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.920]   from the future wrath of God.
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.920]   So here's Romans 5, 9.
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.920]   "Since therefore we have been justified by his blood,"
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.580]   that's past, and that's the guarantee of what?
[00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.480]   "Much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of God.
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:26.040]   For if while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God,"
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:31.000]   past, "by the death of his Son, much more,
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.720]   now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved by his life?"
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.920]   And there are numerous other texts that speak in that way.
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.120]   1 Thessalonians 5, 9, and 10, Romans 13, 11,
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.120]   2 Timothy 4, 18, 1 Thessalonians 1, 10, Hebrews 9, 28.
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:53.660]   Now, what about the words, "are being saved,"
[00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.140]   in 1 Corinthians 1, 18?
[00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:58.020]   That's what Jessica is asking about.
[00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.900]   "The word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing,
[00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.900]   but to those who are being saved, it is the power of God."
[00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.920]   Same wording in Acts 2, 47,
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.100]   "The Lord added to their number day by day,
[00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.840]   those who were being saved."
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.540]   Same thing in 2 Corinthians 2, 15,
[00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.720]   "We are the aroma of Christ to God
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.200]   among those who are being saved."
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:32.200]   So in what sense is God saving us now
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:37.620]   between the past salvation of the new birth,
[00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.320]   and redemption, and justification,
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.040]   and forgiveness of sins, and adoption,
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.160]   which are all fixed, and firm, and unchangeable,
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.900]   and the future salvation of deliverance
[00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:52.400]   from the wrath of God in judgment,
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:57.140]   and the, as she said, complete eradication of sin,
[00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:58.860]   and the transformation of our bodies
[00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.120]   into glorious bodies like Christ?
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.600]   What is God doing now
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.660]   that qualifies as part of this salvation?
[00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:12.200]   And I think the key verse that launches us
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.200]   into our right understanding of this
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.040]   is 2 Thessalonians 2, verse 13.
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:23.660]   "God chose you as the first fruits
[00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:28.660]   to be saved through sanctification by the Spirit
[00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:32.440]   and belief in the truth."
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:37.440]   Saved through sanctification by the Spirit.
[00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.200]   That is what God is doing now.
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:46.200]   He is sanctifying us, and that is salvation.
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:51.680]   A necessary part of salvation for three reasons.
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.880]   One, it says right here in this text,
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.160]   we are saved through sanctification.
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.200]   Sanctification is the work of God
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:05.040]   through which we make it to find our salvation.
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:09.540]   Number two, Hebrews 12, 14 says there's a holiness,
[00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:14.540]   a sanctification, without which we will not see the Lord.
[00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:18.140]   So God is at work saving us now
[00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:21.640]   by seeing to it that we attain the holiness
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.860]   without which we won't see the Lord.
[00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:28.580]   And number three, 2 Peter 1, 10 says,
[00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.620]   "Therefore, brothers, be all the more diligent
[00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:36.300]   to confirm your calling and election,
[00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.220]   for if you practice these things,"
[00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:41.180]   that is, if you're sanctified, as Paul said,
[00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:43.800]   "you'll never fail, you'll never fall."
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:48.800]   So I conclude that Christians are being saved now by God
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:54.500]   in that he is sanctifying us
[00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:59.500]   as the necessary confirmation of our election
[00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:02.100]   through lives of sanctification.
[00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:05.840]   God is doing that saving work in two senses.
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:09.740]   Number one, he's keeping us back
[00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:12.820]   from soul-destroying patterns of sin.
[00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:15.780]   As it says in 1 Corinthians 10, 13,
[00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:20.780]   no test, no temptation will overcome us to destroy us.
[00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:26.700]   Or Jude 24, he will keep us from stumbling
[00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:28.940]   and present us blameless to God.
[00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:32.700]   And number two, the other sense
[00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:37.420]   in which God is doing that sanctifying work,
[00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:40.620]   that saving work, is by causing us
[00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:44.200]   to positively walk in paths of righteousness.
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:48.500]   As Hebrews 13, 21 says, "He is working in us
[00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.500]   that which is pleasing in his sight."
[00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:56.980]   Now, if we ask how God is saving us
[00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:00.580]   in this sanctifying way,
[00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:02.660]   the answer given over and over
[00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:07.420]   is by the word of God, by the gospel.
[00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:12.420]   So Jesus prayed, "Father, sanctify them in the truth.
[00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:14.220]   Your word is truth."
[00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:18.300]   So God sanctifies by the truth.
[00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:22.200]   Paul said in 1 Corinthians 15, 1 and 2,
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:25.980]   "I would remind you, brothers, of the gospel
[00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:31.820]   I preach to you, which you received, in which you stand,
[00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:36.060]   and by which you are being saved,
[00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:40.020]   if you hold fast to the word I preach to you."
[00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:45.020]   In other words, the words of God, the gospel,
[00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:51.300]   God uses to, in an ongoing, present, saving,
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:55.680]   sanctifying work in believers,
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:00.080]   keep us, hold us, save us by the gospel,
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.400]   by trusting the promises of the gospel.
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:06.400]   Day by day, the power of sin is broken,
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:09.180]   and we walk in the freedom of holiness.
[00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:12.240]   James puts it like this, James 1, 21.
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:16.540]   He says to Christians, "Receive with meekness
[00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:21.540]   the implanted word which is able to save your soul."
[00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:27.260]   So daily welcoming, receiving, daily embracing
[00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:31.820]   of the word of God is the ongoing way
[00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:35.980]   that God keeps us from destruction and saves us.
[00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:39.380]   Peter puts it like this in 1 Peter 2, 2.
[00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:42.220]   After saying that we are born again
[00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:44.700]   by the living and abiding word of God,
[00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:49.700]   he says to new Christians, "Like newborn infants,
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:53.980]   long for the pure spiritual milk."
[00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:56.300]   I take that to be the word.
[00:10:56.300 --> 00:11:01.300]   "That by it, you may grow up into salvation."
[00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:06.660]   We grow into final salvation by living on the word of God.
[00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:12.940]   That's how the gospel goes on saving.
[00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:15.620]   Which leaves us now with one final question.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.820]   Can we count on God's present saving work
[00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:26.680]   to be as infallible and as sure as our past salvation is?
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:32.900]   The past seems so firm, so fixed, so finished,
[00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:35.740]   it's wonderful to dwell on the past thought.
[00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:37.500]   I am justified.
[00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.580]   The past can't be changed,
[00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:43.620]   but what about the present ongoing work of God
[00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.580]   to save us through sanctification?
[00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:50.580]   And here's Paul's answer in 1 Thessalonians 5, 23.
[00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:56.660]   "Now may the God of peace himself sanctify you completely.
[00:11:56.660 --> 00:12:01.140]   And may your whole spirit and soul and body
[00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:06.020]   be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:09.260]   He who calls you is faithful.
[00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:13.340]   He will surely do it."
[00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.940]   So yes, yes, it is sure.
[00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:22.940]   Present salvation is as sure as the past
[00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:27.160]   because the past is in fact what secures it.
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:31.220]   So let's end where we began
[00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:36.220]   with the spectacular logic of heaven in Romans 8, 32.
[00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:40.540]   "He who did not spare his own son,
[00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:42.860]   but gave him up for us all."
[00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:44.060]   That's the past.
[00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:49.060]   How will he not also graciously give us all things?
[00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:55.740]   So yes, yes, our present and future salvation
[00:12:55.740 --> 00:13:01.500]   is as sure as God's commitment
[00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:06.500]   to the worth of his son's death, which is infinite.
[00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:11.700]   - Secure and sure in the blood of Jesus Christ, amen.
[00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:13.580]   Thank you, Pastor John, for that gospel reminder,
[00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:15.940]   and thank you for joining us today in the podcast.
[00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:19.660]   If you want to ask Pastor John, email your question to us
[00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:22.260]   at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.180]   We'll ask three people to explain
[00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:26.900]   what it means to be spiritual,
[00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:29.100]   and you'll get four different answers.
[00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.500]   That's a humorous way to state the problem.
[00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:34.100]   Definitions of spirituality are squishy.
[00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:36.020]   It means something different to everyone.
[00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:40.180]   So what is biblical spirituality?
[00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:41.140]   That's next time.
[00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:42.580]   I'm your host Tony Reggie.
[00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:44.420]   We'll see you back here on Thursday.
[00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:47.020]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:49.620]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:59.620]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
