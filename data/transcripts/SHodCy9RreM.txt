[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960]   Culture is an interesting one because I think it's not something that easily fits on a checklist,
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.040]   but it's something that when you really experience it, it's so memorable.
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.320]   I had a conversation with Rolf Potts, who wrote a book called Vagabonding,
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.880]   and he said he was talking to someone who went to France and was so frustrated that
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.160]   all they wanted to do was they wanted to experience the culture of France.
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.960]   And they went to a cafe, and they sat out on the sidewalk, people were walking by,
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.800]   and two hours later, they still hadn't been able to eat and get their bill.
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.320]   And they were so frustrated because all they wanted to do was leave the cafe
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.240]   to go experience the culture of France. And he's like, "You just missed it."
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.720]   Like, sitting at a cafe, taking two hours to eat your lunch is literally
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.520]   experiencing the culture of this country, yet you were so focused on trying to go do things.
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.480]   So my new thing is relax, slow down, experience what's there, don't plan too much.
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.920]   Absolutely. I mean, when you're racing to get to the next, I don't know,
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.120]   museum visit or food tour or whatever, that's when you miss some of the most memorable moments.
