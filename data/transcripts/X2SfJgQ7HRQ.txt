[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.640]   online community and I trust that you're doing well and walking in the joy of our Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:14.000]   Thank you again for your faithfulness to this training. I trust that our study has been a
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.200]   blessing to you and we just look forward to a wonderful time tonight as we study the next
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:27.280]   topic in the ACBC counseling exams. Tonight we're looking at counseling exam number eight
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.400]   which is an exam question on the operations or the activities of the devil.
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:41.040]   And I'm not sure why this question is under the heading of the counseling exams rather than the
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.680]   theology exam questions. I do think that this particular question would have fit in nicely with
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:55.680]   the theology exam questions, but it is a good question and one that we need to think through.
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:03.520]   What are the activities of the devil, the demonic realm, how do they show up in a counseling
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:12.800]   situation, and how do we as counselors engage in spiritual warfare in the true biblical sense?
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:20.400]   For those of you who are with us in the online ACBC national conference held this prior year,
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:27.360]   you know that the theme of that conference was spiritual warfare, destroying strongholds. And
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:34.000]   we were looking at what is true spiritual warfare and how do we as counselors, how are we to be
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:43.200]   aware of the spiritual warfare in our counselees hearts and how are we to engage in that warfare.
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:50.400]   We do want to strike a balance in this discussion. On one hand, we don't want to underestimate
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.760]   Satan's power and activity in this world. We want to be aware that the Bible teaches us that
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:05.440]   Satan is real, the devil is real, that Satan is very active in this world. 1 Peter 5 verse 8 says,
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:12.160]   "Be sober-minded, be watchful. Your adversary, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion,
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:22.560]   seeking someone to devour." So we do want to be watchful and aware of the activities of the devil.
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:31.200]   Satan is a real personal being who exercises great influence in this world.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.520]   On the other hand, we don't want to overestimate Satan's abilities either.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:46.480]   Not every temptation to sin comes directly from Satan. You can't blame a demon for every temptation
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:56.480]   to sin. Sometimes, in fact, it is just the counselee's own flesh or it is the own sinfulness
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:04.880]   of the counselee's heart that is drawing the counselee to sinful behavior. And so, while on
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.480]   the one hand, we don't want to ignore the fact that Satan may have an influence and an activity
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:19.040]   that will show up in counseling situations, we don't want to, on the other hand, overestimate
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:27.360]   Satan's influence. We don't want to fall into the mistake of blaming Satan for everything when,
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.920]   at times, it is the counselee's own heart that he or she needs to deal with.
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.160]   If a counselee says to you, "Well, I'm being mean to my wife because
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:47.840]   it's Satan's fault. Satan's making me do it," or "I have the demon of anger," you may want to ask
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:56.560]   the counselee to re-evaluate that assessment. It's probably that this person is just being selfish
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:02.160]   and needs to repent and submit his heart to the lordship of Christ.
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:10.560]   The Bible teaches that Satan is not omnipotent. James 4 verse 4 says, "Resist the devil and he
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:17.360]   will flee from you." Satan's influence is not greater than the influence of the Holy Spirit,
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:24.000]   and the Bible teaches us that the Holy Spirit lives in the true believer in Christ, that our
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.960]   bodies are literally temples of the Holy Spirit, that we've been baptized into the person and into
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:40.080]   the power of the Holy Spirit, and so we don't want to be overly intimidated by Satan's activity.
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:49.600]   So, how is it that we come to a biblical view of the operations of the devil? How can we be
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:57.440]   equipped to counsel well? How can we be wise in our understanding of this topic and its application
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:03.840]   to counseling ministry? And that's what we're here to study tonight, so let me pray for us,
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:09.920]   and we'll devote this hour to the Lord in prayer. Let's pray. Father, we thank you that you have
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:18.400]   sent your Son to die on the cross, to rise again from the dead, and Lord, we thank you that through
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:25.280]   Christ's power that we are no longer under the power of the evil one. We thank you that you've
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:33.760]   given to us your Holy Spirit who lives in us so that Satan can tempt us from without, but he cannot
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:43.040]   indwell us from within. He cannot take power over our bodies because our bodies are temples of the
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:48.720]   Holy Spirit, and we just pray that you would make us wise as we look at this topic. Thank you for
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:54.640]   each of my brothers and sisters joining us tonight in this online class, and I pray that this will be
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:06:01.680]   a blessing and a benefit to each of their lives, and we ask this and pray this in Jesus' name. Amen.
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:09.280]   Well, let's look at the counseling exam question together. The question is this. Describe in
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:15.760]   biblical categories the operations of the devil. Is there a difference between believers and
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:24.800]   unbelievers regarding the activity of the devil? What is a biblical methodology for responding
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:33.840]   to the demonic in the context of counseling? And the short answer is that it isn't really
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:43.040]   that complicated. We'll see how that works out in just a moment. Just a technical note,
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:49.600]   I have been asked on this question what does the word "operations" mean, and I would just take that
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:55.040]   to mean what it says in the next sentence. Is there a difference between believers and
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:02.880]   unbelievers regarding the activity of the devil? And so, "operations" would just be another word
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:07.200]   for "activity." We're asking the question, how does Satan operate in the world today?
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:16.160]   What are the activities that he engages in? And we will see in our study, Satan is a very busy
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:23.520]   character who does a lot of things in the world today. The question is asking you to describe in
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:32.400]   biblical categories the operations or the activities of the devil. If you look at your
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:37.920]   handout, I've listed some good resources that will help you in your study of this topic. As I mentioned,
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:45.600]   this is more of a systematic theology question, and so some good selected readings from the
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:52.640]   systematic theology books will help you in your study of this topic. If you haven't written the
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:58.240]   theology exam questions yet, you will want to purchase Paul N's The Moody Handbook of Theology,
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:07.440]   Charles Ryrie Basic Theology, and Wayne Grudem Systematic Theology. You will need those resources
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:13.440]   to help you for each of the 24 theology exam questions. Those are very standard works,
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:20.000]   very reputable works, and they will serve you well in your study of this topic, as well
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:28.480]   as in every other topic as it relates to systematic theology. There's a very good
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:34.720]   systematic theology textbook dealing specifically with the issue of angelology and demonology.
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:42.720]   That is C. Fred Dickinson's Angels, Elect, and Evil. That's a standard theology textbook on
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:52.080]   the subjects of angelology and demonology, and there's a good section on the subject of Satan
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:59.920]   in that textbook, and I would recommend that resource for you. And then, as I mentioned,
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:06.800]   anything by David Powelson is worth reading, and the last book that he wrote before he went to go
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:14.320]   be with the Lord is on the subject of spiritual warfare. It was entitled Safe and Sound, Standing
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:22.000]   Firm in Spiritual Battles. I haven't read the entire book yet, but I've gotten a start, and
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:31.360]   it is just a very good biblical wise treatment of the subject of spiritual warfare. I believe
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:40.640]   Powelson's last book was the inspiration for the theme Destroying Strongholds at the ACBC National
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:46.560]   Conference, and I would also recommend that you look up the audio for that conference from the
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:56.640]   ACBC National Conference Destroying Strongholds in year 2020. Many good lectures and main sessions
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:03.840]   devoted to the subject of spiritual warfare from a biblical perspective and how it relates to
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:10.000]   the counseling ministry, and I would encourage you to make use of those resources.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:17.520]   Well, with that said, let's look at page two of your class notes, and I like to begin with
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:27.280]   this statement. I can bring it up on the slide here that Martin Luther has said that the devil
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:37.280]   is God's devil. I like that statement. I like Martin Luther's perspective on Satan and spiritual
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:47.440]   warfare. The devil is God's devil. If you read Luther's works, you will see that Luther saw the
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:56.240]   Christian life was a great spiritual battle with Satan himself. He said this in one of his
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:03.680]   commentaries that Satan is by nature such a wicked and poisonous spirit that he cannot tolerate
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:10.560]   anything that is good. It pains him that even an apple, a cherry, and the like grow. It causes him
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:15.680]   pain and grief that a single healthy person should live upon the earth, and if God would
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:23.680]   not restrain him, he would hurl everything together in ruin. But to nothing is he a more bitter enemy
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:31.040]   than the dear word, because while he can conceal himself under all creatures, the word is the only
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:39.680]   agency that can disclose him and reveal to everyone how black he is. If you read Luther's
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:48.960]   works, you will see that Martin Luther struggled greatly in his spiritual life. He wrote, "When the
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:56.880]   devil throws your sins in your face and declares that you deserve death and hell, tell him this,
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:03.040]   I admit that I deserve death and hell. What of it? For I know one who suffered and made
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:12.240]   satisfaction on my behalf. His name is Jesus Christ, Son of God, and where he is, there I shall be also."
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:20.400]   Luther understood the spiritual battle with the enemy, but he also understood that the Christian
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:30.160]   could be victorious in his or her own battle with Satan and demonic realm. You remember the great
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:38.480]   stanza of Luther's hymn, "A Mighty Fortress Is Our God," where he wrote, "And though this world
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:45.120]   with devil's fill should threaten to undo us, we will not fear, for God has willed his truth to
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:54.720]   triumph through us. The prince of darkness grim, we tremble not for him. His rage we can endure,
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:13:06.320]   for lo, his doom is sure. One little word shall fell him." So Luther understood that Satan is
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:13.360]   influential in this world. Luther understood the great spiritual battle against Satan and the
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:22.560]   demonic realm, and yet he also understood that a mighty fortress is our God, that God is sovereign,
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:32.160]   not Satan. God is the authority over Satan. Satan cannot act one inch outside of what God has
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:40.800]   sovereignly prescribed for him, that the devil is God's devil. When Satan does his worst,
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:50.640]   God accomplishes his best. At the cross, Satan thought that he was nailing the Messiah to the
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:57.200]   cross and putting him to death, and at the same time, God was using the activities of Satan to
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:05.520]   accomplish salvation for the world. William Gurnall has written, "When God says, 'Stay,'
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:12.080]   Satan must stand like a dog by the table while the saints feast on God's comfort. He does not
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:23.280]   dare to snatch even a tidbit, for the master's eye is always upon him." This is why I would think
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:30.640]   that Satan is probably the most frustrated character in the world today. Every time he
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:39.120]   thinks he has accomplished evil, God uses that to accomplish something good. Satan is always scoring
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:48.160]   goals only to find that he is racking up points for the other team. The devil is God's devil.
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:56.080]   Erwin Luther has said this, "Let us boldly affirm that whatever mischief Satan is allowed to do,
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:02.720]   it is always appointed by God for the ultimate service of a benefit to the saints.
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:11.440]   Satan always loses even when he wins. The greater our God, the smaller our devil."
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:21.280]   So, there's a balance here, and I understand the grief of a pastor or the grief of a parent who
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:30.160]   sees a sheep or sees a person who once professed the name of Christ go astray and go into the
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:38.000]   world. I don't want to underestimate Satan's influence. It's a grievous thing that Satan does
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:48.080]   in snatching away the Word of God from the soil, as it were, in Mark chapter 4. It is a grievous
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:55.440]   thing that Satan does in blinding the minds of unbelievers, and yet we understand that Satan
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:16:05.200]   is not sovereign. God is sovereign, and God uses Satan to accomplish God's perfect and holy will.
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:12.640]   So, we see on your handout there that Satan is a real, personal,
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:21.120]   living being who is active in the world today. We see Satan's activity in the Garden of Eden,
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:27.120]   do we not? In Genesis chapter 3, verse 1, "Now the serpent was more crafty than any other beast
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:34.640]   of the field that the Lord God had made. He said to the woman, 'Did God actually say,
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:43.760]   'You shall not eat of any tree in the garden?'" I mean, right there you see one of the primary
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:52.160]   activities or operations of the devil today, which is to cast doubt on the truthfulness of the Word
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:17:03.360]   of God. Satan is crafty, but he is doing the same thing today that he did in the Garden of Eden. He
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:13.360]   hasn't changed his tactics from that day when he came to Adam and Eve all the way to the United
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:24.880]   States of America in 2021. Satan wants to cast doubt on the truthfulness of God's Word. Did God
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:34.880]   really say that? Now listen to Martin Luther commenting on this passage. Luther says this,
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:41.840]   "Therefore Satan here attacks Adam and Eve in this way to deprive them of the Word
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:48.640]   and to make them believe his lie after they have lost the Word and their trust in God.
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:58.000]   Unbelief is the source of all sins. When Satan brought about this unbelief by driving out or
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:07.120]   corrupting the Word, the rest was easy for him. The chief temptation was to listen to another Word
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:17.680]   and to depart from the one which God had previously spoken." I'll end Luther's quote there.
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:24.240]   Oh, the implications of this truth for counseling ministry.
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:32.240]   One of the primary ways that Satan is going to show up in the counseling room in your meeting
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:39.200]   with a counselee is not by so much possessing the counselee and making the counselee speak
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:48.080]   demonic voices, but one of the primary ways that Satan is going to show his influence is that the
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:56.560]   counselee will be tempted on a daily basis to doubt the authority and the truthfulness of God's Word.
[00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:02.960]   And I know we need to talk about the issue of demon possession, and I know we need to talk
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:10.800]   about how does a Christian respond to demon possession, and can a believer be demon possessed,
[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:18.400]   and what to do if there are demonic influences in that way showing up in a counseling situation.
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:24.160]   That is a legitimate topic in this field of study, but in 24 years of pastoral ministry,
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:30.000]   I can tell you that I have yet to deal with a person in my church who comes to me and says to
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:37.920]   me in a demonic voice, "I am of Satan," or "I am of a certain demon." I know that may happen. I'm
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:50.080]   not saying that never happens, but it's not the primary way that Satan works today. I believe
[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:55.200]   that Satan is a little too intelligent for that. He knows that if people were showing up in every
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:20:02.080]   church today speaking in demonic voices and saying that they are of the devil, then that would
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:10.720]   simply serve to wake churches up to pray and to read their Bibles and to see that the spiritual
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:16.880]   battle is real, and there would be churches spending all night in prayer and fasting for
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:24.400]   the souls of people in the communities because there would be a reminder of the great spiritual
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:29.360]   battle that is all around us. Satan doesn't want to do that. He wants to lull us to sleep
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:38.640]   so that we become complacent and comfortable. He wants to work with subtlety and craftiness.
[00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:49.040]   He disguises himself as an angel of light. And so the primary way that Satan works, or at least
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:59.760]   one of the primary ways, is he tempts the counselee to doubt God's Word. And in 24 years of pastoral
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:04.800]   ministry, I haven't seen someone come to me and speak in a demonic voice, but I have had plenty
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:14.160]   of counselees and plenty of members in my churches who have said to me, "Did God really say that?"
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:20.240]   Or, "I don't really believe that God would actually call me to do that."
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:26.240]   Or, "Is this truth in the Bible really true?"
[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:35.520]   I've met with plenty of counselees when we open the Bible and I give them God's Word,
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:42.320]   that they are resistant to the truthfulness and the authority of God's Word. Satan is pretty crafty,
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:50.320]   but he's also very consistent. His primary tactic is to cause people to doubt the truthfulness of
[00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:56.000]   the Word of God. Genesis 3, verse 2, "And the woman said to the serpent, 'We may eat of the
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.120]   fruit of the trees in the garden, but God said, 'You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree that
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:06.560]   is in the midst of the garden, neither shall you touch it lest you die.'" So, Eve responds, "Yes,
[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:13.040]   God did actually say that. That is the Word of God. God said, 'You may not eat of the tree that
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:21.280]   is in the midst of the garden.'" Verse 4, "The serpent said to the woman, 'You will not surely
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:33.040]   die.'" Satan goes from casting doubt on the truthfulness of God's Word to blatantly
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:41.120]   contradicting the truthfulness of God's Word. Now, brothers and sisters, I hope you see this is
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:48.880]   nothing new. This is what's going on in the world today. What is Satan doing in the world today? He
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:57.360]   casts doubt on the truthfulness of God's Word. He says to our culture, "Did God really say that?"
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:04.640]   And then he moves to blatant contradiction.
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:15.760]   He goes from saying, "Did God really say that marriage is a covenant between one man and one
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:27.920]   woman? Would God really be so restrictive?" And then he moves to blatant contradiction.
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:36.320]   "God didn't say that. Why would He say that?" And he says, "Marriage is not a covenant
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:42.160]   between one man and one woman." You can draw out the applications from there. You understand
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:48.560]   what's going on in the world today, from casting doubt to blatant contradiction.
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:54.080]   Verse 5, "For God knows that when you eat of it, your eyes will be open and you will be like God,
[00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:58.960]   knowing good and evil. So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, that it was a delight
[00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:04.160]   to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate,
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:14.080]   and she also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate." What a sad narrative and
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:26.000]   what a sad state of affairs. Sad for Satan, who, if we piece the accounts of Isaiah 14 and Ezekiel 28
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:35.920]   together, we learn that Satan was once an anointed cherub who fell from heaven. He who once was a
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:42.960]   beautiful angel is now filled with hatred and rage toward the living God and God's people.
[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:50.080]   Satan knows that his doom is sure. Romans 16, verse 20 says, "The God of peace will soon crush
[00:24:50.080 --> 00:25:00.320]   Satan under your feet." Satan knows that his future eternity is to spend all of eternity
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:11.200]   in the lake of fire, and he opposes God's people. He operates by casting doubt upon the Word of God.
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:18.960]   We see Satan's activity in the story of Job in the Old Testament. This account is sobering. It
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:26.080]   also gives us assurance that God is sovereign over Satan. Satan's activity was limited in the
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:34.720]   life of Job. God set the boundaries for Satan's influence. Job 1, verse 6, "Now there was a day
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:39.840]   when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan also came among them.
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:46.960]   The Lord said to Satan, 'From where have you come?' Satan answered the Lord and said, 'From going to
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:53.120]   and fro on the earth and from walking up and down on it.'" So you see that Satan here is a very busy
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:26:00.880]   character, moving to and fro on the earth, and yet we also see that Satan is not omnipotent.
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:06.240]   Satan is not omnipresent. He is not everywhere at one time.
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:14.240]   Job 1, verse 8, "The Lord said to Satan, 'Have you considered my servant Job,
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:19.520]   that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man who fears God and
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:27.200]   turns away from evil?' Then Satan answered the Lord and said, 'Does Job fear God for no reason?'"
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:36.560]   The name "Satan" actually means "adversary." The name "devil" literally means "slanderer." So we
[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:42.480]   see that the devil is always accusing God's people. This is another one of the operations
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:50.240]   of the devil. He accuses God's people. Verse 10, "Have you not put a hedge around him in his house
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:54.560]   and all that he has on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands and his possessions
[00:26:54.560 --> 00:27:00.080]   have increased in the land. But stretch out your hand and touch all that he has and he will curse
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:09.200]   you to your face." Satan says to the Lord, "The only reason why Job loves you is because you are
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:17.120]   nice to him and you give him good things. If you take away his blessings, he will curse you
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:24.240]   to your face." Verse 12, "The Lord said to Satan, 'Behold, all that he has is in your hand. Only
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:29.360]   against him do not stretch out your hand.' So Satan went out from the presence of the Lord."
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:33.840]   And you know the story from there. Job endured a season of great suffering.
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:42.640]   Never did Job curse God to his face. Instead, Job said, "Naked I come from my mother's womb and
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:48.320]   naked shall I return. The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away. Blessed be the name of the Lord."
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:53.120]   And all this Job did not sin or charge God with wrong. So here's the main point.
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:28:03.760]   Satan's activity, where Satan sought to do Job evil, only ended up in producing this good.
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:16.160]   Job's testimony of godly faith is recorded in scripture now as a testimony to the world
[00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:23.040]   throughout centuries of time. That the true saints of God love God for who he is,
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:32.160]   not only for what God gives to them. When Satan was seeking to do his worst, God was working to
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:41.680]   accomplish his best. God used Satan's activity to bring about this amazing testimony of godly
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:52.560]   character that is still impacting lives today. We see in the gospel records, Jesus said to Peter
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:59.680]   in Luke 22, verse 31, "Simon, Simon, behold, Satan demanded to have you that he might sift
[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:09.360]   you like wheat. But I prayed for you that your faith may not fail. And when you have turned again,
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:20.080]   strengthen your brothers." God can use the activity of Satan to strengthen the testimony
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:30.480]   of a believer. We see this happen in the life of the apostle Paul, where Paul was given a thorn in
[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:37.760]   the flesh in 2 Corinthians chapter 12, literally a stake that was ran through his flesh. And he
[00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:47.040]   called this thorn, this painful trial, a messenger of Satan to harass me, literally to beat me black
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:53.760]   and blue, to keep me from becoming conceded. And Paul pleaded with the Lord three times that the
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:30:00.320]   thorn in the flesh would be removed from him. And God essentially said, "No." He said, "My grace is
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:09.120]   sufficient for you." God sovereignly allowed this messenger of Satan to beat upon Paul, causing him
[00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:17.600]   painful affliction in order to produce this good end in Paul's life. Paul needed to be rescued
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:26.880]   from being conceded. Paul needed to be rescued from spiritual pride. He'd been given all of these
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:34.960]   great privileges as an apostle, and he had a temptation to exalt himself because of his great
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:43.120]   privileges. And so God sovereignly allowed this messenger of Satan to harass him in order to keep
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:50.960]   Paul humble. Now the point is that Satan was seeking to beat Paul black and blue. Satan thought
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:56.800]   that he was causing Paul pain, but all that he was accomplishing within God's sovereign plan
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:31:04.960]   was to produce this good end in Paul's life, to keep him humble so that he could continue
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:15.680]   to be in the place of God's blessing and God's grace. God limited the activity of Satan. He
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:24.480]   didn't remove it, but he did use it in order to produce the fruit of godly character in Paul's
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:32.240]   life. Going back to your handout, we see that Satan was active in the life of Jesus.
[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:38.320]   I mean, the audacity of Satan to seek to tempt the Son of God himself,
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:47.680]   the temptation to be self-sufficient. Matthew 4 verse 3, "If you are the Son of God,
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:54.240]   command these stones to become loaves of bread." The temptation to be spectacular.
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:59.760]   Verse 5, "The devil took him to the holy city and set him on the pinnacle of the temple and said to
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:04.720]   him, 'If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written, 'He will command his
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:10.080]   angels concerning you, and on their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:22.240]   a stone.'" The temptation to shortcut God's plan to go to the cross.
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:28.800]   "The devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:32.880]   and their glory. And he said to him, 'All these I will give you if you fall down and worship me.'
[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:40.800]   Then Jesus said to him, 'Be gone, Satan, for it is written,
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:44.400]   'You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve.'
[00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:50.720]   Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and were ministering to him."
[00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:56.080]   Jesus fought every temptation using scripture.
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:07.520]   He used a different passage of scripture for each specific temptation.
[00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:18.400]   And here I just want to plead with you to not make this whole subject of spiritual
[00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:24.160]   warfare overly complicated. This is all we're trying to do with our counselees.
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:34.160]   We are seeking to equip them to use scripture to fight temptation,
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:44.800]   to battle for sanctification. We want them to use different passages of scripture for specific
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:53.760]   temptations, for specific seasons of life. And we just want to bring people to use the
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:34:00.400]   sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God, and to enter into this battle for sanctification
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:07.120]   and holiness. It really isn't any more complicated than that. We want to use
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:11.680]   the Bible to fight our spiritual battles.
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:21.520]   Some other passages there, John 8, 44. Satan was active in the life of the Pharisees,
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:25.760]   the religious leaders. Now that's interesting because the Pharisees didn't look like
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:33.760]   Satan worshipers. They didn't dress in black and have pitchforks and have horns on their heads.
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:42.960]   These were religious people. They were clean-cut. They were moral externally.
[00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:50.640]   Yet Jesus said to the Pharisees, "You are of your father the devil, and your will is to do your
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:57.440]   father's desires." He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth because
[00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:06.080]   there is no truth in him. We see Satan's activity in the life of the early church, Acts 5, verse 3.
[00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:12.000]   Peter said, "Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:18.720]   for yourself part of the proceeds of this land?" 2 Corinthians 11, verse 14. "No wonder, for even
[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:22.480]   Satan disguises himself as an angel of light."
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:32.400]   Satanic activity shows up at your door. It will most likely not look like a person
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:42.800]   dressed in black with a pitchfork, but it will mostly look like the form of a clean-cut person
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:53.040]   who is wearing a tie and holding a Bible and yet preaching a false gospel of works salvation.
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:36:00.800]   Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:08.400]   So Satan is very active. We see that both in Old Testament and New Testament scriptures.
[00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:12.880]   We see that in the world and the church today. Moving to page 3 of your handout,
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:22.080]   and let me find myself where I'm on the screen here. Ian Bounce has written this,
[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:29.920]   "That the devil is a very busy character. He does a big business, a very ugly business,
[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:34.240]   but he does it well. That is, as well as an ugly business can be done,
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:40.960]   he has lots of experience, big brains, a black heart, great force, tireless energy, and is of
[00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:47.200]   great influence and great character. All his immense resources are used for evil purposes."
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:56.320]   Satan is indeed very busy. What are his activities or his operations? Number one,
[00:36:56.880 --> 00:37:06.640]   he's active in deceiving the nations. Revelation 20 verse 2 says that he sees the dragon, that
[00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:11.520]   ancient serpent who is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years and drew him into
[00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:18.640]   the pit and shut it and sealed it over him so that he might not deceive the nations any longer.
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:27.680]   Implication, what is Satan doing when he is not thrown into the pit? He is active in deceiving
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:33.920]   the nations. He is the father of lies. Satan speaks lies. 1 Timothy 4 verse 1 says, "The
[00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:39.840]   spirit expressly says that in later times some will depart from the faith by devoting themselves
[00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:46.400]   to deceitful spirits and teachings of demons through the insincerity of liars whose consciences
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:52.880]   are seared, who forbid marriage and require abstinence from foods that God created to be
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:38:00.400]   received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth." Just note there that on the
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:10.480]   surface that may look really spiritual. Asceticism, denying yourself from that which God has declared
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:23.680]   to be good. These people aren't speaking in demonic voices. They're saying if you have a
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:32.880]   really, really strict diet, then you will be really, really spiritual. Now just be balanced
[00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:39.680]   with that. I'm not saying all diets are wrong or all diets are evil. I'm saying a diet that is used
[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:44.480]   as a means of works righteousness to make yourself acceptable to God
[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:50.880]   is a form of satanic influence, a form of works righteousness.
[00:38:50.880 --> 00:39:03.680]   And it looks really spiritual, but this is the activity of demonic
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:12.080]   influence. Paul says in verse 5, "For everything created by God is good, and nothing is to be
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:18.640]   rejected if it is received with thanksgiving, for it is made holy by the word of God in prayer."
[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:25.920]   2 Corinthians 11 verse 3 says, "I'm afraid that as a serpent deceived Eve by his cunning,
[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:31.920]   your thoughts will be led astray from a sincere and pure devotion to Christ." So just to be clear,
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:36.640]   if someone in the church says, "I'm going to go on a diet because I think that diet's going to
[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:43.280]   improve my physical health," then that may be a way of expressing your worship and obedience to
[00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:48.320]   the Lord, of exercising self-control, of manifesting the fruit of the Spirit. And there may be something
[00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:57.920]   that is very good in that. But if a person is teaching a form of legalism, that we must eat
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:08.000]   only certain foods because by denying ourselves from all that God has given to us, we will somehow
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:14.480]   make ourselves more acceptable to God, then that is a form of a works righteousness system.
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:22.720]   Satan loves to deceive others into thinking that because they are adhering to a works
[00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:27.360]   righteousness system, they have made themselves acceptable to God when Scripture says that it is
[00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:33.280]   only through Christ and it is only through His perfect work on the cross, His life, His death,
[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:40.160]   and His resurrection that we are made acceptable to God and that God has given to us all things
[00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:46.880]   to be enjoyed and to be received with thanksgiving. Everything is created by God
[00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:53.040]   is good. But you see, when you adhere to a works righteousness system, that system
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:56.480]   will become the focus instead of Christ.
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:41:05.360]   And you will be led away, led astray from a sincere and pure devotion to Christ.
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:17.760]   Thought life is where you see satanic influence in the counseling room. What a Christian thinks
[00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:26.560]   about, how a counselor thinks about himself, about the world, about the truth, about Christ.
[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:36.320]   Thoughts that lead away from a sincere and pure devotion to Christ. This is the pastoral heart
[00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:41.760]   that I hope will characterize every biblical counselor that's trained in our ministry.
[00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:49.600]   The pastoral heart just to pray for our counselees, that they would love Christ,
[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:55.440]   that they would have a sincere and pure devotion to Christ. In their hearts, there would not be
[00:41:55.440 --> 00:42:01.760]   the worship of Christ plus something else, and that we would labor and work with our counselees
[00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:10.240]   to experience the purification of their hearts that comes through the Holy Spirit's work in
[00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:18.800]   their lives. That if their joy is tied to anything else other than Christ, that the Holy Spirit would
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:25.440]   purify them and lead them to a pure and sincere devotion to Christ.
[00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:34.240]   So, Satan is active in deceiving the nations. Number two, Satan is active in opposing Christ.
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:42.240]   1 John 2, verse 18, "Children, it is the last hour, and as you've heard that Antichrist is coming,
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:50.320]   so now many Antichrists have come." The word Antichrist literally can be translated against
[00:42:50.320 --> 00:43:00.320]   or in the place of Christ. 1 John 2, verse 22, "Who is the liar, but he who denies that Jesus
[00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:06.720]   is the Christ, this is the Antichrist, he who denies the Father and the Son."
[00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:15.360]   Chapter 4, verse 3, "And every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God, this is the
[00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:22.880]   spirit of the Antichrist, which you heard was coming and now is in the world already."
[00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:28.400]   So, let's again not make it any more complicated than it is.
[00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:34.640]   Satan's influence is to oppose Christ, is to diminish Christ.
[00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:42.160]   How will you see satanic influence in the counseling ministry? As you meet with a
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:47.600]   counselee, you will see it in the counselee's diminished view of Christ,
[00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:54.640]   or the removal of Christ as the center of the counselee's life.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:05.440]   So, Satan's influence is to oppose Christ, this spirit is the spirit of the Antichrist.
[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:12.880]   So, if Satan's activity is to oppose Christ, then how do we as biblical counselors combat
[00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:20.320]   satanic activity? Isn't it very simple? We are to make much of Christ.
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:29.600]   We are to make Christ the center of our counseling. Biblical counseling is Christ-centered
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:36.080]   counseling. We want to lead our counselees to Christ, that they would love Christ, that they
[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:41.200]   would see that Christ is better than their marriage being the way that they want it to be.
[00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:46.720]   Christ is better than their children turning out the way that they want it to be. Christ is
[00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:51.520]   better than their business succeeding in the way that they had planned. Christ is
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:56.240]   better than all of these things. We want our counselees to treasure Christ.
[00:44:56.240 --> 00:45:05.360]   As A.W. Tozer has well said, the best way to keep the enemy out is to keep Christ in.
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:13.120]   Many of our counselees are allowing satanic influence
[00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:19.840]   to be brought upon their lives because they are not worshiping Christ.
[00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:26.800]   They are not making much of Christ. They are not dwelling upon Christ and all that he is.
[00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:33.840]   And so, the tactic of spiritual warfare is very simple.
[00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:44.160]   If you make much of Christ, then you keep satanic influence out. In Paul's letters,
[00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:51.760]   Mark Hitchcock has observed the word Satan is used 10 times, the word Devil is used 6 times,
[00:45:51.760 --> 00:46:04.560]   and the name Jesus is used 291 times. The title Lord is used in 272 verses, and
[00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:15.760]   the name Christ is used in 389 verses. He observes that clearly we are to focus
[00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:22.960]   on Christ, not Satan. We are to be Christ-centered, not Satan-centered.
[00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:32.080]   So, we see that Satan is active in opposing Christ. Let me move you to the fourth page
[00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:41.680]   of your handout. A third activity is that Satan is active in ruling over this present world system.
[00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:51.040]   John 12, verse 31, "Now is the judgment of this world. Now will the ruler of this world be cast
[00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:56.400]   out." 2 Corinthians 4, verse 4, "In their case, the God of this world has blinded the minds of
[00:46:56.400 --> 00:47:02.320]   the unbelievers to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ,
[00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:09.120]   who is the image of God." 1 John 5, verse 19, "We know that we are from God and that the whole
[00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:16.560]   world lies in the power of the evil one." The world system referring
[00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:27.600]   to the orderly system that functions apart from God. As Charles Rowley writes,
[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:34.080]   "The world is that system organized by Satan, headed by Satan, and run by Satan,
[00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:37.680]   which leaves God out and is a rival to him."
[00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:47.760]   Satanic influence will be seen in a counselee's doubting the truth of God's word,
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:55.920]   in a counselee's distraction from devotion to a pure and sincere devotion to Christ,
[00:47:55.920 --> 00:48:04.720]   and satanic influence is seen in a love of the world. 1 John 2, verse 15, "Do not love
[00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:10.720]   the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not
[00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:18.080]   in him. For all that is in the world, the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and the
[00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:28.640]   pride of life, is not from the Father but is from the world." The world system, which is opposed to
[00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:37.520]   the will of God, and the scripture says you cannot love God and love the world at the same time.
[00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:43.120]   Number four, Satan is active in blinding unbelievers to the truth. That's 2 Corinthians 4,
[00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:48.720]   verse 4, "The God of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers."
[00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:59.200]   And this is why Paul says in 2 Timothy 2, verse 24, "That the Lord's servant must not be quarrelsome,
[00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:06.080]   but be kind to everyone, able to teach, patiently enduring evil, correcting his opponents with
[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:14.640]   gentleness." Why? God may perhaps grant them repentance, leading to a knowledge of the truth,
[00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:22.480]   and they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil after being captured by
[00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:32.640]   him to do his will. How do you and I as biblical counselors engage in spiritual warfare? How do we
[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:41.760]   engage in a battle against satanic influence in our counseling ministry? Here it is. If we are to
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:51.680]   fight the influence of the devil, we must be kind, we must be patient, we must be gentle,
[00:49:51.680 --> 00:50:02.080]   we must have compassion and mercy to know that if the counselee is being resistant to God's word or
[00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:11.040]   being resistant to biblical counsel, that it may be that he or she is being captured by him that is
[00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:20.800]   Satan to do his will. The anger of man does not achieve the righteousness of God. Listen,
[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:28.320]   biblical counselors in training, your sinful anger against your counselees will be of no help
[00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:36.560]   in this spiritual battle. Your impatience with your counselees will be of no help in this
[00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:43.680]   spiritual battle. You raising your voice in a counseling session because you want to hammer
[00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:51.040]   home a truth so that a counselee will really get it will be of no help in producing the fruit of
[00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:58.320]   righteousness in that counselee's life. If we are to engage in the spiritual battle, we must engage
[00:50:58.320 --> 00:51:08.880]   in the character qualities of gentleness, patience, kindness, must be in prayer, we must patiently
[00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:18.640]   endure evil, we must turn the other cheek when we are wronged, the Lord's servant must not be
[00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:27.840]   quarrelsome. Lastly, Satan is active in opposing believers and this is adapted from Dickinson's
[00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:36.400]   work, Angels Elect and Evil. He wages warfare, he accuses and slanders, he plants doubt,
[00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:44.560]   he attempts to sin. You know the great lyrics of that great praise song, "When Satan tempts me to
[00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:52.000]   despair and tells me of the guilt within, upward I look him there who made an end to all my sin."
[00:51:52.720 --> 00:52:00.080]   That's a wonderful statement on how we are to fight the influence of Satan. It is
[00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:10.240]   by looking to Christ that we combat the influence of the evil one. So, the question would be this,
[00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:17.120]   and I think this is on your last page here on page five. The exam question asks the question,
[00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:24.800]   "Is there a difference between believers and unbelievers regarding the activity of the devil?"
[00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:36.320]   Is there a difference between believers and unbelievers regarding the activity of the devil?
[00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:43.920]   Now, I hope if you've been with me up to this point that you understand that the answer is very
[00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:50.080]   simple. The answer would be yes. It has to be yes, right?
[00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:57.520]   Why is there a difference between believers and unbelievers regarding the activity of the devil?
[00:52:57.520 --> 00:53:07.040]   Because a believer has been filled with the spirit. A believer has been redeemed by the sun.
[00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:14.240]   1 Corinthians 1 verse 13 says that the believer has been transferred from the domain of darkness
[00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:20.640]   into the kingdom of his beloved son in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.
[00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:28.800]   The believer can be tempted from without but cannot be possessed from within. 1 Corinthians
[00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:36.160]   6 verse 19, "Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you whom you
[00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:47.440]   have from God? Greater is he who is in us than he who is in the world." And so, an unbeliever
[00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:57.040]   can be possessed by a demon. We see that in the gospel records. We see that in Mark chapter 5,
[00:53:57.040 --> 00:54:04.320]   there was a man who was possessed by a legion of demons. There's no guarantee for an unbeliever
[00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:10.800]   that a demon would not be able to come into that person's life and take complete control of that
[00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:18.400]   person's body. As I mentioned, I believe that Satan probably doesn't act in that way in a
[00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:24.400]   general sense because it would just awaken people up to their spiritual condition. But that's
[00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:32.320]   possible, demon possession. By the way, in the Greek language in the New Testament, there really
[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:39.600]   isn't a difference between the word used for demon possession and a word used for demon influence.
[00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:46.480]   The Greek term demazomai refers to both possession and influence, and so there
[00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:52.080]   isn't this sharp distinction of internal possession versus external oppression or
[00:54:52.080 --> 00:55:00.400]   external influence. But we do see descriptively in the New Testament that there were some who,
[00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:06.880]   in the gospel records, were possessed in the sense that a demon took complete control over
[00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:15.120]   their bodies. Now, we would just argue from Scripture that if the Holy Spirit dwells
[00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:21.280]   permanently in the body of a believer, that it would be impossible for a demon to come and take
[00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:32.560]   control of that body. But we do see demonic influence in a believer's life. Scripture
[00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:39.040]   even promises that in Ephesians chapter 6. It describes Christian life as a wrestling, as a
[00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:46.640]   hand-to-hand combat with the demonic realm and calls us to be strong in the Lord and in the
[00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:52.560]   strength of his might, and to put on the armor of God, and to pray, and to wield the sword of
[00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:57.520]   the Spirit, which is the Word of God, and to engage in this great spiritual battle,
[00:55:57.520 --> 00:56:02.080]   and to be engaged in praying for other believers as they engage in the spiritual battle.
[00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:11.360]   But there's no secret passage in the New Testament that tells us how to cast out a demon.
[00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:22.000]   There's no specific instructions, step-by-step how-to manual. If you come across a
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:25.120]   demon-possessed person, this is how you cast out that demon.
[00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:32.320]   So, we just want to strike a balance with this.
[00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:38.880]   Some related questions would be, "Can a believer be demon-possessed?"
[00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:47.200]   I believe that believers can be accused and tempted by Satan from without, but cannot be
[00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:55.200]   indwelt or possessed by Satan or demons from within. "What should a counselor do if a
[00:56:55.200 --> 00:57:02.240]   counselee appears to be demon-possessed?" As I mentioned, Scripture does not give us
[00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:07.520]   step-by-step instructions on how to cast out a demon.
[00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:14.960]   But I would just give this perspective. If a counselee appears to be demon-possessed,
[00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:19.600]   it would be likely that that counselee is an unbeliever.
[00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:27.040]   And if a counselee is an unbeliever, then what do they need more than anything else?
[00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:35.920]   They need the gospel. Romans 1, verse 16, "For I am not ashamed of the gospel,
[00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:39.360]   for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes." So,
[00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:44.960]   while there is not a step-by-step instruction manual on how to deal with demon possession,
[00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:52.960]   I would say a good general tactic would just be preach the gospel to that unbeliever.
[00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:57.040]   The same thing you would do to any unbeliever.
[00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:06.800]   "What should a counselor do if a counselee who is a believer appears to be in conflict
[00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:15.920]   with a demon?" My answer would be, don't be surprised. We're not surprised if
[00:58:15.920 --> 00:58:21.920]   counselees are engaging in intense spiritual warfare with demons because that's what Ephesians
[00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:26.400]   6, verse 12 tells us is going on in our lives, whether we know it to be true or not.
[00:58:27.680 --> 00:58:31.600]   Paul says, "We do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers,
[00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:36.720]   against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness,
[00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:41.840]   against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places." If a counselor says to me,
[00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:47.120]   "I don't know what to do. My counselee appears to be in a conflict with a demon." My response would
[00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:53.520]   be, read Ephesians 6. That is exactly what Paul tells us is happening in every believer's life.
[00:58:55.760 --> 00:58:58.880]   Tell that counselee to put on the armor of God,
[00:58:58.880 --> 00:59:07.040]   the belt of truth, the breastplate of righteousness, the shoes of the gospel of peace,
[00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:13.040]   the shield of faith, the helmet of salvation, the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God,
[00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:19.280]   praying at all times in the Spirit with all prayer and supplication, and tell that counselee
[00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:25.360]   to stand firm and be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might.
[00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:36.000]   And tell that counselee that even if that person is like Paul, being beaten black and blue
[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:42.560]   by a messenger of Satan with a painful stake or thorn in the flesh,
[00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:51.680]   that God will give sufficient grace to endure that trial and will sovereignly use even the worst
[00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:58.800]   that Satan can bring to bring about the good and holy purposes that God desires.
[00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:12.160]   Luther says, Erwin Luther, not Martin Luther, spoke of Martin Luther, and he said that Luther
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:19.760]   points out that the devil is God's tool, like a hoe that is used to cultivate God's garden.
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:25.440]   Though the hoe might take pleasure in destroying the weeds, it can never move out of God's hand
[01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:30.480]   nor weed where he does not wish nor thwart his purpose of building a beautiful garden. Thus,
[01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:36.720]   the devil always does God's work. The devil is as much God's servant in his rebellion as he was
[01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:45.920]   God's servant in the days of his sweet obedience. And so, let us take comfort in the truth that
[01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:55.280]   Satan is a defeated foe. Colossians 2, verse 15 says, Christ disarmed the rulers and authorities
[01:00:55.280 --> 01:01:04.400]   and put them to open shame by triumphing over them in him. Markitchcock writes that we live today in
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:09.200]   the interval between the achievement and the announcement of victory at the cross in the empty
[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:15.520]   tomb and the actualization of that victory at the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:22.480]   Satan will be bound for a thousand years at the second coming of Jesus Christ.
[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:32.880]   He will be judged eternally in the lake of fire. And Revelation 20 says this, that the devil who
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:37.760]   had deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur where the beast and the false
[01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:48.720]   prophet were, and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever. The best way to keep the
[01:01:48.720 --> 01:02:00.000]   enemy out is to keep Christ in. And I think this is just a long way of saying, brothers and sisters,
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:07.440]   training for counseling ministry, that our approach as biblical counselors is actually very
[01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:15.040]   simple. We want to minister the Word of God. We want to make Christ central.
[01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:22.960]   We want to pray the Spirit of God would use the Word of God in the lives of our counselees. If
[01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:29.200]   our counselee comes in and that person looks like an unbeliever, then we want to take that opportunity
[01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:36.960]   to preach the gospel of Christ, the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ and Christ's
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:44.560]   sacrifice, which is sufficient to cover over all of our sins. The counselor is a believer engaging
[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:50.880]   in spiritual warfare. We want to give that counselee the Word of God, train that counselee
[01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:57.280]   to use the Word of God to fight temptation as Jesus fought temptation using the Word in the
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:07.120]   wilderness. We want to be aware of Satan's activity, but we don't want to overestimate
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:16.080]   his capability. We want our understanding of the satanic influence in the world today
[01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:23.920]   and the demonic realm to lead us to a greater embracing, a greater reliance upon the truthfulness
[01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:31.600]   of the Word of God. We want our understanding of Satan and demons to lead us to a greater study
[01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:39.680]   and reliance upon the scriptures. And that's all that we do as biblical counselors.
[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:47.680]   We just minister the Word. We just point people to the scriptures. We just point people to Christ,
[01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:56.880]   and we pray that the Spirit would use His Word to do a work in our counselee's lives.
[01:03:56.880 --> 01:04:07.600]   This last week, I received a very sweet note from a counselee who had been ministered to by
[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:17.520]   a biblical counselor in our ministry, and I was overwhelmed by this note. The counselor who was
[01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:26.080]   spoken of in this note had been in a class just like this not long ago, writing these essays,
[01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:33.520]   laboring in doctrine, seeking to understand the 24 theology exams and the 20 counseling exams,
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:41.120]   and then got into phase three and just started applying the things and the truths that she had
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:48.000]   learned, just giving the Word, just giving the truth of scripture, just meeting with a
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:56.400]   counselee, opening the Word, and to hear this testimony of a counselee who said how much change
[01:04:56.400 --> 01:05:05.600]   she had experienced through the Word of God simply being ministered to in the context of a one-on-one
[01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:14.000]   one-on-one setting in the counseling ministry. It was a great affirmation of the simplicity
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:20.960]   and the power of biblical counseling. Brothers and sisters, you don't need to go chasing down
[01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:30.400]   every demon. You don't need to find some manual on how to cast out Satan or all of these. You
[01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:37.200]   don't need to find magical words to say in order to be successful in overcoming spiritual darkness.
[01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:46.800]   What you need to do and what I need to do is to get busy studying, learning, obeying, applying,
[01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:54.160]   and then communicating the all-sufficient Word of God, the 66 books of the Bible, and I pray that
[01:05:54.160 --> 01:06:01.040]   God will be gracious to you and give you His sufficient grace as you do just that this week.
[01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:06.960]   Well, thank you for joining us tonight for the study on the activities or the operations of the
[01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:14.160]   devil. I pray that the study would lead you to a greater understanding of Christ and greater
[01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:22.400]   understanding of the sovereignty of God. Join us next week on April 18th at five o'clock Pacific
[01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:28.640]   Time. We're going to be looking at counseling exam number 10, which has to deal with such
[01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:39.920]   subjects as the chemical imbalance theory, the biogenic theory of mood disorders, the 12-step
[01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:48.480]   recovery programs, cognitive behavioral therapy, and electroconvulsive therapy. That's one of the
[01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:56.480]   more interesting and complicated questions in the ACBC theology exam questions, but we trust
[01:06:56.480 --> 01:07:02.960]   that next week's session will help you and equip you to write a good essay on that topic. Let me
[01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:09.040]   pray for us and we'll be dismissed for tonight. Father, thank you that Satan is a defeated foe,
[01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:18.080]   though he is influential, that as Luther said, his doom is sure. We thank you that
[01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:29.440]   we can sing with Luther, a mighty fortress is our God, and we can know that as we simply study and
[01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:38.240]   learn and communicate the word of God, that the word is powerful, living and active, and able to
[01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:49.040]   transform people's lives. May our study of Satan and the demonic realm lead us to a sobriety and
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:56.240]   greater understanding and reliance upon the sufficient word of God that you've given to us.
[01:07:56.240 --> 01:08:02.880]   I thank you for each of my brothers and sisters here tonight and ask that you would bless them
[01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:09.600]   in their studies this week. We pray all this in the precious name of Jesus. Amen.
