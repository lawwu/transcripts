[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.200]   God grant that that prayer may be answered to all who truly offered it.
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.240]   And that that might be helped, let us consider together the words that are to be found in
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:29.760]   the Gospel according to St. Luke, chapter 13, verses 31, 32, and 33.
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.520]   The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying unto him, Get thee out, and depart
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.840]   hence; for Herod will kill thee.
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:51.560]   And he said unto them, Go ye, and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and I do cures
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:57.360]   to-day and to-morrow; and the third day I shall be perfected.
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:05.280]   Nevertheless, I must walk to-day and to-morrow, and the day following; for it cannot be that
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.560]   a prophet should perish out of Jerusalem.
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.040]   Let me read those words again.
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.720]   The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying unto him, Get thee out, and depart
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.760]   hence; for Herod will kill thee.
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:30.360]   And he said unto them, Go ye, and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and I do cures
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.120]   to-day and to-morrow; and the third day I shall be perfected.
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:43.040]   Nevertheless, I must walk to-day and to-morrow, and the day following; for it cannot be that
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.440]   a prophet should perish out of Jerusalem.
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.160]   Now there is nothing that is more important for us whenever we read the Bible than to
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:02:01.600]   remember that it is the word of God, that it is a uniquely inspired word, containing
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:12.680]   truth that is different in its very nature and essence from every other kind of truth.
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.800]   So that whenever we come to read this book we must remind ourselves of that.
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.520]   It is important sometimes that we should prepare ourselves for the reading even of secular
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.520]   books.
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:36.160]   But when we come to read this book it is absolutely essential because here everything is important.
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.260]   Everything has its meaning.
[00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.400]   Everything has its significance.
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.160]   The result is that when we come to read the Bible we must never regard anything as unimportant,
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:54.440]   as mere connecting link as it were, something thrown in to make the story complete.
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.040]   We must realize that everything is the word of God, and therefore we should always be
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.280]   looking for a meaning or a significance.
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:12.240]   For you will find as you read the Bible that suddenly in what appear to be at first glance
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:21.600]   the most unexpected places you will find important and vital truth.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:29.080]   That is what makes the reading of the Bible such a romantic procedure always.
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.800]   You remember Shakespeare's word, "Turn but a stone and start a wing."
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:41.240]   Well, if you come to the Bible correctly you will constantly be having that sort of experience.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:46.360]   You will come across a statement that seems on the surface, I say, to contain no truth
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:53.000]   at all, just an actual report of something that happened, but which seems at first to
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.080]   be devoid of any scriptural truth or any great doctrine or anything that is vital to our
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.000]   salvation.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.840]   But be careful, I say.
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.100]   "Turn but a stone and start a wing."
[00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.320]   Look at it carefully.
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.600]   Seek for its hidden meaning.
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:17.560]   And you will suddenly and quite unexpectedly find that something startling suddenly appears
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:24.680]   before you, something that is of vital importance to your soul and your eternal destiny.
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:31.720]   Now what we are looking at tonight I think can be accurately put into some such category
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.120]   as that.
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.800]   As you read these three verses, at first you feel, "Well, that's all right.
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:45.200]   No doubt that happened, but it's got nothing to say to me.
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:51.160]   It's a detail, a historical detail, no doubt, in the life of our Lord and Savior, but it
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:57.760]   has no relevance to me today and to my present state and condition."
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.480]   But that is a very great and a very grievous fallacy.
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:08.240]   For I hope to show you that if we take the trouble to investigate what we are told in
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:15.160]   these three verses, we shall find ourselves face to face with very profound and very vital
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.800]   truth.
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:18.800]   What is it?
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:31.360]   Well, it's a picture, you see, of our Lord confronting and handling certain of his enemies.
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:38.680]   The central thing here, of course, in the three verses, the striking thing, is the great
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:48.960]   message about our Lord himself, the glory of his person, the glory of his message, the
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.400]   glory of his work.
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:06:00.180]   But that is shown here in a rather unusual and somewhat striking manner.
[00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.880]   It is shown in this way.
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:12.800]   It is shown in the failure of his enemies to see this truth about him and to realize
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:18.080]   who he was and why he had come into the world and what he could do.
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.080]   That's how it's shown.
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:30.420]   His glory, his perfection, his majesty, is shown to us in this form of a contrast.
[00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:41.180]   The utter abject failure of these Pharisees and King Herod to realize who he was and his
[00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.140]   essential glory.
[00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:51.940]   Now, I'm calling attention to this, of course, for this reason, that this is not only a true
[00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.060]   record of history.
[00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:57.540]   It's something much more than that.
[00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:05.460]   Here we are introduced to a principle which teaches us that all the trouble that men and
[00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:11.780]   women seem to have about believing this Christian message and believing in the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:25.980]   ultimately arises from one great cause, and that is this difficulty about realizing who
[00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:31.500]   he is and what he is.
[00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:35.980]   You see, the world is full of people still who say, "Well, I'm not a Christian and I
[00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:36.980]   can't be a Christian.
[00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:39.500]   I wish I could," say some of them.
[00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:43.100]   I'm dealing with them particularly tonight.
[00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:47.740]   I mean the kind of people who correspond to these Pharisees who came here and spoke to
[00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:50.700]   our Lord.
[00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:54.780]   These Pharisees did not believe in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:58.420]   They are outside the Christian church.
[00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:02.340]   But nevertheless, they were always crowding around him and always putting questions to
[00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:03.340]   him.
[00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:05.740]   They couldn't leave him alone.
[00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:10.100]   That's the great record that we get in the pages of these four Gospels.
[00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:13.780]   Wherever he was, they went and they watched him and they tried to catch him and they put
[00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:15.260]   their questions to him.
[00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.060]   They were baffled by him.
[00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:19.580]   They were troubled by him.
[00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:21.380]   But they remained outside.
[00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:23.980]   Now I say there are large numbers of people like that today.
[00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:26.620]   They are the modern Pharisees.
[00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:28.300]   They don't believe in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:29.300]   They're not Christians.
[00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.420]   Yet they can't leave him alone.
[00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:33.780]   They can't leave his faith alone.
[00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:34.980]   They're always talking about it.
[00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:36.820]   They're always asking questions.
[00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:42.300]   They're doing in this age exactly what these Pharisees did so long ago.
[00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:48.700]   Now my proposition this evening is this.
[00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:54.060]   That there's only one cause for that kind of trouble.
[00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:58.260]   And that is they've never seen him.
[00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.660]   They don't know him.
[00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:02.500]   They've missed the glory.
[00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:06.740]   All day, like the ancient Pharisees, will say, "No, no, that isn't it at all.
[00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:12.060]   I'm in trouble about this or that, the supernatural, the miraculous, the two natures in theâ€¦"
[00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:14.660]   They say they've got a multiplicity of difficulties.
[00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:17.900]   All I'm saying by way of reply is this.
[00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:26.100]   That really to meet him is to cause all these separate individual difficulties to vanish
[00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:30.740]   as the morning mist does before the rising sun.
[00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:32.780]   They all just disappear.
[00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:37.140]   There is only one key to the multiplicity of problems.
[00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:44.040]   It is the person of the Lord Jesus Christ himself.
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:50.740]   And I'm holding it before you in the hope that looking on objectively, someone in this
[00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:57.500]   congregation who may be in that position or in that condition may see the whole thing.
[00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:03.180]   I trust you'll see yourself in the picture I'm going to hold before you of the Pharisees.
[00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:09.180]   And then I trust it will create a feeling of abhorrence and disgust in you, that you
[00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:11.620]   should be like that at all.
[00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:16.300]   And that will help your eyes to be opened, that you may see him and look at him without
[00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:19.860]   your prejudices and your preconceived notions.
[00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:26.940]   And seeing something of his glory will fall down at his feet and begin to receive those
[00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:30.220]   blessings that he alone can give.
[00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:39.380]   Now here we are, approaching the season of Good Friday and Easter, the period of the
[00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:44.980]   year that reminds us of the death of the Lord Jesus Christ on the cross on Calvary's Hill,
[00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:48.620]   his burial in a grave, and his subsequent resurrection.
[00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:54.980]   This incident, I say, helps to focus our attention upon him and especially upon those crucial
[00:10:54.980 --> 00:11:00.420]   events and happenings in his earthly life and history.
[00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:04.740]   Very well, all I have to do this evening is to hold two pictures before you.
[00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:14.060]   The first is the miserable picture of this King Herod and the Pharisees.
[00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:18.140]   The same day there came certain of the Pharisees saying unto him, "Get thee out and depart
[00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:26.460]   into the mountains, for Herod, King Herod, is going to kill you."
[00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:31.140]   Now here they are, you see, Herod and the Pharisees.
[00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:36.020]   They had agreed about one thing, and that is their desire to get rid of him.
[00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:42.020]   There were great differences between the Herod party, the Herodians, and the Pharisees.
[00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:44.180]   You can read the history for yourselves.
[00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:48.560]   The King's party, the Herodians, had a very different point of view on many, many subjects
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:49.940]   from the Pharisees.
[00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:52.740]   The Herodians were primarily politicians.
[00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:57.260]   These others were people who studied the law and were the religious leaders and authorities
[00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:58.700]   and teachers.
[00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:03.120]   On the surface there were many differences between them, but you will find as you read
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:08.620]   the Gospels that they were made one when they confronted Jesus Christ.
[00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:14.620]   They were both equally opposed to him, and so they are on this occasion here, though
[00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:17.060]   on the surface it looks as if they are not.
[00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:23.340]   But I will show you in a moment how they were, both parties, equally anxious to get rid of
[00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:24.340]   him.
[00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:29.140]   Now here I want to make a preliminary observation.
[00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:35.220]   Isn't there something almost incredible about this?
[00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:43.660]   Here stands the Son of God in all his nobility and the glory of his person, the one who was
[00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:49.540]   always going about and doing good, the thing people say they are interested in.
[00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:52.220]   They don't want doctrine, they say they want practical goodness.
[00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:57.500]   If ever one lived to do practical goodness, it was this Jesus of Nazareth, healing the
[00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:03.420]   sick, having time always to commiserate and to be compassionate towards those who were
[00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:05.340]   in trouble and in need.
[00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:10.500]   Oh, as Peter says, he went about doing good.
[00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:15.500]   The smoking flax he did not quench, and the bruised reed he did not break.
[00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:17.980]   Nobody could rarely bring any charge against him.
[00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:19.740]   They tried to do so, but they couldn't.
[00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:21.140]   They couldn't establish it.
[00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:24.500]   There was nothing to be said against him.
[00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:30.540]   And yet look at these miserable people, trying to trip him and to trap him, trying to get
[00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:32.780]   rid of him.
[00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:38.740]   What a sad, I say, what a sorry picture it presents to us.
[00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:42.180]   What was the matter with these people?
[00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:43.980]   Why did they behave like this?
[00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:51.340]   Why did they react like this to this blessed Son of God, the greatest benefactor that this
[00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:53.180]   world has ever known?
[00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:56.340]   Well, the answers are given to us here quite plainly.
[00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:58.300]   There were two main reasons for their trouble.
[00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:04.060]   The first was this, and I want to emphasize it again.
[00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:10.020]   They seem to have been utterly blind to the evidence that was staring them in the face.
[00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:11.180]   What do you mean, says someone?
[00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:16.220]   Well, our Lord here reminds them of the evidence.
[00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:21.380]   Go and tell that fox, "Behold, I cast out devils."
[00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:28.580]   He means, "I am going on to cast out devils and to do cures today and tomorrow."
[00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:33.460]   That's the evidence.
[00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:37.140]   And they knew that it was the evidence.
[00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:41.380]   Before their very eyes, he had been doing these very things.
[00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:43.380]   He had been casting out devils.
[00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:46.140]   People were brought to him devil-possessed.
[00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:47.500]   Nobody could do anything with them.
[00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:50.380]   Think of the men of Gadara, a legion of devils.
[00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:52.340]   They bound him with fetters and with chains.
[00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:55.740]   They had done everything, but they couldn't tame him.
[00:14:55.740 --> 00:15:02.340]   At a word from our Lord, he is to be seen seated and clothed and in his right mind.
[00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:06.620]   Look at the boy at the foot of the Mount of Transfiguration.
[00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:10.860]   There is a boy, call him epileptic if you like, call him what you like, but there was
[00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:13.860]   a boy for whom nothing could be done.
[00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:17.260]   Even the disciples of our Lord couldn't do anything for him.
[00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:24.060]   Yet in a moment, our Lord exercises, drives out the devil, and the boy is restored to
[00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:25.060]   his father.
[00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:33.860]   Cast out devils, likewise with miracles, healing the sick, giving sight to the blind, raising
[00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:39.780]   the dead, calming the raging storm at sea.
[00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:42.460]   All these things were happening before their eyes.
[00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:48.220]   And yet they couldn't see it.
[00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:49.540]   What was the matter with these people?
[00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:54.700]   Why couldn't they work out the logic of the position that was confronting them?
[00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:59.260]   Surely the obvious thing to say was this, "Who is this man?
[00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.540]   Whence this power?"
[00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:03.900]   The common people said that.
[00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:07.340]   They said, "We have seen strange things today."
[00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:09.420]   They detected even a note in his authority.
[00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:15.820]   They said, "This man speaks with authority not as the Pharisees and scribes.
[00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:17.860]   Whence has come this knowledge to him?
[00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:18.860]   He is not a Pharisee.
[00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:20.660]   He is not trained in their schools.
[00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:21.980]   He is a carpenter.
[00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:25.700]   We know he is a lowly man, Jesus of Nazareth."
[00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:29.820]   Well then the obvious question to ask was this, "Well, how does he do it?
[00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:35.180]   What is the explanation of this power, this exercising of devils, this working of healing
[00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:36.180]   miracles?
[00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:37.380]   What is this?
[00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:38.380]   How does he get it?
[00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:40.860]   What is the explanation?"
[00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:46.140]   The evidence was staring them in the face as he reminds them.
[00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:50.700]   But you see they were so blinded by prejudice they never even looked at it.
[00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:53.100]   They had got preconceived notions and ideas.
[00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:56.620]   They were arguing about certain odd points on which they were very keen, and they never
[00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:57.620]   faced him.
[00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:59.860]   That is what men and women are still doing.
[00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:02.060]   They start with their theories and their ideas.
[00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:08.420]   They never really looked at Christ and tried to explain him because he cannot be explained
[00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:14.100]   except in one way, and that is that he is the Son of God.
[00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:18.380]   Did you notice how it was put there in that passage which we read at the beginning tonight
[00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:21.220]   in this twelfth chapter of John's Gospel?
[00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:29.380]   "Though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him."
[00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:32.940]   It was in spite of the evidence that they did not believe.
[00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:40.300]   They were blinded by their prejudices.
[00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:50.660]   That is still the sole explanation of why any individual is not a Christian.
[00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:53.340]   "No, no, but you see, it is not that, you know.
[00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:55.660]   It is my brain, it is my intelligence."
[00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:58.980]   But my dear friend, there are people with equal brains and intelligence who do believe
[00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:00.540]   in him, so it cannot be that.
[00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:03.780]   "Ah, but you say it is my knowledge, it is my knowledge of science."
[00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:07.300]   There are men who have greater knowledge than you have of science who do believe in him.
[00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:08.300]   It cannot be that.
[00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:13.300]   No, no, there is only one explanation.
[00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:17.020]   It is this tragic blindness.
[00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:23.420]   If our Gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost, in whom the God of this world hath
[00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:29.380]   blinded the eyes and the minds of them that believe, not lest they believe the glorious
[00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:30.980]   Gospel of Christ.
[00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:33.140]   It is the old trouble of the Pharisees.
[00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:35.660]   The evidence was there, they could not see it.
[00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:39.740]   Preoccupied with these other things, they could not see what was staring them in the
[00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:40.740]   face.
[00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:42.660]   It is still the trouble.
[00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:48.720]   And that, of course, in turn, led to the second thing which comes out so plainly in these
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:51.380]   three verses.
[00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:52.380]   What was that?
[00:18:52.380 --> 00:19:00.380]   Well, of course, failing to realize who he was and what was true about him.
[00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:05.020]   They then naturally exaggerated their own powers and their own abilities.
[00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:06.020]   What do you mean, Sir Simon?
[00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:08.140]   Well, I mean this.
[00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:11.580]   These people thought that they could deceive him.
[00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:15.980]   The very Pharisees that came to him with this statement about Herod, these men who told
[00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:18.420]   him, "Get out of here, Herod is going to kill you."
[00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:23.500]   You know, as they were saying it, they really believed they were deceiving him.
[00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:26.420]   They always thought they could deceive him.
[00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:28.660]   You read the four Gospels.
[00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:33.380]   You will find that these Pharisees and scribes and Sadducees and doctors of the law were
[00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:35.500]   always absolutely confident.
[00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:39.140]   When they came with their questions, they pretended to be quite honest.
[00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:40.460]   They thought they were taking him in.
[00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:42.180]   They had got a catch in the question.
[00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:43.700]   They wanted him to commit himself.
[00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:48.380]   But he always knew, he said, "Why tempt me, hypocrites."
[00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:49.660]   But they never realized it.
[00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:52.840]   They were so confident of their own cleverness.
[00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:56.500]   You know, this is why people are not Christians.
[00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:59.540]   The modern man thinks he is very clever in not being a Christian.
[00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:01.420]   Ah, he knows a thing or two.
[00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:03.220]   He can be clever and subtle.
[00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:08.020]   Oh, the tragedy of this self-deception.
[00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:13.380]   That men and women should think that they can deceive the Son of God.
[00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:16.180]   They say, "But you know, I really am interested.
[00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:17.180]   I am not a hypocrite.
[00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:18.180]   I am not pretentious.
[00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:19.180]   I really am interested."
[00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:21.760]   My friend, the trouble with you is you are not.
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:26.020]   If you were really interested, you would soon believe.
[00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:27.540]   The second thing is this.
[00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:29.780]   They think they can frighten him.
[00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:35.820]   "Get thee out," they said, "and depart hence, for Herod will kill thee."
[00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:39.580]   They expected him to go at once and say, "Thank you very much," and escape for his life.
[00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:42.060]   They really thought they could frighten him.
[00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:47.340]   They kept on thinking that.
[00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:51.500]   And thirdly, and of course, most serious of all, they thought that they could foil him
[00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:58.900]   and his purpose and frustrate his plans.
[00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:02.600]   They are trying to move him, to get him out, to get him up to Jerusalem.
[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:06.460]   They see he is working on a plan, and they really believe they have got it in their power
[00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:12.260]   to frustrate his plan.
[00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:17.960]   That I suppose is the ultimate sin.
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:22.420]   That men and women should think that they have got it in their power to frustrate the
[00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:29.480]   plan of Almighty God.
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:34.220]   To me, that is the one big explanation of what has been happening in this world during
[00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:37.100]   the last century.
[00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:41.260]   Man in his knowledge, especially scientific knowledge, has been persuading himself that
[00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:43.220]   he rarely can do without God.
[00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:44.820]   He has turned his back on God.
[00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:46.260]   He is ignoring God.
[00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:51.820]   He is going to run the world and do things as he wants to.
[00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:56.580]   But history is proving that he cannot.
[00:21:56.580 --> 00:22:02.300]   God reigns, God rules, God is still there at the back, and nothing can frustrate the
[00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:04.540]   plan and the purpose of God.
[00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:09.460]   Men in his folly, like these Pharisees, are trying to frustrate it, but they cannot.
[00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:10.460]   They never will.
[00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:15.960]   They have been trying throughout the running centuries, and the whole history of civilization
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:19.300]   is the failure of mankind to do so.
[00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:23.100]   The Lord reigneth.
[00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:25.800]   Let the people tremble.
[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:29.300]   These people were confident that they could frustrate his plans.
[00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:34.540]   Very well, there are the things that I see in King Herod and his followers, and in these
[00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:39.740]   Pharisees who are allying themselves with him to bring their own purposes to pass.
[00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:43.900]   Let us turn from them.
[00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:49.780]   Let us look at the other picture, the picture of the Son of God.
[00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:55.820]   And does he not stand out by contrast in the majesty and the glory and the magnificence
[00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:59.860]   of his holy person?
[00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:03.660]   How miserably he makes them look.
[00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:06.660]   There is not a suspicion of fear in his whole demeanor.
[00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:08.660]   It is not a terrifying thing.
[00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:11.940]   He just stands and smiles at them.
[00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:19.580]   "Today and tomorrow I do cures, and the third day I shall be perfected.
[00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:24.220]   I must walk today and tomorrow and the day following."
[00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:30.420]   He just stands like a rock, and they are like the foolish waves, dashing themselves against
[00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:33.340]   him, imagining that they can knock him over and move him.
[00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:34.340]   Of course they cannot.
[00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:35.700]   Do not you see them?
[00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:40.260]   They are like moths around a candle, flying into him, thinking that they can put him out
[00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:44.660]   only to singe their own wings and to fall back, finally dead.
[00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:49.940]   How miserable they look when they come up against the majesty and the glory of his person.
[00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:56.620]   Look at the masterly way in which he handles them, telling them quietly and calmly that
[00:23:56.620 --> 00:24:02.500]   he is going on with what he has planned and what he has purposed, and that nothing can
[00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:03.860]   stop him.
[00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:04.860]   Nothing can stop him.
[00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:07.260]   There it is on the surface.
[00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:09.220]   But come, let me analyze it for you.
[00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:10.220]   What do we find in him?
[00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:16.140]   Well, the first remarkable thing one finds here is his extraordinary knowledge of men
[00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:21.260]   and of their minds and of their ways.
[00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:23.860]   I wonder whether you caught it as I read this text to you.
[00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:27.260]   Let me read it again to see if you get it.
[00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:31.460]   The same day there came certain of the Pharisees saying unto him, "Get thee out, and depart
[00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:34.540]   hence, for Herod will kill thee."
[00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:45.860]   And he said unto them, "Go ye, and tell that fox, that fox."
[00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:47.140]   That is the emphasis, you know.
[00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:50.540]   I am not manufacturing this.
[00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:55.320]   You experts on Greek, turn this text up for yourselves, and you will find that that is
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.580]   exactly the meaning here.
[00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:59.820]   He does not say, "Go and tell that fox."
[00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:06.820]   He is not the only fox.
[00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:08.860]   There are other foxes.
[00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:09.860]   Who are the others?
[00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:14.700]   Oh, the Pharisees, would put the question unto whom he was speaking.
[00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:19.500]   In other words, he is saying, "Go and tell that fox, and you foxes, listen at the same
[00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:22.220]   time."
[00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:28.300]   You see, he shows his knowledge of Herod and the Pharisees at one and the same time.
[00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:29.300]   What is he showing?
[00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:33.060]   He is showing this.
[00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:38.980]   Our Lord knew perfectly well that Herod did not intend to kill him.
[00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:46.100]   No doubt Herod had let it be known that he was going to, but Herod did not intend to.
[00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:47.460]   Herod was a coward, of course.
[00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:53.980]   You remember, he was this same Herod who was responsible for the death of John the Baptist.
[00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:56.900]   "Oh, well," you say, "but there he killed John the Baptist."
[00:25:56.900 --> 00:26:00.740]   I know he did it, but he did not want to do it.
[00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:05.380]   For we are told about him that Herod feared John, knowing that he was a holy and a good
[00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:07.740]   man and observed him.
[00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:10.260]   That means looked after him, tried to guard him.
[00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:11.260]   John was in prison.
[00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:15.660]   Herod did his utmost not to kill John the Baptist, but having made a foolish speech
[00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:20.140]   and having committed himself, he was trapped by the woman with whom he lived, and she put
[00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:24.100]   the message into the mouth of her daughter to get rid of John, and then for his oath's
[00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:25.100]   sake.
[00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:27.580]   He was a bit ashamed not to do what he said he would do.
[00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:30.980]   He had to behead John the Baptist, but he was a coward.
[00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:32.380]   He did not enjoy killing people.
[00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:36.140]   He was afraid of killing people, but he was a man who was a typical coward who could talk
[00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:39.460]   big, and he said he was going to kill Jesus.
[00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:41.460]   He did not want to.
[00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:46.300]   All he really wanted was to get Jesus out of his own particular territory, for when
[00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:52.340]   these things were happening, Jesus was in the territory where Herod had a certain amount
[00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:56.100]   of authority and power.
[00:26:56.100 --> 00:27:02.020]   So he lets him know at once that he sees through him, and he therefore calls him a fox, knowing
[00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:05.140]   that this will be reported to Herod.
[00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:06.140]   What does he mean?
[00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:09.500]   Well, there are two things that are true about a fox, aren't there?
[00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:13.740]   The first thing is that he is cunning, that he is scheming, that he is clever.
[00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:17.620]   Sly fox.
[00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:19.340]   That's the great characteristic of the fox.
[00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:23.660]   It was the great characteristic of this man, Herod.
[00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:26.740]   You see, you pretend one thing in order to bring about the other.
[00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:28.740]   You try to put the hounds on a false scent.
[00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:31.100]   You pretend you're going that way when you want to go this way.
[00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:32.260]   You double on your tracks.
[00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:35.140]   The fox, cunning.
[00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:40.420]   And Herod, by thus letting it be known that he is going to kill the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:42.260]   is just behaving like a fox.
[00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:43.700]   He doesn't intend it at all.
[00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:48.540]   But what he really wants is to get him out of his territory, to get him away from his
[00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:49.540]   place.
[00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:56.900]   He could see that he'd be in trouble again, as he had been in the case of John the Baptist.
[00:27:56.900 --> 00:28:00.780]   Go and tell that fox.
[00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:06.660]   There's another characteristic of a fox, of course, and that is that he has none of the
[00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:09.820]   strength and the power of a lion.
[00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:12.980]   A fox lives on his wits.
[00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:17.500]   And as I've been explaining to you, this man, King Herod had always done that.
[00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:19.940]   He's a contemptible character.
[00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:23.900]   He wobbled and vacillated over the case of John the Baptist.
[00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:24.900]   He always did.
[00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:25.900]   You can't respect him.
[00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:27.420]   There's nothing big about him.
[00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:28.420]   There's no strength.
[00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:30.620]   He's a weakling.
[00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:35.660]   Go and tell that fox.
[00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:43.220]   In that pregnant phrase, he analyzes, unmasks, and reveals his knowledge of the character
[00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:46.940]   of this King Herod.
[00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:52.340]   But at the same time, as I'm indicating to you, he reveals his knowledge of the Pharisees.
[00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:53.340]   How does he do that?
[00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:56.980]   You say, "Well, like this."
[00:28:56.980 --> 00:29:01.900]   Here come the Pharisees saying to him, as would be friends, "Get thee out and depart
[00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:04.060]   hence, for Herod will kill thee."
[00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:08.180]   They sound as if they're the friends of the Lord Jesus Christ, don't they?
[00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:11.620]   But they were not.
[00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:15.140]   They were his bitterest enemies.
[00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:18.380]   But here they are behaving like foxes also.
[00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:23.820]   They affect, they simulate an interest in his well-being and in his personal safety.
[00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:26.580]   They seem to be anxious to save him from death.
[00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:27.780]   But what were they really out for?
[00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:28.900]   Well, I can tell you.
[00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:29.900]   And our Lord knew it.
[00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:32.820]   That's why he calls them foxes also.
[00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:34.260]   What they wanted was this.
[00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:40.820]   They wanted to get him out of Herod's territory, and they wanted him to hurry up to Jerusalem.
[00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:41.820]   Why?
[00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:46.940]   Well, because they knew very well that if they could only get him to Jerusalem, they
[00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:50.420]   would soon encompass his death.
[00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:53.220]   They were already planning and plotting to put him to death.
[00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:56.820]   They'd never do it while he was up there, but once they get him to Jerusalem, they can
[00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:59.100]   bring in the draw in the net.
[00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:00.300]   They can put him on trial.
[00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:02.420]   They can put questions to him that will trap him.
[00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:06.820]   They'll trump up their case, and then they'll put it to the authorities, and thus they're
[00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:07.820]   going to get rid of him.
[00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:08.820]   Oh, the foxes!
[00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:18.900]   The sly foxes, pretending to be his enemies, but the whole time much more anxious than
[00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:21.020]   miserable Herod was to kill him.
[00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:25.780]   Thus they dissimulate and pretend, but our Lord exposes it all.
[00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:30.020]   Tell that fox, and listen yourselves, you foxes.
[00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:35.420]   I know exactly what you're thinking and what is at the back of your minds.
[00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:41.300]   Because he stands out in all the glory and the magnificence of his holy personality as
[00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:43.820]   a man who reads all men.
[00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:50.420]   All things are naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.
[00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:55.140]   He reads us as an open book.
[00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:59.460]   And when you and I are talking brilliantly and cleverly and voicing our objections against
[00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:05.020]   Christianity and talking about our difficulties, he is looking at your miserable life, at your
[00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:10.140]   wretched moral failure, at the jealousy and the envy and the ugliness and the foulness
[00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:11.900]   that is in your heart.
[00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:20.700]   He knows all about us, and he knows that every one of us is a fox, a sham and a pretense,
[00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:27.580]   despicable, not rarely appearing as we actually and truly are.
[00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:30.780]   That fox.
[00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:36.740]   Then I mustn't stay to talk about his power, which he reminds them of, exercising devil's
[00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:37.740]   healing.
[00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:42.740]   Oh, there is no limit to this man's power.
[00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:45.780]   This is the Son of God.
[00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:51.260]   But let me hurry to the next thing, which is, of course, one of the most remarkable
[00:31:51.260 --> 00:32:01.020]   things of all in this particular incident, and that is his teaching concerning his death.
[00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:04.260]   Have you noticed what he tells us here concerning his death?
[00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:06.220]   There are two main matters.
[00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:14.460]   The first is that his death did not come unexpectedly to him.
[00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:18.380]   It didn't take him by surprise at all.
[00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:22.820]   Many people think it did, you know, that here was this innocent, pure man just going about
[00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:26.180]   with his teaching and his doing good, and these cruel people were plotting.
[00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:30.220]   And suddenly he finds himself arrested, and his work comes to an end, and he cries out
[00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:33.300]   in despair, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
[00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:34.300]   The end has come.
[00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:35.300]   It's all up."
[00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:36.300]   A failure.
[00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:45.020]   Oh, what a complete misunderstanding of him and of his death in particular.
[00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:50.180]   Here he shows so plainly that his death was no surprise to him.
[00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:52.460]   He tells them that he knows certain things about it.
[00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:53.460]   What are they?
[00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:54.660]   Well, here's the first.
[00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:56.860]   He knows when he's going to die.
[00:32:56.860 --> 00:32:57.860]   When's that?
[00:32:57.860 --> 00:32:59.660]   Well, this is how he puts it.
[00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:05.540]   "Go and tell that fox Herod, 'Behold, I cast out devils, and I do cures today and
[00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:08.660]   tomorrow, and the third day I shall be perfected.'"
[00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:09.660]   He repeats it.
[00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:14.820]   "I must walk today and tomorrow and the day following."
[00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:15.820]   What's that?
[00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:21.900]   Well, that's just a proverbial way, which was very common at that time, of saying that
[00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:26.900]   he knows that he hasn't got much longer to live.
[00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:34.060]   It doesn't mean exactly and precisely three days, but it does mean a short period of time.
[00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:37.660]   "Today, tomorrow, the third day.
[00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:38.780]   I haven't got long.
[00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:39.780]   My end is coming."
[00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:40.780]   He knew it.
[00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:41.780]   He's telling them.
[00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:42.780]   "I'm going to die.
[00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:47.320]   Do you know what I'm going to?"
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:51.320]   He knows when he's going to die.
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:56.780]   Secondly, he knows where he's going to die.
[00:33:56.780 --> 00:34:02.780]   "It's all right," he says, "and I can see the smile on his face as he says it.
[00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:07.500]   You tell me," he said to the Pharisees, "that I'm going to be killed by Herod just here."
[00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:08.500]   It's not true.
[00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:11.260]   I'm not going to.
[00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:14.220]   I am going to be killed, but it isn't going to be here.
[00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:24.900]   It's going to be in Jerusalem, for it cannot be that a prophet should perish out of Jerusalem.
[00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:30.740]   He knows exactly where he's going to die.
[00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:36.740]   And thirdly, he tells them that he knows exactly how he's going to die.
[00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:43.340]   "It's all right," he said, "Herod isn't going to kill me.
[00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:45.860]   I am not going to die at the hands of Herod.
[00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:55.940]   I am going to die in Jerusalem, and I am going to die as the result of the plot that you
[00:34:55.940 --> 00:35:02.900]   Pharisees, together with the Sadducees and these Herodians and others, are already plotting
[00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:04.700]   actively against me.
[00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:08.780]   You're going to get me up to Jerusalem, and then you're going to put me on trial.
[00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:14.060]   You're going to plead with the Roman governor that if he really is a true servant of Caesar,
[00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:18.940]   that I'm a danger and a menace.
[00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:25.660]   You're going to stage a great play and a great occasion up at Jerusalem.
[00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:32.740]   And it will be thus as the result of a great public trial, and after I've been submitted
[00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:39.340]   to all sorts of indignities and cruelties, then I shall be put to death.
[00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:44.700]   It will happen not here, but before the whole world in Jerusalem, and it will involve an
[00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:52.500]   exposure of all the foulness and the subtlety and the fox-like character of you Pharisees
[00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:59.780]   and scribes and all your collaborators in opposition to the kingdom of my God and my
[00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:00.780]   Father."
[00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:03.020]   That's what he tells them.
[00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:05.540]   Have you seen it here?
[00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:09.460]   Did you see what I meant at the beginning when I warned you to be careful when you read
[00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:10.460]   the Scriptures?
[00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:13.300]   "Turn but a stone, start a wing"?
[00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:14.620]   He's telling them.
[00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:16.140]   He knows all about his death.
[00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:17.820]   It doesn't come suddenly upon him.
[00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:18.980]   He's aware of it all.
[00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:20.580]   He knows where, when, how.
[00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:27.380]   He knows everything about it.
[00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:31.180]   But still more important is his view of his death.
[00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:37.020]   "Ah," he says, "these people, you are talking about my death.
[00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:38.420]   You don't understand my death.
[00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:39.980]   You know nothing about my death.
[00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:41.540]   I'll tell you about my death."
[00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:42.540]   Listen to him.
[00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:43.540]   Here is the way he puts it.
[00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:53.620]   "Go and tell that fox, 'Behold, I cast out devils and I do cures today and tomorrow.
[00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:59.660]   And the third day I shall be perfected.'"
[00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:00.660]   What's this?
[00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:03.560]   "I shall be perfected."
[00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:05.380]   This is a very good translation.
[00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:08.700]   There are some people who say wrongly that he meant this.
[00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:13.280]   "Behold, I cast out devils and I do cures today and tomorrow.
[00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:16.140]   And the third day I shall finish the work."
[00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:17.540]   He said nothing of the sort.
[00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:19.580]   This is in the passive tense.
[00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:21.760]   It is something that's going to happen to him.
[00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:22.760]   This is right.
[00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:26.860]   "I shall be perfected."
[00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:28.860]   What is this?
[00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:34.380]   Well, you may prefer another translation which can put it like this.
[00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:40.940]   "Behold, I cast out devils and I do cures today and tomorrow.
[00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:47.780]   And the third day I am at the goal or I am led to the goal.
[00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:52.380]   The goal, the end, I shall be perfected."
[00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:54.400]   What does he mean?
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:58.020]   What he means is this.
[00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:05.040]   Casting out devils, healings, teaching.
[00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:06.040]   What are they?
[00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:07.040]   They are not the goal.
[00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:08.040]   They are but preliminaries.
[00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:09.040]   They are but introductions.
[00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:10.040]   These are subsidiary.
[00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:11.040]   These are not the end.
[00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:12.040]   These are not the goal.
[00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:13.040]   He didn't come to teach only, as so many are telling us today.
[00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:26.640]   He didn't merely come to heal, as so many are telling us.
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:28.840]   He didn't merely come to cast out devils.
[00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:29.840]   What did he come?
[00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:30.840]   What's the goal?
[00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:32.400]   What's the end?
[00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:36.360]   How is he perfected?
[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:40.200]   And there's only one answer.
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:43.560]   It is his death.
[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:46.120]   You are talking about my death, he says.
[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:48.800]   You're telling me to escape, to save my life.
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:51.060]   For if I'm killed, I can't go on teaching.
[00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:53.320]   If I'm killed, I can't go out casting out devils.
[00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:55.400]   If I'm killed, I can't go on healing.
[00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:56.400]   Save yourself.
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:57.400]   Get away.
[00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:58.400]   No, no, he says.
[00:38:58.400 --> 00:38:59.400]   You don't understand it.
[00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:03.320]   I'm going to die, but far from running away from it.
[00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:06.280]   I set my faith steadfastly to go to Jerusalem.
[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:07.280]   Why?
[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:16.000]   Because I know I shall be perfect.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.240]   I'm not complete until that happens.
[00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:21.400]   What does he mean by this?
[00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:34.880]   He means by this, that the end and his object in coming into this world was to die.
[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:39.600]   That's what the Pharisees and their audience never understood.
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:42.960]   That's what men and women who say they're in trouble and difficulties about the Christian
[00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:43.960]   faith never understand.
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:47.000]   They say, "Oh, I like his teaching.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.720]   I like to follow his example, but that path of his, I can't get it."
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:51.720]   Of course you can't.
[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:53.680]   If you got that, you'd get everything.
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:55.080]   He came to do that.
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:56.160]   That's the goal.
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:40:00.800]   If you don't see that, all the rest is in vain.
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:02.560]   Why did he die?
[00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:05.040]   What was happening when he died upon the cross?
[00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:11.000]   Well, the apostle Peter, you see, who at first was stumbled by his death and was disappointed
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:15.880]   and unhappy and miserable and felt the end had come and said with the others, "We thought
[00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:20.880]   that it had been he that would have restored the kingdom to Israel, but he's been killed."
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:30.640]   Later he's filled with the Spirit and he says, "In being delivered by the determinate counsel
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:38.880]   and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken and by wicked hands have crucified and slain."
[00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:43.880]   That's it.
[00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:46.920]   His death upon the cross was not an accident.
[00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:55.120]   It was according to the predeterminate counsel and foreknowledge of God.
[00:40:55.120 --> 00:41:00.360]   God sent his Son into this world to die.
[00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:01.640]   That's the goal.
[00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:05.760]   Listen to the evidence.
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:11.080]   We see Jesus as the author of the epistle to the Hebrews in the second chapter, verse
[00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:15.440]   9, who has made a little earth and the angels, what for?
[00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:25.440]   For the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor, that he by the grace of God might
[00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:31.320]   taste death for every man.
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:36.960]   Did you notice how our Lord himself put it in the twelfth chapter of John's Gospel, verse
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:45.640]   23, "The hour is come that the Son of Man should be glorified."
[00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:49.480]   Glorified, what's he talking about?
[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:53.560]   He's talking about his death.
[00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:56.280]   This is the most glorious thing in his history.
[00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:57.280]   Listen to him as he goes on.
[00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:00.920]   "Now is my soul troubled, and what shall I say?
[00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:03.440]   Father, save me from this hour?
[00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:05.120]   Shall I say that?
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:06.120]   No.
[00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:10.800]   But for this cause came I unto this hour."
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:12.040]   What's he doing in this world?
[00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:13.440]   Why has he come?
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:14.800]   Is it merely to teach?
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:16.720]   Is it merely to cast out devils?
[00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:17.720]   Is it merely to heal?
[00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:18.720]   No, no.
[00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:22.840]   He's come to die, to be a high priest.
[00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:28.000]   He's the sacrifice, the offering, the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the whole
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   world.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:36.160]   There he's perfected, and only there.
[00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:45.320]   "Today and tomorrow I do, I cast out devils and I do cures.
[00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:49.080]   And the third day I shall be perfected.
[00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:51.040]   I shall complete the work.
[00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:52.320]   I'll offer myself.
[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:53.320]   I'll sanctify myself.
[00:42:53.320 --> 00:43:01.040]   I'll lay myself there, and God will do the final act, my glorification, my perfection
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:04.280]   as the Saviour of the souls of men.
[00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:05.280]   That's how I do it."
[00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:13.960]   That's what it means.
[00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:18.400]   He is perfected as the Saviour.
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:30.160]   "When your sins and mine were laid upon him, and God struck him and smote him, punishing
[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:34.440]   your guilt and mine in him."
[00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:45.760]   Oh, he says to these Pharisees, "Go and tell your collaborator, your fellow fox, that you
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:53.600]   don't understand me, you don't know me, you don't know anything about my purpose.
[00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:55.600]   You can't kill me.
[00:43:55.600 --> 00:44:02.080]   There is only one who can.
[00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:10.360]   The one who is going to make me to be sin, though I know no sin.
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:18.520]   The one who is going to put the sins of men upon me and punish them, and make a sin offering
[00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:19.520]   of me.
[00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:28.240]   I am the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the whole world.
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:30.360]   I shall come to the goal.
[00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:36.040]   I'll come to the end for which I was sent.
[00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:46.360]   The work that I was sent to accomplish will be finished and will be completed."
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:50.360]   That is his teaching about his death.
[00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:52.440]   Have you seen it?
[00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:55.480]   Have you recognized its significance?
[00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:58.240]   His death is the way of salvation.
[00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:00.480]   It is by dying he saves.
[00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:01.480]   It's the goal.
[00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:02.480]   It's the center.
[00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:09.520]   It's the focus of it all.
[00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:20.440]   To miss or to dispute or to deny that is to fail to know him as your savior.
[00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:25.920]   It is to die in your sins.
[00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:36.120]   So I would quietly draw these conclusions with you from this incident.
[00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:40.480]   No man can interfere with his purpose.
[00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:43.280]   Herod couldn't.
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:46.640]   The Pharisees couldn't.
[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:47.640]   No one could.
[00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:50.480]   That's what he's telling them.
[00:45:50.480 --> 00:46:02.240]   The Father's plan is going to be carried out perfectly in his own time, in his own way,
[00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:06.880]   in his own place.
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:17.080]   He is going to die according to the predeterminate counsel and foreknowledge of God.
[00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:22.880]   Herod can't stop it.
[00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:28.120]   No one could stop it.
[00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:36.280]   And so the final lesson is this.
[00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:42.160]   There is another section to his purpose.
[00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:55.360]   It is not yet completed, but it will be completed.
[00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:57.360]   What is this?
[00:46:57.360 --> 00:47:05.080]   He is coming back into the world to rule and to reign.
[00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:19.200]   He is coming back to destroy his enemies, to gather his people unto himself.
[00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:24.880]   And what this message tells us is this.
[00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:28.640]   Nothing and no one can stop it.
[00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:38.160]   The march of science, the increase in knowledge, the godlessness of men is nothing.
[00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:45.200]   Herod and the Pharisees did their utmost to foil his plan.
[00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:47.200]   They couldn't.
[00:47:47.200 --> 00:48:00.200]   And man in the height of his folly will be equally unable to frustrate or to foil the
[00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:06.520]   future program of the Son of God.
[00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:11.120]   Let the world do what it wills.
[00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:18.280]   In his own appointed time he will come.
[00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:26.440]   Riding the cloud of heaven surrounded by his early angels, he will come, he will judge
[00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:29.040]   the world in righteousness.
[00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:32.280]   He will separate the sheep and the goats.
[00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:40.680]   He will take his people unto himself, and all who have rejected him will be sent to
[00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:46.040]   their everlasting and eternal perdition.
[00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:47.680]   Nothing can stop it.
[00:48:47.680 --> 00:49:05.280]   Today, tomorrow, the third day, the goal, the end, the absolute, it will come.
[00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:07.920]   What is the message?
[00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:10.920]   Isn't it obvious?
[00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:23.320]   "Case the son, lest he be angry and he perish from the way, while his wrath is kindled but
[00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:24.320]   a little.
[00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:37.080]   Blessed are they that put their trust in him."
[00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:40.600]   He is God the Son.
[00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:43.280]   He knows all.
[00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:47.840]   He has all power.
[00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:53.800]   If you attempt to fight him or to frustrate him, you will be crushed.
[00:49:53.800 --> 00:50:06.080]   There is nothing that can make him, his purpose, forego.
[00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:22.080]   Today, tomorrow, the third day, the goal, the consummation, the final judgment, the
[00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:28.880]   ushering in of the everlasting kingdom.
[00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:36.520]   My dear friend, have you seen him?
[00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:41.480]   Have you recognized him?
[00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:44.120]   Have you seen his glory?
[00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:45.720]   Have you seen his power?
[00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:49.320]   Have you seen his purpose?
[00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:54.120]   Have you seen the meaning of his death?
[00:50:54.120 --> 00:51:04.560]   Have you realized that your judgment and that of the whole world is in his hands?
[00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:13.560]   Oh, as you look at these miserable Pharisees and Herodians, see their unutterable folly,
[00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:22.120]   turn away from them, believe on him, recognize his miracles, his power, all his claims, fall
[00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:33.160]   at his feet and give yourself unreservedly to him, the Savior of your soul, the one who
[00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:37.760]   came to die for you.
[00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:51.160]   And the Lord of lords and the King of kings, kiss the Son while there is still time.
[00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:54.200]   Amen.
[00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:58.120]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
