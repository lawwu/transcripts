[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   A lot of the Soviet high growth was rebuilding after the war, which central planning can do relatively well, right?
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   You see government rebuilding. Cities, say in Germany, that works pretty well.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.500]   But most of all, and this is even before World War II, just urbanization.
[00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.000]   It shouldn't be underrated today, given we've observed China, but so much of Chinese growth was driven by urbanization.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   So much of Soviet growth, you take someone working on a farm, producing almost nothing, put them in a city.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   Even under a bad system, they're going to be a lot more productive.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   And that drove so much of Soviet growth before and after the war.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   But that at some point more or less ends, as it has.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   Well, it hasn't quite ended with China, but it's certainly slowed down.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   And people don't pay enough attention to that. I don't know why. It now seems pretty obvious.
