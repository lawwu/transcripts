[00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.940]   and I'm wondering what some good financial planning things
[00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.020]   to do are for newlyweds.
[00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.920]   - Congratulations.
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:01.760]   That's great.
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:02.580]   - Thank you.
[00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:03.620]   - So how old are you?
[00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.860]   - I just turned 41.
[00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.560]   - And is your wife of a similar age?
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.500]   - Late 30s, yep.
[00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.320]   - Okay.
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.700]   So you have benefits and disadvantages
[00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.400]   of being older than many people.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.700]   At 41, you would be at this point
[00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.200]   much more stable in your life, I would imagine.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.980]   And with your wife is also similar in age,
[00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.940]   you guys are at a different,
[00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.840]   your newly married life will look a little bit different
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.280]   than a 21-year-old who is entering into the same approach.
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.920]   Now, tell me a little bit about what you own,
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.860]   your living conditions, owning a house.
[00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.120]   Does she own a house?
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.600]   Like, what's your plan going forward?
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.920]   What do you have right now?
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.400]   - So we rent an apartment together.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.100]   Previously, I was renting,
[00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.000]   and she actually owned an apartment that she sold
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.840]   about a year ago.
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.500]   So we are renting.
[00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.800]   No urgency to purchase,
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.820]   'cause we live in a fairly expensive area
[00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.680]   from a housing market standpoint.
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.920]   But probably in the three to five year range,
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.660]   acquiring a home is a distinct possibility.
[00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.320]   And the proceeds from the sale of her apartment
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.300]   would probably make a pretty suitable down payment for that.
[00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.140]   - Great.
[00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.360]   Has she already sold the apartment,
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.360]   or is it on the market now?
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.240]   - Oh, no, she sold it.
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.320]   - Okay, great.
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.140]   And in terms of your income, your work,
[00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.580]   tell me a little bit about your financial flows
[00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:34.740]   through your household.
[00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:39.440]   - Sure, so I'm a professional, I'm a physician.
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.900]   I've got higher income than her.
[00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.060]   So I'm making in the sort of mid six figure range,
[00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.980]   and she's making in the very low six figure range in her job.
[00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.760]   - Okay, so household income,
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.160]   about three quarters of a million dollars-ish.
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.400]   And do--
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.000]   - It's less than that, but several six figures.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.840]   - Okay, great.
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.820]   And does, after being married,
[00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.700]   have you guys talked about anything
[00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.420]   as that relates to your career plans?
[00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.100]   Do you both plan to continue working in your careers?
[00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.940]   Are there any kind of changes or transitions
[00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.340]   that you would hope to make?
[00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.540]   - I have no career change goals.
[00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.100]   I'm very happy with where I am.
[00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:30.460]   If she got a superior offer in the industry she's in,
[00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.320]   given that my job is portable,
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.820]   I would consider relocating
[00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.580]   if she got a really great opportunity.
[00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.760]   But she also has other opportunities locally.
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.460]   So there's no plans to move.
[00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.340]   If something happened,
[00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.040]   I think we've got flexibility to do that.
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.300]   - Do you and your wife hope to have children?
[00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.020]   - Yes.
[00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.860]   - Okay.
[00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.300]   Is there any thought on when that might occur?
[00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.380]   - Well, given that we're older,
[00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.220]   probably sooner than later would be the idea.
[00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.540]   But that would be something that in the next
[00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.660]   couple of years would sort of biologically need to be.
[00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:11.500]   - Right.
[00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.980]   - Cooking, if that's gonna happen,
[00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.020]   that's gonna be in the next couple of years.
[00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.860]   - Right, right.
[00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.040]   Yeah, without question,
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.740]   one of the most important things is
[00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.960]   if you and she hope to have children,
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.220]   it will be much easier and much less expensive
[00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.320]   to do it sooner rather than later.
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.660]   Especially when a woman starts to reach her late 30s.
[00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:30.500]   And if you're a physician,
[00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.780]   of course you all know the data.
[00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.700]   But when a woman starts to reach her late 30s,
[00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.940]   it becomes much more challenging for her to have children.
[00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.780]   And then even the having of those children
[00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.700]   comes with additional risks, concerns,
[00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.820]   which can add to the cost, can add to the stress, et cetera.
[00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.560]   So definitely sooner is certainly better than later.
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.060]   If you and she were to conceive a baby,
[00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.980]   how would that affect her thoughts
[00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:54.540]   about her career and her work?
[00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.240]   Would that make any impact to you?
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:01.100]   - So I think that the,
[00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.580]   she's interested in still working ultimately
[00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:05.600]   if we have children.
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.540]   I think the big question is,
[00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:13.420]   what happens to alternate career trajectories
[00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:16.660]   she could go on versus staying in the same,
[00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.420]   for instance, making a move at that point
[00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:20.020]   might not be as appealing.
[00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:24.360]   I don't think she would stop working.
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:29.540]   I think that's as granular as we've gotten on that
[00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:30.620]   at this point though.
[00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.460]   - Got it.
[00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:37.820]   With regard to your and her financial position
[00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.820]   prior to marriage, were both of you similarly wealthy?
[00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:44.820]   Did one of you have a lot more money?
[00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:47.420]   Was one of you deeply in debt or anything like that?
[00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:53.900]   - She, other than having the apartment
[00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:58.580]   which she made money on, she has no debt.
[00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.660]   She has no student loans or anything like that.
[00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:06.660]   I still have student loans from med school.
[00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:12.660]   And I had more money saved
[00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:16.180]   by virtue of being in a higher income job.
[00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:17.560]   She's been working a little bit longer than me,
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.020]   but I've been in a higher income job for longer.
[00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:24.060]   And since I never really prioritized home ownership,
[00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:27.140]   socked more away into retirement
[00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:29.820]   and other types of investment accounts than she did.
[00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:32.580]   - Do you and she have similar attitudes
[00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:33.900]   about the spending of money
[00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.180]   or is there a significant disparity
[00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.440]   in your approaches toward spending decisions?
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:43.460]   - I think the disparity is primarily
[00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:46.420]   because I've had more disposable income than her.
[00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:50.540]   So I would say generally speaking,
[00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:54.660]   neither of us is reckless or racks up
[00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:56.780]   a bunch of credit card debt or anything like that.
[00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:00.580]   I think that she might be slightly more frugal than I am,
[00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.780]   but I think if you sort of normalized our incomes,
[00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:04.980]   I think it'd be pretty comparable.
[00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:06.460]   - One more question.
[00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:10.180]   Do you and she have any current philosophy
[00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:13.540]   that would govern your decisions around money
[00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:15.380]   and how you would handle it together?
[00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:21.020]   - I think that given that I've had more cashflow,
[00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:23.060]   I think that I'm more willing to do things
[00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:25.940]   like buy something on a credit card
[00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:27.420]   and pay it off next month
[00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:32.580]   and maybe make some larger purchases than she is
[00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:34.580]   because I've had that higher degree of cashflow.
[00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:37.180]   I think, and with a high student loan balance
[00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:39.540]   and handling that for almost a decade now,
[00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:43.380]   I think I'm more comfortable with having debt
[00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:45.740]   and paying it off through cashflow.
[00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:47.460]   And I think she hasn't had the same degree
[00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:48.460]   of cashflow before,
[00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:51.460]   so I think there's a little bit of a difference there.
[00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:52.500]   - Okay.
[00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.660]   And I should never say questions like,
[00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:55.500]   oh, this is my,
[00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:56.980]   I should never say things like final question
[00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:58.940]   'cause I always come up with one more.
[00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:04.220]   Do you and she have any kind of prenuptial
[00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:06.580]   or pre-marriage financial agreements
[00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:07.740]   between the two of you?
[00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:14.300]   - No, but her family has some holdings
[00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.380]   that are out of the country
[00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:19.180]   that by virtue of where they are
[00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:22.180]   and how they are situated,
[00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:23.900]   it's something I can't touch.
[00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:26.140]   So it's not something I wanted to touch anyway,
[00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:29.220]   but I mean, it wasn't an agreement we entered,
[00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:30.540]   it was a pre-existing agreement
[00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:32.140]   that there's nothing I can do about it.
[00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:33.380]   - Understood, okay.
[00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:35.660]   So let's start with some tactical stuff,
[00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:38.860]   just kind of very tactical stuff to clean things up.
[00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.220]   And then we talk a little bit about philosophy.
[00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:43.620]   We could do it in either philosophy first or tactics.
[00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:45.700]   The harder thing is going to be philosophy,
[00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:46.860]   but let's start with tactics.
[00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:49.140]   So first, you wanna sit down
[00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:53.640]   and make a complete accounting of everything that you have.
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:56.220]   And both of you should do this.
[00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:57.780]   Both of you should sit down
[00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:00.840]   and make a complete accounting of any bank accounts
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.480]   that you currently own,
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:07.480]   any investment accounts that you currently have,
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.260]   any credit accounts that you currently have,
[00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.460]   and talk about those with each other.
[00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:14.580]   It'd be good way to do this,
[00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:16.900]   make sure you pull your credit reports
[00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:18.540]   so you have that information
[00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:21.860]   and make sure that all the information is out there,
[00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:25.700]   that you know what's going on in each other's past.
[00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:27.740]   You know what credit cards she has,
[00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:28.660]   what credit cards you have,
[00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:29.960]   you know what accounts she has,
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:31.780]   what accounts you have, et cetera.
[00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:33.180]   Now, in my opinion,
[00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:35.680]   it would be ideal to do this before marriage.
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.060]   This should not wait until after marriage.
[00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:40.220]   - Yeah, we've already done that for the most part,
[00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:41.340]   except for the credit score.
[00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:42.180]   - Good, so at least--
[00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:43.940]   - We know roughly what our credit scores are,
[00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:46.700]   but I've never shown her my credit report.
[00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.140]   We've basically done all that.
[00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:50.580]   - Okay, so now you wanna go through those accounts
[00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:51.760]   and talk about them,
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:54.900]   and then do any kind of simple housekeeping items
[00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:55.740]   that need to be done.
[00:10:55.740 --> 00:11:00.660]   An example would be for your bank accounts,
[00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:04.060]   talk about, are we going to have joint accounts
[00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:04.900]   on everything?
[00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:07.300]   Are we gonna maintain separate accounts?
[00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:08.860]   If you're gonna maintain joint accounts,
[00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:09.860]   then you need to sign up,
[00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:12.300]   which is gonna be our primary checking account.
[00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:14.020]   How are we gonna establish this?
[00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:16.460]   Make sure that any accounts that you want to be joint
[00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:17.520]   are going to be joint.
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:20.300]   Any accounts that are gonna remain separate are separate,
[00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:22.060]   but make sure that you adjust
[00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:24.100]   any kind of beneficiary designation
[00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.520]   or any separate account.
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.520]   Make sure that there's a payable on death
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:30.020]   arrangement for that,
[00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:31.100]   since a bank account
[00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:32.980]   wouldn't have a beneficiary designation.
[00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:35.660]   But if you have any separate accounts
[00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:36.660]   that you're going to maintain
[00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:38.980]   for any reasons that you decide is important,
[00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:40.660]   then make sure that that's payable on death
[00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:42.040]   to the other person.
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.340]   Go through all of your investment accounts,
[00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:45.540]   and you need to update
[00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:47.540]   all of the beneficiary designations.
[00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.620]   Make sure that she is listed as the direct beneficiary
[00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:53.980]   on all of your 401(k) accounts,
[00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.320]   on any investment accounts, and vice versa.
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:59.520]   And then talk about your secondary beneficiaries.
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:00.800]   At this point in time,
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:04.280]   usually that would be your other direct family members,
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:05.880]   but make sure that you know about that.
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:06.960]   So if you die together,
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.000]   what would happen to the money?
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.040]   And this will be important
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.560]   as you start to move in the direction of,
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:12.400]   in the future,
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:15.820]   establishing wills and trusts together,
[00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:17.980]   to make sure that you're starting to talk about that.
[00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:20.560]   So frequently, for a newly married couple,
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:21.620]   it would look something like,
[00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:23.000]   well, we'll be direct beneficiaries
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.800]   of each other's investment accounts,
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:27.820]   but we'll keep our blood family lines
[00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:29.220]   as the secondary beneficiary.
[00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:30.840]   So if we die together,
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:35.680]   then our current assets will go to our parents,
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:38.120]   or my brother, or something like that.
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.880]   So go through and update those.
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:42.580]   Same things with insurance policies.
[00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:45.280]   Make sure that your insurance policies all get updated.
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:47.820]   So make sure that your life insurance is updated.
[00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:50.280]   Make sure that it has both the primary
[00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:52.680]   and the contingent beneficiary established.
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:55.040]   And then finally, with your credit accounts,
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.400]   go through your credit accounts
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:58.440]   and talk about your strategies.
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.640]   If you, for example,
[00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:01.480]   maybe you use an Amex Platinum
[00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:04.400]   and you wanna go ahead and add her as an authorized user
[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:05.960]   so she can get the benefits of that.
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:07.280]   Or, you know,
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:10.040]   we're gonna keep these separate credit cards,
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.040]   or we're gonna keep these credit cards together,
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:14.720]   and go through and go ahead and order authorized cards
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:15.720]   or secondary cards,
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:18.080]   whatever your personal plan is.
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:19.840]   Take a look through any other things,
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:23.200]   safety deposit box, combinations on the safe.
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.460]   Just go through all that bookkeeping
[00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:26.720]   and make sure that she knows where you hide the cash.
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:30.040]   Make sure that she knows who your financial advisor is
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:31.920]   so that if you die, she knows who to call,
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:33.360]   things like that.
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.520]   And deal with all of that bookkeeping.
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:37.240]   Now, the next thing is,
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:41.520]   start to talk about your longer-term financial goals.
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:45.340]   So you wanna think and discuss your financial goals.
[00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:48.800]   And one of the most exciting things about being newlyweds
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:51.600]   is the ability to start to make plans together
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:55.000]   on the solid foundation of togetherness.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.600]   Because now it's not a matter of,
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:58.200]   well, if we do this someday,
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.860]   now it's, okay, we're one, we're together.
[00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:02.640]   Now, what are we going to plan for?
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:04.080]   What are we going to work towards?
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:08.100]   So what I did with my wife is I'm the writer,
[00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:10.720]   and so I would give her things to try to pull things out of,
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:12.400]   I'd give her journaling assignments and say,
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:13.960]   think about this, talk about this.
[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:15.200]   And we would start to make lists.
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.520]   If we're gonna live in a house,
[00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:17.580]   here are the kinds of things
[00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:19.520]   that we'd like to have in that house.
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:21.400]   If we're gonna, and et cetera,
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:23.220]   any kind of things that you'd like to have,
[00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:25.800]   things that you'd like to do, career aspirations.
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:28.920]   Try to get those things out and get them put on paper
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:32.200]   so that they can be discussed and brainstormed
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.280]   and dreamed about together.
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:35.280]   That's a big challenge,
[00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:38.000]   because especially with your and she
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.860]   both being a little bit older,
[00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:43.680]   for all of your life, you've made your plans individually.
[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.960]   You've not had to consider another person.
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:47.800]   And she has made her plans individually.
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:49.880]   She's not had to consider another person.
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:51.640]   But now you have to consider one another,
[00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:52.960]   and you have to work and say,
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:56.180]   how do we actually consider one another's goals?
[00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:58.380]   There will be goals that each of you has
[00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:00.520]   that are in direct conflict.
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:03.100]   You may want to go right, she wants to go left.
[00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:05.800]   Well, you can't go together, both right and left.
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:08.640]   And so you have to think about how do we accomplish this?
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:13.200]   How do we find an option that will fulfill those things
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:15.100]   that are important to both of us?
[00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:16.700]   Sometimes this is easy.
[00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:18.680]   Sometimes this is very hard.
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.260]   And so sometimes you have to look
[00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.200]   for a third or fourth option.
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.600]   Sometimes you make a plan and say, for right now,
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:26.420]   for example, you talk about careers.
[00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:28.760]   She has an exciting opportunity.
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:31.240]   She wants to move into this different career path.
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:33.780]   Then you might need to change and move to a different city.
[00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:37.220]   And so if that's gonna happen, that should happen soon.
[00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:38.960]   If it's not gonna happen, then you figure out,
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:40.200]   well, what would be the best path
[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:41.840]   to move to this other thing?
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.680]   And so you work through those goals
[00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:46.200]   and start to talk about them.
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:48.760]   And the best way to do it is long in advance
[00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:51.340]   of any decisions so that there can be lots of time
[00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:52.960]   to think with one another,
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:54.600]   to consider what each other wants,
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:56.560]   and then to work out plans where both people
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:59.880]   will be satisfied in the very best way possible
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:02.940]   so that there's less and less conflict down the road.
[00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:04.960]   So those are just some tactical things.
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:07.840]   And that goal-setting process will be the most important
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:11.680]   and influential thing to be done along the way.
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:13.940]   Now, let me pause for a moment
[00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:15.080]   before I go to philosophy.
[00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:18.280]   Any questions so far on those tactical discussions?
[00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:22.560]   - Are there any good tools or prompts or forms
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.560]   for the goal-setting exercise?
[00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:27.400]   I mean, should it be freeform or should it be structured?
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:28.280]   Or does it matter?
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:31.440]   - Yeah, I've done both and I find both helpful.
[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:34.980]   I can't cite any one specific exercise right now.
[00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:37.080]   I've done, I have a number of exercises.
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:40.660]   Let me just give you a few questions that are useful
[00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:43.840]   that I've done from freeform journaling exercises.
[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:45.920]   I've delivered these in my career
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:46.880]   and income planning course,
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:49.080]   and I've found that the students there
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.400]   really benefited from these.
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.120]   And so I'll just give a list of questions
[00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:53.720]   that I often will start from,
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:55.820]   but I'm sure that there are books and good books
[00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:56.800]   and good things out there.
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:59.800]   So a quick web search using DuckDuckGo
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:03.120]   will find various options that you'd like to do.
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.080]   But here are a couple of questions
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:05.160]   that I've often asked people.
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.560]   One, just the 10 goal method.
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:10.520]   What are 10 things that you'd like to do in the next year?
[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:12.340]   Just sit down and make a list of 10 things.
[00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:13.980]   Just 10 goals that you have for the next year.
[00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:16.160]   Very freeform, can be anything that you want.
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.220]   Make a list of 10 goals that you'd like to accomplish
[00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:19.340]   in the next year.
[00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:21.940]   Another number-oriented one.
[00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:24.620]   Make a list of 30 things you'd like to do,
[00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:26.340]   30 things you'd like to be,
[00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:29.460]   and 30 things you'd like to have before you die.
[00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:31.420]   And I like that one because it focuses
[00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:32.840]   on that extensive list.
[00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:36.700]   If you study the philosophy or the,
[00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:38.140]   I hate to use the word science
[00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:40.280]   'cause this stuff is not appropriate
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:41.660]   to use that word in this.
[00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:45.820]   But a lot of times if you force an extensive list,
[00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:48.540]   you can force more ideas out of the back of your mind.
[00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:49.460]   So I really like that one.
[00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:51.880]   30 things you'd like to do, 30 things you'd like to have,
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:54.540]   and 30 things you'd like to be before you die.
[00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:57.060]   And put those on there.
[00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:59.820]   That was one that when I made my wife do that,
[00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:01.880]   it was very helpful 'cause it could give me a list
[00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:04.060]   into the things that were on her list.
[00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:05.740]   And she does these exercises
[00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:07.560]   dramatically different than I do.
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:09.800]   They're just, there's no comparison.
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:11.200]   But when she puts them on the list,
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:16.200]   then I can work those into our overall family goals.
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:21.360]   Another one would be the three-year question,
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:22.740]   the Dan Sullivan question.
[00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:24.640]   If we were sitting here having a conversation
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.860]   three years from today,
[00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:28.620]   what would have to have happened for you
[00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:31.300]   personally, professionally, and financially
[00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:33.660]   for you to really feel satisfied with your progress?
[00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:35.100]   That was my variation of how I used
[00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:36.840]   to ask financial planning clients that.
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:41.020]   I can't say his exact question right off the top of my head,
[00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:41.860]   but it's something like that.
[00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:43.740]   Three years from today, what has to have happened
[00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:45.900]   for you to feel happy about your progress?
[00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:47.200]   And then I'll just give you one more.
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:49.700]   I really love the perfect day exercise.
[00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:52.960]   And so basically you close your eyes
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:57.480]   and you imagine yourself waking up in the morning,
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:59.660]   and it's a perfect day for you.
[00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:03.220]   And you sit down and you imagine,
[00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:05.100]   what does that day look like?
[00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:06.660]   And the way that I like to do this one
[00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:07.660]   is just with a voice recorder,
[00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:09.240]   turn on the voice recording app on your phone,
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:12.420]   close your eyes, and walk yourself through an ideal day,
[00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:13.480]   a perfect day.
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:15.540]   So if you wake up in the morning,
[00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:17.380]   in your mind's eye, look around the room
[00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:19.060]   and see where are you waking up?
[00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:20.580]   What does the room look like?
[00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:21.980]   Where is the room?
[00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:23.820]   Some people, when they do that exercise,
[00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:26.660]   they wind up living in a little apartment
[00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:28.740]   on the 47th floor in New York City.
[00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:30.500]   Some people, when they do that exercise,
[00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.540]   are looking out of a ski chalet.
[00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:33.940]   Some people are at the beach.
[00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:36.020]   Some people are in a bus,
[00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:38.860]   traveling the world in a converted school bus.
[00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:43.260]   And so you think through everything that you'd like to do,
[00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:46.220]   and you say, "Here's my perfect day."
[00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:48.940]   And then describe what you do.
[00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:50.320]   What do you have for breakfast?
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:51.160]   Who are you with?
[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:52.820]   Who can you imagine being there?
[00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:57.180]   And then go through the day in exhaustive detail
[00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:59.620]   with as much as you can see in your mind's eye.
[00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:01.620]   And then what I like to do is go back and transcribe that
[00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:04.420]   so I can look at it so that I can see that.
[00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:06.460]   And that for me has been one of the most powerful
[00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:09.020]   because it grasps my imagination
[00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:12.180]   and helps it to apply to real life.
[00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:14.860]   And then I can figure out what changes are in that.
[00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:17.300]   And so for me, when I do that exercise,
[00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:20.140]   some changes involve physical location.
[00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:23.140]   Some changes involve the daily schedule that I keep.
[00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:26.540]   Some changes involve what I do for work.
[00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:28.580]   And I can really see that.
[00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:30.300]   That one's always been useful for me.
[00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:33.180]   And then, well, I'll just quit with that.
[00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:35.420]   So those are just a few freeform ones
[00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:36.500]   that I find really useful.
[00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:40.740]   But the key is I tend, I like to go for freeform
[00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.980]   more than structured,
[00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:46.440]   because a lot of times what happens with structured prompts
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:50.780]   is you fit into the standard methodology.
[00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:52.200]   So I'll give you an example.
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:54.040]   I used to do structured prompts,
[00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:57.700]   and I would write down goals based upon that.
[00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:59.740]   And I would write down a new list of goals every day.
[00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:01.220]   I'd write my goals out every single day
[00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:02.700]   to keep myself focused on them.
[00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:06.020]   And one of my goals was to have a fancy car.
[00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:08.900]   One of my goals was to have a Harley Davidson.
[00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:10.340]   I wanted a big black Harley Davidson.
[00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:11.780]   So I'd write these goals down.
[00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:13.380]   Then finally I sat there and looked at the list,
[00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:14.460]   and I said, "This is stupid.
[00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:16.280]   "I don't actually care about a fancy car.
[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:17.700]   "I only care about that
[00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:19.600]   "because that's what everyone says I'm supposed to do.
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.080]   "So you're supposed to come up with a dream,
[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:23.540]   "and that dream is supposed to care with a fancy car."
[00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:24.740]   I don't care.
[00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:27.100]   I don't actually care about owning a Harley Davidson.
[00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:28.460]   I like to ride them,
[00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:30.060]   but I don't actually wanna own one,
[00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:31.980]   and I don't wanna own one at this point in time.
[00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:36.840]   I much more care about my time with my children
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:38.040]   and what I'm teaching them
[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:39.820]   than I do about the Harley Davidson.
[00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:42.540]   And so once I stopped all those prompted stuff
[00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:44.500]   where you're supposed to imagine a fancy house
[00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:45.620]   and a fancy car,
[00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:47.100]   then I was able to get to the things
[00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:48.540]   that I actually cared about,
[00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:50.700]   which were much less materialistic
[00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:55.340]   and much more about impact and meaning and people and work
[00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:57.380]   than it was about consumption.
[00:21:57.380 --> 00:21:58.860]   So that was my experience,
[00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:00.160]   but your mileage may vary.
[00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:06.140]   So let's go now to philosophy.
[00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:08.520]   So once you've got those tactics out of the way,
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:11.120]   then I think you have to start to talk with one another
[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:14.380]   about philosophy and start to put together a concept
[00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:18.100]   of how you're going to approach your life together.
[00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:22.220]   And there are a few major sticking points in marriage.
[00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:24.880]   Number one is the handling of money
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:28.120]   in terms of decisions and authority.
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:29.180]   That's a big one.
[00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:31.580]   Number two is going to be careers.
[00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:34.980]   And so the really tough one is handling money.
[00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:36.400]   Now, there are some couples
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:39.100]   who seem to just automatically think alike
[00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:40.920]   and they don't ever have any problems,
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:44.100]   but that's pretty rare in my experience.
[00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:46.320]   And so when it comes to the handling of money,
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:47.420]   how are you gonna do it?
[00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:50.360]   And here is where your religious philosophy,
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:53.580]   your worldview, your outlook on what marriage looks like
[00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:54.420]   will come to play.
[00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:59.420]   So let me use two kind of extreme examples as a foil.
[00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:03.580]   I come from a religious tradition
[00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:06.240]   that emphasizes unity, oneness.
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:09.260]   And so one of the things that's very important for me
[00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:12.340]   in terms of how my wife and I approach our money
[00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:15.700]   is to focus on making decisions together.
[00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:17.800]   Ultimately, I'm the head of my household,
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:21.020]   so I bear the responsibility for the ultimate decision,
[00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:23.620]   but we wanna make our decisions together.
[00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:26.260]   And so everything in how we approach money,
[00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:29.660]   we wanna emphasize unity, oneness together.
[00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:33.920]   And so we don't have separate checking accounts for usage.
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:37.060]   We do everything with one joint account,
[00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:39.620]   with the exception of, there may be exceptions to this
[00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:43.020]   for simple tax or legal reasons.
[00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:44.380]   There can be many reasons for somebody
[00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:46.340]   to have a separate checking account
[00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:49.980]   for the isolation of legal rights,
[00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:52.960]   but in terms of overall function
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:54.620]   or the way of going forward,
[00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:58.100]   I would always emphasize and encourage a togetherness,
[00:23:58.100 --> 00:23:58.940]   a joint work.
[00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:03.420]   So we don't have her money and my money, we have our money.
[00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:05.380]   It doesn't matter who brings it into the household,
[00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:06.820]   whose income is reflected,
[00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:08.820]   and it doesn't matter who's actually
[00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:11.100]   making the physical transaction to pay out money.
[00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:14.500]   We have our money and we're accountable to one another.
[00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:15.980]   And so we emphasize that
[00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:17.860]   in the practical outworking of things.
[00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:19.500]   We have a joint checking account.
[00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:21.940]   The money that we spend is always spent together.
[00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:23.320]   And that's because of this emphasis
[00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:25.320]   on oneness and togetherness.
[00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:28.400]   There is no hers, there is no mine.
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:30.040]   There's no her money, there's no my money.
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:32.160]   There's no her rights or my rights.
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:35.400]   There is only us, even to our own bodies.
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:37.880]   My body is not my own, her body is not her own.
[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:40.520]   Everything is together, we belong to each other.
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:42.680]   And that comes from the religious tradition
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:45.180]   and ideology that governs our lives.
[00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:48.640]   Now, if you take that over to an extreme opposite,
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:51.240]   one of the conversations that I've had many times
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:52.820]   with people in my generation,
[00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:55.260]   with especially of the modern secular
[00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:57.960]   and highly feminist influenced philosophy,
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:00.780]   is a deep lack of trust.
[00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:02.620]   And so I've worked with couples
[00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:06.000]   where they cannot even conceive of doing things together.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.120]   And they've had to figure out how do I,
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:10.680]   it's basically, it's all about mine.
[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:13.680]   So for example, I've heard and read financial advice
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.540]   that would counsel, usually women especially,
[00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:16.960]   because in the modern age,
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:19.860]   the philosophy is that women are disadvantaged
[00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:23.080]   and underprivileged, and so because of that,
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:26.680]   they have to look out for being oppressed by men,
[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:27.920]   is basically how it goes.
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:31.340]   And so I've listened to advice where women are encouraged,
[00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:34.140]   don't ever give your husband the money,
[00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:36.420]   don't ever work together, always maintain,
[00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:38.440]   you always have to maintain your own career
[00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:40.800]   so that if your husband abandons you and divorces you,
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:42.960]   that you're not left destitute,
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:45.000]   you always have to maintain your own money.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.480]   Because if you allow your husband
[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:48.380]   to have supervision over your money,
[00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:50.040]   then you're ceding your power.
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:51.920]   So you always have to maintain your own accounts,
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:54.160]   you always have to maintain everything externally.
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:56.040]   And so many modern couples,
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:57.880]   their approach to this kind of thing is,
[00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:00.720]   they'll figure out, well, what's ours, our joint accounts,
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:02.280]   and we'll pay our rent together,
[00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:03.440]   we'll pay our mortgage payment
[00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:04.920]   'cause we're living in the same house,
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:06.740]   but then I'll pay my bills over here,
[00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:08.480]   you pay your bills over there.
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:13.480]   I've even seen this and read, I've read in my files,
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:17.920]   there's a lengthy essay that I read by a libertarian guy
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:21.520]   who came down to, he and his wife paid one another
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:25.040]   for household chores, and they viewed,
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:28.100]   and there was no exaggeration, I had the same chuckle,
[00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:29.280]   but he was very sincere
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:30.620]   about how it had been a great thing,
[00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:31.540]   where they would sit down
[00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:33.420]   and they would bargain with one another
[00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:36.340]   over the dollar value of who would clean the bathroom.
[00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:39.460]   And they would have an auction and a bid with one another
[00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:40.580]   over who would clean the bathroom,
[00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:42.180]   and they literally would pay each other money
[00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:43.100]   to each other's accounts.
[00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:46.900]   They held nothing in common other than the thing
[00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:48.040]   that would be ultimately required,
[00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:49.480]   but they held nothing in common,
[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:52.240]   and they just, they viewed it as an auction process
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:53.280]   with one another.
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:56.280]   And he opined as to why this was the perfect way
[00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:57.700]   of handling money together.
[00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:01.120]   Now, I'm not gonna say to somebody,
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:02.740]   here's how you have to do it,
[00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:05.240]   because I think there are things that,
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:07.160]   the relationship between a husband and a wife
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:09.720]   is the most intimate relationship out there,
[00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:11.400]   and husbands and wives have to learn
[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:13.260]   to work with one another.
[00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:14.940]   But I do think you have to identify
[00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:17.240]   your undergirding philosophy
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:19.160]   and discuss it with one another
[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:21.280]   so that you know what direction you're going.
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:24.620]   My wife and I, even though we were firmly committed
[00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:28.800]   to the same philosophy, you know, she bears my name,
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:31.520]   she, we're one, we're firmly committed,
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:33.560]   but that wasn't an easy transition.
[00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:35.200]   It takes time to work that in.
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:37.500]   It takes time for husbands and wives
[00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:38.640]   to learn to dwell with one another
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:40.280]   with understanding and love.
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:43.440]   And it takes a lot of showing a lot of mercy to one another.
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:45.380]   So don't expect it to be perfect.
[00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:47.440]   And I would say for you, my caution is,
[00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:49.980]   it's going to be extra difficult
[00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:53.620]   because you and she are fully formed mature adults.
[00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:55.660]   And for the last 20 years of your adult life,
[00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:57.540]   you've never talked to somebody about your decisions.
[00:27:57.540 --> 00:28:00.140]   You've never submitted your decision-making one to another.
[00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:02.780]   And so it's extra hard for people who marry older
[00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:05.580]   to be able to make decisions together
[00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:06.460]   than it is for younger people.
[00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:07.980]   You have the benefit of having a lot more money.
[00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:09.540]   Younger people usually are broker,
[00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:11.500]   and so they learn those things together.
[00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:14.320]   But you and she are much more likely to be calcified
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:16.760]   in your own approaches as individuals.
[00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:17.880]   Make sense?
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:18.720]   - Got it.
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:19.540]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:21.640]   - And then one more thing with regard to careers,
[00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:25.120]   and this is another huge philosophical divide
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:27.000]   that I think you have to tackle openly
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.760]   and honestly and identify.
[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:30.820]   One of the biggest tensions that happens
[00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:32.960]   in modern marriages as it relates to money
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:38.840]   is what career are we going to handle?
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:41.660]   And again, this comes down to philosophy,
[00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:44.060]   your religious philosophy, your worldview,
[00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:46.700]   and your basically life philosophy is gonna drive this.
[00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:49.060]   So back again, let me use these foils
[00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:50.820]   of kind of extreme opposites.
[00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:55.620]   For my wife and for me, there was never any question
[00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:59.140]   as far as money and career.
[00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:02.380]   I was the one who had the responsibility
[00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:04.460]   for providing the income for the family.
[00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:07.900]   And for her, her primary career
[00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:10.260]   is in being my wife and mother,
[00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:13.060]   and that was decided before we entered into marriage.
[00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:16.640]   That wasn't always the case in terms of easy.
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:19.100]   She has earned income at different times,
[00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:20.980]   but that was clearly decided in advance,
[00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:22.780]   which meant that we didn't have career tension.
[00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:27.060]   She never had career tension between children and income.
[00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:30.220]   And one of the things that we have worked hard at
[00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:34.660]   is to try to help her to avoid the consistent
[00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:36.460]   kind of screaming of people saying
[00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:39.260]   that if you don't earn income, you're worthless.
[00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:41.860]   Because basically everything in our modern society
[00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:43.740]   is based upon earning income,
[00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:45.840]   especially in the wake of the feminist revolution
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:47.540]   in the last 75 years,
[00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:50.620]   women feel worthless if they don't earn income.
[00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:54.140]   And it's very, very hard for many women
[00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:56.540]   who are influenced by this philosophy
[00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:59.060]   to feel a place of contentment and satisfaction.
[00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:01.380]   So they're often in a fight with their husbands,
[00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:03.900]   feeling like I have to have power over my husband
[00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:04.940]   because of earning money.
[00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:08.140]   And if I give up my income, then I give up my independence,
[00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:10.760]   and now I'm in this place of becoming a victim,
[00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:12.500]   and that's not what my mother fought for
[00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:14.340]   and went marching in the streets for.
[00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:19.340]   And so women usually have a strong urge towards motherhood
[00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:24.260]   and towards being focused on raising children.
[00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:26.520]   If you study the data, it's very, very clear
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:28.300]   that women in the United States of America
[00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:30.460]   want more children than they have,
[00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:33.780]   and they want to be with children more than they are.
[00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:38.780]   But that's a politically impossible thing to admit
[00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:41.460]   in public conversation among polite company.
[00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:43.500]   And so that often will put your wife
[00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:45.300]   in a very difficult situation
[00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:47.960]   where she feels like she has to do both things well.
[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:52.120]   She feels like she has to be a hard-charging businesswoman
[00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:57.120]   who is erasing the gender wage gap single-handedly,
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:58.740]   but also she wants to be a mother.
[00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:01.780]   And that's a really difficult lifestyle to have.
[00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:03.180]   I don't understand how it's possible.
[00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:05.760]   Of course, there are women who run themselves ragged
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:06.780]   trying to do both things,
[00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:08.660]   but I don't understand how it's possible.
[00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:10.420]   So you've got to talk about that.
[00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:12.860]   And if your wife wants to be a mother,
[00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:14.840]   if she wants to be a wife and a mother,
[00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:17.820]   if she wants to be at home and be focused on her home,
[00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:20.340]   you've got to work with her to help her to see
[00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:23.420]   that that is every bit, in fact, more valuable
[00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:24.360]   than earning income.
[00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:27.220]   Because if your wife labors under this idea
[00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:29.420]   and this ideology in the modern era,
[00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:33.100]   that the only thing that brings her self-worth is her income.
[00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:34.660]   And that's the thing that, you know,
[00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:36.820]   when she's asked the question of what do you do,
[00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:39.820]   if all of her girlfriends look at her as being a loser
[00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:43.220]   and not advancing the revolution that needs to happen
[00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:46.500]   because she's being a wife and mother, she won't do it.
[00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:47.620]   She won't do it happily.
[00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:49.660]   She'll feel like she has to do both.
[00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:51.740]   And that can bring a huge amount of tension
[00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:53.340]   into a relationship.
[00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:56.320]   Now, on the flip side, if you and she talk about it,
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:58.800]   and for her, this expression of her career
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:02.560]   is deeply important, and she needs to do this work,
[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:06.680]   and she doesn't want to, you know, care for the,
[00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:08.080]   she doesn't want to be home with the kids,
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:10.200]   she doesn't want to give up this career thing,
[00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:12.160]   and she doesn't want to give up this income,
[00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:15.740]   then if you try to say, well, this has to happen,
[00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:17.460]   it's a recipe for unrest.
[00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:19.400]   If you try to say, hey, you've got to go
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:21.440]   and, you know, be home with the children,
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:22.440]   you've got to do this.
[00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:24.800]   So I would say one of the most important things
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:27.000]   is to talk it through with one another.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.840]   Study the actual data, for example.
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:32.320]   Study the data on the well-being of children.
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:34.440]   Study the data on what happens
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:36.760]   if your child is raised by a daycare.
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:38.960]   Study the data in terms of the impact.
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:41.960]   Study, talk about it in terms of philosophy.
[00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:44.700]   Find out what she's thinking, what's important to her.
[00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:46.280]   Find out what's important to you.
[00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:48.600]   And do it prior to having children
[00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:53.480]   so that you can hopefully come to a more peaceful solution.
[00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:56.000]   It is one of the biggest conflicts that I see
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   in most of the married couples that I have counseled.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.560]   And it's often very, very difficult
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:05.440]   for couples to work it through,
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:07.720]   and it usually takes a lot of discussion
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:09.400]   to come to a place of peace
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:11.440]   where they can move confidently.
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:12.960]   And so if your wife is going to be a mother,
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:14.600]   for her to be able to be confident
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:17.760]   and to tell her girlfriends and say,
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:19.880]   listen, this is what we're doing,
[00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:22.320]   she's gonna need to be clear on that decision
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:23.880]   because she will be very susceptible
[00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:25.600]   to peer pressure one way or the other.
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:28.160]   And so it's gonna take some time and conversation
[00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:29.960]   to come to the solution that's right for you
[00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:33.060]   based upon your undergirding philosophy and worldview.
[00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:36.080]   - Got it.
[00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:37.420]   - That was a lot of philosophy,
[00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:38.560]   but I guess those are some of the things
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:39.480]   that I think are important.
[00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:42.520]   And then finally, I guess I shouldn't skip past,
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:43.880]   go ahead and get some insurance for each other.
[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:44.980]   You have enough money.
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:48.440]   If you don't have,
[00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:50.800]   do you have a bunch of term life insurance already?
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:54.600]   - Yeah, we both just upped what we're,
[00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:56.400]   we need to verify everything went through
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:57.640]   as far as beneficiaries and everything,
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:00.080]   but we both through work are able to do that
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:01.400]   and increase that.
[00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:04.160]   - Get some private insurance for,
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:06.640]   get some that's outside of your work, especially,
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:09.000]   because if you change jobs, she changes jobs,
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.640]   now especially, that you start to have commitments
[00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:14.960]   to one another, and those commitments go beyond finances.
[00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:17.560]   Life insurance gains additional importance.
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:20.480]   Get some term life insurance, at least 10,
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:22.200]   closer to 20 times your annual income
[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:25.080]   of term life insurance that's not connected to your job.
[00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:28.720]   And then secondarily, get some disability income insurance
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:29.880]   if you don't have it.
[00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:30.720]   And then--
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:32.000]   - Oh yeah, I've got that.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   - And then also with her,
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.920]   make sure she has disability income insurance.
[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:36.560]   If she has disability income insurance--
[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:37.960]   - She does outside of work as well, yeah.
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:38.800]   - Good, good.
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:40.040]   So then that will still cover her
[00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:41.240]   and she could choose to keep it
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:43.080]   even if she leaves her job
[00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:46.640]   and/or it could provide income for her during pregnancy,
[00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:48.640]   especially in case of complications of pregnancy,
[00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:49.760]   which can be helpful as well.
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:51.360]   So get all that stuff squared away
[00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:55.000]   so that if she does decide to stop her job
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.360]   while she's having children,
[00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:58.860]   then that can be done easily.
[00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:02.320]   - If you're able to take your life insurance policy
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:04.600]   from your employer if you leave,
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:06.080]   would you consider that sufficient
[00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:08.600]   or would you still consider
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:10.600]   getting a completely separate policy?
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:13.040]   - I wouldn't run away from that.
[00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:14.880]   Obviously, if you're able to take it,
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:17.240]   but I would make sure that you understand it very carefully.
[00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:18.160]   Usually--
[00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:19.000]   - Got it.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.460]   - You can't take just a term life insurance policy
[00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:22.800]   from your employer
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:24.940]   and keep it as a term life insurance policy
[00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:25.880]   without changing it.
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:27.740]   Usually that's not possible.
[00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:30.620]   Usually if you can take a life insurance policy
[00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:31.460]   from your employer,
[00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:34.080]   you have to convert it from a term insurance policy
[00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:35.680]   to a whole life policy.
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:37.880]   And so that can be a real challenge.
[00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:40.200]   So I'm not saying that it's not possible,
[00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:42.360]   I'm just saying the standard approach is,
[00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:45.080]   yes, you may be able to buy term life insurance at work,
[00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:46.120]   but let's say you're signed up
[00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:47.760]   for a half a million dollars of coverage there.
[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:48.680]   If you leave that job,
[00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:50.800]   you can't usually take it as half a million dollars
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:52.400]   of term insurance coverage.
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:55.100]   So make sure you're very clear on those details.
[00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:57.520]   Now, if your job is providing you
[00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:00.680]   with a substantial discount for it,
[00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:02.800]   then you should save the money.
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:05.840]   Don't waste money unnecessarily on insurance premiums.
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:09.080]   But most people can't get the maximum amount of insurance
[00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:11.320]   that they probably should have at their work.
[00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:13.720]   So usually you need at least some additional,
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:15.800]   and usually the insurance that you get at your work
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:18.440]   can't go with you as a term policy.
[00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:19.760]   So think through your insurance strategy.
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:22.280]   Just make sure that you're okay in case you leave the job,
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:23.480]   she leaves her job,
[00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:26.300]   and make sure you understand how those options work.
[00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:30.120]   - Okay, that is good to look into.
[00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:31.720]   - Congratulations on your marriage, Peter.
[00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:32.720]   Anything else?
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:33.540]   - Thank you.
[00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:34.380]   - Yeah.
[00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:35.200]   - That'll do it.
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:36.040]   - It's an exciting time.
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:37.480]   And I guess I would,
[00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:39.240]   my closing comment,
[00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:40.140]   you're older than I am,
[00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:41.720]   but I've been married for longer than you are.
[00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:43.080]   I would say this.
[00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:44.680]   One of the pieces of advice
[00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:47.640]   that I wish I had been given much more strongly
[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:50.840]   is during the beginning of marriage,
[00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:52.520]   don't make big decisions
[00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:55.280]   and don't try to climb the corporate ladder.
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:57.300]   There's a principle that comes from the Old Testament
[00:36:57.300 --> 00:36:58.480]   in the Bible.
[00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:01.040]   And it's from the Mosaic Law
[00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:03.920]   that was given to the Jews under Moses,
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:04.740]   where it says,
[00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:06.040]   "When a man is newly married,
[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:08.600]   "he must not be sent off to war
[00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:10.580]   "for the first year of his marriage."
[00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:11.840]   And the Bible says,
[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:13.760]   "But he must stay at home
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:16.400]   "and learn to please his wife."
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:18.340]   And I've talked with a lot of married couples.
[00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:19.940]   And one of the regrets that I have
[00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:22.540]   and that many married couples that I've spoken with
[00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:25.580]   is they wish that they had made plans and provisions
[00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:29.100]   for that in a much more intentional way.
[00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:29.940]   In hindsight,
[00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:31.420]   I wish I hadn't worked as much as I did
[00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:32.500]   the first year we were married.
[00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:33.420]   In hindsight,
[00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:35.700]   I wish we hadn't only taken a two-week honeymoon.
[00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:36.660]   In hindsight,
[00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:40.040]   I wish that I had taken more time to stay at home
[00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:43.000]   and learn how to please my wife that first year of marriage,
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.520]   because it's a very, very special time.
[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:47.780]   And it's a time of transition in life
[00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:49.800]   that will quickly pass by.
[00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:52.680]   So my encouragement to you is,
[00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:54.260]   during the next year,
[00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:55.280]   take time,
[00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:56.160]   be at home,
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:57.760]   and learn how to please your wife.
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:59.400]   And then simultaneously,
[00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:01.540]   don't make any big decisions quickly,
[00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:03.120]   because it takes time to learn
[00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:04.320]   how to work with one another
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:06.400]   and to really understand what's important to people.
[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:10.320]   Most married couples have lied to one another
[00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:13.120]   to some degree prior to marriage,
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:15.080]   even just to try to make themselves seem
[00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:16.140]   some way that they weren't.
[00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:18.480]   And so it takes some time to build that comfort
[00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:19.840]   to say, "Oh, you know,
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:21.800]   "I told you that this was always important to me,"
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:23.880]   or, "I led you to believe that I was this kind of person,
[00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:24.880]   "but in reality,
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:28.080]   "I was doing that because I wanted you to like me more."
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:31.200]   And so it takes time to smoke those things out
[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:32.720]   to where you can make better decisions.
[00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:33.800]   I wouldn't buy houses.
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:34.620]   I wouldn't move.
[00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:35.460]   I wouldn't do any of that stuff
[00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:37.000]   in my first year of marriage, at least.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   Take the time and just enjoy being with one another.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.120]   Keep your...
[00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:41.060]   When I got married,
[00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:45.040]   I got out of almost every organization.
[00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:47.040]   When I was single, I was in every organization,
[00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:49.560]   everything around town, everything from my career.
[00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:50.380]   When I got married,
[00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:51.760]   I got out of every single one of them,
[00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:53.240]   except two that I couldn't get out of.
[00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:54.880]   And by the time we had our first baby,
[00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:55.840]   I got out of those.
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:59.120]   And so I don't participate in community stuff anymore.
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:00.880]   I'm not interested in going to your thing
[00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:03.240]   at five o'clock on Thursday afternoon
[00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:04.840]   for your stupid local networking thing.
[00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:06.280]   That was fine when I was single,
[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:08.480]   but at this point, I'm not going, I'm not doing it.
[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:11.080]   And so I'm gonna hang out with my family
[00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:12.760]   'cause that's the phase of life that I'm in.
[00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:13.940]   And if you wanna talk to me,
[00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:15.280]   it's gonna be during business hours.
[00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:16.400]   I'm not coming in the evening.
[00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:18.920]   I'm not gonna go and do that in the morning.
[00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:21.080]   So you figure out how to make that happen.
[00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:23.600]   But I think it's underappreciated
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:26.160]   how special that first year is of marriage
[00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:28.600]   and how much good can come from it
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:30.380]   if you really intensively focus.
[00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:32.520]   And I would say this to you, you have the money.
[00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:34.920]   So take every day of vacation you have,
[00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:40.000]   you and she should take a month off that unpaid,
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.280]   arrange a small sabbatical,
[00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:43.200]   take multiple honeymoons this first year.
[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:46.920]   You have the money, spend it on time together
[00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:49.760]   because it's a very, very special and wonderful time.
[00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:52.640]   - We are on that.
[00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:53.480]   - Good.
[00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:54.640]   - You don't have to worry about that.
[00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:56.460]   - Well, good, then we're successful.
[00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:57.960]   So congratulations on that.
[00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:59.440]   And I wish both of you well,
[00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:02.600]   and hopefully my ideas were useful.
[00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:04.040]   We go now to the great state of California.
[00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:04.880]   Welcome to the call.
[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:06.040]   How can I serve you today?
[00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:08.480]   - Hi, Joshua, how are you?
[00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:09.320]   - I'm very well, sir.
[00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:11.720]   Tell me your name and how I can serve you, please.
[00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:13.840]   - Yeah, my name's Cody.
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:17.000]   As you mentioned, I am from the great state of California.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   Current employer just recently offered a 401k
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.900]   for my position, but there's no matching on it.
[00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:30.680]   And as lovely as the great state of California is,
[00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:32.320]   it's not a cheap place to live.
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:35.260]   I'm in the greater Los Angeles area.
[00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:38.800]   And this year was kind of a transitionary year for me.
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:41.680]   And I knew that I wanted to save a lot of money.
[00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:45.120]   Part of that meant living with my parents for this year.
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:47.960]   And I've done a really good job, I think, saving money.
[00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:51.840]   And when this 401k option came about,
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:54.320]   the no matching was kind of the thing that kept me
[00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:58.560]   from contributing to that at all.
[00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:00.780]   And I'm just curious on your thoughts about,
[00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:03.720]   is it worth contributing to it if there's no match,
[00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:07.480]   especially given the fact that I have no debts
[00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:11.040]   and I feel like I'm doing a good job saving the money.
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:13.880]   Now it's not actively being invested,
[00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:15.080]   but yeah, just kind of curious
[00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:16.360]   what your thoughts are on that.
[00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:17.240]   - Sure.
[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:19.380]   So how much is your income?
[00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:24.280]   - So we're gonna see with a bonus,
[00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:27.960]   probably like 58, 59,000.
[00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:28.800]   - All right.
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:31.440]   And what do you see happening in the next few years
[00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:33.700]   with your income and with your career?
[00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:38.360]   - Yeah, so career could take me
[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:40.160]   kind of anywhere in the country.
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:43.920]   So definitely need to be available to move.
[00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:45.680]   And I think having some cash on hand,
[00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:47.680]   that's definitely a consideration
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:49.580]   as to why I've been saving this money.
[00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:55.300]   How high that income can go, I don't know exactly.
[00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:58.220]   I think that's a good question.
[00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:00.820]   I don't know exactly where it can go.
[00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:02.020]   - Okay.
[00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:05.800]   When you look at, so you're out of debt,
[00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:08.660]   you've been living with your family to save money.
[00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:10.760]   How much savings have you been able
[00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:12.140]   to accumulate at this point?
[00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:18.420]   - So this year alone, by the end of December,
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:23.280]   by the end of 2018, I should be a little over $20,000.
[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:27.340]   And that'll put me at about $40,000 in savings.
[00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:29.240]   - Great, congratulations, well done.
[00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:31.180]   - Thanks.
[00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:33.980]   - Why are you working for this employer
[00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:36.200]   and why are you living in California?
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:42.560]   - So I was living in Utah and working for a tech company.
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:48.720]   I didn't want to sell HR and financial management
[00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:50.820]   software, I wasn't passionate about that.
[00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:56.780]   And so I left that and this might sound kind of strange,
[00:42:56.780 --> 00:43:00.780]   but I'm very passionate about alcohol
[00:43:00.780 --> 00:43:02.060]   and the alcohol industry.
[00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:04.700]   I'm not an alcoholic, I need to try
[00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:05.700]   and make that distinction.
[00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:07.580]   I feel like when you say you're passionate about alcohol,
[00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:08.880]   people get the wrong idea.
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:11.860]   I study it, really.
[00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:12.700]   - Interesting.
[00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:18.780]   - Yeah, and so I left because I wanted to pursue a job
[00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:23.480]   in that industry and pretty much any job
[00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:26.440]   that you can get starting out is gonna be in Los Angeles,
[00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:29.440]   in New York, or San Francisco, maybe Chicago,
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:30.820]   but a major city.
[00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:34.020]   As I mentioned, I've got family here in LA,
[00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:36.700]   so it made sense to move back and move in with them.
[00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:40.280]   I was working at a couple of restaurants for a few months
[00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:42.440]   and then ultimately got hired by the company
[00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:44.760]   that I now work for.
[00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:48.100]   So it was a lifestyle move.
[00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:53.600]   I knew that financially I was gonna be taking a hit
[00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:57.500]   a little bit in the short term, relative short term,
[00:43:57.500 --> 00:44:02.260]   but in the long term, I think I'm gonna be a lot happier
[00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:04.780]   talking about something and getting to work with something
[00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:08.360]   that I'm passionate about rather than talking about
[00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:12.060]   recruiting modules and a statement.
[00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:13.860]   - I understand the feeling.
[00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:19.100]   There are two questions to your answer.
[00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:21.700]   Let me just answer the 401(k) question quickly
[00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:26.640]   and then we'll discuss more options beyond that.
[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:29.900]   Should you participate in your 401(k)
[00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:33.220]   if they don't give you a company match?
[00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:38.220]   Yes, if you value having the tax deduction on your income.
[00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:44.860]   And this would be particularly valuable for you
[00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:49.860]   if you were to move outside of California
[00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:51.780]   at some point in the future.
[00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:53.700]   One of the wrinkles with California
[00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:56.820]   is a very high state income tax.
[00:44:56.820 --> 00:45:00.380]   Now, at an annual income of $58,000,
[00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:02.500]   this is not affecting you quite so much
[00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:05.680]   as when you're earning $258,000,
[00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:07.300]   but it is still affecting your money.
[00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:10.540]   You are still paying California state income tax.
[00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:13.100]   If you put money into the 401(k),
[00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:18.100]   you can not pay currently your federal income tax
[00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:20.540]   on those dollars.
[00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:22.860]   And in addition, you cannot pay currently
[00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:25.900]   your state income tax on those dollars.
[00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:28.460]   And then if you move out of California
[00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:30.540]   at some point in the future,
[00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:32.700]   then to a state, especially perhaps a state
[00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:34.700]   that doesn't have a state income tax,
[00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:37.680]   when you take the distribution on those 401(k) dollars,
[00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:41.000]   you will avoid ever paying California state income tax
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.100]   on those dollars if you can move your domicile
[00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:45.040]   outside of California.
[00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:47.960]   Given that you sound relatively young in your career,
[00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:49.060]   how old are you, Cody?
[00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:51.680]   - Yeah, I'm 25.
[00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:52.520]   - Great.
[00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:55.000]   - So yeah, young in my career would be an accurate description.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.900]   - And currently single, is that right?
[00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:58.940]   - Yes, sir.
[00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:02.640]   - Okay, so at 25 and unmarried,
[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:06.620]   you have a lot of flexibility in your lifestyle.
[00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:09.360]   So let's talk about some things that you could do.
[00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:12.040]   Contributing money to the 401(k) can be helpful
[00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:15.000]   because it will reduce your current taxable income.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.160]   And if you will calculate,
[00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:21.520]   let's say you made an $18,000 contribution to your 401(k).
[00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:26.240]   If you've saved $20,000 in cash in the last year,
[00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:28.300]   that means that you could live on,
[00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:31.200]   your living expenses could be less than $40,000,
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:33.760]   58,000 minus $40,000.
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:35.360]   What you should do is calculate
[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:37.520]   what your total tax burden would be
[00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:40.100]   as a 25-year-old unmarried individual
[00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:41.720]   living in California,
[00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:44.460]   reporting $58,000 of income
[00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:47.120]   versus reporting $40,000 of income.
[00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:49.280]   Calculate what your total tax burden
[00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:53.160]   would be estimated to be under that circumstance.
[00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:55.160]   So let me help you with just a quick estimate here.
[00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:57.620]   If you are 25 single,
[00:46:57.620 --> 00:47:02.800]   excuse one quick tax estimator here, earning $58,000,
[00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:05.920]   then you will incur $6,060,
[00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:07.620]   would be just about an estimated amount
[00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:09.240]   of federal income taxes
[00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:11.360]   that you would pay at the federal rate.
[00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:14.080]   Secondly, if you are earning $40,000,
[00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:17.040]   you would incur a federal income tax,
[00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:20.640]   federal income taxes of about $3,100.
[00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:23.280]   So about $3,000 difference between that.
[00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:25.080]   That's the amount that you would pay
[00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:27.000]   on that $18,000 of income.
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:27.840]   Now I don't know,
[00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:29.800]   I'm not competent enough to do California taxes
[00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:30.620]   off the top of my head.
[00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:32.400]   I don't even know if you'd owe any California taxes.
[00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:34.960]   Do you know with a $58,000 income,
[00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:36.600]   how much money you can expect to pay this year
[00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:38.320]   with California state income taxes?
[00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:40.920]   - I don't, but that's, I mean,
[00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:42.760]   that's an easy enough number to look up
[00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:43.720]   once we get off the call.
[00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:45.240]   - Yeah, so you need to look that up
[00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:49.760]   and try to get an idea of what that tax number might be,
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:52.520]   if anything, because, you know,
[00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:55.080]   not to be insulting, but you're not making a ton of money.
[00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:57.640]   So you're not paying a lot of taxes yet
[00:47:57.640 --> 00:47:59.600]   at this point in time, which is fine.
[00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:00.640]   - Oh, believe me, I know.
[00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:02.720]   - Okay, just to be clear.
[00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:04.200]   Always sounds a little bit insulting
[00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:05.320]   when you say to somebody,
[00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:07.880]   the good news is you're not making very much money right now.
[00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:09.520]   Like I'm doing the best I can.
[00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:13.680]   So if you could put that $18,000 in there,
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:16.320]   that saves you $3,000 of taxes.
[00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:18.520]   And that's something that you lose
[00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:20.320]   if you don't do it this year.
[00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:21.760]   Now, even if you put it in
[00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:23.200]   and then take it out in the future,
[00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:25.160]   even if you have to pay a penalty tax,
[00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:27.880]   it would still be cheaper for you to put the money in
[00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:30.240]   and take it out than if you never put it in
[00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:31.120]   in the first place.
[00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:34.920]   And then with being young and with being somewhat flexible,
[00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:38.040]   you could use this and put this into play
[00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:41.480]   in a way that it could save you all kinds of benefits.
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:43.840]   So let's say that you put the money in there
[00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:45.480]   and then two years from now, you decide,
[00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:48.920]   number one, I'm gonna move to Nevada.
[00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:51.320]   And then number two, I'm going to start a business.
[00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:53.160]   And so your income is very low.
[00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:55.380]   If you need to take money out of your 401k,
[00:48:55.380 --> 00:48:57.460]   you could go ahead and take it out at that point in time.
[00:48:57.460 --> 00:48:59.680]   And even though you pay the 10% penalty,
[00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:03.440]   it would still be lower than what you're paying right now.
[00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:06.440]   So you run the math, but in general, I would say, yes,
[00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:10.960]   you should use the 401k unless you have a specific,
[00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:14.760]   a specific thing that you're saving for
[00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:16.640]   that's in the short term,
[00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:19.440]   because you could afford to put money in the 401k
[00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:20.880]   and you still have enough other cash
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:23.800]   to make most moves in life.
[00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:26.860]   So short answer to your 401k question is yes,
[00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:29.480]   I would say do it unless you have other things.
[00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:31.280]   Now, if you didn't have any liquid savings,
[00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:32.840]   if you didn't have $40,000 saved,
[00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:34.880]   I would say, no, don't do it.
[00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:37.680]   If you didn't have other options, if you had debt,
[00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:40.200]   I would be more careful, but I would say, yes,
[00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:42.200]   it's good to put the money in the 401k,
[00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:44.460]   because even if you take it out a few years from now,
[00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:46.800]   even though you pay the 10% penalty tax,
[00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:48.200]   as long as your income is low
[00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:51.680]   and you're not paying a high tax rate at that point in time,
[00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:55.680]   the 10% penalty tax probably will still be cheaper
[00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:58.440]   than the current tax bracket that you're paying,
[00:49:58.440 --> 00:49:59.920]   the current rate that you're paying
[00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:02.320]   on that top $18,000 of income,
[00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:05.280]   if you think you'll lower your income in the future.
[00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:07.080]   Now, let's talk about California.
[00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:09.720]   Your big challenge is living in the state of California.
[00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:12.200]   And it's very hard, the number one state
[00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:14.640]   in the United States, where I have the most listeners,
[00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:16.140]   is California.
[00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:19.600]   So I recognize that there are a lot of people in California,
[00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:21.660]   'cause of course it's an extremely populated state.
[00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:23.600]   But it's very hard to see the future
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:26.040]   for a young person living in California,
[00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:29.660]   unless you're moving there specifically for the culture,
[00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:35.380]   the ideology, the politics, or a specific career
[00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:38.700]   that is not available in another place.
[00:50:38.700 --> 00:50:40.640]   Those are my reasons why I could understand
[00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:41.880]   somebody moving there.
[00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:44.200]   Whether, and let me kind of lay those out for you.
[00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:46.820]   The culture, so you might wanna live in a place
[00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:51.240]   that has a beach surfing culture, or a Latino culture,
[00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:53.840]   or you wanna live in San Francisco
[00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:58.840]   for the lifestyle culture that is common in San Francisco.
[00:50:58.840 --> 00:51:01.560]   So those are things that are related to culture.
[00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:04.040]   You might wanna live in California for the politics.
[00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:07.360]   If your political persuasion is best expressed
[00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:09.120]   by living in California,
[00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:11.520]   then you might wanna consider there for that,
[00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:15.920]   or some ideology, or a career, a specific career
[00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:17.540]   that is most available to you,
[00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:20.480]   or where you can most advance it in California
[00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:22.440]   that you can't in another place.
[00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:26.040]   But it's very hard for me to see the growth prospects
[00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:28.480]   for a young man living in California.
[00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:31.680]   If you build a life and stay in California,
[00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:37.840]   basically you are locked in to a very, very expensive
[00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:40.520]   lifestyle going forward.
[00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:43.600]   And about the best thing I can give for California
[00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:46.080]   is that property taxes are not egregious.
[00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:49.020]   So if you can structure your life in a way that,
[00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:51.440]   yes, you can afford to pay the property values,
[00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:52.960]   but you don't earn a lot of income,
[00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:55.680]   and you don't deal with a lot of the restrictions
[00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:58.000]   and just the legal environment
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.480]   that makes running a business so burdensome,
[00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:02.120]   then maybe California has a future.
[00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:03.640]   But it's hard for me to see a future
[00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:05.200]   for young people in California
[00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:08.200]   because of everything that you know around you.
[00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:11.840]   So I don't know the answer to your career question,
[00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:14.760]   but there is a big price to pay for living in California
[00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:17.480]   versus living in somewhere that is a little bit more free
[00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:19.320]   and has a little bit of a freer economy
[00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:22.320]   so that you can get better deals on stuff.
[00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:24.360]   - Yeah, I mean, as I mentioned,
[00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:26.360]   part of why I moved back there was just 'cause
[00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:28.640]   I needed to get out of the current job I was in.
[00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:31.640]   I had family here, and it just, it made sense to move back.
[00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:35.840]   For those not really maybe aware of what's going on
[00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:38.720]   with sort of the alcohol culture in the US,
[00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:41.760]   historically there's kind of three great cities
[00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:44.800]   for drinking, it's New York, San Francisco, and New Orleans.
[00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:47.840]   And Los Angeles right now is actually kind of
[00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:49.560]   establishing itself as another hub.
[00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:53.880]   And so there are a lot of really influential bartenders,
[00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:57.200]   bar managers, salespeople for the off-premise side
[00:52:57.200 --> 00:52:58.280]   that are here right now.
[00:52:58.280 --> 00:53:03.280]   So I think that for me to sort of as a response
[00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:04.360]   to those thoughts that you had,
[00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:08.120]   there is a culture here from sort of the bar community
[00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:11.520]   that makes sense right now for me to be here.
[00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:14.600]   And I think it's good that I'm here for a period of time.
[00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:19.520]   Long-term, I lived in Colorado for a little bit.
[00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:21.420]   I would love to get back to Colorado.
[00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:24.800]   There are other states that I would consider living in.
[00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:28.240]   So yeah, I agree with you with everything that you said.
[00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:30.400]   As someone experiencing it firsthand,
[00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:33.320]   I don't think that California is my long-term solution,
[00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:35.920]   but I do think there are some advantages for me
[00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:37.920]   just in the connections that I'm making
[00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:40.880]   in the time that I'm here right now.
[00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:42.880]   - Right, and that's the challenge.
[00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:44.960]   And so I would just say, Ken, is there a way
[00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:46.960]   that you can use those connections
[00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:49.040]   and build a really exciting plan
[00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:51.840]   that's also financially wise?
[00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:53.160]   Can you build the connections
[00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:58.080]   and then go and help a new company that's in Austin, Texas?
[00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:02.040]   Or can you build the connections
[00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:05.040]   and then go and work with a company in Hong Kong
[00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:07.840]   or something else that gets you out
[00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:10.100]   of the constraints of California?
[00:54:10.100 --> 00:54:12.840]   So you have to analyze it on the ground.
[00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:15.520]   Each location is actually individual.
[00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:16.480]   And in most places,
[00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:18.760]   you can figure out a way to make things work.
[00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:22.160]   But if your only reason for being there is a career
[00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:23.560]   and not those other reasons,
[00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:25.500]   not because you like the political environment,
[00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:27.000]   not because you like the culture,
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:29.560]   the ideology of your neighbors, things like that,
[00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:32.400]   just recognize that you pay a high price
[00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:34.200]   and calculate it carefully.
[00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:35.160]   And always look to see,
[00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:36.760]   is there a way that I could build this career
[00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:39.200]   without actually being here?
[00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:42.300]   Because it will wind up costing you a lot more money.
[00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:45.640]   Good news is you're not paying a ton at this point in time.
[00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:46.480]   You may not,
[00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:48.760]   I just ran a quick calculator while you were talking
[00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:50.920]   with the California standard deduction.
[00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:54.040]   You may not be paying significant state income taxes
[00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:54.960]   at this point in time,
[00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:56.940]   because by the time you put together
[00:54:56.940 --> 00:54:58.920]   your California deductions,
[00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:01.760]   it may not be,
[00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:06.020]   nevermind.
[00:55:06.020 --> 00:55:10.320]   I shouldn't try to do this kind of thing live on the radio.
[00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:14.300]   So it looks to me like with your standard deduction,
[00:55:14.300 --> 00:55:15.820]   actually at $58,000,
[00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:19.000]   you may be paying about $2,444
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:22.820]   for the privilege of living in California.
[00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:25.480]   So run the math, run it carefully, study your career.
[00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:27.620]   I think it's wise for you to be in a place
[00:55:27.620 --> 00:55:29.820]   where there are growth prospects for your career.
[00:55:29.820 --> 00:55:31.500]   So if the alcohol industry
[00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:33.140]   is something that you really love,
[00:55:33.140 --> 00:55:36.180]   and if Los Angeles is the place to do it, do it.
[00:55:36.180 --> 00:55:37.300]   And if you can get your income off
[00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:42.300]   from 58 to 158 to 258 to 558 to 1,000,058,
[00:55:42.300 --> 00:55:45.900]   and you can do that because you're in Los Angeles, California
[00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:47.940]   you can live very well in Los Angeles, California
[00:55:47.940 --> 00:55:49.240]   on a million bucks a year.
[00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:51.260]   Anything else, Cody?
[00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:53.360]   - No, thank you so much.
[00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:55.740]   I really appreciate your time and everything that you do.
[00:55:55.740 --> 00:55:56.740]   - My pleasure, sir.
[00:55:56.740 --> 00:56:00.380]   We go now to, speaking of Texas,
[00:56:00.380 --> 00:56:01.580]   we go now to Houston, Texas.
[00:56:01.580 --> 00:56:02.420]   Welcome to the call.
[00:56:02.420 --> 00:56:03.500]   How can I serve you today?
[00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:06.340]   - Hey Joshua.
[00:56:06.340 --> 00:56:07.700]   Yeah, thanks for taking my call
[00:56:07.700 --> 00:56:09.500]   and thanks for setting up these,
[00:56:09.500 --> 00:56:12.500]   this string of calls for all of us this week.
[00:56:12.500 --> 00:56:16.660]   So I was listening to your most recent show
[00:56:16.660 --> 00:56:18.540]   that came out yesterday
[00:56:18.540 --> 00:56:22.220]   and got me thinking about whether or not
[00:56:22.220 --> 00:56:25.980]   I am thinking through college planning
[00:56:25.980 --> 00:56:28.980]   as effectively as I can.
[00:56:28.980 --> 00:56:31.460]   My wife and I, we live here in Texas
[00:56:31.460 --> 00:56:33.980]   and we have a one-year-old baby boy
[00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:36.500]   and obviously thinking through
[00:56:36.500 --> 00:56:40.820]   what college might look like in the next 17 to 18 years.
[00:56:40.820 --> 00:56:43.380]   And as far as I can tell,
[00:56:43.380 --> 00:56:49.280]   there aren't too many benefits of a 529 here in Texas
[00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:52.420]   in terms of like tax deductions or anything like that.
[00:56:52.420 --> 00:56:56.740]   So we did open up a 529, put about $8,000 in it,
[00:56:56.740 --> 00:56:59.300]   but I've since adjusted my plan
[00:56:59.300 --> 00:57:03.740]   in that we have opened up a Roth IRA under my wife's name.
[00:57:03.740 --> 00:57:08.540]   And are contributing the maximum to that
[00:57:08.540 --> 00:57:11.260]   with the plan of taking out the contributions
[00:57:11.260 --> 00:57:13.780]   in 18 years to pay for college.
[00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:17.580]   My question is, does that sound like, excuse me,
[00:57:17.580 --> 00:57:21.660]   an effective way of thinking through college plans?
[00:57:21.660 --> 00:57:25.780]   And I mean, is that something that can be done?
[00:57:25.780 --> 00:57:28.540]   And then the second part to that question is,
[00:57:28.540 --> 00:57:33.380]   when is time for him to look at
[00:57:33.380 --> 00:57:37.140]   perhaps financial aid or scholarships?
[00:57:37.140 --> 00:57:40.140]   What all do the institutions look at
[00:57:40.140 --> 00:57:43.500]   in terms of assets under the family name?
[00:57:43.500 --> 00:57:48.460]   - Have you listened to a podcast that I did a few years ago
[00:57:48.460 --> 00:57:51.100]   called "Why This Financial Planner Refuses to Save
[00:57:51.100 --> 00:57:53.820]   for His Kid's College Education?"
[00:57:53.820 --> 00:57:57.580]   - I don't believe I have, no.
[00:57:57.580 --> 00:57:59.580]   - Okay, so the very best one,
[00:57:59.580 --> 00:58:03.020]   and I'll give you the show number in a moment,
[00:58:03.020 --> 00:58:04.380]   but what I would recommend to you
[00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:05.980]   and any other interested listeners
[00:58:05.980 --> 00:58:09.380]   is to go back and listen to that complete podcast
[00:58:09.380 --> 00:58:14.380]   because it will give you some specific suggestions.
[00:58:14.380 --> 00:58:19.420]   It's podcast number 276, released on January 6, 2016.
[00:58:19.420 --> 00:58:22.260]   It's called "Why This Financial Planner Refuses
[00:58:22.260 --> 00:58:24.300]   to Save Money for His Kid's College,"
[00:58:24.300 --> 00:58:26.340]   which is obviously, I mean, not obviously,
[00:58:26.340 --> 00:58:27.860]   but I'm the financial planner
[00:58:27.860 --> 00:58:30.020]   and I'm talking about my own kids.
[00:58:30.020 --> 00:58:31.900]   So I'll give you just an abbreviated version
[00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:33.780]   and answer your specific question,
[00:58:33.780 --> 00:58:37.300]   but I would commend episode 276 to you
[00:58:37.300 --> 00:58:41.180]   for you to consider in terms of how it would apply
[00:58:41.180 --> 00:58:42.100]   to your situation.
[00:58:42.100 --> 00:58:44.160]   First, with regard to a 529 plan.
[00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:48.980]   Yes, if you do not pay a state income tax,
[00:58:48.980 --> 00:58:51.740]   as you do not pay in Texas,
[00:58:51.740 --> 00:58:55.220]   a 529 plan is of limited value
[00:58:55.220 --> 00:58:58.660]   with regard to tax considerations.
[00:58:58.660 --> 00:59:00.940]   When you put money into a 529 plan
[00:59:00.940 --> 00:59:03.860]   or a Coverdell Educational Savings Account,
[00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:07.020]   you do not get an upfront tax deduction.
[00:59:07.020 --> 00:59:11.420]   As the money grows over time,
[00:59:11.420 --> 00:59:14.740]   when you take it out and use the money
[00:59:14.740 --> 00:59:18.700]   for a qualified education-related expense,
[00:59:18.700 --> 00:59:22.140]   you can take the money out and pay for that expense
[00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:25.420]   without paying taxes on the growth.
[00:59:25.420 --> 00:59:28.300]   So what you save with a 529 plan
[00:59:28.300 --> 00:59:30.900]   is the amount of tax that you would incur
[00:59:30.900 --> 00:59:33.380]   on the growth of the asset.
[00:59:33.380 --> 00:59:36.340]   Because you have a young child,
[00:59:36.340 --> 00:59:38.620]   you said one-year-old, right?
[00:59:38.620 --> 00:59:39.500]   - One-year-old, yes, sir.
[00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:42.060]   - Because you have a young child,
[00:59:42.060 --> 00:59:46.080]   that tax growth might be substantial.
[00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:47.980]   So it might be.
[00:59:47.980 --> 00:59:51.460]   And let's talk about, let's run a quick analysis.
[00:59:51.460 --> 00:59:54.140]   How much would you put away in this account
[00:59:54.140 --> 00:59:56.300]   for your one-year-old's education?
[00:59:56.300 --> 01:00:00.580]   - How much would I put away into the 529 account?
[01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:02.060]   - Yes, per year.
[01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:06.460]   - Per year, probably about $5,000 per year.
[01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:09.680]   - Okay, and would you do that for the next 17 years?
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:15.060]   - Unless I had an increase in income, yes.
[01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:17.540]   - All right, so let's run a quick financial calculator
[01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:19.580]   and see how much would be the interest
[01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:21.820]   on that particular account.
[01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:23.180]   So the first thing we're gonna do
[01:00:23.180 --> 01:00:26.340]   is we're gonna put in a $5,000 annual payment
[01:00:26.340 --> 01:00:29.580]   for 17 years at a 0% interest,
[01:00:29.580 --> 01:00:32.220]   starting with an account value of zero.
[01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:33.780]   And at the end of 17 years,
[01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:37.140]   that would be total contributions of $85,000,
[01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:39.900]   simply $5,000 times 17.
[01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:42.980]   Now, how much do you think you will earn
[01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:45.220]   on your 529 account investments
[01:00:45.220 --> 01:00:47.120]   in terms of annual rate of return?
[01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:50.540]   - The challenge with the 529,
[01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:54.380]   the way that I have it set up in this case
[01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:57.440]   is it's through Vanguard, and it's one of their,
[01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:01.060]   I guess, scaling portfolios,
[01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:03.100]   so they add in more bonds
[01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:07.880]   toward the maturity of the due date.
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:10.140]   And so, I don't know, it's been hard for me
[01:01:10.140 --> 01:01:13.460]   to think through what I would and could expect
[01:01:13.460 --> 01:01:20.300]   as an interest on those contributions.
[01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:23.340]   - So give me your best guess that you would be comfortable
[01:01:23.340 --> 01:01:25.260]   in using for calculation purposes.
[01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:29.660]   - 5%.
[01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:33.180]   - Okay, so let's put in now a 5% interest rate,
[01:01:33.180 --> 01:01:35.060]   or annualized rate of return,
[01:01:35.060 --> 01:01:37.380]   which means that at the end of 17 years,
[01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:39.940]   if you could earn 5% each year,
[01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:44.300]   you would have an account value of $135,600.
[01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:47.920]   So let's just round it off to $135,600.
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:52.920]   So 135,600 minus $85,000 equals $50,600.
[01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:58.300]   So the value of the 529 account would be
[01:01:58.300 --> 01:02:02.500]   that you can avoid paying tax on the growth
[01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:05.340]   from that $50,600.
[01:02:05.340 --> 01:02:08.640]   Now, what is your effective tax rate personally?
[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:15.940]   - 2019, I think it's 24%.
[01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:20.940]   - Okay, so a 24% effective tax rate is $12,000 of taxes
[01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:23.740]   on that $50,000 number.
[01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:27.020]   So by using a 529 account,
[01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:29.900]   you could potentially, if your tax rate stays the same,
[01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:33.560]   you could potentially save yourself about $12,000 in taxes.
[01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:37.540]   Now, does that number seem to you like a lot or a little?
[01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:41.140]   - To me, it seems like a lot.
[01:02:41.140 --> 01:02:44.060]   - Okay, now I would say that it's not insubstantial.
[01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:46.220]   It does sound on the higher end.
[01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:47.900]   Now, the reason that it's on the higher end
[01:02:47.900 --> 01:02:50.540]   is because you're talking about a one-year-old.
[01:02:50.540 --> 01:02:53.360]   Most people will never have that much growth
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:55.260]   on a 529 account because they start
[01:02:55.260 --> 01:02:59.500]   when their children are eight or 10 or 12,
[01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:01.580]   and they wanna put the money away for college,
[01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:03.420]   but because they're so close to college,
[01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:06.420]   they can't actually invest the money all that aggressively.
[01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:07.380]   And that's one of the challenges
[01:03:07.380 --> 01:03:09.740]   with even the age-banded portfolios
[01:03:09.740 --> 01:03:12.400]   is they constantly move money from stocks to bonds,
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:14.540]   which you kinda have to do because as you get closer,
[01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:18.060]   you don't wanna suffer a 30% correction in the stock market
[01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:19.260]   that takes away 30% of your money
[01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:20.660]   right when you need it for college,
[01:03:20.660 --> 01:03:22.580]   but unfortunately, it also puts a major drag
[01:03:22.580 --> 01:03:24.660]   on your potential returns from stocks.
[01:03:24.660 --> 01:03:28.140]   So the reason I go through those calculations,
[01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:32.460]   you are in the perfect position to use a 529 account,
[01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:36.500]   but yet even you, it's only about $12,000 of tax savings
[01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:38.420]   that you would incur.
[01:03:38.420 --> 01:03:40.260]   Now, I wouldn't sneeze at that,
[01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:43.300]   but it's also not hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[01:03:43.300 --> 01:03:45.100]   That's very different than the calculation
[01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:46.460]   on a retirement account.
[01:03:46.460 --> 01:03:49.060]   When you have a 40-year or 30- or 40-year
[01:03:49.060 --> 01:03:50.220]   investment time horizon
[01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:52.700]   instead of a 17-year time horizon,
[01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:54.780]   then you can really produce major gains.
[01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:57.700]   Now, investing in the retirement account
[01:03:57.700 --> 01:03:59.100]   is a really big deal.
[01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:00.940]   So I would point out to you
[01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:03.220]   that you should know the actual numbers
[01:04:03.220 --> 01:04:05.900]   from the benefit of a 529 account.
[01:04:05.900 --> 01:04:09.220]   Secondly, remember that that's not the only way
[01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:11.560]   for you to save on taxes.
[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:15.500]   Example, you could purchase assets
[01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:17.520]   that you don't pay ordinary income tax rates on.
[01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:18.660]   You could purchase assets
[01:04:18.660 --> 01:04:20.780]   that are long-term capital gains assets.
[01:04:20.780 --> 01:04:23.900]   You could buy a stock or an efficient index fund
[01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:25.380]   or a piece of real estate,
[01:04:25.380 --> 01:04:27.580]   hold that real estate for many years.
[01:04:27.580 --> 01:04:29.220]   And if you could find a way to make more
[01:04:29.220 --> 01:04:32.820]   than the 5% that you get in the Vanguard 529 portfolio,
[01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:35.060]   and if you can find a way
[01:04:35.060 --> 01:04:37.220]   to pay long-term capital gains rates
[01:04:37.220 --> 01:04:39.020]   instead of personal income tax rates,
[01:04:39.020 --> 01:04:41.180]   your rate could be lower than the 24%
[01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:44.060]   that you are currently paying on your personal household.
[01:04:44.060 --> 01:04:48.060]   So 529 accounts aren't the only path to that solution.
[01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:51.180]   Secondly, or next, your plan with putting money
[01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:54.380]   into a Roth IRA, in my opinion, is a great one.
[01:04:54.380 --> 01:04:58.100]   If you put $5,000 aside into a Roth IRA each year
[01:04:58.100 --> 01:05:00.540]   for the next 17 years, at that point in time,
[01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:04.980]   you have $85,000 available to you for college
[01:05:04.980 --> 01:05:08.340]   that you could just take out and pay for college.
[01:05:08.340 --> 01:05:11.920]   You wouldn't be able to take out the $135,000,
[01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:13.180]   which would be the growth,
[01:05:13.180 --> 01:05:14.300]   but all of the rest of that money
[01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:15.860]   could stay in the Roth IRA,
[01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:18.460]   and then you could use it for other needs as well.
[01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:21.260]   And so you would have the $85,000 available to you.
[01:05:21.260 --> 01:05:25.260]   So if you were choosing between a Roth IRA or a 529
[01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:26.780]   with the amount of money that you have to save,
[01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:29.260]   I would move you in the direction of a Roth IRA.
[01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:31.420]   If you're already maxing out Roth IRAs
[01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:34.380]   and you're looking for an additional account to use,
[01:05:34.380 --> 01:05:36.180]   then I would put you in the direction
[01:05:36.180 --> 01:05:37.780]   of another type of account.
[01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:38.600]   Make sense?
[01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:41.780]   - Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.
[01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:44.760]   So, you know, let me ask you this,
[01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:48.340]   and deciding between the two,
[01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:52.300]   when it comes time for, like,
[01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:55.420]   applying for scholarships or perhaps financial aid
[01:05:55.420 --> 01:05:56.660]   or whatever it might be,
[01:05:56.660 --> 01:06:01.220]   and the institution wants to look into
[01:06:01.220 --> 01:06:05.020]   specific assets or income to see what you qualify for,
[01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:09.980]   will they look into retirement accounts like a Roth IRA?
[01:06:09.980 --> 01:06:12.000]   - Let me ask you a question.
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.780]   How confident are you that the environment
[01:06:14.780 --> 01:06:18.260]   that your one-year-old will go into with college
[01:06:18.260 --> 01:06:21.640]   will look the same as it looks today in 17 years?
[01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:25.340]   - Not very confident.
[01:06:25.340 --> 01:06:27.560]   - Right, that's the problem,
[01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:29.620]   is I can answer the question today,
[01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:32.120]   but you have a one-year-old,
[01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:35.500]   you have a one-year-old, not a 17-year-old,
[01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:37.940]   and I have zero, okay,
[01:06:37.940 --> 01:06:42.940]   I have .01% confidence that the situation
[01:06:42.940 --> 01:06:46.160]   will look anything like it looks in 17 years.
[01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:49.040]   We are undergoing a revolution right now
[01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:51.240]   in the world of college academics,
[01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:54.320]   and let me identify just a couple things for you to watch.
[01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:58.840]   Number one, there is a major debate going on between people
[01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:02.760]   as to whether or not a college degree has financial value,
[01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:05.040]   and this debate is difficult to find the answer to
[01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:09.300]   because all college degrees are not created equal.
[01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:12.940]   So there is clear and compelling evidence
[01:07:12.940 --> 01:07:16.060]   that people with college degrees earn a lot more
[01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:17.460]   over the course of their lifetime
[01:07:17.460 --> 01:07:19.780]   than people without college degrees.
[01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:22.600]   I don't know, and I have never seen any writing
[01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:24.480]   or effective persuasive argument
[01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:28.700]   as to whether that is a matter of causation or correlation.
[01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:32.380]   I went to college because I'm not a loser,
[01:07:32.380 --> 01:07:34.040]   and when I was in high school,
[01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:35.860]   I was under the impression
[01:07:35.860 --> 01:07:38.400]   that only losers don't go to college,
[01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:40.740]   and I'm not a loser, so I went to college,
[01:07:40.740 --> 01:07:45.740]   but I can trace none of my personal success or failures,
[01:07:45.740 --> 01:07:48.660]   but I can't trace any of my personal success in life
[01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:50.020]   to my college degree.
[01:07:50.020 --> 01:07:51.940]   I can't trace any of it.
[01:07:51.940 --> 01:07:54.220]   About the best thing that I can say
[01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:56.580]   that came for me from my college years
[01:07:56.580 --> 01:07:58.180]   was the fact that I met my wife,
[01:07:58.180 --> 01:08:00.860]   and we married happily after college,
[01:08:00.860 --> 01:08:05.860]   but I can't trace any direct causation of my college degree
[01:08:05.860 --> 01:08:08.260]   on my personal success in life.
[01:08:08.260 --> 01:08:09.860]   Rather, I look at it and say,
[01:08:09.860 --> 01:08:12.340]   if someone had come along and given me a different path,
[01:08:12.340 --> 01:08:14.300]   I think I would have a lot more money.
[01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:15.820]   I think I'd be a lot more successful today
[01:08:15.820 --> 01:08:17.040]   if I hadn't gone to college,
[01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:18.600]   if I'd pursued a different path.
[01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:21.120]   College cost me a lot of money and a lot of time,
[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:23.440]   and I don't trace a lot of value from that.
[01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:25.120]   So how do you find the answer?
[01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:25.960]   I don't know.
[01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:27.560]   Some of the academic will have to figure out
[01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:30.200]   and how to suss out causation versus correlation
[01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:32.360]   on college degrees and lifetime earnings.
[01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:33.200]   I don't know.
[01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:34.480]   I'm not competent enough to do that,
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:36.400]   but that's a big thing that's happening.
[01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:39.080]   Number two, a lot of people that go to college
[01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:40.660]   are very hurt by college.
[01:08:40.660 --> 01:08:43.000]   When I look around my peers,
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.540]   very few of us trace any major benefits to college.
[01:08:46.540 --> 01:08:48.040]   Most of us would simply agree
[01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:50.320]   that college allows us to get jobs more easily
[01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:51.900]   because we can tick the box
[01:08:51.900 --> 01:08:54.520]   that we have a college degree.
[01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:56.640]   But if you look at the trends in employer data,
[01:08:56.640 --> 01:08:58.200]   that is changing.
[01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:01.480]   Many employers are not requiring college degrees,
[01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:06.000]   or at least are not so strict about it as they once were.
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.500]   Traditionally, the biggest value of a college degree
[01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:10.200]   for an employer was that a college degree
[01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:12.000]   demonstrated to the employer
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:17.000]   that the applicant was successful at finishing things.
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:21.840]   It takes somebody who's a finisher to finish high school,
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:24.000]   to go to college and finish college.
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.080]   And so that was useful.
[01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:28.400]   But, and then also someone who's smart
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:29.960]   and has a basic level of knowledge.
[01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:31.160]   But jobs are changing,
[01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:33.260]   and the information that's needed,
[01:09:33.260 --> 01:09:35.480]   the skills that are needed are changing so quickly
[01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:38.160]   that with the exception of the hard sciences,
[01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:41.240]   where you need that four years in engineering classes,
[01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:43.980]   you need those four years in mathematics classes,
[01:09:43.980 --> 01:09:46.280]   you need those four years in chemistry classes,
[01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:47.760]   because it's directly relevant
[01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:50.560]   to your materials science research.
[01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:51.880]   Most college degrees,
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:54.600]   the information is obsolete by the time you get out.
[01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:55.640]   They're not current.
[01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:57.920]   They're not cutting edge at all.
[01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:00.200]   Just the simplest example was when I was in college,
[01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:01.880]   I had a class on writing,
[01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:03.920]   and they would teach us proper business writing.
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:05.100]   And so I used to do it.
[01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:06.200]   When I got out in the business world,
[01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:08.520]   I'm a good writer and I would write proper emails.
[01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:09.880]   Nobody read my emails.
[01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:11.920]   So the only way that I got my emails answered
[01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:12.880]   in the business world,
[01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:15.560]   is I put the text of my email in the subject line,
[01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:17.840]   and then I copied and pasted it to the body of the email,
[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:19.600]   which would make any English teacher
[01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:21.240]   break out in cold sweats,
[01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:23.180]   but I would get answers to my emails that way
[01:10:23.180 --> 01:10:24.940]   when I wouldn't with my perfectly formatted
[01:10:24.940 --> 01:10:26.500]   professional letter.
[01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:28.840]   So, you know, the things that are taught in college,
[01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:30.280]   with the exception of the hard sciences,
[01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:31.560]   are largely obsolete.
[01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:32.720]   Other things that are happening,
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:36.720]   there is a massive problem in the student debt market.
[01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:39.680]   And the student debt market is very, very difficult.
[01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:41.400]   There are a lot of people with student debt
[01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:44.120]   who went into student debt for worthless degrees
[01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:45.920]   that feel like they were bamboozled.
[01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:46.760]   They were hoodwinks.
[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:47.800]   They were fooled.
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:51.480]   And so they have a job that doesn't pay for the debt.
[01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:54.520]   And so you have this massive clamoring on all sides
[01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:56.340]   for a political solution.
[01:10:56.340 --> 01:11:00.520]   Look at the tremendous upswell of support
[01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:01.840]   that Senator Bernie Sanders had.
[01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:05.920]   And one of the bases for his economic plan
[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:08.640]   was the idea that we're gonna wipe out student debts.
[01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:10.100]   We're gonna make college free.
[01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:11.640]   Now, I don't know what direction the politics
[01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:13.380]   in the United States of America are going,
[01:11:13.380 --> 01:11:14.600]   but it's very hard to see
[01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:16.600]   that that just disappears overnight.
[01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:19.920]   That political position is very, very strong.
[01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:22.900]   And I could go on and on, but today, even today,
[01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:26.360]   college, if you look at it and say, is it expensive?
[01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:30.240]   Anybody with good academic competence
[01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:33.080]   and decent cognitive ability today
[01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:36.460]   can go to college working a minimum wage job
[01:11:36.460 --> 01:11:37.880]   at a fast food restaurant
[01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:41.080]   and pay for the whole thing in cash.
[01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:44.600]   There are so many free and inexpensive options available.
[01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:45.440]   There's a big press.
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:46.840]   First of all, online universities
[01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:48.360]   are really coming into their own.
[01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:49.940]   Today, you can get an accredited degree
[01:11:49.940 --> 01:11:53.000]   from an online university for less than 10,000 bucks total
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:54.500]   for a four-year degree.
[01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:56.800]   The state colleges, the community college approach,
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:59.560]   the state college approach is stronger than it's ever been.
[01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:01.000]   Prices are coming down.
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.600]   And the financial aid market
[01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:06.140]   for people with good college skills,
[01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:09.000]   good cognitive ability is stronger than it's ever been.
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.760]   There are so many colleges all across the country
[01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:14.400]   that somebody with good skills, good grades,
[01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:18.240]   good test scores can go to and be guaranteed a full ride.
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:20.060]   And so I look at it and say,
[01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:21.300]   we should pay attention to that.
[01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:24.140]   If your child does not have good cognitive ability,
[01:12:24.140 --> 01:12:26.340]   it is not academically skilled,
[01:12:26.340 --> 01:12:27.860]   they shouldn't go to college
[01:12:27.860 --> 01:12:29.620]   because the horror stories of college
[01:12:29.620 --> 01:12:32.480]   are the people who go and are not well-suited for it.
[01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:33.840]   They go and they fail out.
[01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:36.340]   Now they have $15,000 of student loan debt.
[01:12:36.340 --> 01:12:38.420]   They finished two years of a degree.
[01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:40.520]   They don't have the degree and all they have is the debt.
[01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:42.540]   They weren't a good match for college.
[01:12:42.540 --> 01:12:43.940]   So the only people that should go to college
[01:12:43.940 --> 01:12:45.340]   are people who are a good match for college
[01:12:45.340 --> 01:12:46.900]   and people who are a good match for college
[01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:48.260]   don't need to pay for it today.
[01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:49.580]   Or if they do need to pay for it,
[01:12:49.580 --> 01:12:52.420]   they can work part-time and pay for it
[01:12:52.420 --> 01:12:53.540]   out of their earnings.
[01:12:53.540 --> 01:12:55.900]   So I think 17 years from now,
[01:12:55.900 --> 01:12:58.020]   these trends are just going to continue.
[01:12:58.020 --> 01:12:59.700]   I think 17 years from now,
[01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:02.340]   you'll be able to get an accredited degree
[01:13:02.340 --> 01:13:05.540]   from an online university while you're a teenager
[01:13:05.540 --> 01:13:07.900]   for less than a few thousand bucks less.
[01:13:07.900 --> 01:13:10.140]   And there's no reason to save for that kind of thing.
[01:13:10.140 --> 01:13:13.960]   I think the costs for state universities and such like that
[01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:16.920]   will be forced by the market to come down
[01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:20.040]   because of the market pressures
[01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:25.940]   or because of government legislation
[01:13:25.940 --> 01:13:28.460]   where state universities become free,
[01:13:28.460 --> 01:13:31.760]   as in paid for by other people other than the student,
[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:35.320]   and/or the cost for the elite universities,
[01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:37.040]   the sorting mechanism of the elite universities,
[01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:38.680]   those will continue to ride,
[01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:41.220]   but there will continue to be plenty of option
[01:13:41.220 --> 01:13:46.220]   to have those things paid for by the universities
[01:13:46.220 --> 01:13:49.440]   and by scholarship programs and things like that.
[01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:50.880]   So that's your problem.
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:54.120]   Your problem is how's your crystal ball 17 years from now
[01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:59.120]   trying to tell you how much money you should pay for college?
[01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:01.640]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:04.600]   And I think that's one of the most attractive things
[01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:08.240]   about using the contributions from a Roth IRA
[01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:12.180]   rather than a 529 is with that evolution
[01:14:12.180 --> 01:14:14.020]   and not knowing what that's gonna look like
[01:14:14.020 --> 01:14:17.720]   or if it's even gonna be relevant in the next 17 years,
[01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:19.780]   or if for whatever reason,
[01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:22.180]   my little boy doesn't wanna go to college,
[01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:23.460]   I can go ahead and leave those in there
[01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:24.980]   to continue to grow for retirement
[01:14:24.980 --> 01:14:28.220]   or use those contributions for another endeavor.
[01:14:28.220 --> 01:14:31.980]   But so I just wanted to run that by you.
[01:14:31.980 --> 01:14:34.860]   I mean, the gentleman that called in yesterday
[01:14:34.860 --> 01:14:39.240]   that was asking about transfer of beneficiaries
[01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:43.200]   from one 529 to the other on his two girls,
[01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:48.200]   just got me thinking about the scholarship side of things.
[01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:52.740]   And if I were to leave them in a Roth IRA,
[01:14:52.740 --> 01:14:57.080]   would that open up more doors for potential scholarships
[01:14:57.080 --> 01:14:58.120]   later on down the road,
[01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:03.000]   rather than being limited to the scholarship institutions
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.180]   that could look behind the 529 curtain and say,
[01:15:05.180 --> 01:15:08.000]   well, you don't necessarily need this scholarship.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:08.840]   - Right.
[01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:10.960]   So let me answer that question specifically.
[01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:14.740]   There are many scholarships that are available
[01:15:14.740 --> 01:15:18.900]   that do not take into account any assets, income,
[01:15:18.900 --> 01:15:22.260]   or resources of the parent or student
[01:15:22.260 --> 01:15:24.120]   in their consideration.
[01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:27.220]   Example, where I live in Florida,
[01:15:27.220 --> 01:15:30.660]   the Florida Lottery underwrites a scholarship program,
[01:15:30.660 --> 01:15:33.780]   and that scholarship program is exclusively based
[01:15:33.780 --> 01:15:37.620]   upon the grades of the student.
[01:15:37.620 --> 01:15:41.560]   All of my siblings and I got many thousands of dollars
[01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:44.620]   per year for college because we had good grades,
[01:15:44.620 --> 01:15:48.220]   and there was no requirement that we submit any information
[01:15:48.220 --> 01:15:53.220]   about our parents' assets, our parents' income, et cetera.
[01:15:53.220 --> 01:15:57.020]   So there was no requirement from that perspective.
[01:15:57.020 --> 01:16:00.020]   Secondly, there are many scholarships that are available
[01:16:00.020 --> 01:16:02.400]   that don't pay any attention to assets
[01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:05.680]   that are available from schools and from organizations.
[01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:09.500]   If you are a Choctaw Indian or whatever,
[01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:11.300]   you have some ethnic heritage,
[01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:13.340]   there's a scholarship for that.
[01:16:13.340 --> 01:16:15.700]   If your child winds up designing robots,
[01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:18.020]   there's a scholarship for that.
[01:16:18.020 --> 01:16:21.080]   There are tons of scholarships that don't take into account
[01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:23.620]   any financial considerations.
[01:16:23.620 --> 01:16:26.820]   And so that's important for you to notice and to recognize
[01:16:26.820 --> 01:16:28.980]   is the best thing to do is to make sure
[01:16:28.980 --> 01:16:31.060]   that your child is academically skilled
[01:16:31.060 --> 01:16:33.900]   and that they qualify for as many scholarships as possible
[01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:38.900]   that don't relate to their personal income or assets,
[01:16:38.900 --> 01:16:40.660]   because those are available.
[01:16:40.660 --> 01:16:45.140]   Now, the big problem is that most scholarships,
[01:16:45.140 --> 01:16:46.800]   especially from schools,
[01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:49.740]   and are based upon what's called the FAFSA,
[01:16:49.740 --> 01:16:52.180]   the Free Application for Federal Student Aid.
[01:16:52.180 --> 01:16:54.340]   And the FAFSA is a document you can go on
[01:16:54.340 --> 01:16:59.340]   and you can use a free FAFSA estimator online right now.
[01:16:59.340 --> 01:17:04.420]   And so if you go on and you use that FAFSA,
[01:17:04.420 --> 01:17:07.380]   you can put your numbers in and put your expected numbers in
[01:17:07.380 --> 01:17:08.700]   and you can play with the formula
[01:17:08.700 --> 01:17:09.660]   and you can find out
[01:17:09.660 --> 01:17:12.860]   what your expected family contribution is.
[01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:14.580]   So when you run that FAFSA,
[01:17:14.580 --> 01:17:16.980]   it will create a number that's called your EFC,
[01:17:16.980 --> 01:17:18.980]   your expected family contribution.
[01:17:18.980 --> 01:17:21.620]   And that's how much money you're supposed to give
[01:17:21.620 --> 01:17:25.740]   to your children for their college expenses.
[01:17:25.740 --> 01:17:28.420]   And that FAFSA will relate,
[01:17:28.420 --> 01:17:31.380]   it will list out your assets
[01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:34.040]   and it will list out your income.
[01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:38.860]   So that's the basic function of it.
[01:17:38.860 --> 01:17:42.220]   Most schools, most colleges and universities
[01:17:42.220 --> 01:17:43.840]   will also use that number
[01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:46.740]   in determining their own financial aid calculations
[01:17:46.740 --> 01:17:48.900]   within their local scholarship department.
[01:17:48.900 --> 01:17:51.900]   Many of them will require you to fill out the FAFSA
[01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:56.340]   in order to be eligible for their school's scholarships.
[01:17:56.340 --> 01:17:59.980]   Now, I'm not convinced that people should use that form,
[01:17:59.980 --> 01:18:03.340]   but if you're gonna do college planning,
[01:18:03.340 --> 01:18:05.020]   then you're gonna do that.
[01:18:05.020 --> 01:18:06.020]   So the question is how,
[01:18:06.020 --> 01:18:08.500]   the specific question is how are things reported
[01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:10.680]   on the FAFSA?
[01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:12.340]   Now, on a FAFSA,
[01:18:12.340 --> 01:18:17.340]   the assets are reported of a 529 account.
[01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:22.560]   But what, so any assets that are owned by the parent
[01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:25.280]   or the student or which they're a beneficiary,
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:26.680]   those assets, sorry,
[01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:28.360]   any assets that are owned by the parent or the student
[01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:30.680]   are gonna be reported on the FAFSA.
[01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:33.400]   And then what they do is they take that,
[01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:35.440]   the amounts that are in those accounts
[01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:37.120]   and then they assess a rate.
[01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:39.020]   I think it's about 5.5%.
[01:18:39.020 --> 01:18:43.240]   So they take a 529 plan and they take the balance of it,
[01:18:43.240 --> 01:18:45.080]   take about 5.5% of that,
[01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:50.080]   and they apply that towards the financial aid eligibility.
[01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:52.760]   It's my understanding at the moment,
[01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:54.080]   I'm not an expert, check me out,
[01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:56.640]   but it's my understanding that things like a Roth IRA,
[01:18:56.640 --> 01:18:58.080]   the balance is not brought
[01:18:58.080 --> 01:19:00.040]   to the expected family contribution.
[01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:01.660]   That can be a benefit to it.
[01:19:01.660 --> 01:19:04.160]   But if you take income out of the Roth IRA,
[01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:07.280]   then now all of that income will be assessed
[01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:09.240]   based upon its contribution,
[01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:10.360]   which is a much higher rate.
[01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:11.880]   I think it's about half.
[01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:16.760]   And so if you take out money from the Roth IRA
[01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:18.980]   and use that to pay for college,
[01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:22.480]   the higher income amount that's reported on the FAFSA
[01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:26.400]   will be a bigger problem than the 529 account.
[01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:28.440]   So for the purposes of the FAFSA,
[01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:33.880]   the 529 account is a good account to have
[01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:39.520]   because of that 5.5% rate versus the 50% rate.
[01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:41.900]   So that would be the kind of advice
[01:19:41.900 --> 01:19:44.120]   that would apply to somebody who's 16 or 17
[01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:45.560]   as they're trying to figure it out.
[01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:47.960]   But for you, given that you don't even know
[01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:49.280]   what you're gonna do,
[01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:51.160]   you don't know where you're gonna be in 17 years,
[01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:54.200]   I think the Roth IRA offers many more flexible options,
[01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:56.520]   and I don't think the FAFSA will look
[01:19:56.520 --> 01:19:58.960]   like it does today in 17 years.
[01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:01.400]   So that's the technical answer to your question
[01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:02.840]   as I understand it,
[01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:05.200]   and then you have to figure out what to do with that.
[01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:06.800]   Make sense?
[01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:07.640]   - Yeah, it makes sense.
[01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:09.080]   One last quick question for you though
[01:20:09.080 --> 01:20:11.640]   is are the contributions that are pulled out
[01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:15.000]   of the Roth IRA considered income
[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.300]   even though you've already paid taxes on them?
[01:20:17.300 --> 01:20:21.720]   - Huh.
[01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:23.760]   I don't know.
[01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:26.440]   - Okay.
[01:20:26.440 --> 01:20:28.760]   - That's a good question.
[01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:30.640]   I don't know.
[01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:31.760]   I never thought about that
[01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:33.480]   when I was reading college advisors
[01:20:33.480 --> 01:20:35.660]   talking about this debate.
[01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:39.540]   I think not,
[01:20:39.540 --> 01:20:44.120]   which might turn, well.
[01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:45.360]   - Doesn't seem like it would be
[01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:47.840]   since it was already reported as income.
[01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:49.240]   - Right, right.
[01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:50.320]   That is a good question.
[01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:52.600]   I don't know the answer to it.
[01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:54.900]   I will attempt to research it and try to find out,
[01:20:54.900 --> 01:20:56.300]   but it doesn't seem to me,
[01:20:56.300 --> 01:20:58.520]   because when you take a distribution from a Roth IRA
[01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:00.760]   that's just simply a return of contribution,
[01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:02.480]   why would that be counted as income
[01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:05.140]   if it's not reported as income on your tax return?
[01:21:05.140 --> 01:21:07.680]   Good question, sir.
[01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:09.640]   Let's close it out with I don't know.
[01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:10.560]   You research it.
[01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:11.520]   I'll try to research it
[01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:13.680]   and see if I can come up with an answer,
[01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:16.200]   because I didn't think about that wrinkle
[01:21:16.200 --> 01:21:18.560]   until you just asked the question.
[01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:19.440]   - Yeah.
[01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:21.920]   Yeah, I'll dig into it a little bit,
[01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:23.520]   and if I come across anything,
[01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:25.080]   I'll just post it to the show notes
[01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:25.920]   in the comments section.
[01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:26.740]   - That would be great.
[01:21:26.740 --> 01:21:27.720]   And I'll say this to you.
[01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:29.600]   I don't think parents should,
[01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:32.400]   the only place I see for five to nine accounts
[01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:36.680]   is for somebody who has a long time horizon.
[01:21:37.640 --> 01:21:39.240]   There are a number of situations.
[01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:40.560]   For example, if somebody has a lot of money,
[01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:41.640]   a grandparent has a lot of money,
[01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:43.640]   a five to nine account is one of the most useful
[01:21:43.640 --> 01:21:44.880]   estate planning tools out there
[01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:47.040]   because you can give a gift to present interest,
[01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:50.120]   but still control, a completed gift to present interest,
[01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:51.080]   but still control the account.
[01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:53.240]   So grandparents, very useful.
[01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:55.240]   There's an addition with now that five to nine accounts
[01:21:55.240 --> 01:21:57.880]   are opened up to pay for private schools,
[01:21:57.880 --> 01:21:59.000]   for K through 12,
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.080]   I think more parents should consider them.
[01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:02.840]   But for what you're describing to me,
[01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:05.020]   I don't think they should be a primary use.
[01:22:05.020 --> 01:22:05.920]   I think better,
[01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:07.800]   make sure your children get good grades,
[01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:10.920]   are intelligent people and get a good deal on college
[01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:13.240]   or make the university pay you to go there.
[01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:15.040]   Don't bother with these accounts
[01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:18.000]   thinking that somehow saving money for college
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:18.960]   is gonna be a big deal.
[01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:23.000]   I think that by the time your 17 year old is in college,
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:26.480]   by my political finger up in the wind,
[01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:29.600]   it sure seems to me like there's not going to be,
[01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:30.440]   there's not gonna,
[01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:35.440]   that government sponsored tuition at college
[01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:37.440]   will be fully available.
[01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:38.560]   And let me just explain why,
[01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:41.600]   so you can consider if you think so as well.
[01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:44.320]   Should government schools exist for K through 12?
[01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:47.880]   - You're asking me?
[01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:49.440]   - Yes.
[01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:51.480]   - Should government schools exist for K through 12?
[01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:53.880]   - What's your opinion?
[01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:55.960]   - My opinion is yes.
[01:22:55.960 --> 01:22:56.800]   - Okay.
[01:22:56.800 --> 01:22:57.640]   - As long as we're paying taxes.
[01:22:57.640 --> 01:22:58.480]   - Okay.
[01:22:58.480 --> 01:23:01.760]   Now, in that case,
[01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:03.760]   should government schools exist
[01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:06.200]   for four years of undergraduate school?
[01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:12.400]   - You know, I haven't thought about that.
[01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:13.880]   - So if you'll think about it,
[01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:14.920]   in my analysis,
[01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:17.920]   if you think government schools should exist
[01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:19.040]   for K through 12,
[01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:24.040]   the logic of that position will also lead you to believe
[01:23:24.040 --> 01:23:26.120]   that you think government schools should exist
[01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:28.440]   for kindergarten and preschool.
[01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:30.880]   And the same logic will lead you to think
[01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:33.000]   that government schools should exist
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.160]   for undergraduate degrees at least,
[01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:37.280]   and maybe graduate degrees.
[01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:39.400]   Because there's no difference in logic
[01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:43.520]   between pre-K, sixth grade, 12th grade,
[01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:46.000]   or a four-year undergraduate degree
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.520]   if you think government schools should exist.
[01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:50.400]   And the majority of people think
[01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:52.240]   that government schools should exist.
[01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:56.480]   And so I don't see any logical or ideological difference
[01:23:56.480 --> 01:23:58.880]   between four years of an undergraduate school
[01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:00.560]   versus 10th grade.
[01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:03.520]   So how can this artificial demarcation exist?
[01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:05.840]   You have government schools for K through 12
[01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:08.620]   that are free for anybody who lives in that district.
[01:24:08.620 --> 01:24:12.200]   You have government-sponsored state universities
[01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:13.240]   that are not free.
[01:24:13.240 --> 01:24:14.840]   Why shouldn't they be free too?
[01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:18.120]   Now, I personally don't think government schools
[01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:19.040]   should exist.
[01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:21.120]   That's my own personal ideological position.
[01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:24.860]   I believe that it's theft for the government to come in
[01:24:24.860 --> 01:24:27.280]   and say, "We're going to take from people over here
[01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:29.840]   with taxes, and we're gonna force other people
[01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:31.880]   to pay for your children's schooling."
[01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:34.220]   So I don't think government schools should exist.
[01:24:34.220 --> 01:24:35.440]   So therefore, I don't think
[01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:38.000]   that government-paid colleges should exist.
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.320]   And I also don't think that government-paid preschool
[01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:43.740]   or kindergarten or primary or secondary school should exist.
[01:24:43.740 --> 01:24:47.960]   But I'm in a very tiny minority of the population.
[01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:48.840]   I don't know the percentage,
[01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:50.280]   but it's gotta be less than 10%
[01:24:50.280 --> 01:24:51.760]   of people who would agree with me.
[01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:54.620]   So I don't see how, in that political environment,
[01:24:54.620 --> 01:24:57.440]   given that most people, my guess, at least 80%,
[01:24:57.440 --> 01:24:58.800]   if not 90% of people,
[01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:01.320]   think that government schools are just fine,
[01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:03.760]   I don't see how that logic doesn't automatically,
[01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:06.460]   over the next decade or two, get extended to colleges,
[01:25:06.460 --> 01:25:08.600]   because there's no ideological difference
[01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:10.580]   that I can find between 10th grade
[01:25:10.580 --> 01:25:12.200]   versus an undergraduate degree.
[01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:13.680]   And so for that reason,
[01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:16.240]   I think by the time that you're in my one-year-olds
[01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:20.440]   are 17 or 18, college education will be paid for
[01:25:20.440 --> 01:25:21.660]   by the state.
[01:25:21.660 --> 01:25:25.800]   You're my, you think about that,
[01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:27.520]   but I can't find any reason,
[01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:29.960]   if I believed that government schools should exist,
[01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:33.160]   I can't find any reason to oppose government-paid colleges.
[01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:35.440]   - Right, okay.
[01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:37.800]   All right, good stuff to think about.
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:38.620]   I appreciate it.
[01:25:38.620 --> 01:25:39.460]   - My pleasure, sir.
[01:25:39.460 --> 01:25:40.520]   Have a great day.
[01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:41.840]   And with that, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:44.280]   we close out today's show.
[01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:46.240]   A little bit longer than I intended.
[01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:47.280]   I hope you've enjoyed the Q&A.
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:49.080]   Thank you to the callers.
[01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:52.400]   My just request for you, go and take these ideas,
[01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:55.920]   think about them, and think about your own personal life.
[01:25:55.920 --> 01:25:59.880]   Analyze your set of circumstances as is appropriate.
[01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:02.960]   Any tool, 529 account, Roth IRA,
[01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:05.000]   Coverdell Educational Savings Account,
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:08.200]   any tool can be used in the right set of circumstances.
[01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:10.600]   And so I can design, as I constantly do,
[01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:14.440]   I can design ideas for you in which this tool is wonderful.
[01:26:14.440 --> 01:26:16.800]   I can identify several plans
[01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:18.800]   in which 529 accounts are incredible,
[01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:21.480]   but you'll only be able to understand what's right for you
[01:26:21.480 --> 01:26:23.560]   if you understand the attributes of the tool,
[01:26:23.560 --> 01:26:24.680]   you understand your goals,
[01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:26.240]   you understand your own thoughts,
[01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:28.800]   and then can apply them to your own situation.
[01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:32.080]   So I hope that these ideas have been useful to you.
[01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:34.420]   And as I go, I've just hit pause
[01:26:34.420 --> 01:26:35.520]   on the recording for a moment
[01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:37.400]   and looked up the answer to the question
[01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:42.400]   on the Roth IRA return of contribution.
[01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:46.300]   And the answer is, for the purposes of financial aid,
[01:26:46.300 --> 01:26:49.640]   the Roth IRA is counted as income.
[01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:53.300]   It's not on your taxable, on your tax return,
[01:26:53.300 --> 01:26:55.560]   but the FAFSA form,
[01:26:55.560 --> 01:26:57.960]   the Free Application for Federal Student Aid,
[01:26:57.960 --> 01:27:01.320]   requires you to list untaxed income.
[01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:03.320]   And that untaxed income,
[01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:05.640]   which is coming in from your Roth IRA
[01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:08.520]   that you list on the FAFSA form
[01:27:08.520 --> 01:27:13.480]   will count in the expected family contribution formula.
[01:27:13.480 --> 01:27:17.840]   So the answer is that, as described,
[01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:20.480]   the 529 account, for the purposes
[01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:23.740]   of having a lower expected family contribution,
[01:27:23.740 --> 01:27:26.080]   the 529 account is superior
[01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:29.000]   to taking distributions from the Roth IRA
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.440]   because the FAFSA will require you
[01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:33.320]   to report untaxed income.
[01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:35.700]   And in that category,
[01:27:35.700 --> 01:27:38.500]   you will report the return of contributions
[01:27:38.500 --> 01:27:40.280]   from your Roth IRA,
[01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:41.760]   or at least that seems to be
[01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:43.800]   what I found based upon research.
[01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:45.720]   Now, I still think that caller
[01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:47.880]   should go first to the Roth IRA
[01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:49.320]   for the reasons previously stated
[01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:51.080]   that I don't think they will need
[01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:54.000]   to take distributions from the Roth IRA.
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:55.320]   And it would seem to me,
[01:27:55.320 --> 01:27:57.120]   although I'm not an expert on the FAFSA,
[01:27:57.120 --> 01:27:59.300]   it would seem to me that there would be
[01:27:59.300 --> 01:28:03.180]   a very simple and easy way of handling this problem
[01:28:03.180 --> 01:28:04.960]   so that you don't have untaxed income.
[01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:08.120]   First, obviously, eliminate the need.
[01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:10.520]   Send your child to a cheap school.
[01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:12.240]   Make sure that your child has good grades.
[01:28:12.240 --> 01:28:15.340]   Make sure that your child has lots of other options.
[01:28:15.340 --> 01:28:18.200]   As far as for academic scholarships
[01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:20.000]   and things that don't rely on the FAFSA,
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:21.960]   make sure that you've adjusted your finances
[01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:24.960]   so you can just pay cash with your income during that time.
[01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:28.600]   But how I would get around this issue with the FAFSA
[01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:33.600]   is since Roth IRA assets are not reported on the FAFSA
[01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:35.840]   because they don't factor into the EFC,
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:38.160]   as long as you don't take a distribution from them,
[01:28:38.160 --> 01:28:40.500]   I would keep the money in the Roth IRA.
[01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:43.580]   Then I would not make a distribution from the account
[01:28:43.580 --> 01:28:45.000]   while the child is in college,
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.660]   while if I'm even filling out the FAFSA.
[01:28:47.660 --> 01:28:51.200]   I would take out a loan and use the loan to pay for college.
[01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:53.280]   And then if to pay back the loan,
[01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:55.200]   I would pay back the loan with the Roth IRA
[01:28:55.200 --> 01:28:56.840]   after the child is out of college,
[01:28:56.840 --> 01:28:59.280]   after I don't have to fill out the FAFSA anymore.
[01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:02.340]   Seems to me the most obvious and simple workaround.
[01:29:02.340 --> 01:29:04.440]   So I still think for that particular listener,
[01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:06.700]   the Roth IRA is superior.
[01:29:06.700 --> 01:29:08.880]   As we go today, wow, what a great time for me
[01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:10.680]   to plug to you my credit card course.
[01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:13.920]   How would I take a loan out against my Roth IRA
[01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:16.060]   for my child's tuition payments?
[01:29:16.060 --> 01:29:19.480]   Well, I would put it on credit cards.
[01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:22.320]   If I had a decent income and a nice big credit score,
[01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:26.120]   I would get a nice big fat 0% interest rate credit card.
[01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:27.360]   I would take that credit card
[01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:29.760]   down to the college accounting department.
[01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:31.080]   I would swipe that thing
[01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:33.460]   and I would get a 15 month interest free loan
[01:29:33.460 --> 01:29:35.020]   on my 0% credit card.
[01:29:35.020 --> 01:29:39.000]   And or I would put it on an Airlines Miles credit card
[01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.100]   and get myself a free plane ticket because of it
[01:29:41.100 --> 01:29:42.340]   or something like that.
[01:29:42.340 --> 01:29:45.020]   I would surf those balances around,
[01:29:45.020 --> 01:29:48.320]   never paying more than a very small balance transfer fee
[01:29:48.320 --> 01:29:50.240]   for a few years while my kid was in college.
[01:29:50.240 --> 01:29:51.880]   And then after my kid was in college,
[01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:52.800]   at that point in time,
[01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:54.280]   if I didn't pay those credit cards off
[01:29:54.280 --> 01:29:57.200]   with just income and extra money that was available,
[01:29:57.200 --> 01:29:58.880]   that's when I would take those distributions
[01:29:58.880 --> 01:30:02.620]   from the Roth IRA and pay off those credit cards.
[01:30:02.620 --> 01:30:04.320]   It's very simple and easy to do.
[01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:06.240]   And as long as you're not paying $100,000
[01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:08.680]   a year tuition payments, it's very, very doable.
[01:30:08.680 --> 01:30:09.960]   It would be silly to pay $100,000
[01:30:09.960 --> 01:30:11.480]   a year tuition payments anyway.
[01:30:11.480 --> 01:30:14.320]   A reasonable approach to college is a few thousand dollars
[01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:16.740]   a year, not hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.
[01:30:16.740 --> 01:30:18.300]   So if you'd like to understand how to do that,
[01:30:18.300 --> 01:30:20.580]   how to build that strategy up so that when your child
[01:30:20.580 --> 01:30:23.660]   is 17 or 18 years old, you can easily do that.
