[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.460]   So, why do we pray?
[00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.280]   That was a question on the table during John Piper's sermon, "Pray Like This, Hello Be
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.840]   Your Name," a sermon he preached on December 30th, 2007.
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.160]   Here's a clip from that message.
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.400]   Why pray?
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:28.340]   Because when you go to God in dependence upon His wisdom and power and love to do what you
[00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:37.320]   long for Him to do according to His will, you mightily make the Father and the Son look
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.000]   great.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.260]   You make them look great.
[00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.440]   When you go to the Father in the name of the Son by the power of the Spirit to do what
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:57.000]   only they can do and you plead and it happens, you make them look great.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:05.560]   So let me give you a verse, John 14, 13, "Whatever you ask in my name, this I will do that the
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.640]   Father may be glorified in the Son."
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:18.460]   Come to me, ask me in the name of myself to the Father and He'll do it that He in me will
[00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.760]   look glorious.
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.280]   That's the reason we pray.
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:32.840]   Or here's the way Paul said it in 2 Corinthians 1, "You also must help us by prayer so that
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:42.960]   many will give thanks on our behalf for the blessing granted to us through many prayers."
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.800]   A complicated sentence but not a complicated point.
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.760]   Let's have lots of people pray so lots of people thank God when it happens.
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.880]   God is really into getting thanks, hence He's into prayer.
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.320]   Here's the way the psalmist said it, Psalm 50, verse 15, "Call upon me in the day of
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:09.800]   trouble and I will deliver you and you will glorify me."
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.400]   So can you draw it near?
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:19.520]   Call upon me in the day of trouble, I will deliver you and you will glorify me.
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.840]   He goes up, He comes down, glory goes back up.
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.720]   That's why we pray.
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:31.480]   We exist to spread a passion for the supremacy of God in all things for the joy of all peoples.
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.960]   And the Bible tells us that prayer magnifies the supremacy of God.
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:45.920]   So we pray because we're really into God's glory and God's supremacy.
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.840]   Here's what Jesus said, Matthew 6, 9.
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:59.880]   Jesus said, "Pray then like this, 'Our Father in heaven, hallowed be Your name.'"
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:07.480]   Wish I could take you back with me to 1968, '69, Noel and I just married, December '68.
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.440]   And I was seeing so much.
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:16.760]   I just felt like my world was being shredded and rebuilt as I immersed myself in the Bible
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.440]   in those early days of school.
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.560]   And I said to her one time, I think it was later in '69, I said, "You know, you can tell
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:33.240]   when your theology is undergoing a Copernican revolution because you pray differently.
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.960]   Like you suddenly wake up to what you're saying here."
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:50.640]   Jesus said, "The first, preeminent, most important, all-encompassing request we should make of
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:58.600]   the living God is make Your name great."
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.760]   That's the first request of the Lord's Prayer.
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:07.720]   "God, hallowed be Your name."
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.960]   Which means, "Cause Your name to be hallowed."
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.320]   Do something, God, for Your name in Minneapolis.
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.740]   Do something for Your name in this church.
[00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:23.520]   Do something for Your name in this family.
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.440]   Do something for Your name in Pakistan today.
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.240]   Let it turn, oh God, for the hallowing of Your name in that aching country.
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:39.520]   This is our request that God be jealous for the name of God.
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:40.520]   People choke on this.
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.160]   What does "hallowed" mean?
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.640]   "Hagia Stata."
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.200]   It means sanctified.
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.400]   It's the word used for sanctified.
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.480]   It's a third-person imperative.
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:58.200]   Like Peter said on the Pentecost, "Let them repent."
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:03.600]   This is modestly and mildly commanding God to do something.
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.600]   Giving Him an imperative.
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.280]   This is a request.
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.760]   We are pleading with God, "Hallow Your name.
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.880]   Make Your name hallowed in the world.
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.880]   Make Your name hallowed in this church.
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.600]   Make Your name hallowed in my children."
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.760]   What does "hallowed" mean?
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:19.760]   Sanctified.
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:25.120]   What does "sanctified" mean for a God who is infinitely holy and doesn't need any improvement?
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.600]   Sanctified means set apart.
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.880]   Set apart like what?
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.200]   How do you mean?
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.760]   God set Your name apart.
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:40.000]   It means God take Your name, this holy representation of Yourself, and set it apart as the most
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:48.280]   precious, holy, beautiful, valuable reality in the mind of the person for whom I'm praying.
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.480]   That's the first thing to pray all the time.
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.480]   All the time.
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:06:00.960]   Number one issue in prayer is, "God, right now in this person I care about, so work that
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.400]   Your name is treasured above my name.
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.920]   That Your name is treasured above money.
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:11.200]   That Your name is treasured above sex, above alcohol, above fame, above approval, above
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.200]   success.
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:16.880]   Make Your name great in their hearts, oh God.
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:21.200]   Be jealous for Your name in their lives."
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:30.600]   That's the overarching, deep, unifying, global thing that holds all praying together.
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:31.600]   Doesn't it?
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:32.600]   I hope it does.
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.080]   I hope this holds your life together.
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.200]   A passion for the supremacy of God.
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:46.840]   I mean, what else could it signify when Jesus says, "When you pray, say, number one,
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:56.400]   God, Father, make sure Your name gets hallowed."
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.800]   Man, I love that clip.
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.440]   That was from John Piper's sermon, "Pray Like This, Hallowed Be Your Name," which he preached
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.200]   on December 30th, 2007.
