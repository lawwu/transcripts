[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.700]   We get a lot of emails on relationships, everything from dating and engagements, marriage, and of course divorce and remarriage.
[00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.780]   This is a genre of email that dominates all the other questions we get, as you know.
[00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:17.620]   And we get a lot of good pushback emails as well and follow-up questions in search of greater
[00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.380]   clarity like this one from a listener named Matthew.
[00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.860]   Pastor John, I have a follow-up to you on episode number 920 on divorce.
[00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.180]   Didn't John the Baptist want Herod to ditch his wife?
[00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.940]   Because John had been saying to him, "It is not lawful for you to have her," present tense.
[00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:43.460]   See Matthew chapter 14 verse 4. He did not say, "It is not lawful for you to have taken her," past tense.
[00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.560]   And we all know how important tense is interpreting the Bible. She is called his wife.
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:54.040]   So how do you reconcile this seemingly clear call for a married couple to divorce?
[00:00:54.580 --> 00:01:02.220]   There are at least three things in this passage that are unknown to us.
[00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:08.380]   And that keep me from using the passage to justify divorce.
[00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:17.180]   I admit, I don't know if that was clear, I admit that sometimes divorce for a faithful believer is inevitable
[00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:24.180]   because Paul says so in 1 Corinthians 7 15 when an unbeliever insists on leaving.
[00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.260]   A believer who does everything he or she can to make the marriage work.
[00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.900]   You can't stop an unbeliever from doing that and therefore
[00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.660]   divorce as they carry it through may be inevitable.
[00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:44.780]   Remarriage in that situation is another issue. We're not talking about that. So let's go back to this text. The text says,
[00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:51.660]   "For Herod has seized John," John the Baptist, "and bound him and put him in prison
[00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.700]   for the sake of Herodias,
[00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.520]   his brother Philip's wife."
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:06.380]   Because John had been saying to him, "It is not lawful for you to have her."
[00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.780]   That's a good translation, by the way. "It is not lawful for you to have her."
[00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.460]   So the first thing that is unknown to me is when
[00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.580]   Herod
[00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.860]   married his brother's wife, or if he actually
[00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:29.180]   married her. When John says, "It is not lawful for you to have her," is he
[00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.860]   definitively saying that they're married, or
[00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:40.220]   only that they're sleeping together or living in some kind of common-law situation, some kind of situation that looks like
[00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.140]   marriage just to avoid legal issues.
[00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.780]   Most commentators
[00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.020]   document that they were married, but
[00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.380]   nobody seems to actually put a date on it in
[00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.580]   relationship to this event. If they weren't
[00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:03.180]   married, then John is saying, "Get out of the relationship. Stop sleeping together."
[00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.460]   Not, "Get out of a marriage." I don't know. I don't know.
[00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.660]   Number two, the second thing that's uncertain isâ€”
[00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.900]   let's just suppose they were married, okay? So the second thing that's
[00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.780]   uncertain is whether John is
[00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.820]   actually saying that the marriage should end. He is saying, "It is unlawful
[00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:33.260]   for you to have her. You sinned in marrying her, if he married her."
[00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:41.540]   But it may also be unlawful to throw her out after she had been married to another man, and
[00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.860]   therefore make her destitute on Jewish principles, since she can't go back to that first husband.
[00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.820]   It is not crystal clear from this text that John is saying,
[00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:59.020]   "Ditch her." But now let us suppose that John was actually saying, "End the marriage." And
[00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:05.780]   let's suppose they were married. So two uncertainties. We'll just assume both of them are true.
[00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:11.220]   The third thing that's uncertain is whether he is saying this because
[00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:19.220]   the unlawfulness of the marriage is owing to the fact that she was married before,
[00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.940]   or at the same time, or
[00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.260]   that she was the wife of
[00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:32.480]   his brother, which according to Old Testament law would make the second marriage incestuous,
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.380]   like marrying your sister or your sister-in-law or your daughter.
[00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:44.620]   So Leviticus 18, 16, "You shall not uncover the nakedness of your brother's wife. It is your brother's nakedness." Or
[00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:52.260]   Leviticus 20, 21, "If a man takes his brother's wife, it is impurity. He has uncovered his brother's nakedness.
[00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.260]   They shall be childless."
[00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.540]   Frankly,
[00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:01.340]   and this kind of boils down to the practical reality, I have never,
[00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.420]   in all my pastoral life,
[00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:12.540]   been confronted with a situation in which a man had married his sister or sister-in-law.
[00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:18.260]   It's difficult to know what I would say about the ongoing
[00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.500]   reality and propriety of that
[00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:29.300]   marriage. My inclination, not having faced it and not having thought more than a little about it, is
[00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.060]   that I probably would
[00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:38.220]   say the marriage should end the way I would if the man was found to have married his own daughter.
[00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.860]   But those are such extraordinary
[00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.980]   cases that I'd be very
[00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:50.040]   hesitant to build a case in favor of divorce in general
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.060]   upon them. So in view of those three
[00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:57.940]   uncertainties at least, I don't think Matthew 14, 4
[00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:02.980]   can be used in any ordinary situation to justify divorce.
[00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:08.460]   Such a good breakdown of the entangled questions and issues involved in
[00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.820]   interpreting this text. Thank you, Pastor John.
