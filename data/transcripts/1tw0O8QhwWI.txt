[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   (silence)
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:08.240]   Psalm 80, oh God restore us.
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.200]   For the choir director, El Shoshanim,
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.960]   a duth of Asaph, a psalm.
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.560]   Oh shepherd of Israel, give ear.
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.560]   You who guide Joseph like a flock.
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.880]   You who are enthroned above the cherubim, shine forth.
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.460]   Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh,
[00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.780]   stir up your might and come to save us.
[00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.800]   Oh God, restore us.
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.720]   And cause your face to shine upon us
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:39.880]   that we would be saved.
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.960]   Oh Yahweh, God of hosts,
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.500]   how long will you smolder against the prayer of your people?
[00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.760]   You have fed them with the bread of tears
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.560]   and you have made them to drink tears in large measure.
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.120]   You set us as an object of strife to our neighbors
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.700]   and our enemies mock us among themselves.
[00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.960]   Oh God of hosts, restore us.
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.660]   And cause your face to shine upon us
[00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.460]   that we might be saved.
[00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.320]   You removed a vine from Egypt.
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.080]   You drove out the nations and then you planted it.
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.640]   You cleared the ground before it
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.040]   and it took deep root and filled the land.
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.880]   The mountains were covered with its shadow.
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.540]   And the cedars of God with its boughs.
[00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.280]   It sent out its branches to the sea
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.720]   and it shoots to the river.
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.420]   Why have you broken down its hedges
[00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.360]   so that all who pass that way pick its fruit?
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.440]   A boar from the forest devours it
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.480]   and whatever moves in the field feeds on it.
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.000]   Oh God of hosts, return now, we beseech you.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.060]   Look down from heaven and see and visit this vine.
[00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.440]   Even the sapling which your right hand has planted.
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.200]   And on the son whom you have strengthened for yourself.
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.820]   It is burned with fire, it is cut down.
[00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.240]   They perish at the rebuke of your face.
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.720]   Let your hand be upon the man of your right hand.
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.240]   Upon the son of man whom you made strong for yourself.
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.360]   Then we shall not turn back from you.
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.720]   Revive us and we will call upon your name.
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.640]   Oh Yahweh, God of hosts, restore us.
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.640]   Cause your face to shine upon us that we might be saved.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:28.640]   Be saved.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.800]   (silence)
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:40.800]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
