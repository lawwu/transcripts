[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.560]   Well, my favorite editions of the LSB that I use regularly, it just so happens, are the
[00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.080]   smallest and the largest.
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:13.360]   The smallest, right here, and the largest, ah, I almost have to have two hands for this
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.120]   baby, right here.
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.840]   So I actually use this if I'm visiting or I'm not studying it really closely, I will
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.520]   use this small edition, the compact edition.
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.900]   And then the one with the study notes, ah, every morning after I pray, I am reading through
[00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.280]   the Old Testament and I read from this edition right here.
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.800]   With the notes at the bottom, it helps to remind me of parallel passages and so that's
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.560]   my two favorites, the smallest and the largest.
