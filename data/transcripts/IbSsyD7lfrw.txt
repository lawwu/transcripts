[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.560]   - We love to hear from our international listeners
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.800]   who are spread out all across the globe.
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.400]   Here's a question today from a young woman.
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.160]   Hello, Pastor John, greetings to you from Finland
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.880]   and thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.040]   I am married, but my husband and I have no children.
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.960]   In Genesis, God tells the first couple
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.080]   to be fruitful and multiply,
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.820]   increase greatly on the earth and multiply in it.
[00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.760]   That's Genesis 9, 7.
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.720]   Today, many people in my nation,
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.520]   people who are married and capable of having children,
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.000]   choose not to.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.100]   Intentional childlessness has become very common
[00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.000]   in the past decade and the reasons are diverse.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.640]   Fears about climate change,
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.680]   worries about the fragile health of the mother,
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.760]   worries about being a bad parent
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.500]   and simply deprioritizing children entirely.
[00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.360]   I know you said it was permissible for couples
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.340]   to wait to have kids and to limit the number of children
[00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.540]   that they have.
[00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.580]   That was in episode 1176.
[00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.300]   And you said it's permissible in some cases
[00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.100]   for a missionary couple to forego children altogether.
[00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.060]   That's episode 286.
[00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.820]   But how about non-missionary Christians?
[00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.460]   Is it permissible for an ordinary Christian couple
[00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.740]   to simply choose to not have children at all?
[00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.960]   How would you respond, Pastor John?
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.580]   - My first response is,
[00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.580]   I don't think there is any such thing as simply choose.
[00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:36.980]   She asks, is it permissible for an ordinary Christian couple
[00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.940]   to simply choose to have children?
[00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.580]   And I'm not sure what she means by the word simply,
[00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.140]   but it sounds like she means just because we want to.
[00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.900]   In other words, simply choose would mean
[00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.380]   without any struggles or conflicts or reasonings,
[00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.600]   but just because we feel like it.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.100]   And my first response to this is to say
[00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.280]   that there is no such thing.
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.280]   There are always realities in our hearts and in our minds
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.640]   and in our experiences that shape
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.700]   our so-called simply choosing.
[00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.940]   Jesus said, out of what's in the heart,
[00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.500]   out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks.
[00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.140]   How much more would it be true that out of what's
[00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.920]   in the heart, we choose not to have children.
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.260]   We are not simply choosing.
[00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.460]   We are choosing because of who we are,
[00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.640]   because of deep realities that have shaped our hearts,
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.740]   our preferences, our desires, our wants, our inclinations.
[00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.740]   So let me make five observations that may reveal
[00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.820]   some of the hidden things of the heart.
[00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.820]   First, it is normal, beautiful, fitting, natural,
[00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:09.360]   and normative according to scripture,
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.640]   both explicitly and I would say implicitly in many places
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.180]   for a married couple to have children.
[00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.180]   This was God's plan from the moment of creation.
[00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.060]   It was part of what was very good.
[00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.400]   Genesis 128, God blessed them.
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.220]   And God said to them, be fruitful and multiply
[00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.280]   and fill the earth.
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:37.160]   And it remained the plan after the catastrophic fall
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.340]   and the ruin of the world, and even after the flood
[00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.700]   and the recognition that sin is going to ravage the world
[00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.260]   until doomsday.
[00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.300]   Genesis 9, 6, whoever sheds the blood of man,
[00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.940]   by man shall his blood be shed for God made man
[00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.580]   in his own image, and you be fruitful and multiply,
[00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.940]   increase greatly on the earth, multiply in it.
[00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.700]   In other words, there's gonna be murder
[00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.020]   till the end of the day, so have children.
[00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.100]   This is just the opposite of the way some people think.
[00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.380]   And it goes on being God's good plan
[00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.000]   generation after generation.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.100]   Psalm 127, behold, children are a heritage,
[00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.260]   an inheritance from the Lord.
[00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.820]   The fruit of the womb is a reward.
[00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.020]   Like arrows in the hand of a warrior
[00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.340]   are the children of one's youth.
[00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.500]   Blessed is the man who fills his quiver with them.
[00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.900]   He shall not be put to shame when he speaks
[00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.520]   with his enemies in the gate.
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.780]   This is the whole drift of God's word.
[00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.400]   Children are a gift.
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.480]   Children are a blessing.
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.360]   When they are withheld, it is a heartache,
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.080]   sometimes even a judgment.
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.060]   The generations flowing from your seed
[00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.600]   and from your womb are a crown.
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:03.600]   Proverbs 17, six, grandchildren are the crown of the aged,
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.660]   and the glory of children is their father's,
[00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.020]   and they are a blessing.
[00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:14.000]   Her children rise up and call her blessed, Proverbs 31, 28.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.180]   What a sadness when many modern women,
[00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:23.180]   short-sightedly, I think, choose to forego that blessing,
[00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.000]   while millions would literally
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.600]   give their right arm to have it.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.380]   That's observation number one.
[00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.680]   It's just the way scripture leans.
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.880]   Second observation, that positive view of children
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.860]   as a blessing remains true,
[00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:48.420]   even though the Bible is starkly realistic
[00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.780]   about how badly things may go in families.
[00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.300]   Even the book of Proverbs,
[00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.300]   which is maybe the most pro-family book in the Bible,
[00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.980]   says, chapter 30, verse 11,
[00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:05.360]   there are those who curse their fathers
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.160]   and do not bless their mothers.
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.200]   And Jesus warns, they'll be family split,
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.280]   three against two and two against three.
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.400]   And he said it would have been better
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.680]   if Judas had never been born.
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.000]   The cry of David has been heard
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.520]   in the mouth of 10,000 fathers,
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.600]   Absalom, Absalom, oh, my son, Absalom,
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.180]   would to God I had died in your place.
[00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:37.180]   The Bible is not a Pollyanna tale of happy families.
[00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:40.540]   Almost all of them in the Bible are broken,
[00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:42.140]   just one way or the other,
[00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:47.140]   but none of this, none of it hinders the ongoing reality
[00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:52.420]   that conceiving and raising children is normal,
[00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:56.540]   beautiful, fitting, natural, normative.
[00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:59.400]   So the question is, why would that be?
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.820]   So here's my third observation.
[00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.480]   That can be because the Bible
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:08.520]   simply does not share the modern mindset,
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.360]   whether in Finland or in America,
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.500]   that the aim of life is the avoidance of hardship
[00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.320]   or heartache or suffering.
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.720]   Of course, we don't know whether
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.760]   we will have a disabled child or not
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.720]   who changes our lives forever.
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.620]   Of course, we don't know whether a child
[00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:29.980]   will break our heart with unbelief.
[00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:32.980]   Of course, we don't know if our child
[00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:36.660]   will live six hours and then die.
[00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:39.580]   And of course, we do know that our children
[00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:42.380]   will demand enormous focused attention.
[00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:45.460]   We do know that to raise a child in the Lord
[00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:48.900]   demands spiritual desperation and prayer
[00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:51.300]   and focus and attention.
[00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:54.380]   We do know that there will be financial demands
[00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:57.000]   from our lifelong commitment to this child.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.800]   We do know that there will be thousands of hours
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:04.140]   that you must deny yourself an immediate felt need
[00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:06.400]   in order to do good to this child.
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.900]   But from the standpoint of God's Word,
[00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:12.920]   none of those possible heartaches
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.800]   and none of these guaranteed stresses
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.780]   are reasons not to have children
[00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:22.780]   because the Bible does not share the modern viewpoint
[00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:26.180]   that the aim of life is the avoidance of hardship.
[00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:30.260]   On the contrary, the assumption of the Bible
[00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:34.920]   is that through many tribulations we enter the kingdom
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:38.060]   and that the testing of our faith produces steadfastness
[00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:40.980]   and that there's joy to be found
[00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:43.580]   through giving ourselves away.
[00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:48.580]   Jesus said, "It is more blessed to give than to receive."
[00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:53.700]   In other words, almost all the arguments
[00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:57.360]   for not having children are built on a worldview
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.320]   radically different from the Bible's worldview.
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:05.680]   Fourth observation, there's another problem
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:10.100]   with presuming to think that we can do more good
[00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:14.060]   by not having children, like for climate change.
[00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:18.480]   The problem is we simply do not know
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:22.460]   whether our child will be a debit or a credit
[00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:26.180]   to the human race, a curse or a blessing,
[00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:28.060]   a taker or a giver.
[00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:29.240]   We don't know.
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.780]   We don't know.
[00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:35.760]   He may be a freeloader with a big carbon footprint
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:39.940]   or he may be the genius who invents the very means
[00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:42.460]   of saving millions of lives.
[00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:44.460]   Who do we think we are?
[00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:47.840]   My goodness, who do we think we are
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:52.600]   to predict that our children will be a loss
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.100]   rather than a gain for the world
[00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:59.000]   and for the glory of Christ whom we can believe and pray?
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.340]   We don't know.
[00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:03.580]   And it's not our business to know.
[00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:07.940]   Our business is to give them life and raise them up
[00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:11.820]   and do what we can to build into them every dream
[00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:15.340]   and every possibility and power and blessing
[00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:19.540]   for the world and for the glorifying of God.
[00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:24.620]   And my final observation is that not one couple in a thousand
[00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:27.900]   decides to have children by sitting down and calculating
[00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:30.780]   the effect of their child on global warming
[00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:32.900]   or the replacement rate population
[00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:35.860]   so that in 30 years from now, the workforce
[00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:38.340]   will be big enough to sustain the aged
[00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:41.140]   or whether we will certainly have enough resources
[00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:43.420]   to establish the child in a fruitful location.
[00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:48.820]   It just doesn't happen that way, not for 99% of the couples.
[00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:52.900]   And I'm suggesting it shouldn't happen that way.
[00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:55.900]   We're not smart enough for it to happen that way.
[00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:58.460]   And the Bible doesn't encourage us to have children
[00:10:58.460 --> 00:10:59.980]   with that mindset.
[00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:02.660]   Rather, it happens like this--
[00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:07.960]   a combination of, one, the biblical blessing pronounced
[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:12.500]   upon having children together with, two,
[00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:19.860]   the voice of God in nature every month as a woman ovulates
[00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:23.740]   and as the man stands ever ready to deposit his seed,
[00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:30.060]   and, three, as the deep-seated, God-given longings of a man
[00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:33.740]   and a woman to be a father and a mother rise up.
[00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:37.940]   That biblical blessing and that voice of nature
[00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:43.020]   and that God-given longing should be followed,
[00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:48.780]   I'm arguing, unless God himself makes it crystal clear
[00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:54.460]   that the self-denying path of Christ-exalting obedience
[00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:56.940]   is childlessness.
[00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:58.100]   Thank you, Pastor John.

[00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:14.020]   Well, over and over in the Bible,
[00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:16.820]   it appears that God saves us in order
[00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:19.900]   to draw attention to himself.
[00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:24.020]   This is nowhere clearer than in the first chapter of Ephesians.
[00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:27.020]   There we are told that God predestined us
[00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:30.900]   for adoption to himself as sons through Jesus Christ.
[00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:32.220]   Why?
[00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:34.300]   To the praise of his glorious grace.
[00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:36.340]   That's verses 4 to 6.
[00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:39.740]   Again, just a little later, it says God predestined us.
[00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:41.340]   Again, why?
[00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:44.740]   To the praise of his glory, verses 11 and 12.
[00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:47.900]   And then Paul even says that our eternal security
[00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:51.220]   is sealed with the promise of the Holy Spirit.
[00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:52.260]   Why?
[00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.060]   To the praise of his glory.
[00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:56.180]   That's verses 13 to 14.
[00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:57.460]   So why does he do that?
[00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:01.740]   Why does God predestine us, save us, adopt us,
[00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:06.020]   and eternally secure us in order to draw attention to himself?
[00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:08.300]   So very important that we understand
[00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:09.900]   the answer to this question.
[00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:11.140]   That's next time.
[00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:11.980]   I'm Tony Reinke.
