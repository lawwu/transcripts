[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.760]   I should like to call your attention this evening to the message of that seventh chapter
[00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:15.000]   of the book of Daniel, which I read to you at the beginning, with special emphasis, perhaps,
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   upon verses 9 to 14, verses 9 to 14, in the seventh chapter of the book of the prophet
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.680]   Daniel.
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:36.920]   I beheld till the thrones were set, and the Ancient of Days did sit, whose garment was
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.160]   whiter snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool.
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:48.120]   His throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire.
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.160]   A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him.
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:00.600]   And thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.600]   him.
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.560]   The judgment was set, and the books were opened.
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:13.280]   I beheld then, because of the voice of the great words which the horns speak, I beheld
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:21.320]   even till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed and given to the burning flame.
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:28.240]   As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away, yet their lives
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.840]   were prolonged for a season and time.
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:38.520]   I saw in the night visions, and behold, one like the sun of men came with the clouds of
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:45.480]   heaven, and came to the Ancient of Days, and they brought him near before him.
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.880]   And there was given him dominion and glory, and the kingdom that all people, nations,
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.200]   and languages should serve him.
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:00.880]   His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.880]   which shall not be destroyed.
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.040]   I wonder whether there is someone in this congregation who is now saying to himself
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:17.840]   or herself, "What has all that got to do with us here in London, in Great Britain,
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.320]   on Armistice Sunday night in 1957?"
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:30.000]   Surely this person is saying, "At a time like this, with so much trouble and confusion
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.640]   and unhappiness in the world, surely you have some relevant message for us, some word of
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.040]   comfort, of strength, or of hope to give us.
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.440]   Why therefore take us to the book of the prophet Daniel and to that seventh chapter which you
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.640]   have already read to us?"
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.560]   Now I have no doubt that that may be in the minds of many, for we know that the world
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:02.660]   tonight consists of people who have their varying views of this book which we call the
[00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.840]   Bible and of its message.
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.320]   There are some indeed who do not hesitate to assert that the whole Bible and its entire
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:18.440]   message is utterly irrelevant, that it has got nothing to say today at all, and that
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.880]   it is a sheer and an utter waste of time to read it or to consider it.
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.960]   It is all right to say it is a book of religion, as there are other books of religion, old,
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:37.060]   ancient, oldest book in the world, and therefore out of date and with nothing at all to say
[00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.060]   to us.
[00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.740]   There are many who take that view of it.
[00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.540]   There are others who take a slightly different view.
[00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.400]   They say, "No, that's not correct."
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:55.860]   They say, "The Bible has got a message for today, and there is a sense," they say, "in
[00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.740]   which the Bible is not only relevant but very relevant."
[00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:11.680]   But what they say is this, that the Bible is of value and is relevant in the sense that
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:19.660]   it contains a moral teaching, an ethical teaching, which the world is sadly in need of.
[00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.520]   They say, "Don't waste your time with the Old Testament, and especially don't waste
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.860]   your time with these prophets.
[00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.240]   That is something that belongs to the realm of fancy and of fantasy."
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.880]   They say, "We are not interested in that."
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:40.760]   But they say they are interested in the New Testament and in particular with the teaching
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.940]   of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.500]   They say, "The greatest need in the world tonight is the application of the Sermon on
[00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.280]   the Mount.
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.840]   And if only men and women can be persuaded to live and to practice the Sermon on the
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:00.760]   Mount and to follow the Lord Jesus Christ, not only in their personal lives but in their
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:07.320]   international relationships, then," they say, "everything would be all right."
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:13.160]   So they think that the Bible is of help and of value in that way, that reading it and
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:20.260]   understanding its message, it is the business of the Church to urge men and women to protest
[00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:25.520]   against the manufacture of hydrogen bombs and other bombs.
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.280]   And it is the business of the Church to urge the statesmen to call disarmament conferences
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:36.480]   and put an end to all this kind of thing that is going on, and that we are to just urge
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:44.160]   people to take up the ethic and the morality of Jesus of Nazareth and to put it into practice.
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.160]   And you have no doubt, I am sure, in your minds that that is something which is being
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:55.280]   said by large numbers this evening, that that is the relevance of the Bible to the present
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.280]   position.
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:03.240]   Well, I am here this evening to suggest to you that both those views of the Bible are
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:08.800]   altogether and entirely wrong.
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.560]   Let me put it to you like this.
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:21.960]   The Bible, I want to assert this evening, is not only relevant to the present position.
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:26.480]   It alone is relevant.
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.560]   I am making that as a challenge.
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:38.280]   I am suggesting to you that as you look out upon the world as it is this evening and ask
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:45.400]   any teaching that you may like to mention, apart from this, to give you an explanation
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:51.480]   of why things are as they are, that you will find that they cannot do so.
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.780]   And the majority of them are honest enough to admit it and to confess it.
[00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:58.680]   They just do not understand.
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:04.360]   Because most of the views outside the Bible have taken a very optimistic view of men.
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:09.760]   They believe that men is growing and developing, that he is becoming wiser and wiser.
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:15.040]   And as he becomes more and more educated and is able to manifest his marvelous powers,
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:21.200]   so he will solve all his problems and his world will be made perfect.
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:26.600]   So believing something like that, they are quite dumbfounded as they see the world as
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.880]   it is at the present time.
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.920]   This century has been inexplicable to them.
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:33.800]   They cannot understand it.
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:38.400]   Their only attempt at an explanation is to say this, that in this marvelous evolutionary
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:47.000]   process sometimes for no known reason you get this kind of chaotic element intruding
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.360]   itself.
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:53.760]   And they can but hope that it will soon come to an end and that the forward march and development
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:57.080]   of the human race will be continued.
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.440]   In other words, they really do not understand.
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:00.440]   They are bankrupt.
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:07.280]   Now I am saying that you can take any view you like outside this view and you will find
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.560]   that that is its position at the present time.
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.960]   But here is something that is irrelevant.
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.960]   And why?
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:20.440]   Well I say because it has a message.
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:25.940]   And if we really look at its message, not what we think it ought to be, if we take its
[00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:30.000]   message as a whole and not merely shed the whole of the Old Testament and most of the
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.520]   New and pick out just something that we happen to like, if we take the whole message of the
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:43.400]   Bible, we shall find a most amazing relevance to this very evening in this way.
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:51.920]   The Bible I want to try to show you tonight really does explain to us why things are as
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:57.000]   they are in this world at this present time.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.520]   You know, it even goes further than that.
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:08.720]   I want to show you tonight that the Bible even prophesied thousands of years ago that
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:13.660]   the world now would be exactly as it is now.
[00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:15.780]   It goes as far as that.
[00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:20.760]   It not only provides me with an understanding and an explanation of why man has brought
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:28.240]   such chaos into his world, I say it even prophesies and predicts that, and that things would be
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.240]   as they are.
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.580]   It goes further.
[00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:33.260]   It foretells the future.
[00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:38.780]   It gives us an understanding of what is yet going to be in the history of this world.
[00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:46.260]   Now that's a tremendous claim I know, and I want to try to substantiate my assertion
[00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:47.760]   and my claim.
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:52.840]   Here I say then, we are presented with history.
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:10:00.600]   Here we have prophecies which foretell history, and this is what's interesting.
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:06.760]   Much of the history that is foretold in the Bible has already come to pass.
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:09.760]   That is something that we mustn't forget.
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:13.640]   There is here in the Old Testament prophecy concerning future events.
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:19.960]   Now it's astounding and amazing to notice how many of the things that are prophesied
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:25.640]   have already literally and actually come to pass.
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:30.280]   And therefore I say, bearing that in mind, it surely behoves us to be very careful as
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:36.760]   we consider what the Bible has to say with respect to what is yet going to come to pass.
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:41.960]   The verity and the truth of the Bible can therefore be tested by history that has already
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:43.800]   taken place.
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:49.480]   And as we find this verification, I say it should modify our attitude with regard to
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:56.480]   the prophecies and predictions of the scriptures with regard to the future.
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:06.240]   Now then, all this is something that is demonstrated in this seventh chapter of this book of Daniel.
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:11.000]   And that is why I am calling your attention to it tonight.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:18.160]   It's a perfect illustration of what I've been saying about the Bible's view of history.
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.040]   It's a typical example of it.
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:24.640]   It's all here, as it were, in one chapter.
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:31.320]   Now you remember that this all came to Daniel in the form of a dream.
[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:37.080]   He tells us at the very beginning, you remember the introduction, "In the first year of Belshazzar,
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:42.800]   king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed.
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:47.280]   Then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters."
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:52.200]   And then the rest of the chapter gives us the account.
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:54.640]   What is this?
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:12:04.680]   Well you know what we have here is God giving his servant, this prophet Daniel, a preview
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:07.520]   of history.
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:12.600]   He was just telling Daniel what was going to happen.
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:18.060]   Not merely to his own nation and people, but to these other nations.
[00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:22.600]   To the nation, for instance, that had recently conquered the children of Israel and carried
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:24.680]   them away captive into Babylon.
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:29.480]   For when this happened to Daniel, he was a prisoner with the rest of his people in Babylon.
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:30.880]   He was a slave.
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:35.120]   And it was while they were there that God gave this man this vision in the form of a
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.120]   dream.
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:40.080]   In order that he might know the future of his own people.
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:43.120]   Yes, but beyond that.
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:50.640]   In order that he might make known unto him this preview of the history of the human race
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:55.280]   and of God's purposes with respect to this world.
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:13:01.640]   Therefore I think I can show you that in this one chapter, in the compass of just this one
[00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:10.240]   chapter, we are given the knowledge of the very things that are most essential for us
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:12.840]   to know this very night.
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:17.280]   I'm assuming that you're all concerned as I am about the state of our world.
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:20.600]   Ah, Mr. Stey, what's it remind us of?
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:21.600]   Remembrance Sunday.
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.960]   What's it point to?
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:25.200]   Two world wars.
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:31.040]   With their devastation, with the death of loved ones, with homes broken, with all the
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:35.360]   tragedy of war, and here are the nations still preparing for war.
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.880]   Now that's the problem.
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:37.880]   What is it all about?
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:38.880]   Why is it?
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.680]   Why is man behaving like this?
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:42.240]   Is there any glimmer of hope?
[00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:43.860]   Is there any understanding?
[00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:44.860]   What of the future?
[00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:51.580]   I say that all those questions are dealt with and are answered in this one chapter.
[00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:55.720]   Now let's not be troubled by the form in which the message takes.
[00:13:55.720 --> 00:14:01.020]   Daniel, I say, was given the message in a dream.
[00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:06.680]   And everything that was told him in the dream was given him in terms of symbols and of pictures.
[00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:09.260]   That's the usual thing in a dream, isn't it?
[00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:15.400]   And you will find that often, indeed generally in the scriptures, these prophecies are given
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:20.400]   in the form of pictures and of symbols.
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:24.920]   Very well then, what is the message?
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:35.660]   In its essence, the message is this, that there are two types of history in connection
[00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:38.920]   with this world and the story of the human race.
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:42.360]   There are two types, two kinds of history.
[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:49.640]   Or, if you prefer it in other language, there are two standpoints or points of view which
[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:56.760]   we can take with respect to what we see happening before our eyes at the present moment.
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:59.640]   Let me put it like this.
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:06.560]   One history is a history from the standpoint of earth and of man.
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:12.000]   The other history is the history from the standpoint of heaven, from the standpoint
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.040]   of God.
[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:19.560]   Now then, what we've got, you see, in this one chapter is an account of the two histories
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:29.200]   in a most amazing and astonishing manner, bringing us right up to date, extremely relevant,
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:34.080]   explaining why things are as they are, and giving us an insight into the future that
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:36.160]   lies ahead of us.
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:41.080]   Very well, all I'm going to ask you to do is to join with me now as we look together
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:43.600]   at these two types of history.
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:47.640]   My task this evening is an unusually simple one.
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:50.480]   All I've got to do is to hold the pictures before you.
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:54.120]   We've not only got the pictures, we've even got the comments on the pictures.
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:58.920]   And all I have, I say, is to remind you of it and to underline the various things that
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:15:59.920]   we are told here.
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:03.800]   Two types of history.
[00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:08.360]   The first type of history that we've got to look at is history from the standpoint
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:11.400]   of earth.
[00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:18.720]   History in terms of man, or if you like, the history that man produces.
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:22.280]   Now we are facing history tonight, aren't we?
[00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:26.440]   You see, we can't meet together on a day like this without considering history.
[00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:30.120]   We are in it, we are involved in it, and we are the inheritors of what has happened in
[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:31.120]   it.
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:35.840]   And this is our major problem today, the problem of history.
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:37.800]   What is happening in the world?
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:40.600]   What is the explanation of what we are looking upon tonight?
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:44.480]   I say the answer is, it's man's history.
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:47.720]   This is the history that man is producing.
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:52.040]   This is the history you find in your newspapers, in your secular textbooks of history.
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:53.040]   What is it?
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:55.560]   Well, we can put it like this.
[00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:59.760]   This is the Bible's way of putting it.
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:06.160]   This is the history of man without God.
[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:12.200]   This is the history of man in sin.
[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:19.280]   This is the history that man produces when he takes control himself and God allows him
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:22.240]   to do so and abandons him to his fate.
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:25.920]   That is the first history we are going to look at.
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:32.240]   It is shown here very plainly and with a terrible kind of clarity.
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:37.240]   You remember the four beasts that arose from the earth, don't you?
[00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:39.480]   How they came up one after the other.
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:42.640]   Well, the explanation is given to the prophet.
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:47.280]   And what he was told is this, you see, that the first beast represents the kingdom of
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:51.680]   Babylon under which he was a slave at that moment.
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:55.520]   The message says that that is to be followed by another kingdom.
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:58.160]   It was indeed the Medo-Persian kingdom.
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.640]   It actually happened.
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:04.440]   And the characteristics of the two kingdoms are put here quite plainly.
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:09.140]   But that in turn was to be replaced by a third kingdom, again different.
[00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:14.200]   This is the kingdom of Greece, Alexander the Great, again different.
[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:18.560]   And then there is to be a fourth kingdom, still altogether different, more mighty than
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:20.080]   all the others.
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:21.080]   What is this?
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:23.360]   This is the Roman Empire.
[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:28.440]   Now here is a man, I say, in the fifth century who was given a preview of all this.
[00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:34.120]   And exactly as it was revealed to him, so it came to pass.
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:39.680]   When Daniel was given this vision, Nebuchadnezzar and the kingdom of Babylon seemed to be absolutely
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:42.160]   invincible.
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:44.560]   But they were conquered and they went.
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:48.360]   And the other arose and that appeared invincible, but it went.
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:50.680]   And the next came Alexander the Great.
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:52.680]   Here is the greatest captain of all.
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:54.000]   Actually never to be defeated.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   But he was.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.960]   He died at a comparatively early age and his kingdom was divided and Rome arose, the Roman
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:02.640]   Empire.
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:06.920]   Now the point I'm making is that this is actual history.
[00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:14.280]   What was revealed to Daniel ahead of time literally came to pass in time.
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:19.440]   But that isn't the thing which I want to emphasize this evening.
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:24.640]   There is something here which is more than the literal and the actual history.
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:29.440]   And so often people, because they've been tied by a materialistic interpretation, have
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:34.480]   really missed the great spiritual message of this mighty chapter.
[00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:35.480]   What is it?
[00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:38.520]   Well, it's this.
[00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:49.880]   What we are really shown here is the character of man as a sinner and a rebel against God.
[00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:55.800]   Man setting up his own kingdoms, man setting up his own government, man trying to run the
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:20:01.720]   world instead of submitting to God and obeying his commandments and allowing God as it were
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:02.720]   to run the world.
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:03.720]   What are the characteristics?
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:07.480]   Well, here they are.
[00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:14.000]   And if this isn't a description of the world as it is tonight, where do you find one?
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:23.440]   Daniel spake and said, "I saw in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of the
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:28.560]   heaven strove upon the great sea."
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:29.560]   What are we looking at?
[00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:32.280]   We are looking at a storm.
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:38.240]   We are looking at a mighty storm at sea, the wind blowing, the gale howling, coming from
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:43.920]   all directions, a kind of hurricane, north, south, east, and west, changing its course,
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:50.960]   and the turmoil and the boiling of the waters and the billows rising, a sea in terrible
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:53.240]   turmoil.
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:56.440]   That's the picture.
[00:20:56.440 --> 00:21:03.000]   Storm and trouble.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.040]   Isn't that the history of the world?
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:09.800]   Read your history books.
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:10.800]   What is history?
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:18.040]   It's a history of wars and desolations and famines and ruins and trouble.
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:20.840]   Go and read them.
[00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:22.480]   Read our own history.
[00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:26.120]   Read the history of Greece and Rome and Spain and all the great empires.
[00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:27.120]   It's just this.
[00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:29.040]   It's all here in this chapter.
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:30.040]   This is life.
[00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:41.320]   Turmoil, war, trouble, agony, strife, bloodshed, the sea in this terrible condition because
[00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:44.040]   the four winds are blowing upon it.
[00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:45.400]   But what does it mean?
[00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:50.800]   Where do these winds come from and who controls these winds?
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:56.580]   The answer of the Bible to that is always perfectly plain and clear.
[00:21:56.580 --> 00:22:04.760]   It is God who controls the four winds of the heavens, and it is God who lets loose the
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:08.680]   four winds upon the sea.
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:09.680]   What is the sea?
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:13.360]   Well, the sea in Scripture is generally mankind.
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:17.360]   Whenever you come across the sea in prophetic literature in the Bible, it's always a picture
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:19.280]   of mankind.
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:24.760]   And without God, the nations of the world apart from God, the sea, they're always compared
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:25.760]   to the sea.
[00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:29.680]   And this is what we are told, that God has let loose the four winds upon the sea.
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:30.680]   Why?
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:34.600]   Well, for this reason.
[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:41.760]   God forewarned mankind that if it sinned against him and broke his laws, that it would have
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:45.080]   nothing but trouble.
[00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:50.240]   By the sweat of thy brow thou shalt earn thy bread, said God to the men, if you sin against
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.240]   me.
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:52.240]   And it's happened to him.
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:55.840]   God told men in paradise when there wasn't a war and everything was perfect and there
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:23:00.480]   was no trouble, if you disobey my commandment, you'll go out and you'll spend your life in
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:02.360]   misery and wretchedness.
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:06.680]   And hasn't the world done so ever since?
[00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:12.360]   The sea is trouble because the four winds have been let loose upon it.
[00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:18.080]   My dear friends, whether we like it or not, we get these wars and these upheavals and
[00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:23.960]   these calamities because we have sinned against God.
[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:29.240]   There would never have been a war if men had not sinned against God and tried to take the
[00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:35.560]   sovereignty and the power and the direction of life in this world into his own hands.
[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:37.480]   That's the position.
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:40.920]   But it doesn't stop at that, as you notice.
[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:46.840]   You notice that what happens as the result of the storm and which goes on producing storms
[00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:52.400]   and increasing them is just this.
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:55.520]   These beasts.
[00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:56.520]   What are these?
[00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:59.600]   Well, the interpretation was given, you remember, to Daniel.
[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:01.960]   These are kings, these are kingdoms.
[00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:09.120]   Yes, but you notice the way in which they're represented, not as men, but as beasts.
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:14.120]   The first was like a lion and had eagle's wings, strength and swiftness.
[00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:18.600]   Another beast, the second likened to a bear, raised up itself on one side, had three ribs
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:25.240]   in the mouth of it, between the teeth of it, a bear, again the power and certain characteristics.
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:29.560]   And then after that another like a leopard which had upon the back of it four wings of
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:30.560]   a fowl.
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:36.640]   A wonderful description, you see, of the kingdom of Greece and Alexander the Great.
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:41.880]   Again this tremendous swiftness and power to trample and to destroy.
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:48.800]   And finally the fourth beast, dreadful and terrible and exceeding strong with iron teeth.
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:54.200]   And it devoured and break in pieces and stamped the residue with the feet of it.
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:25:01.480]   Well, here they are, I said, but the point I'm emphasizing is this.
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:07.560]   That the only true way of representing them is as beasts.
[00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:11.120]   And isn't it a perfect description?
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:17.960]   Look at these great empires of which the history books make so much and of which men boast
[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:18.960]   so much.
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:20.720]   What have they been?
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:24.320]   Haven't they been beasts?
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:25.600]   What has been their characteristic?
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:28.720]   Well, they've all been rapacious.
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:33.200]   They've all had a terrible greed and a lust for power and for possessions.
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:38.520]   They've all been characterized by trampling and defeat, by smashing and destroying, and
[00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:44.960]   leaving in their wake desolation and ruin and disappointment and unhappiness and sorrow.
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:47.680]   Isn't that the history of men?
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:50.200]   Hasn't that been the history of the world?
[00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:53.400]   Big nations are rising, trampling upon others, wars.
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:54.400]   Why?
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:58.000]   Well, it's all greed, self-aggrandizement.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:06.680]   Man bursting of himself and bringing this destruction and desolation in his wake.
[00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:10.860]   You see, it's a very perfect representation, isn't it?
[00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:12.720]   Human history is utterly beastly.
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:17.240]   Of course, we don't see it in the case of our own nation or empire.
[00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:20.680]   We see it in the case of others, but the others say the same about us.
[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:23.360]   Indeed, it's true of every one of us.
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:33.320]   It's man setting himself up, and yet he glories in this, and he boasts of his great history.
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:37.600]   But the Bible says it's all beastly.
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:41.120]   It can only be adequately described in these ways.
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:43.080]   And I say, read your history books.
[00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:46.440]   Read about the wars and the devastation that has followed.
[00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:52.000]   Read about the introduction of armaments and gunpowder and the blasting and the destroying
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.040]   and the destruction and the trampling to dust.
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:56.040]   It's all here.
[00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:57.040]   It's all prophesied.
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:59.240]   That's what man's history is.
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:06.040]   That's the history that man produces when he acts independently of God.
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:12.960]   And the other characteristic you notice that is emphasized here is the constant changing.
[00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:19.280]   They all of them, in spite of their apparent great might and invincibility, are all conquered
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:20.280]   in turn.
[00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:23.480]   And you know, there's something to me almost laughable about all this.
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:33.120]   Here they are, you see, one after the other, Assyria, Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, Rome.
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:35.600]   Dynasties have arisen and gone down in China.
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:37.640]   Egypt was once powerful.
[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:40.520]   Spain was once holding sway.
[00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:41.760]   Holland.
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:46.840]   You can complete the list for yourself.
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:49.440]   This is history, you see.
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:55.040]   The same essential characteristic, but for a time one in the ascendant, then at another
[00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:59.640]   time another in the ascendant, up and down, rising and waning.
[00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:04.560]   They come, they appear to be invincible, but down they go, another rises.
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:05.560]   That's human history.
[00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:10.520]   Isn't it a perfect description?
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:12.080]   But wait a moment, says someone.
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:17.360]   I'd rather like to ask the question that Daniel himself asked.
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:20.000]   What about that little horn?
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.400]   You remember the fourth beast, don't you?
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:24.880]   He had ten horns.
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:28.920]   But suddenly there appeared another little horn that conquered three of them, and then
[00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:31.000]   he developed and expanded.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.360]   And you remember we are given a description of him.
[00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:34.800]   Here it is in verse eight.
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:40.080]   I considered the horns, and behold, there came up among them another little horn, before
[00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:44.000]   whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:50.960]   And behold, in this horn were eyes, like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:55.220]   things.
[00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:57.360]   Let me give you the further description.
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:58.860]   Verse twenty.
[00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:05.360]   Even of that horn that had eyes and a mouth that speak very great things, whose look was
[00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:11.920]   more stout than his fellows, I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:14.200]   prevailed against them.
[00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:16.420]   And then in verse twenty-five.
[00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:23.960]   And he shall speak great words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:29.400]   the Most High, and think to change times and laws.
[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:35.800]   And they shall be given into his hand until a time and times, and the dividing of time.
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:38.320]   What does all this mean, says someone?
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:44.360]   Well this is most remarkable, and here it is, I bring you right up to date, my friends.
[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:50.480]   You see, what we are told here is this, that these earthly kingdoms will rise one after
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:56.400]   another, and up to a point they'll be chiefly and almost entirely military.
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:59.400]   They'll be godless always, but they'll be chiefly military.
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:05.800]   Ah yes, but there's a time coming, according to this prophecy, when they will become less
[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:10.680]   and less military in a sense, and more and more intellectual.
[00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:15.640]   When they'll have less and less of the beast's obvious character, but will develop more and
[00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:17.520]   more the character of a man.
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:24.040]   This little horn has eyes of a man, and he speaks with a mouth, and he says certain things,
[00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:27.680]   and they're great things, and they're mighty things.
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:29.240]   Well what does he say?
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:35.560]   Well, here I say we are given a picture of that which is going to characterize mankind
[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:37.680]   towards the end of the age.
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:40.360]   Here we are coming to the climax.
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:44.600]   All the rest has been happening, as I've shown you, throughout the running centuries,
[00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:49.080]   but it's going to become more and more in this intellectualized form, and this is going
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:57.400]   to be the final climax, this little horn with the eyes of a man, and speaking great words.
[00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:59.400]   What is the interpretation, says someone?
[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:03.560]   Well here it is.
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:10.920]   These are to be the characteristics of mankind when it's working up to a final climax.
[00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:21.800]   Its presumptuousness, its arrogance against God, speaking great words, speaking very great
[00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:29.480]   words, standing up against the God of heaven, uttering blasphemies against him, and he shall
[00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:35.400]   speak great words against the Most High.
[00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:38.680]   Now don't misunderstand me.
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:45.600]   I don't want to be too particular in my application of these things, but I read in the paper recently
[00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:52.560]   a statement by a scoffing scientist in the world at this moment, who thought that it
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:32:00.120]   was very clever to say this, that he was interested to observe that this satellite that the Russians
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:05.480]   have shot up into the outer atmosphere, and which was able to record so much in such a
[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:15.120]   marvelous manner, had not hitherto sent any report about seeing God anywhere.
[00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:20.400]   Speaking great words against the Most High.
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:27.080]   Man you see in his cleverness, he is able to penetrate outer space, and he shoots his
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:32.840]   satellites and he ridicules the whole idea of God.
[00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:37.080]   No report yet as to having seen him.
[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:42.720]   Speaking great words, the presumptuousness, the arrogance of it all, and then the other
[00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:47.080]   characteristic is the persecution of God's people.
[00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:50.680]   Not only the ridiculing of the Bible, but the ridiculing of God's people.
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:58.120]   War on the saints of God, blasphemy against the religion, and against the Christian Church.
[00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:00.640]   But notice this.
[00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:05.720]   He shall speak great words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:18.080]   Most High, and think to change times and laws.
[00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:19.080]   What does this mean?
[00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:25.640]   Well I don't know exactly what it does mean, but I know what really is meant by the changing
[00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:27.420]   of times and laws.
[00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:29.720]   This is the true translation.
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:36.520]   It is an attempt to change the foundations and the main conditions of life and of the
[00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:38.960]   actions of men in this world.
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:40.620]   That's what that really means.
[00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:45.440]   That isn't my translation, it's the translation of a great authority in the Hebrew language.
[00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:49.000]   Here it is, shall think to change times and laws.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:55.700]   Shall think to change the foundations and the main conditions of the life and actions
[00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:57.880]   of men in this world.
[00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:03.120]   Now hitherto these times and laws have been governed and controlled by God, by what we
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:08.800]   call the laws of nature, which have been put there by God, the sun and the moon, and all
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:14.520]   these things that are there in that unknown atmosphere.
[00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:19.680]   Man we are told is going to reach this pitch, that he is going to think that he can claim
[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:25.400]   to change even that.
[00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:30.600]   Does it seem to you that he is trying to do it at the present time?
[00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:34.720]   Is he trying to land a satellite on the moon?
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:39.840]   Is that not going to affect the whole conditions of life in this world?
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:43.000]   Here he is penetrating outer space.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.560]   If he can govern and control that, what's going to happen?
[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:50.720]   It's an attempt, I say, to undermine the whole foundation of life and being and existence
[00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:51.720]   in this world.
[00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:55.000]   Where is it going to stop?
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:00.600]   Are not these latest experiments and successes, I say, such that you can see quite easily
[00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:06.440]   that they're going to have a profound effect upon the whole basis of life as we have hitherto
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:09.560]   known it in the long story of mankind?
[00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:12.600]   And of course he is going to try to change laws also.
[00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:18.640]   And isn't he doing it or trying to do it?
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:23.360]   God has placed certain laws in men and in nature.
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:29.920]   God has made a difference between male and female, man and woman.
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:34.000]   And they're made differently for a purpose, and they're made for one another.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.400]   And the complement of man is not man, it's woman.
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:42.760]   That's nature, that's God's law.
[00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:51.480]   But you and I are living in a time when it's man with man and woman with woman.
[00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:55.040]   But evil be my good.
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:36:01.760]   He will attempt to change times and laws.
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:03.800]   I'm not an alarmist.
[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:07.760]   I'm not one of these people who says that he can prophesy the end of the world.
[00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:12.120]   But what I do know is this, that it's made very plain and clear in this book, not only
[00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:17.160]   here but elsewhere, that this is man in sin and as a rebel against God.
[00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:20.760]   This is man when he arrogates unto himself supreme power.
[00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:24.640]   And when he turns his back on God and says he doesn't recognize God.
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:29.680]   And when he takes charge of the world, and here he is trying to get into that outer space
[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:37.440]   and to touch the very moon itself and the constellations and trampling upon God's laws.
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:44.280]   Isn't this man at the height of his arrogance?
[00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:47.880]   That's the story here.
[00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:54.000]   In other words, human history, men's history, is the glorification of men and his powers.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.120]   It's man without God.
[00:36:56.120 --> 00:37:01.320]   You say the relevance of the Bible to the world and to history, isn't this it?
[00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:03.520]   That's why the world is as it is tonight.
[00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:09.440]   It's the greed, the rapacity of this beast that's in men, individually in human kingdoms.
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:15.840]   It's manifesting itself and it leaves devastation and destruction and ruin and misery in its
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:18.040]   wake.
[00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:20.040]   That's the history of the world.
[00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:22.840]   That is why things are as they are tonight.
[00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:26.120]   That is why the Bible prophesied they would be so.
[00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:28.200]   Very well, let me hurry on.
[00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:36.480]   Let us turn and look at history from God's standpoint or from the standpoint of heaven.
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:40.560]   And thank God for the ability to do so.
[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:41.560]   What a contrast.
[00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:42.560]   What a change.
[00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:43.560]   Listen.
[00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:58.660]   "I beheld till the thrones were set, and the Ancient of Days did sit, whose garment was
[00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:04.620]   white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool.
[00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:10.420]   His throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire.
[00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:15.960]   A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him, thousand thousands ministered
[00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:23.520]   unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousands stood before him.
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:26.040]   The judgment was set and the books were opened."
[00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:30.400]   Thank God, I say, for the change.
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:31.400]   What do I mean?
[00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:34.960]   I mean this.
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:40.120]   That suddenly we are able to lift up our eyes and lift up our heads and look at something
[00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:44.800]   above the earth and above the world.
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:51.320]   And no longer are we looking at the beast, we are looking at one who is described as
[00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:55.880]   the Ancient of Days.
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:39:04.840]   That is but a picture and a symbol of the eternity of God from everlasting to everlasting.
[00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:12.400]   Without beginning and without end, the Most High who is always there.
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:18.280]   He is not like these beasts that suddenly come and appear one after another, and have
[00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:21.000]   their sway and are killed and destroyed.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   No, no.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:30.480]   He is always there and always has been and always will be the Ancient of Days.
[00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:39.680]   Above the flux of time and the changes of history and all its passing scenes.
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:48.880]   Oh, I say, what a comfort this is that we can look to someone who is stable and eternal
[00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:54.720]   and absolute and none of the rapacity of the beast, but his hair is like wool.
[00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:59.320]   There is a mildness and a glory and a softness, if I may say it.
[00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:05.560]   There is a love about him, the Ancient of Days.
[00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:11.840]   I am no longer looking at that turbulent sea with all its billows and its rocking and its
[00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:12.840]   rolling.
[00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:13.840]   No, no.
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:20.520]   I am looking at God set upon a throne, there forever, immovable and immutable.
[00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:28.960]   Oh, the majesty, thousands, thousands ministering unto him, ten thousand times ten thousand
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:30.640]   standing before him.
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:38.320]   There he is in his glory and in his everlasting ineffable majesty.
[00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:48.720]   And the judgment is set and the books are opened and fire issues from the throne and
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:49.720]   from him.
[00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:53.920]   What does it all mean?
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:41:02.480]   My dear friend, it just means this, that while you and I and the world are so busy with these
[00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:10.400]   kingdoms and these beasts and all our human greatness and bursting, God is there above
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:20.760]   and beyond it all in his glory, unaffected by it all, untouched, uninfluenced by it all.
[00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:23.320]   Well you see, if that is God, why does he allow this?
[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:24.840]   I have already told you.
[00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:26.460]   He permits all this.
[00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:30.640]   He permits it because we are sinners and because we deserve punishment.
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:31.640]   He warned us.
[00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:33.120]   We have brought it on ourselves.
[00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:34.320]   He permits it.
[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:38.720]   But remember it is in his hands.
[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:46.800]   We are told that these things happen only till the thrones were set.
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:55.120]   He only permits these things for a time and times and a season.
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:59.680]   As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away, yet their lives
[00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:02.680]   were prolonged for a season and time.
[00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:06.760]   My dear friend, if you don't understand this, you are ignorant of God.
[00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:09.880]   God is above it all and he is controlling it all.
[00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:10.880]   He allows, he permits.
[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:13.960]   He has given man a free hand.
[00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:16.280]   He seems to hand the world over to man at times.
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:20.680]   He gives us over to a reprobate mind, but it doesn't mean he loses control.
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:28.280]   He is there and he is still controlling and the times are in his hands.
[00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:33.480]   He has permitted all this to happen.
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:36.400]   And he may yet permit much to happen.
[00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:40.080]   I don't know.
[00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:47.080]   But what I do know is this, that a day is coming when he is going to bring all that
[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:54.840]   to an end, when all these beasts and all they represent shall be destroyed.
[00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:59.600]   As certain as we are here, there is a limit to human history.
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:04.880]   All the beasts are to be destroyed and to be made utterly nothing.
[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:08.000]   There is no improvement promised for this world.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.200]   If you came in expecting me to say that there is a glimmer of hope and I think the world
[00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:14.080]   is going to get better, you are wrong.
[00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:15.520]   You are disappointed.
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:17.600]   This world will never get better.
[00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:20.600]   It will always be beastly.
[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:25.680]   There is only one thing to do with this world and that is to destroy it and God will destroy
[00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:26.680]   it.
[00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:29.680]   Man in sin is under wrath.
[00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:37.240]   He is to be punished and as certainly as we are here, all the glory of men and his arrogance
[00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:43.520]   is going to be utterly destroyed and cast to the lake of burning.
[00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:46.160]   No improvement for this world.
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:49.040]   And whoever says there is, is uttering a lie.
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:56.320]   It's beast after beast after beast until the Ancient of Days shall sit and announce
[00:43:56.320 --> 00:44:02.960]   the last judgment and the end of time.
[00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:10.480]   If you are still innocent enough to put your faith in every and any human contrivance or
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:16.520]   organization, I have nothing to say of you but that you are a fool.
[00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:21.400]   The world has always been saying this but look what the world is and it will go on.
[00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:25.560]   The beast is in control and there is only one thing to do with the beast, to destroy
[00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:32.760]   him utterly and God will arise and smite him and destroy him out of his holy sight.
[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:42.360]   Well, dear me, says someone, is that all you have got to say to us on a night like this?
[00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:45.040]   No, no, it isn't.
[00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:53.200]   I have got to say that all that is going to be destroyed and must be destroyed.
[00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:55.680]   But my dear friend, there is something else.
[00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:57.680]   There is another kingdom.
[00:44:57.680 --> 00:44:59.320]   Listen.
[00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:06.480]   I saw in the night visions and behold, one like the Son of Man came with the clouds of
[00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:12.480]   heaven and came to the Ancient of Days and they brought him near before him and there
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:18.280]   was given him dominion and glory and a kingdom that all people, nations and languages should
[00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:19.280]   serve him.
[00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:26.040]   His dominion is an everlasting dominion which shall not pass away and his kingdom that which
[00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:28.280]   shall not be destroyed.
[00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:29.280]   What's this?
[00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:32.120]   Well, isn't this a marvelous panorama?
[00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:34.160]   We have looked at man's kingdom.
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:35.800]   We have looked at God's kingdom.
[00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:38.840]   Have a look at Christ's kingdom.
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:43.600]   For this is none other than the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:49.960]   There is a special history that comes in and through Christ, another history, another kind
[00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:53.480]   of kingdom that is altogether different from the others.
[00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:55.200]   What's this kingdom like, you say?
[00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:59.440]   Not like a beast, like the Son of Man.
[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:07.360]   No longer the rapacious, grasping, malicious beast, like a Son of Man, like a man, like
[00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:13.200]   man was meant to be, like man was when God made him, like paradise, an entirely different
[00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:14.200]   kingdom.
[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:18.680]   He is like a man and yet he comes on the clouds of heaven.
[00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:19.680]   Who is this?
[00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:21.640]   He is a man and yet he is not a man.
[00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:27.280]   He is some great regal person because when he comes riding the clouds of heaven, they
[00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:32.520]   bring him before the Ancient of Days and he can stand before him.
[00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:36.480]   Who is this?
[00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:44.680]   This is Jesus of Nazareth, whose favorite description of himself was the Son of Man.
[00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:46.120]   He took over this term.
[00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:47.360]   He appropriated it.
[00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:49.600]   He said, "That speaks of me."
[00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:50.600]   Son of Man?
[00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:53.400]   Who is this Son of Man?
[00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:54.400]   He is a man.
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:57.720]   He is like a man and yet he rides the clouds of heaven.
[00:46:57.720 --> 00:47:00.200]   He is man, yes, but he is God also.
[00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:01.200]   He is God-man.
[00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:06.480]   Here is the marvel and the miracle of the Incarnation.
[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:12.160]   God come in the flesh, in the likeness of sinful flesh, in the likeness of man.
[00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:13.160]   What is this?
[00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:19.560]   Oh, it is God in his eternal love and in his mercy and grace and compassion, looking down
[00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:24.680]   upon the troubled sea of mankind that has brought itself to this with the beasts and
[00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:26.120]   the war.
[00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:31.720]   And in spite of it says, "I am going to send down into it a way of salvation, a way of
[00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:32.720]   deliverance.
[00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:36.280]   I will form my kingdom yet."
[00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:42.280]   And he has done it through sending his only Son into this world, one like unto a Son of
[00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:47.560]   Man and yet riding the clouds of heaven.
[00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:55.120]   Jesus of Nazareth was the Son of God and he came into this world to found this kingdom,
[00:47:55.120 --> 00:48:02.000]   to rescue and to redeem, not to set up another rapacious kingdom, not beast-like, no, no,
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:07.920]   like a man, that man might be created anew in the image of God and of Christ and might
[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:10.440]   live life as he was meant to live it.
[00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:15.240]   That is the message of Christianity, not an improvement of this old world.
[00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:16.840]   It cannot be improved.
[00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:23.080]   You must have a new kingdom and God has set it in motion and in being in the person of
[00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:32.680]   his only begotten Son, the Son of God came down from heaven to earth to set up this kingdom.
[00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:38.920]   He did so not only by living a perfect life, but by dying that death on Calvary's hill,
[00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:41.840]   by being buried, by rising again.
[00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:50.440]   Here is his kingdom entirely different, not of this world, not a temporary kingdom.
[00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:56.360]   It doesn't rise and go like the lion and the bear and the leopard and the fox.
[00:48:56.360 --> 00:49:03.720]   No, no, this kingdom is an everlasting dominion which shall not pass away and his kingdom
[00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:08.480]   that which shall not be destroyed.
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:19.120]   This is an eternal kingdom and will go on throughout the countless ages of eternity.
[00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:28.240]   This kingdom shall never be conquered, shall never be destroyed.
[00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:36.600]   It is the kingdom of the Son of Man, the kingdom of peace and of righteousness.
[00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:43.640]   The kingdom of God, says Paul, is not meat and drink, but righteousness and peace and
[00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:47.120]   joy in the Holy Ghost.
[00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:49.080]   What a different kingdom!
[00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:54.320]   And it will go on beyond death, beyond the destruction of the world, beyond the final
[00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:55.320]   judgment.
[00:49:55.320 --> 00:50:00.400]   It will go on to all eternity.
[00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:08.600]   I don't know what you feel, but to me the most urgent and the most relevant question
[00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:13.440]   facing every one of us at this moment is just this.
[00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:17.760]   Do we belong to this kingdom?
[00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:25.200]   If you belong to any one of the other kingdoms, if you belong to man and his ideas and his
[00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:33.520]   power and authority, you will be destroyed everlastingly.
[00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:43.400]   They alone are safe and saved who belong to this other kingdom of the Son of Man.
[00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:46.920]   How does one belong to this U.S.?
[00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:49.720]   Quite right, I can tell you.
[00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:58.640]   You belong to this kingdom in this way, by serving him.
[00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:04.440]   And there was given him dominion and glory in the kingdom, that all people, nations,
[00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:09.560]   and languages should serve him.
[00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:13.920]   And the kingdom and dominion and the greatness of the kingdom unto the whole heaven shall
[00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:18.600]   be given to the people of the saints of the Most High.
[00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:24.760]   They are the people, the people who serve him, the people who are saints.
[00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:27.320]   What does that mean?
[00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:30.200]   What does it mean to serve him?
[00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:40.320]   Well, it's just another term for worshipping him, for giving yourself to him.
[00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:41.320]   And what is a saint?
[00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:44.840]   A saint is a man who has been separated.
[00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:49.520]   A saint is a man who has been taken out of the world and separated and who lives a life
[00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:53.680]   as he lives, is one who follows him and goes after him.
[00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:58.360]   Those are the only conditions.
[00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:05.520]   There is only one way to enter this kingdom of the Son of Man, this kingdom of peace and
[00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:09.680]   of righteousness and of joy.
[00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:12.640]   It is to serve him.
[00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:18.480]   It is to recognize him as the Son of God.
[00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:24.720]   It is to believe that he came into the world and died on the cross to redeem us from our
[00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:33.480]   sins, that he bore our punishment, endured our shame, that he has risen to justify us
[00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:35.600]   and to present us to God.
[00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:36.600]   Serve him.
[00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:38.320]   It means religious worship.
[00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:40.600]   It means that I bow down before him.
[00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:43.560]   It means that I acknowledge and confess my sin to him.
[00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:48.920]   It is to say that I realize I belong to the beasts and have gloried in the beasts, not
[00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:55.000]   only in the military and the earthly power, but in my own mind and brain and understanding.
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:58.120]   And in man it is to acknowledge and confess that.
[00:52:58.120 --> 00:53:04.440]   It is to fall prostrate before him, to look up into his face and to ask him to receive
[00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:10.680]   me, to have mercy upon me and to give myself utterly to him, to rise up and follow him,
[00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:17.320]   to serve him, to become a saint, to realize that nothing matters except being with him,
[00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:24.040]   being like him, being holy as he is holy and knowing God as my Father and experiencing
[00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:26.720]   his love.
[00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:32.560]   There is human history, my friends.
[00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:34.160]   It is still going on.
[00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:35.960]   How long I don't know.
[00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:39.160]   But if man has his own way it will soon come to an end.
[00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:43.440]   Man will blast it to nothing.
[00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:45.120]   But he will not do that.
[00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:48.600]   It's God who is going to destroy the world.
[00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:51.560]   Man seems to get very near it, but he never gets there.
[00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:59.240]   God will set the judgment and the end will be ushered in.
[00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:06.920]   Have you seen man's history for what it is?
[00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:11.840]   Have you still any confidence in man or in anything he can do?
[00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:17.920]   Come, let me ask the other question.
[00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:26.920]   Have you had a glimpse of the ancient of days, God in eternity?
[00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:35.760]   Have you seen the Son of His love, the Son of Man as one who has come into the world
[00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:46.480]   and even died to rescue you and save you from this beastly human history and to separate
[00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:59.680]   you unto himself that he one day may present you to the ancient of days and to enable you
[00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:06.680]   to spend your eternity in his glorious presence.
[00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:09.640]   Amen.
