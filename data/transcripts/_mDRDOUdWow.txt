[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.940]   We continue this morning our consideration of this great prayer that the Apostle Paul
[00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.900]   offers for the members of the Church at Ephesus, which is to be found in the third chapter
[00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:20.120]   of his epistle to the Ephesians, beginning at verse 14.
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:26.640]   "For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.320]   whole family in heaven and earth is named, that he would grant you, according to the
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:41.440]   riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner men, that
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:50.680]   Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith, that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.720]   may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and length and depth and
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:05.080]   height, and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.120]   with all the fulness of God.
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.360]   And then, he adds, now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:22.080]   we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, unto him be glory in the church
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.920]   by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end.
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:28.920]   Amen."
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:36.240]   We are still considering the seventeenth verse, this petition in which he says that Christ
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.280]   may dwell in your hearts by faith.
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:50.440]   Now we have been looking at this great statement in general, we have considered its nature
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:56.160]   in general, and we have observed, and I must repeat this because it is so important that
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:03.880]   the Apostle offers this prayer for all the members of the church at Ephesus, not for
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.780]   certain people only, but for all, and he goes on to say that they may be able to comprehend
[00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:19.660]   with all saints what is this great love of Christ which passeth knowledge.
[00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:26.480]   And therefore, I come back to it in order that once more we may deal with it in a more
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.800]   practical sense.
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:35.320]   There can be no question about this proposition that we are looking here at the greatest thing
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.600]   that can ever confront a human being.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.760]   Here we are shown the possibilities for a Christian in this life and in this world.
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.720]   This is, in a sense, true Christianity.
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.800]   Let us be clear about that.
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.720]   I am not saying that you cannot be a Christian without being in this position, but we are
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.160]   very poor Christians unless we are in this position.
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.920]   This is what we are meant to be, this is what is possible for us.
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:12.020]   And therefore, surely nothing is more important for us than to know how we may arrive at this
[00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:20.180]   position, how we may know whether Christ does dwell in us, and how we may be enabled to
[00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:26.880]   enjoy that supreme privilege and that greatest source of joy.
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.880]   Now, the hymn that we have just been singing reminds us of the possibility, but let me
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.240]   again remind you of something of what this means.
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:43.520]   Let me read to you the testimony of a man who knew what it was to have Christ in his
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.520]   heart.
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:50.960]   If I may use such a term, I do this in order to whet your appetites, in order that we may
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.280]   remind ourselves that we are not doing something theoretical here.
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:03.560]   We are talking about something that has been a fact realized in the life of large numbers
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:09.180]   of God's people in all ages, in all centuries, in all places.
[00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:16.080]   In spite of and irrespective of all theological differences, you find that there is a common
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:21.160]   testimony to this great experience of Christ in the heart.
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:29.680]   But I take this morning as my example and illustration, Charles Wesley.
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.840]   This is the sort of thing a man is enabled to say when Christ dwells in his heart.
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.920]   I am going to read to you—it is in our hymn book, fortunately—hymn number 471.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:47.700]   Thou hidden source of calm repose, Thou all-sufficient love divine,
[00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:54.560]   Thou my help and refuge from my foes, Secure I am if Thou art mine,
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:01.800]   And lo, from sin and grief and shame I hide me Jesus in Thy name.
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:08.880]   Thy mighty name salvation is, And keeps my happy soul above,
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:15.440]   Comfort it brings, and power and peace, And joy and everlasting love,
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:23.180]   To me with Thy dear name are given, Pardon and holiness and heaven.
[00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:31.420]   Jesus, my all in all Thou art, My rest in toil, my knees in pain,
[00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:39.260]   The medicine of my broken heart, In war my peace, in loss my gain,
[00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:47.500]   My smile beneath the tyrant's frown, In shame my glory and my crown,
[00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:55.020]   In want my plentiful supply, In weakness mine almighty power,
[00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:02.720]   In bonds my perfect liberty, My light in Satan's darkest hours,
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:13.580]   My help and stay whene'er I call, My life in death, my heaven, my all.
[00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:18.340]   Now the simple question that I put to you is this.
[00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.560]   Is that your experience?
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.460]   Can you adopt those words and use them?
[00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.700]   Is Christ like that to us?
[00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.040]   That's the question.
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:33.200]   Now that is what happens when Christ dwells in the heart.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.400]   You notice the intimacy of the relationship.
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.320]   You notice the fullness of the satisfaction.
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.480]   Christ is his all and in all, is his everything.
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:48.560]   Whatever his circumstances and conditions, here is always the answer.
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:55.200]   This relationship to Christ, this knowledge of Christ, it's experimental, experiential,
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.200]   if you like.
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.920]   It's not something held in the mind only, it isn't theory.
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:04.720]   He did find Christ his complete satisfaction.
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:12.880]   He has proved that the words of our Lord himself are true when he said that if any man went
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.720]   unto him, he would never hunger.
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:20.480]   If any man believed in him, he would never thirst.
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:26.200]   This is the well of water within springing up into everlasting life.
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:34.720]   The promise is of a complete satisfaction and here it is verified in the experience
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.400]   of a man like Charles Wesley.
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:41.640]   Now that I say is essential Christianity.
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:47.520]   That is what you and I are offered and it is to the extent that we know that experience
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:54.280]   and can testify to it that we are likely to attract others to the Christian faith.
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:58.600]   Men and women, after all, are entitled to watch us and to observe us.
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:04.440]   We make this tremendous claim that God has done a unique thing, that he sent his only
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:05.600]   son into the world.
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:11.040]   We believe in the incarnation, in the power of the spirit and so on, but the question
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:14.440]   is what does it lead to in practice?
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:20.640]   And if as Christian people we appear to be miserable and if in times of stress and trial
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:26.480]   and of strain we seem to have no consolation, well, the world is fully entitled to ask what
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.440]   is the value of your Christianity?
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:31.480]   What is there in it after all?
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:37.400]   And in a time and in an age like this, when so many hearts are failing people, they look
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:44.000]   to us and I say therefore not only for our own sakes, but for the sake of God and his
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:50.680]   glorious salvation, for the sake of the Son of God who came and endured so much that we
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:53.120]   might come to this position.
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:09:00.200]   It behoves us to see that we do know it and that we are manifesting it in our daily lives.
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:05.280]   That I say brings us to this most practical and essential question.
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:08.880]   How does this become possible?
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:13.960]   I know that I am speaking to many who are saying at this moment, "I'd give the whole
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:19.280]   world if I could only really use those words of Charles Wesley honestly."
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:20.280]   Very well.
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:21.720]   Here is the answer.
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.720]   How does this become possible?
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:26.880]   The Apostle's answer, you notice, is by faith.
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:34.000]   That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith, or if you prefer it, through faith.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.480]   But now it is extremely important that we should be clear as to the meaning of that
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:48.760]   phrase because it is a phrase that is very frequently misunderstood.
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:54.560]   Or if you like, we can take it at the same time in terms of that picture which we glanced
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:10:04.200]   at a fortnight ago in Revelations 3.20, "Christ says, 'Behold, I stand at the door and knock.
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:09.080]   If any man open, I will enter in, and will sup with him, and he with me.'"
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:14.360]   That addressed, you remember, to the Church of the Laodiceans, a message to Christian
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:15.360]   believers.
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.400]   Now, what is opening the door?
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.600]   That is the question.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.880]   What is by faith?
[00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:25.800]   What is opening the door?
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:30.040]   Now in an attempt to answer this question in a thoroughly practical manner this morning,
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:38.280]   I would start by saying again that we must start with verse 16, "That he would grant
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:44.560]   you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.600]   in the inner men."
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:49.680]   Now without that, we can do nothing.
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:54.240]   That is ever always the starting point.
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:57.640]   This is something that a man in and of himself is incapable of.
[00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:59.700]   He just cannot do it.
[00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:04.840]   So the apostle puts that in the first position.
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:09.840]   But here, I say, a certain danger arises.
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:18.680]   And it is, of course, a danger which has afflicted many people in this way.
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:25.680]   Because of this emphasis and stress upon the primary work of the Holy Spirit, the danger
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:29.840]   is to say, "Well, very well.
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:35.800]   That means then, I take it, that you and I can do nothing."
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:41.900]   And we simply remain passive and wait for something to happen to us, and we go on expecting
[00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:45.300]   that something will take place.
[00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.360]   But that, of course, is an entire fallacy.
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:53.280]   The truth about this matter is expressed once and forever, it seems to me, in the Epistle
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:57.600]   to the Philippians, in the second chapter, verses 12 and 13, where the apostle puts it
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:05.000]   like this, "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God that
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:12.080]   worketh in you both the will and to-do of his good pleasure."
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:17.400]   Now there you notice the right balance and the right sequence.
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:22.080]   He puts it as an exhortation, almost as a command, "Work out your own salvation
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.080]   with fear and trembling."
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:27.160]   There is the indicative, there is something that you and I have got to do.
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:31.920]   Yes, but you notice he adds, "For it is God that worketh in you."
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:36.120]   That's just putting it the other way around from what we have here, but really saying
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:39.000]   the same thing.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.460]   Were it not for the fact that God works in us both the will and to-do, we could never
[00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:46.920]   do anything at all.
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:52.200]   Our wills, as we've seen, need to be stimulated and to be strengthened, and we need the power.
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.200]   Very well.
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:54.520]   God has promised to do that.
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:57.400]   He works in us both the will and to-do.
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:06.080]   And because he does that, you and I now work out our own salvation with fear and trembling.
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:14.500]   So all this emphasis upon the 16th verse does not teach us a kind of passivity in which
[00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:18.520]   we just wait and do nothing at all.
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:23.440]   Very well, having said that, the apostle goes on to say that this, therefore, is something
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:25.600]   now which happens by faith.
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:30.200]   The Holy Spirit, we have prayed that he will strengthen us with his glorious power in the
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:31.200]   inner man.
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.200]   Very well.
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:39.360]   As a result of that, we are now able to receive Christ to dwell in our hearts by faith.
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:49.560]   And here we come to this crucial question, "What is this by faith or through faith?"
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:56.180]   Now it is here, again, that we come across a type of teaching which, if I understand
[00:13:56.180 --> 00:14:02.180]   these matters at all, has stumbled many and has kept them from a living experience of
[00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:05.540]   what we are considering.
[00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:13.500]   By faith does not mean, to use the current phrase, "Take it by faith."
[00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:18.260]   Now you are familiar with that teaching, which comes to you and says about this or any other
[00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:22.100]   experience in the Christian life, it says it is quite simple, there is no difficulty
[00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:23.100]   at all.
[00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:24.100]   You just take it by faith.
[00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:26.060]   You just open the door to Christ and he is in.
[00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:29.500]   And then, though you may feel nothing at all, you say, "Well, of course, the word says
[00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:31.620]   if you open the door, I will enter in.
[00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:33.620]   Well, I open the door and he enters.
[00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:34.620]   Well, there it is.
[00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:35.620]   I feel nothing at all."
[00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:36.620]   "But it does not matter," they say.
[00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:40.620]   "It does not matter what you feel, you just go on now assuming that he has come in because
[00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:41.620]   he says he will.
[00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:42.820]   It is quite simple.
[00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:45.180]   You take it by faith."
[00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:49.500]   Now that seems to me to be completely wrong.
[00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:53.720]   And indeed, I do not hesitate to assert that there is no type of teaching that can be so
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:15:00.340]   dangerous to the soul as just that, and for this reason.
[00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:05.900]   That is surely nothing but a kind of self-persuasion.
[00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:13.560]   That is just, to put into practice, a psychological principle of auto-suggestion.
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:18.700]   And it is so wrong in this connection for this reason, that we are not dealing here
[00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:28.500]   with an influence, we are dealing with a person, that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith.
[00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:33.560]   You see, when a man like Charles Wesley writes that hymn, he is not persuading himself, he
[00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:36.340]   is writing his experience.
[00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:39.460]   That is how Christ was to him.
[00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:42.500]   He did not sort of have no feelings whatsoever.
[00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:46.620]   He was not just left to himself, and then have to persuade himself that these things
[00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:47.620]   are so.
[00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:48.620]   No, no.
[00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:49.620]   What he says is this.
[00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:52.540]   "You are the medicine of my broken heart.
[00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:57.100]   You are my perfect liberty when I am in bonds."
[00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:01.980]   And it was true to him, in his experience, he is not persuading himself of something.
[00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:04.980]   He is experiencing this something.
[00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:10.740]   And that, as we saw in the quotations I gave you last Sunday morning, has always been the
[00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:13.300]   experience of God's people.
[00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:17.620]   This is not something that you have to assume or to take it for granted and go on in a kind
[00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:18.620]   of blind faith.
[00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:19.620]   No.
[00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:20.620]   Thank God it isn't that.
[00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:25.260]   It is a reality, a living reality.
[00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:30.780]   The Apostle Paul isn't speaking in hyperbole when he says, "To me to live is Christ."
[00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:32.740]   It was true.
[00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:39.100]   And when he adds, "I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me," it was a fact
[00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:40.580]   in his experience.
[00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:46.460]   Therefore, I say we must be very careful about this teaching about "take it by faith," and
[00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:54.880]   in any case, there is nothing which is so misleading as to say that it is quite simple.
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:57.260]   Some people use that illustration, you remember.
[00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:01.380]   They say, "There's the room with the blinds drawn, and it's in a state of darkness, though
[00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:03.500]   there's brilliant sunshine outside."
[00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:04.500]   They say, "It's quite simple.
[00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:10.700]   All you have to do is to let up the blind, and the sunshine comes streaming in."
[00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:13.180]   And we are told that it's as simple as that.
[00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:15.180]   But that leaves many people in perplexity.
[00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:17.020]   They say, "I've been doing that for years.
[00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:18.060]   I've been trying to do that.
[00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:21.180]   I've believed it's quite simple, but it doesn't seem to happen.
[00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:23.820]   I haven't got this experience."
[00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:27.820]   And the answer is, of course, that it is not quite simple.
[00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:30.020]   Faith is not something simple in that way.
[00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:34.940]   That is, ought to suggestion, that's a kind of believism.
[00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:40.020]   Faith as I want to try to show you is something much more active than that.
[00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:46.540]   So if you will read the biographies of God's people who have known what it is to have Christ
[00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:52.060]   in their hearts by faith, you will find that not one of them says it's quite simple.
[00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:57.020]   You will find that many of them, indeed most of them, have had a long process of seeking
[00:17:57.020 --> 00:18:04.440]   and of searching, and of almost becoming desperate, and of almost giving up in despair.
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:09.140]   But they've gone on, and they've sought, and they've struggled.
[00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:17.540]   And then they have become aware that Christ is in truth and in fact dwelling within them.
[00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:21.380]   Therefore I say the last thing I am urging is that this is something quite simple.
[00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:25.540]   And you just take it on as the word, as it were, and open the door, and Christ has come
[00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:26.660]   in and all is well.
[00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:29.480]   But the question is, is all well?
[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:31.940]   Is this your experience?
[00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:37.420]   So that, having shown you that that negative treatment of the subject is quite wrong, let
[00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:40.100]   me come to the positive.
[00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:42.740]   What is this by faith?
[00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:48.980]   Now, it seems to me that we can do nothing better than to take the description we are
[00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:56.980]   given of this in that great chapter, the eleventh chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews, which
[00:18:56.980 --> 00:19:03.380]   was written specially in order to give us an account and a description of what the life
[00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:06.780]   of faith really is.
[00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:09.380]   It isn't something passive, we shall find.
[00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:11.180]   It isn't the kind of auto-suggestion.
[00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:12.860]   It isn't something which is quite simple.
[00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:17.260]   No, no, you read the lives of those men and you'll see that it wasn't simple, but it's
[00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:18.260]   very true.
[00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:19.260]   Well, what is it?
[00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:25.340]   Well, it is, I say, primarily and essentially an activity.
[00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:29.660]   Fortunately, the author sums it up for us in one verse.
[00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:33.820]   In the thirteenth verse of that eleventh chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews, we are given
[00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:36.700]   this remarkable definition.
[00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:41.620]   These all, he says, he has been referring to a number of saints living in different
[00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:50.740]   centuries, these all, he says, died in faith, not having received the promises, but having
[00:19:50.740 --> 00:20:00.260]   seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that
[00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:06.460]   they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.
[00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:13.060]   Now then, let us take this definition which he gives us and apply it, that Christ may
[00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:17.940]   dwell in your hearts by faith.
[00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:18.940]   What does it mean?
[00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:25.860]   Well, the first thing it means is this, that I must see this, having seen these things
[00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:28.720]   afar off.
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:33.420]   In other words, I must recognize this thing.
[00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:38.080]   I must recognize the teaching and not just dismiss it.
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:41.100]   I must be arrested by it.
[00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:46.240]   You see, here were these men living their life in this world even as you and I are doing,
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:52.020]   and a message came of something very different, something spiritual, something from God.
[00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:53.620]   And what is the truth about these men?
[00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:55.140]   Well, they saw it.
[00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:56.520]   Nobody else saw it.
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:59.140]   The other people, in fact, ridiculed it.
[00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:01.620]   Look at the men like Noah, for instance.
[00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:05.140]   He heard the message that was given that God was going to destroy the world.
[00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:07.140]   He saw it, and he did something about it.
[00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:08.140]   Nobody else did.
[00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:10.140]   And they ridiculed him for building his ark.
[00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:11.300]   They laughed at him.
[00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:13.020]   The thing seemed to be monstrous.
[00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:21.220]   Ah, the thing that differentiates the Christian from everybody else is that he sees something.
[00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:28.620]   And the vital question for us at this moment is this, do we see this possibility?
[00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:33.420]   Or do we say, ah, but this is some sort of mysticism.
[00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:36.780]   This is some sort of enthusiasm or a fanaticism.
[00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:41.100]   I believe in being a Christian, says the man, and I believe in holding this truth in general
[00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:42.940]   in my mind and living a certain type of life.
[00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:49.100]   But ah, you are now leading us surely into some dangerous realm where strange things
[00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:50.180]   may happen to us.
[00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:52.820]   Well, indeed I am.
[00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:56.500]   I am leading you into the realm of those great heroes of the faith.
[00:21:56.500 --> 00:22:00.580]   I am leading you into the realm in which the Apostle Paul lived, and the Apostles, and
[00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:03.220]   these first Christians.
[00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:11.420]   But the point is that unless we see this, and see it as a concrete reality, obviously,
[00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:12.700]   we shall never know it.
[00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:15.000]   We shall never experience it.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.760]   But not only did these people see these things, they were persuaded of them.
[00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:25.520]   And I want to emphasize this.
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:29.940]   Because so many, when they read a passage like this and begin to get some understanding
[00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:36.760]   of it, once they begin to see it, they then avoid the whole thing by speaking in this
[00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:37.760]   way.
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:43.200]   Ah, they say, of course, I recognize the type of experience that you are describing.
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:45.040]   You've demonstrated it out of the Scriptures.
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:47.360]   You've demonstrated it out of your hymn book.
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:51.000]   It's certainly been true of large numbers of people.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   But don't you think, says this person, that they're rather exceptional people?
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:03.280]   Isn't this something that only happens to a certain type, and to a certain kind?
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:06.840]   Isn't this something that's finally dependent upon one's makeup?
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:12.800]   There is the kind of person who's naturally mystical, and there's the other person who
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:17.240]   is more stolid and more ordinary, the more mundane type.
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:21.480]   Isn't this solely for a certain type of person?
[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:26.280]   Now, I'm quite sure that I'm speaking what has been in the mind of many, as I say
[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:28.200]   that this morning.
[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:31.320]   The devil has come and has suggested, well, it's a perfectly genuine experience, of
[00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:33.560]   course, but it was never meant for you.
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:36.200]   It isn't meant for everybody.
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:38.000]   Or it may come in this form.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:45.400]   Ah, yes, of course, that's a very wonderful experience, and I do like listening to it
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:48.720]   and reading about it.
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:55.320]   But of course, it's obviously not meant for me, I'm a businessman, and I'm concerned
[00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:59.200]   with the affairs of this life, or I'm a professional man, and I'm busy.
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:04.080]   I can see quite clearly that if I had nothing else to do but to spend my days in my study,
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:09.120]   or just concentrating upon the Christian life, if I became a monk, or a hermit, or an anchorite,
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:12.720]   and could really give myself to the pursuit of this, I've no doubt it would be possible
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:13.720]   for me.
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:19.320]   But here I am immersed in business and affairs and all these problems, sure, it's quite
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:20.720]   impossible for me.
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:27.720]   Well, now, the simple answer to that is that the Apostle Paul regarded it as a possibility
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:33.280]   for every one of these members of the Christian church in Ephesus.
[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:37.120]   And we are given to understand that these early Christians, the majority of them were
[00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:44.520]   slaves, not their own masters at all, forced to work and to labor and to sweat, men who'd
[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:48.480]   lacked education and knowledge and culture and preparation.
[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:53.160]   Here were men immersed in the most sordid details of life, and yet the Apostle says
[00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:57.160]   this is possible for them.
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:02.400]   And it is absolutely essential that we should be persuaded about this thing.
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:07.180]   If you push it away and evade it by trying to explain that your position or your circumstances
[00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:10.440]   are such that it's not possible for you, of course you'll never know it.
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:12.960]   But you're utterly unscriptural.
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:15.400]   You are denying the apostles' teaching.
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:24.760]   And not only that, you are denying Christian experience in the church throughout the centuries.
[00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:28.960]   Now I said in passing last Sunday morning that we must at all costs avoid that utterly
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:35.280]   false dichotomy which the Roman Catholic church and other forms of Catholicism indulge in
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:38.320]   when we divide people into saints and those who are not saints.
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:41.600]   Every single Christian is a saint.
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:45.120]   All the members of the church at Corinth were called to be saints.
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:46.880]   They are regarded as saints.
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:51.800]   We must reject this suggestion as of the very devil.
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:57.360]   This is possible for every one of us.
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:04.480]   As each one of us has the same salvation by the blood of Christ, we are given the same
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:10.680]   gift of life, we are meant to experience it the same, to live it the same, to die in the
[00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:15.320]   same knowledge, and to go to the same heaven.
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:23.920]   And as I say, it is just a fact of history that the most ordinary kind of individual
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:31.960]   has had this blessed experience and has been able to testify to it.
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:34.560]   I'm more and more impressed by that.
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:37.520]   It is not confined to outstanding people.
[00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:45.200]   It is the common experience of the most ordinary as well as the extraordinary.
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:51.880]   Because you see, finally, it does not depend upon anything in us, but upon the Lord himself.
[00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:58.720]   And all we do is to believe in it, to see it, and to be persuaded of it.
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:03.120]   I do trust that I have made that abundantly clear, because if we are not persuaded of
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:07.960]   it as a possibility for us, obviously we shall not seek it.
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:09.520]   But then you notice this next term.
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:15.360]   They saw it afar off, they were persuaded of it, and then they embraced it.
[00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:21.440]   You notice how each term takes us on from step to step.
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:25.080]   The moment these people were persuaded of this thing, they said, "I am going to lay
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:26.080]   hold on that.
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:27.080]   I want it."
[00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:31.400]   They embraced it.
[00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:37.680]   They began earnestly to desire this very thing.
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:45.840]   Now, this is the thing, of course, that our Lord put in the Sermon on the Mount, in one
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:46.840]   of the Beatitudes.
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:52.880]   It is in Matthew's Gospel, chapter 5, verse 6, "Blessed," he said, "are they which
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:28:01.440]   do hunger and thirst after righteousness; for they shall be filled."
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:04.280]   That is embracing it, you see.
[00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:05.280]   Hungering and thirsting.
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:07.440]   They have seen this thing at last.
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:11.320]   They have read this chapter many times, but it had never conveyed anything to them.
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:13.600]   At last they say, "This is a living possibility."
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:16.840]   And then they are absolutely persuaded of it, and for themselves, so they now begin
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:17.840]   to hunger and thirst.
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:23.880]   They are laying hold of it.
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:28.200]   And incidentally linking this with the last point, let me put it in this extremely simple
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:32.080]   and practical way.
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:39.040]   Are we too busy to be persuaded of and to embrace things that we want in this life and
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:42.760]   in this world?
[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:49.800]   Have we no time at all to cultivate our interests and our tastes?
[00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:55.180]   Is a man, a businessman or a professional man, who tells me that he is too busy to seek
[00:28:55.180 --> 00:29:02.160]   Christ in this way, is he as a young man too busy to seek a wife?
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:03.160]   Has he no time at all?
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:05.040]   Does he say, "No, I haven't a spare moment"?
[00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:06.040]   He finds hours.
[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:12.080]   He makes time, and so we must do it with his embrace.
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:16.880]   Now let me give you again a very good statement of this, and this time I am going to quote
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:19.680]   you another hymn.
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:28.920]   And this time I go to that saintly Dutchman, Ter Stegen, a man again who had experienced
[00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:29.920]   these things.
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:36.240]   Listen to him, this is how he puts it, "Here is a man who has seen this, and he has not
[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:40.400]   only seen it, he is persuaded, and now he embraces the thing.
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:48.560]   Thou hidden love of God, whose height, whose depth, and fathomed no man knows, I see from
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:55.480]   far thy beauteous light, in thee I sigh for thy repose.
[00:29:55.480 --> 00:30:02.880]   My heart is pained, nor can it be at rest till it finds rest in thee."
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:04.360]   That's the embracing.
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:08.520]   You see the man not only sees it as an intellectual possibility, it's a reality to him.
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:10.720]   He's persuaded and he's trying to embrace it.
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:17.040]   "'Tis mercy all that thou hast brought my mind to seek her peace in thee.
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:25.800]   Yet while I seek but find thee not, no peace my wandering soul shall see.
[00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:36.560]   O, when shall all my wanderings end, and all my steps to thee were tend?"
[00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:38.520]   Let me put it as a question.
[00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:40.880]   Have you spoken like that?
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:43.600]   Have you known that kind of agony of soul?
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:50.040]   You've seen the possibility, and there you want it, and you've sought it, and you're
[00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:54.360]   struggling, and you're wandering after it, but you can't find it, and while you can't
[00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:55.600]   there's no peace for you.
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:59.640]   You've seen it so clearly that you say, "I'll never be happy again until I have
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:00.640]   that."
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:01.640]   That's the thing.
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:02.640]   That's the embracing.
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:08.040]   Ter Stegen, you notice, went through that process.
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:09.680]   He didn't find it very simple.
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:12.580]   He didn't say it's just like letting up the blinds, and he comes flat.
[00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:14.520]   It isn't just like opening the door, and there it is.
[00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:16.040]   I take it by faith, and all is...
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:18.480]   There's no glibness about this, my friends.
[00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:23.880]   None of these people who've experienced this have ever been glib.
[00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:26.560]   Forgive me for putting it like this.
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:32.360]   I sometimes feel that there are many people today who have taken so much by faith that
[00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:35.520]   they've gotten nothing.
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:36.520]   It's all talk.
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:37.520]   It's all words.
[00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:39.760]   Is this thing a reality in experience?
[00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:41.680]   Here's a man who had to struggle.
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:42.680]   He sought.
[00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:48.080]   He felt it seemed to be eluding him, and then he cries out in the agony of his soul, "Oh,
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:53.440]   when shall all my wanderings end?"
[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:55.760]   Have you sought him like that?
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:32:02.660]   Have you tried to embrace the promise in that particular way and manner?
[00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:05.120]   It's a part of this process.
[00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:10.000]   But then I go on to his next term, which is a vitally important one.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.600]   They saw it afar off.
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:12.600]   They were persuaded.
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:19.520]   They embraced, and then they confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims in the world.
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:24.240]   In other words, this is, you see, the point at which they begin to act on it.
[00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:31.780]   And my dear friend, if we don't act on this and in this way, the whole thing is in vain.
[00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:34.520]   Believe me, it's not just a matter of opening a door glibly like that.
[00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:35.520]   No, no.
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:40.160]   You and I have got to do certain things if this is to become a fact.
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:41.560]   The life of faith.
[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:43.740]   They confessed.
[00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:44.740]   They did something.
[00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:45.740]   What was it?
[00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:51.720]   Well, you notice that their whole life and outlook was determined by this and was controlled
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:55.560]   by this.
[00:32:55.560 --> 00:33:00.600]   You read the story of every one of those men in the Eleventh of Hebrews, and you'll find
[00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:03.980]   that's the thing that characterized him.
[00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:07.920]   When Abram saw this, he left his country, and he went out not knowing whether he was
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:08.920]   going.
[00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:09.920]   Why?
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:10.920]   Well, he'd seen this.
[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:11.920]   He confessed.
[00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:12.920]   He acted.
[00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:17.440]   When Noah saw it, yes, he separated himself from others and began building the ark.
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:21.920]   Only one of them.
[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:23.440]   We've got to act.
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:28.480]   Once we see this and are persuaded of it and embrace it, I say this becomes the controlling
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:31.000]   motive of our life.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.960]   It becomes the biggest thing of all.
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:38.320]   We say, "I want Christ, and I'm going to give everything up as it were until I have him."
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:39.320]   Well, what does it mean?
[00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:42.880]   Well, it means this.
[00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:52.760]   The first thing we have to do is to keep this matter constantly in our minds.
[00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:56.480]   Shall I put a simple test to you?
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:03.720]   Has this been in your mind every single day since we considered it last Sunday?
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:08.640]   You may have been charmed by the possibility as I read those hymns to you.
[00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:11.840]   And you said as you sat here last Sunday, "I want that."
[00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:15.280]   Have you said that every day this week?
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:17.520]   How difficult it is to keep things in the mind.
[00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:18.800]   You and I have got to do that.
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:19.800]   How do we do it?
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:20.800]   We read our Bibles.
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:21.980]   You go over this passage.
[00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:23.200]   You read similar ones.
[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:24.520]   You keep on reading.
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:26.000]   Then you meditate upon it.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.400]   You think about it.
[00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:30.640]   You deliberately cause your mind to turn to it.
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:35.600]   And then another very good way, as I'm illustrating to you, is to read the experiences of the
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:36.600]   saints.
[00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:37.600]   You get it in your hymn books.
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:38.600]   You needn't go any further.
[00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:39.600]   It's all there.
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:42.820]   You'll get it in the biographies of saintly men of God.
[00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:43.820]   Watch them.
[00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:44.820]   How they sought it.
[00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:45.820]   What they did about it.
[00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:50.780]   And as you do it, you'll be keeping it before your mind.
[00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:53.340]   Now I say that we have to do it deliberately.
[00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:56.000]   We have to take it up.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.980]   And we have to cause our minds to dwell upon it.
[00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:02.780]   We have to be ruthless.
[00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:08.140]   And above all, of course, we have to remind ourselves of this possibility of this personal
[00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:12.820]   relationship to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:14.820]   Because that is the central thing.
[00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:17.820]   We are not talking about some "it" or some experience as such.
[00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:22.820]   We are talking about Him, He in the heart, and the experience that flows out of our intimacy
[00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:23.860]   with Him.
[00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:29.100]   So we have deliberately to say, "Now then, is Jesus Christ real to me?
[00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:30.100]   I believe on Him.
[00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:31.380]   I've accepted the Christian faith.
[00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:33.140]   Yes, but do I know Him like that?
[00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:36.340]   Can I speak as Wesley spoke?"
[00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:39.760]   And so you go on questioning yourselves and holding it before you.
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:42.260]   That's the first and the most important matter.
[00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:45.100]   But let me hurry on.
[00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:49.180]   The next thing, I think it follows of necessity in a logical manner, doesn't it?
[00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:56.320]   We realize that certain things are quite incompatible with this.
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:36:00.700]   If Christ is in our hearts, well then, certain other things cannot and must not be in our
[00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:02.700]   hearts.
[00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:03.700]   What are they?
[00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:08.740]   Let me take you back again to 2 Corinthians 6, where the thing has been put for us perfectly
[00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:10.120]   once and forever.
[00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:11.120]   Listen.
[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:17.500]   "What agreement hath the temple of God with either, for ye are the temple of the living
[00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:18.500]   God?"
[00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:20.340]   Go back and look at the earlier questions.
[00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:24.300]   "What fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness?
[00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:27.060]   What communion hath light with darkness?
[00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:29.480]   What conquered hath Christ with Belial?
[00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:32.060]   What part hath he that believeth with an infidel?
[00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:36.620]   What agreement hath the temple of God with idols, for ye are the temple of the living
[00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:37.620]   God?
[00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:42.660]   For he hath said, 'I will dwell in them, and walk in them, and I will be their God,
[00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:44.560]   and they shall be my people.'"
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:49.860]   Now there it is, you see.
[00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:53.100]   There's no need to argue about these things.
[00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:56.620]   These things are incompatible.
[00:36:56.620 --> 00:37:00.180]   There is no conquered between Christ and Belial.
[00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:04.300]   If Christ is in my heart, there are certain things that have got to go out of my heart.
[00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:05.900]   He won't dwell with them.
[00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:08.060]   He's particular.
[00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:09.380]   He's the Son of God.
[00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:14.380]   He's absolutely holy and sinless.
[00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:21.180]   So that if we truly seek this and embrace it, we have to begin to take action in this
[00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:22.180]   respect.
[00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:28.540]   "Love not the world, nor the things that are in the world," says the Apostle John.
[00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:32.180]   You can't have the love of the Father and the love of the world at the same time.
[00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:36.820]   Therefore, if you want Christ in your heart, get rid of the world and its mind and its
[00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:39.860]   outlook and its actions and its behavior.
[00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:45.620]   All that has got to go out.
[00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:49.860]   But having got rid of all that, you will find another enemy still remains, and he's the
[00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:54.660]   most subtle of all, and that's self.
[00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:59.660]   If you simply go along and get rid of all those other things in your own strength, you'll
[00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:03.860]   be praising yourself, you'll be patting yourself on the back, you'll be imagining
[00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:05.300]   that you're wonderful.
[00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:11.300]   Self and Christ and self cannot dwell in the heart at the same time.
[00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:14.380]   If he is to occupy, I must go out.
[00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:16.960]   Here again, we are aware of the danger.
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:20.060]   Many of the saints have testified to this.
[00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:26.780]   Let me give it to you in the experience of that great French saint, Theodore Monod.
[00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:32.580]   "Oh, the bitter shame and sorrow that a time could ever be, when I let the Savior's
[00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:38.820]   pity plead in vain and proudly answered, 'All of self and none of thee.'
[00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:40.300]   Yet he found me.
[00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:47.040]   I beheld him bleeding on the accursed tree, heard him pray, 'Forgive them, Father,'
[00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:53.940]   and my wistful heart said faintly, 'Some of self and some of thee.'
[00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:55.940]   He's a Christian now.
[00:38:55.940 --> 00:39:00.300]   It isn't all of self and none of, some of self and some of thee.
[00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:07.460]   Day by day, his tender mercy, healing, helping, full and free, sweet and strong and ah, so
[00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:12.860]   patient, brought me lower while I whispered, 'Less of self and more of thee.'
[00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:19.600]   He's advancing, higher than the highest heaven, deeper than the deepest sea.
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:23.780]   Lord, thy love at last hath conquered.
[00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:32.040]   Grant me now my supplication, none of self and all of thee."
[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:34.940]   We know something about these stages, don't we?
[00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:40.560]   We know the subtlety of the devil, but I say that it's either Christ or self.
[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:45.760]   While you and I are in control, Christ isn't in control, so not only do these things go
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:49.180]   out, self goes out as well.
[00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:53.320]   And then I say we not only recognize that all that has got to go, but we proceed to
[00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:55.040]   do it.
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:40:00.820]   "Wherefore, come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch
[00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:02.640]   not the unclean thing."
[00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:03.720]   It isn't quite simple, is it?
[00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:08.200]   It isn't just letting up the blinds or just, "No, no, you've got to be clearing out.
[00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:10.960]   Come out from among them and get rid of these things.
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:16.400]   Touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you, and will be a father unto you, and ye
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:21.040]   shall be my sons and my daughters, saith the Lord God Almighty."
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:31.400]   Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness
[00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:41.120]   of the flesh and Spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:42.840]   You and I have got to do that.
[00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:48.200]   The Spirit is already strengthening us with might by his power in the inner man, but because
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:50.640]   he is, you and I have got to do this.
[00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:51.640]   Cleanse ourselves.
[00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:54.760]   We've got to get rid of these things.
[00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:59.880]   In other words, if you want Christ in your heart dwelling, well then I say you've got
[00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:02.600]   to put into practice this exhortation.
[00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:04.680]   There is no other way.
[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:14.080]   "If any man would be my disciple, let him deny himself, and take up the cross, and follow
[00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:17.480]   me.
[00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:24.640]   They that are Christ's," says Paul, "have crucified the flesh with the affections and
[00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:32.600]   lusts, and Christ will never dwell in our hearts until we have done that."
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:38.840]   And then, of course, the next step is the step of prayer.
[00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:45.760]   We've got to realize still our utter dependence upon him.
[00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:50.840]   If you think that mutilating the flesh or doing the various other things that some of
[00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:55.960]   the mystics have done falsely is going to lead to this, it's a great mistake.
[00:41:55.960 --> 00:42:01.040]   We work with all our might, work out your salvation with fear and trembling, but we
[00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:04.240]   must realize our utter dependence upon him.
[00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:06.680]   I come back again to Ter Stegen.
[00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:11.320]   Having realized what he needs, having failed to find it, this is how he goes on.
[00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:20.760]   "Is there a thing beneath the sun that strives with thee my heart to share?
[00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:26.360]   I'll tear it hence and reign alone, the Lord of every motion there.
[00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:32.320]   Then shall my heart from earth be free, when it hath found repose in thee.
[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:41.440]   O Lord, O love, thy sovereign aid impart to save me from low-thoughted care.
[00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:49.360]   Chase this self-will through all my heart, through all its latent mazes there.
[00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:56.760]   Make me thy duteous child that I, ceaseless, may ever farther cry.
[00:42:56.760 --> 00:43:06.520]   Each moment draw from earth away my heart that lowly waits thy call.
[00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:18.040]   Speak to my inmost soul and say, 'I am thy love, thy God, thy all, to feel thy power,
[00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:23.480]   to hear thy voice, to taste thy love.
[00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:27.040]   Be all my choice.'"
[00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:28.680]   Do you pray like that to him?
[00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:33.320]   That's hymn number 469.
[00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:40.000]   That's the prayer of a man who is truly embracing these things and confessing them.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:45.680]   He spends his time in talking to Christ, in asking him to come.
[00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:51.240]   He's cleansing, he's purifying, he needs the strength that Christ alone can give.
[00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:53.080]   So he pleads for it.
[00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:54.400]   He yearns for it.
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:55.800]   He asks him for it.
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:57.800]   He asks him to have mercy.
[00:43:57.800 --> 00:43:58.800]   Prayer.
[00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:05.760]   And finally, perseverance, going on with it.
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:11.680]   Persisting like this, you'll have many discouragements.
[00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:14.920]   You may feel much worse than you did before.
[00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:19.200]   You may have visions of your own heart such as you'd never imagined.
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:23.680]   You may be going further from God, as you think, but go on, I say, it's his process.
[00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:29.680]   He is leading you on.
[00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:38.080]   And we have his definite promise and assurance, "Him that cometh unto me I will in no wise
[00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:39.980]   cast out."
[00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:43.060]   This is his desire for us.
[00:44:43.060 --> 00:44:49.080]   But you see, knowing as he does that these other things have got to happen first, he
[00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:51.960]   leads us on.
[00:44:51.960 --> 00:45:01.840]   The first step generally in this mighty experience of Christ in the heart is that we are given
[00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:10.760]   a vision of the blackness of our hearts, the horror of self, and of the self-seeking life
[00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:15.360]   which daunts us and makes us feel utterly desperate, but that's exactly what he wants
[00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:16.360]   us to feel.
[00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:23.120]   It is only when we are utterly desperate and feel quite hopeless that we look to him and
[00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:29.260]   need this strengthening of the spirit in the inner man and pray for it as we've never
[00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:31.520]   prayed before.
[00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:38.760]   And God answers the prayer, and the Holy Spirit so strengthens us and so works in us and so
[00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:49.920]   moves in us that we are able to will and to do and to prepare the place for the Lord Jesus
[00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:58.680]   Christ, that he may fulfill his own promise, "I will manifest myself to you.
[00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:02.760]   I will come and take up my abode in you.
[00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:09.200]   I and the Father will dwell in you."
[00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:11.720]   Amen.
[00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:15.640]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
