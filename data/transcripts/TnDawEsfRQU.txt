[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320]   Previously on Grace To Youâ€¦
[00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:08.800]   All of that has to be held together by integrity, and that is what marked Paul.
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.360]   And essentially, that is what he defends in this entire letter,
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:20.880]   because that's what's under attack. Anybody serving the Lord must maintain personal integrity.
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.960]   What in the world makes us so embarrassed about the gospel?
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:47.520]   I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.760]   I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.760]   I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.200]   Now he understood that fearing the Lord is the foundation of a blessed life.
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:10.320]   Proverbs 9:10 puts it as simply as it could possibly be put: "The fear of the Lord is the
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.200]   beginning of wisdom." "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom." Paul knew that.
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.000]   He also knew what the Proverbs say. And I went through Proverbs and just looked for this,
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.040]   and I found statements in chapter 10 where it says that fearing the Lord
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:36.880]   literally brings and prolongs life. In chapter 14, "The fear of the Lord produces strength
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.600]   and the fountain of life." Chapter 15, "The fear of the Lord is better than treasure."
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.560]   Chapter 19, "The fear of the Lord leads to life." Chapter 22 of Proverbs, "The fear of the Lord leads
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:54.000]   to riches, honor, and life." Life is summed up in its richest form by fearing the Lord.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:02.160]   Why did he pursue integrity this way? Because he was a true worshiper. You can't say, "I'm a true
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:08.160]   worshiper of God. I worship the true and living God with all my heart and not be concerned about
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:15.920]   being a hypocrite." Because the greatest offering you ever give in your worship to God is a pure
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:27.120]   heart, right? A pure heart. So if his reputation is ruined by these lying false teachers who want
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.800]   to destroy his reputation so his people will lose trust in him and start listening to them,
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:42.880]   if his reputation is destroyed, then dishonor comes to the Lord. And that's the last thing he
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:43.920]   would ever want.
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.040]   The last thing he would ever want is to be a true worshiper of God. And that's the last thing he
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.280]   would ever want. And that's the last thing he would ever want. And that's the last thing he would ever
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.640]   want. He's a worshiper. It was reverence for the Lord that motivated him toward integrity.
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.960]   Secondly, it was concern for the church, concern for the church. And we see that in verse 12:
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:06.720]   "We're not again commending ourselves to you." Again he's saying, "This is not just me trying to
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:14.960]   convince you that I'm trustworthy. There's more there than this. We've done that before. So we're
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.960]   not again commending ourselves to you." Again he's saying, "This is not just me trying to convince you
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.960]   that I'm trustworthy. There's more there than this. We've done that before. So we're not again
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:15.120]   again commending ourselves to you." Again he's saying, "This is not just me trying to convince you that I'm
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.120]   trustworthy. There's more there than this. We're not again commending ourselves to you." Again he's saying,
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.600]   "This is not just me trying to convince you that I'm trustworthy. There's more there than this. We're not again
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.240]   commending ourselves to you." Again he's saying, "This is not just me trying to convince you that I'm
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.200]   trustworthy. There's more there than this. We're not again commending ourselves to you." Again he's saying,
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:17.200]   "This is not just me trying to convince you that I'm trustworthy. There's more there than this. We're
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:17.200]   not again commending ourselves to you." Again he's saying, "This is not just me trying to convince you that I'm
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:17.200]   trustworthy. There's more there than this. We're not again commending ourselves to you."
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:24.800]   But are giving you an occasion to be proud of us so that you will have an answer for those who take
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.400]   pride in appearance and not in heart. Well, we can start with the latter part, taking pride in
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.960]   appearance and heart. That's the Judaizers. That's the Jewish people. That's the ones who were denying
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:41.360]   the gospel. They were saying salvation is by works, by circumcision, as we saw. They are called dogs.
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:48.080]   They are called evil workers. Look, works righteousness in the Jewish system is evil work.
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:04:00.240]   Paul calls it evil work. They're dogs. They're outside. So Paul says, "We're doing this so that
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:09.360]   you have an occasion to be proud of us and give an answer to those who are trying to destroy you
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:19.200]   with lies, false doctrine." Paul, again, is struggling because
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:26.320]   it's very difficult for him to defend himself. In chapter 10 of this same epistle, verse 18, he said,
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.080]   "It is not he who commends himself that is approved, but he
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:37.440]   whom the Lord commends." He would much rather let the Lord commend him, back to 1 Corinthians 4:4,
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:44.560]   in the day when the Lord makes that final determination. But for the sake of the church,
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:52.000]   he understands, "You've got to defend me. For your sake, you've got to defend me, or you're
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.720]   going to be overrun by false teachers." And this presupposes that he has a life worth defending.
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.920]   "You know Me.
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.020]   I'm not commending Myself again to you.
[00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:13.440]   I'm just saying what I'm saying here and now so that I can arm you to defend Me for your
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.920]   own sake against the false teachers."
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.000]   This is so sound.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.380]   I can't argue with my enemies.
[00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.740]   I can't argue with my enemies who are bent on my ruin, Paul says.
[00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.620]   I can't do that.
[00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.000]   But you can.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.780]   You can be my defender.
[00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.080]   They're going to see this as just self-defense.
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.240]   They're not going to give in to me.
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.560]   They're after me.
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.100]   But you can do it.
[00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.640]   You can defend my integrity.
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:49.380]   I want you to be proud of us, proud in the sense of defending Him.
[00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:50.940]   You take up my cause.
[00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.880]   You answer my detractors, because it's for your sakes.
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.160]   It's for the sake of the life of the church.
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.320]   Chapter 12, verse 11.
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.300]   He says, "I should have been commended by you.
[00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.760]   By now there shouldn't be any questions about my integrity.
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:06.720]   You lived with Me.
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.720]   You saw it."
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:16.980]   He even goes so far as to say, "I know I'm an apostle come lately, but in no way am I
[00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.840]   less than the most eminent apostle.
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.260]   You know that.
[00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.000]   You should be commending Me.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.020]   You should be giving an answer to those who take pride in appearance and not in heart."
[00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:36.860]   "You know the truth about Me."
[00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:44.820]   Paul is asking his friends to protect themselves, the church.
[00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:53.760]   Anybody who's in the ministry is frightened of attacks and assaults and accusations that
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:57.220]   undermine their ministry.
[00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:58.720]   Because then that affects them.
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:04.120]   That's those to whom they minister.
[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:09.840]   Paul had a concern for the church, and he knew the church was under attack all the time
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:16.620]   from everywhere as Satan and demons, false teachers amassed the weapons against him.
[00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:21.200]   He was the main target.
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:27.420]   You've got to defend me, and you have enough information to do that, or you're going to
[00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:28.420]   find yourself overrun.
[00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:31.320]   You're going to find yourself overrun with error.
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:36.700]   So it was his reverence for the Lord, and it was his concern for the church; and then
[00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:39.420]   thirdly, his devotion to the truth.
[00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:43.880]   This is another motivation in verse 13.
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:50.020]   This is a very interesting verse: "For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God; if
[00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:54.620]   we are of sound mind, it is for you."
[00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:58.120]   There was an accusation that started basically with John the Baptist.
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:02.960]   Church people started on John the Baptist, and they said about John the Baptist that
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:12.980]   he's demon-possessed because of his preaching, because of the way he functioned and operated.
[00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:13.980]   He's demon-possessed.
[00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:20.860]   They said about Jesus, he's demon-possessed.
[00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:23.700]   They said he's drunk.
[00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:27.820]   In Mark 3:21 they said about Jesus, "He has lost his mind."
[00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:31.800]   He's lost his senses.
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:39.980]   This is a criticism that John the Baptist, Jesus, and even the apostle Paul received.
[00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:50.700]   In the book of Acts, chapter 26, verse 24, Paul was giving a defense to Festus, and Festus,
[00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:56.660]   while he was giving his defense, said in a loud voice, "Paul, you are out of your mind.
[00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:57.520]   Your great learning is driving you astray.
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:00.580]   It's driving you mad."
[00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:06.080]   But Paul said, "I'm not out of my mind, most excellent Festus, but I utter words of sober
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.720]   truth."
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:11.460]   And there's the third motive: devotion to the truth.
[00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:16.760]   "If we are beside ourselves, it is for God."
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.020]   I'm dealing with a message from God.
[00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:21.960]   What do you mean, "if we are beside ourselves"?
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:27.220]   Literally means to be ex - it's the verb "to be" and "ex," to be out of being.
[00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:29.480]   To be out of your mind.
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:34.740]   To be insane, to be mad.
[00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:41.060]   In fact, another word that Paul uses to describe this accusation against him is the word "foolishness."
[00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:42.680]   Preaching the cross is foolishness.
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:46.800]   In 2 Corinthians he uses that word "foolishness" over and over again.
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:52.040]   They accuse me of foolishness, foolishness.
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.060]   Here was Paul.
[00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:54.060]   He came preaching.
[00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:55.060]   He came preaching Christ.
[00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:56.920]   He came preaching the cross.
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:59.720]   They said it was foolishness.
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.600]   They said he was so zealous.
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:02.660]   He was so passionate.
[00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:05.240]   He was a man who was mentally deranged.
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:06.480]   He was out of his mind.
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:12.160]   He was insane, not in some technical or clinical sense, but because the zeal and passion which
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.740]   motivated this man was beyond sensibility.
[00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:18.380]   I mean, he would let himself be stoned.
[00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:21.120]   He would end up being beaten, whipped.
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:25.160]   All kinds of things would come against him.
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:26.620]   He had to be a man who'd lost his mind.
[00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:32.120]   He just couldn't seem to pull himself under control, put himself in jeopardy.
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.740]   He put his life in jeopardy on a daily basis.
[00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:38.980]   Can't you tone it down?
[00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:44.120]   But he says if we are beside ourselves, if we go outside the normal boundaries of communication,
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:46.300]   it's for God.
[00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:47.300]   It's for God.
[00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:48.540]   "Why am I enthusiastic?
[00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:49.540]   Why am I zealous?
[00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:51.300]   Why am I passionate?
[00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:56.320]   Because I want to give to God the whole heart and soul and body in the proclamation of divine
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.920]   truth."
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:05.760]   Back in chapter 4, verse 13, he says, "I believed, therefore I spoke."
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:08.680]   It's for God.
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:12.220]   Now if you meet me somewhere out in the patio and I have a conversation with you, I probably
[00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:17.640]   won't talk to you like this.
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:19.880]   But this is not about you, and this is not about me.
[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:23.640]   This is about God.
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:26.020]   The reception of that truth was dependent on God.
[00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:31.020]   It was dependent on being believed, and he believed it, and he respected it, and he knew
[00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:39.840]   he was called by God to proclaim it, and his heart was driven by the passion of this truth.
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:46.880]   If I seem like a fanatic, it's because I have a word from God.
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:51.960]   I have a word from God.
[00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:54.960]   Why do I want to maintain integrity?
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:55.720]   Because I'm a worshiper of God.
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:12:01.380]   And I don't want to dishonor that, because I love the church, and I want the church to
[00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:06.420]   continue to hear only the truth and be protected from error, and because I'm telling you the
[00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:08.220]   truth from heaven.
[00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:13.220]   Do you understand what a gift this is?
[00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:19.080]   So if we are beside ourselves, it is for God; but on the other hand, if we're of sound mind,
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.080]   it's for you.
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:23.840]   "I can also cool down and have a conversation," he says.
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:25.420]   "If I moderate.
[00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:34.300]   A little more sober-minded, sofraneo, a little calm, collected, meek, humble, restrained,
[00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:38.120]   it's for you."
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.120]   I don't want to be proud.
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.060]   I don't want to be pompous.
[00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:44.960]   I don't want to be some kind of an explosive personality.
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:50.020]   I don't want to be bombastic and pompous in the defense of myself.
[00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:55.120]   But I'll tell you, when I get up and I speak for God, it's coming with passion and zeal.
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:13:01.560]   But when I talk to you about me, it's more a conversation.
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:07.340]   For God's sake, when dealing with divine truth, He was full of passion, because the truth
[00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:11.740]   was so critical, so absolutely necessary.
[00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:20.720]   But for His own sake, He's meek and humble and modest and moderate, as He talks about
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:24.820]   the fact that He wants them to defend Him.
[00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:27.760]   For the sake of the truth.
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.060]   But it was always about the truth.
[00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:32.460]   It was always the truth.
[00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:37.300]   He would have a calm conversation with them so that he could continue to passionately
[00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:43.220]   preach the truth.
[00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:49.240]   Paul was motivated by reverence for the Lord, concern for the church, devotion to the truth.
[00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:54.520]   And a final thing - this is where we've been going, and I want you to grasp this - the
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:59.300]   final thing was gratitude for the Savior, gratitude for the Savior.
[00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:03.700]   Fourteen and fifteen: "For the love of Christ controls us, having concluded this, that one
[00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:06.620]   died for all, therefore all died.
[00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:10.900]   And He died for all, so that they who live might no longer live for themselves, but for
[00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:13.820]   Him who died and rose again on their behalf."
[00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:21.600]   You just read two verses that you could write a thousand-page book on.
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.220]   The doctrine is so vast.
[00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:37.780]   And here this massive doctrinal issue pops up in a simple set of words in which he is
[00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:44.020]   explaining his own personal integrity.
[00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:50.040]   What do you mean, the gratitude for the Savior?
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:53.920]   Look at what he says: "For the love of Christ controls us."
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:15:00.320]   The greatest motive, the highest motive, the noblest motive is the love of Christ.
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.460]   That's what controls us.
[00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:06.800]   He's not talking about his love for Christ; it's Christ's love for him.
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:19.900]   The love of Christ to him controls him, constrains him, motivates him, rules him, dominates him.
[00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:23.620]   The verb means a pressure that creates an action.
[00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:31.940]   He's defending his integrity because he is compelled by the love that Christ has for
[00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:33.920]   him.
[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:39.660]   Now, think about that.
[00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:43.420]   That should be true of every believer, should it not?
[00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:51.820]   Are we motivated to holiness and faithfulness because we understand how Christ loves us?
[00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:52.320]   Charles Hodge wrote, "A Christian is one who believes in God and believes in the Lord.
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:52.740]   He is not a Christian who believes in God and believes in the Lord.
[00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:53.320]   He is a Christian who believes in God and believes in the Lord.
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:58.040]   He is one who recognizes Jesus as the Christ, the Son of the living God, as God manifested
[00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:03.260]   in the flesh, loving us and dying for our redemption, and who is so affected by a sense
[00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:08.720]   of the love of this incarnate God as to be constrained to make the will of Christ, the
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:12.680]   rule of His obedience and the glory of Christ the great end for which He lives."
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:15.900]   The man who does this perfectly is a perfect Christian.
[00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:20.780]   The man who does it imperfectly, yet with a sincere desire to be entirely devoted to
[00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:23.020]   Christ is a sincere Christian.
[00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:28.520]   On the other hand, the man who lives for himself, his family, science, the world, mankind,
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:30.960]   or whatever, is not a Christian.
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:37.620]   The great question, says Hodge, is: "What constitutes a Christian?"
[00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:42.460]   The answer: "It is being so constrained by a sense of the love of our divine Lord that
[00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:46.260]   we concentrate our whole lives on Him."
[00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:52.200]   Well, Paul loved the Lord because the Lord first loved him.
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:52.720]   But he had come to a conclusion.
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:56.660]   He had come to a conclusion that is beyond just a simple understanding of that.
[00:16:56.660 --> 00:17:03.460]   "For the love of Christ controls us, having concluded - " this is what grabs me, he says
[00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:09.960]   - "that one died for all."
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:12.460]   Greater love has no man than this, that a man - what?
[00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:13.720]   - lay down his life for his friends.
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:22.420]   So I concluded that one died for all.
[00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:29.260]   Just in a general sense, he could be saying, "Well, one died for all," as contrasted to
[00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:34.600]   many animals dying for a few people, one person dies for all.
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:38.480]   He could be saying, "We don't need any more daily sacrifices."
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.360]   But that's really not his point.
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:47.140]   He says here, "One died for all, huper ponton," in behalf of all, in the place of all, as
[00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:49.760]   a substitute for all.
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:52.120]   So what you have here then is the great truth of substitution.
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:54.180]   It's substitutionary death.
[00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:59.040]   Jesus dying in the place of all.
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:02.500]   That's in the Scripture: "Wounded for our transgressions, bruised for our iniquities,"
[00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:03.960]   Isaiah 53.
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:10.640]   All over the New Testament, He became sin for us at the end of this very chapter.
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:11.760]   He died for all.
[00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:12.760]   We understand that.
[00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:14.480]   He took the curse for us.
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:16.180]   But who is the all?
[00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:18.280]   And the all is the whole issue here.
[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:19.980]   Who is the all?
[00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:20.980]   One died for all.
[00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:21.820]   People say, "We died for the whole world."
[00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:28.580]   He died for the whole world, the whole world, really.
[00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:32.440]   And that was the highest motive for Paul, that he died for the whole world.
[00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:33.440]   That's not special.
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:40.620]   If he died for the whole world, then you're no different than anybody else, right?
[00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:46.820]   Maybe you ought to be more thankful to yourself for being wise enough to pull your direction,
[00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:48.940]   a salvation that was offered to the whole world.
[00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:51.520]   Or maybe you could thank the person that led you to Christ.
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:57.200]   But that is not on Paul's mind.
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:02.520]   When Paul says, "One died for all," he immediately defines what that means.
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:05.900]   "Therefore, all died."
[00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:10.760]   So who are the all for whom the one died?
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:12.600]   They are the ones who all died.
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:15.840]   Are you following me?
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.680]   One died for all, and who are the all?
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:19.800]   They're the all who died.
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:21.220]   So he died for the all who died.
[00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:24.360]   They're the all who died in him.
[00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:33.540]   And they didn't only die in him, but they live - verse 15 - because they died in him
[00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:37.760]   and rose again in him.
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:45.940]   You have just been introduced to one of the great doctrines of all the area of soteriology,
[00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:50.920]   the doctrine of particular redemption.
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:20:08.080]   He's not saying he died for the entire world of people, or all would have died in him,
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:12.920]   and all would have risen in him, and all would therefore be saved.
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:18.160]   You can call all the missionaries home, stop preaching, and we'll just look at our watch
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:19.920]   and hang around until we go to heaven, because there's nothing to do.
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:20.920]   It's not a big deal.
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:21.920]   It's not a big deal.
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:22.920]   He's not trying to say, "You know what?
[00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:23.920]   I'm a Christian."
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:24.920]   He's not trying to say, "You know what?
[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:25.920]   I'm a Christian."
[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:26.920]   He's not trying to say, "You know what?
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:27.920]   I'm a Christian."
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:28.920]   He's not trying to say, "You know what?
[00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:29.920]   I'm a Christian."
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:30.920]   He's not trying to say, "You know what?
[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:31.920]   I'm a Christian."
[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:32.920]   He's not trying to say, "You know what?
[00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:33.920]   I'm a Christian."
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:34.920]   He's not trying to say, "You know what?
[00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:35.920]   I'm a Christian."
[00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:36.920]   He's not trying to say, "You know what?
[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:37.920]   I'm a Christian."
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:38.920]   He's not trying to say, "You know what?
[00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:39.920]   I'm a Christian."
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:40.920]   He's not trying to say, "You know what?
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:41.920]   I'm a Christian."
[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:50.300]   Now, this is very personal, very personal.
[00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:54.300]   Paul is saying, "Look, you know what motivates me?
[00:20:54.300 --> 00:21:00.740]   God in eternity past determined out of His own sovereign love and grace that when His
[00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:11.340]   Son came into the world and died, me, Paul, formerly Saul, would die in Christ and rise
[00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:11.920]   in Christ."
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:20.160]   This is love.
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:25.580]   This is the sense in which the atonement is particular, specific.
[00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:30.600]   It isn't that Jesus died a potential death, and He did it for everybody in the planet
[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:35.420]   who's ever lived, and some people find out about it and access it.
[00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:40.600]   No, because His death was a death for sin.
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:41.340]   And all who died in Him died for Him.
[00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:48.940]   All who died in His death rose in His death and live in His life, rose from His death.
[00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:51.160]   Paul uses huper ponton .
[00:21:51.160 --> 00:22:03.380]   He died instead of, instead of, in the place of, as the substitute for me.
[00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:10.580]   The death of Christ was a death that provided salvation for the people who died.
[00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:10.580]   The death of Christ was a death that provided salvation for the people who died.
[00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:10.580]   The death of Christ was a death that provided salvation for the people who died.
[00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:10.760]   The death of Christ was a death that provided salvation for the people who died.
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:17.140]   the people who died in Him, who were in Him by divine decree.
[00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:22.620]   Look, the whole human race is united in Adam.
[00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:33.900]   So in Adam they all die and die and die - die spiritually, physically, eternally.
[00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:36.800]   The whole race, the unredeemed race is in it.
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:40.080]   There are only two men; everybody's in one of the two.
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:48.940]   The whole race is in Adam, except those who are in Christ.
[00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:57.340]   When Adam sinned, those who were in Adam went down with him.
[00:22:57.340 --> 00:23:04.240]   When Christ died, those who were in Christ went down into the grave with Him and came
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:09.400]   out to new life.
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:15.440]   "As in Adam all died, so in Christ those in Christ shall all be made alive."
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:19.020]   Adam's death was the death of his race.
[00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:23.360]   Christ's death was the death of His race, the death of His people.
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:35.180]   Paul is literally overwhelmed by the reality that he was, by God's sovereign grace, in
[00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:38.720]   Christ when Christ died and rose again.
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:42.180]   It was a real atonement.
[00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:43.600]   It was an actual offering.
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.700]   It was a satisfaction.
[00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:50.680]   It was not a potential; it was a real provision.
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:59.840]   Jesus actually paid the penalty for the sins of those whom God had chosen to be in Him
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:01.880]   in His death.
[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:05.920]   Amazing doctrine.
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:08.040]   Actual atonement.
[00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:21.320]   So Paul says, "This is so motivating that it's a trustworthy statement deserving full
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:22.320]   acceptance.
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:25.440]   Christ came into the world to save sinners, among whom I'm foremost.
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:31.180]   Yet for this reason I found mercy, so that in me as the foremost, Jesus Christ might demonstrate
[00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:34.360]   His perfect patience."
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:37.360]   Then he says, "Now unto the King eternal, immortal, and visible."
[00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:42.080]   And launches off into praise.
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:46.580]   I think motivation is when you begin to understand not that He died for everybody and you happen
[00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:54.300]   to get in on it, but motivation comes from the fact that you know He died for you, and
[00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:57.460]   you died in Him, and you rose in Him.
[00:24:57.460 --> 00:25:02.400]   God had already predetermined that from eternity past, and it was applied to you at the point
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:04.360]   that you believed.
[00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:06.360]   This is overwhelming.
[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:07.360]   Amen.
