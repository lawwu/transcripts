[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:08.440]   - Well, before I get started on introducing Scott,
[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.240]   I just wanna add my note of thanks to Alex.
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.080]   Just out of curiosity, raise your hand,
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.400]   how many people here fairly regularly visit the forum?
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.540]   So, looks like a roughly, I would say,
[00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.020]   half, maybe a little less.
[00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.320]   You know, we like to think we do good work
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.440]   at the Bogle Center and at this conference,
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.880]   but the forum is really where the bulk of the work
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.200]   gets done, it's where people come with their questions,
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.680]   some of them very easy, simple, basic questions,
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.520]   some of them more advanced questions,
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.720]   and it's where an enormous, an enormous amount
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.720]   of education gets done, thousands of posts a week,
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.920]   you know, tens of thousands of threads,
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.640]   most of which, or almost all of which,
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.640]   convey extremely useful information to ordinary investors
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.900]   like all of us, all of us here.
[00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.900]   So, again, a round of applause for Larry for, please,
[00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.400]   for making the forum the place that it is,
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.800]   because without him, it would be overrun with trolls.
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.960]   (audience applauding)
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.400]   'Cause that's the natural history of forums,
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.920]   you have to be constantly battling that entropy,
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.840]   and that's what Larry and Alex and Sue
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.000]   and their associates are doing.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.840]   Well, all right.
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.880]   30 years ago, I was a modestly bored neurologist
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.480]   scribbling about finance, not knowing that I would be
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.160]   spending the last half of my adult life doing it
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.920]   and writing about it, until I heard from Scott,
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.320]   who looked at a few of the things that I had written
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.320]   and said, you know, Bill, you write tolerably well,
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.240]   and you seem to be able to do the math,
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.880]   and that is a very useful combination.
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.600]   You actually have a future ahead of you
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.780]   in financial writing, so keep at it, Bill.
[00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.120]   And so I did, and it's largely thanks to Scott
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.040]   that I'm here talking to you tonight.
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.640]   Scott graduated MIT half a century ago,
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.800]   more than half a century ago.
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.240]   Used to, he tells me, amble over to Harvard
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.840]   to take lessons in writing from Archibald MacLeish,
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.680]   if you can remember who Archibald MacLeish was,
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.120]   very famous poet who fought in the First World War,
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.240]   among other things.
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:46.320]   And he, I believe, started out at the Boston Herald
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.120]   and then wound up at the Dallas Morning News,
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.200]   where he ran a syndicated columnist,
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.120]   hundreds of newspapers read by millions and millions
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.600]   of people, a well-beloved financial writer.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.560]   But more importantly than that, he did important stuff.
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.520]   He wrote a very influential book
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.200]   called The Coming Generational Storm
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.960]   with economist Larry Kotlikoff,
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.720]   and even more important than that,
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.560]   he wrote a white paper for, I believe,
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.240]   it's the National Center for Policy Analysis,
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.840]   Reinventing Retirement Income in America,
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.960]   which is one of the major reasons
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.760]   why so many millions of Americans
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.760]   now have default options in their 401(k) plans
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.760]   of target-gate funds.
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.080]   And if that's not a major accomplishment,
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.280]   I don't know what is.
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.720]   But even more famously than that,
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.440]   he's the inventor of the couch potato portfolio.
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.400]   And there's a very famous story
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.880]   about the financial theorist, Harry Markowitz,
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.640]   who knew about more assembling efficient portfolios
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.280]   than anybody else on the planet.
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.920]   And when Jason Zweig asked him for The Wall Street Journal,
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.160]   how he designed his portfolio, he said,
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.480]   "Well, something like, you know,
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.400]   "I want to minimize regret.
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.120]   "I'm going to split things 50/50,
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.840]   "so I own half stocks and half bonds."
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.800]   And it fell to Scott to define what that portfolio was
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.400]   for millions of people.
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.040]   A very successful portfolio, indeed it is.
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.280]   So without further ado,
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.280]   I'd like to ask Scott to come up and address you all.
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.520]   (audience applauding)
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.440]   - You only need to read one of Bill's things
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.320]   to know that this guy is a wonderful writer,
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.080]   and I like wonderful writers.
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:46.200]   And you also realize that he's a guy
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.440]   who is blissfully unaware of just how smart he is.
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.600]   And that's very rare.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.560]   And when you combine it with actual humility,
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.960]   that's totally rare.
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.800]   So I hope I won't disappoint you
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.040]   after that introduction.
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:13.040]   'Cause I'll just tell you a story to assure you
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.280]   that I am a callow, ink-stained wretch.
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.560]   Okay?
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.520]   Just before we go any further.
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.080]   Last weekend, I was in Boston with my wife.
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.120]   We'd been on a St. Lawrence Seaway cruise
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.600]   that ended in Boston.
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:35.480]   My friend on the cruise was eager to go
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.600]   to Harvard Square and see it.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.520]   And of course, decided that I was the appropriate guide.
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:47.520]   So I took him and his wife, and my wife,
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:54.280]   and we took the MTA, best way to see Boston
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.680]   is to go over the salt and pepper shakers
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.120]   into MIT and then on to Harvard.
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.000]   But it was a really unnerving experience
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.480]   because it had changed so much.
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:13.040]   I would like to have shown him, for instance,
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:17.400]   the little bar where Matt Damon
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.360]   got Minnie Driver's phone number,
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.880]   even though he was a Southie from Boston.
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.960]   But it's not there anymore.
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.360]   The Club 47 on Mount Auburn Street,
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.080]   which is where Joan Baez, Bob Dylan,
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.200]   and Tom Rush got their starts,
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.360]   it is not, there's nothing there anymore.
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.920]   There's a plaque on the wall, and next to it,
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:47.120]   there's a window that's filled with restaurant,
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.080]   you know, disposable supplies.
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.280]   And I have fond memories of that place,
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:55.280]   including one where I was walking with a friend
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.480]   and wanted to go in, and was about to go in,
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.160]   my friend, who was an aspirant poet,
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.120]   grabbed me and said, "Hey, Scott, I can't go in there."
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.320]   I said, "Well, why, Roger?"
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.560]   And he said, "Well, I'm a known dealer."
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.560]   (audience laughing)
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:17.480]   There were a lot of times in Harvard Square
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.000]   that were very interesting.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.520]   But I also have wonderful memories of Jack Bogle.
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:27.360]   One of them was, he appeared at a Cebu meeting,
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.640]   and that's the Society of American Business Editors
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.880]   and Writers, I can't remember what city it was in,
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:37.040]   but he opened his talk by saying,
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.720]   "Well, since we last met, I've had a change of heart."
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:45.720]   And you knew immediately that that was a very prepared line,
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.760]   and he was really, really grateful
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.680]   that he had a new heart that worked.
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.320]   But he made a wonderful presentation,
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:57.240]   including the discussion of the three factors
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:01.400]   that determine the future rates of return on stocks.
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:05.160]   And he was dour about the possibilities,
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:10.160]   which was proof that anticipating the future
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.480]   is very difficult,
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.600]   because he actually turned out to be wrong,
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.560]   even though the equation was wonderful.
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:20.080]   I also remember interviewing him,
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:23.280]   and there's just a peculiar thing.
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:26.640]   He had a mild scent of whiskey.
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:31.600]   This is usually a scent that I don't find attractive.
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:38.320]   But he wore it like a gentleman's aftershave
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.760]   that you could get from Penhaligon.
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:43.160]   There was just something wonderful about it.
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:46.280]   And I don't know, I just found him to be
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:50.960]   a very magnetic guy, I think for all the reasons
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.600]   that he is so admired.
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:57.400]   He really was very serious about being the investor's friend,
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.600]   and he was a titan.
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:06.080]   But if we're being grateful for Jack Bogle,
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:09.920]   there are other reasons to be grateful here as well.
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:14.880]   One of them is for the existence of Morningstar.
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:20.600]   And I'll give you some very specifics for me in a moment.
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:25.600]   But he made a, in retrospect, simple decision
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:31.400]   that the consumer was the ultimate customer.
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:35.960]   Earlier, I was having a senior moment
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.280]   trying to remember the original company
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:41.680]   that gave all the facts and figures on mutual funds.
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:44.400]   And I couldn't remember it.
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.760]   Christine couldn't remember it.
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.280]   Bill Bernstein could.
[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:49.600]   It was Lipper.
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.720]   But does anyone remember Lipper?
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:57.520]   Okay, a few, but they sold their information
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:02.520]   strictly to mutual funds who could use it for benchmarking.
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:06.000]   Mensuedo, with that simple decision,
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.480]   moved things in a direction toward consumers
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:13.200]   and started the ball rolling for us being
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.760]   do-it-yourself investors.
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:19.160]   He also made the wonderful decision to hire people
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.840]   who actually wrote in English
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:25.600]   and thought in English as opposed to numbers,
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.480]   which was a great benefit.
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:32.480]   For me, the real start as a journalist
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:38.720]   was the time when Morningstar's database
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:42.880]   and screening software was put on floppy disks.
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:46.120]   And they were such a small company at that time
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:49.920]   that they had it distributed through Business Week.
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.560]   But you could pay for that.
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:56.560]   And all of a sudden, I had a tool that I could use
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:58.600]   that others could use.
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:03.600]   So I could do research on mutual funds and write about it,
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:10.680]   and knowing that my readers could verify it.
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:13.600]   And that was a sea change.
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:18.160]   It meant that I was no longer like a reporter
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:22.240]   at a press conference where you are led by the nose
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:25.280]   by people who are on message all the time
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.920]   and who control all the information.
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:32.920]   I had information that I could use, sort,
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:35.880]   and make different queries about.
[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:40.880]   It changed my ability to address an audience.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   So I would like to just go on with some other
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.240]   sometimes impolite observations.
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:58.200]   We're now in a position where the towers of Babel out there,
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:02.320]   and we've become a gigantic tower of Babel.
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.080]   They all have a lot of messages.
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.560]   They're all loud distractions.
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:07.840]   They agree on nothing.
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:10.080]   They just have a common theme.
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:13.960]   And that theme is that it's important now to do something.
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:18.480]   And everything depends on this hour, this minute.
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:22.120]   And you should buy, you should sell, you should do something.
[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:25.320]   But I've gathered some information
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:27.920]   on the unimportance of elections.
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:31.280]   This is from an investment manager named David Bainson,
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:34.000]   and he noted these findings recently.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.880]   One, energy was the best performing sector under Obama.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   Despite his constant attacks on energy.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.160]   Technology was the best performing sector under Trump.
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:52.480]   Also, despite his constant attacks on technology.
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:57.600]   The equity market rose in all eight years under Obama,
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.240]   in spite of his being a pinky como, you know what.
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:06.480]   And the equity market rose 70% under Trump despite COVID.
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:09.440]   Markets, in fact, generally,
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:13.280]   but not always, rise under both parties.
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:16.360]   Of course, that doesn't mean they're both good things.
[00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:18.080]   It just means they're things.
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:22.080]   There's another fact that isn't discussed,
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:25.240]   and that's that under both parties,
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:26.880]   the government debt rises,
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:31.720]   and they have a great agreement
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:34.080]   that they won't talk about that topic
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.600]   in this content-free election period.
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:44.480]   So we can't do much about that.
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:49.320]   I've been a student of Social Security for a long time.
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:52.480]   I researched my first book in the late '60s.
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:57.480]   It was published by Doubleday in 1972,
[00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:02.760]   which is a year before the first CFP degree was given out,
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:06.480]   and it was based on Modigliani's Life Cycle Hypothesis,
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.520]   and I was really interested in biology
[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:10.440]   and human creatures, and still am.
[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:21.680]   It was well-received, never became a paperback,
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:26.080]   which is my notion of how a book should be.
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.800]   If you're successful with a book,
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:32.280]   it goes beyond hardcover and gets to have a paperback,
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:37.280]   but as a journalist, I had different opportunities
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:43.600]   for writing papers, and my first paper on Social Security
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:50.360]   appeared in a very well-known journal called Playboy,
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:55.200]   and the story for how this happened
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:58.640]   is that Esquire magazine solicited me
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:01.640]   to write an article about personal bankruptcy,
[00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:03.840]   'cause they really had in mind an article
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:08.040]   that was even happening to executives, God forbid,
[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:12.680]   and I researched the article and wrote it,
[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:16.360]   but I decided that the data didn't show that.
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:21.240]   It was all wrong, and so I wrote an article
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:24.040]   on bankruptcy as a political act,
[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:29.040]   and tons of people going and declaring personal bankruptcy
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:34.760]   deliberately just before the then-coming presidential race.
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:41.440]   Well, Esquire didn't like that, wasn't their idea,
[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:46.440]   so they sent a kill fee, and I redirected the article
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:49.960]   to my column in Boston magazine,
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:53.440]   and then Playboy called Boston
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:56.680]   and wanted an article on bankruptcy,
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:00.440]   so I wrote the article, researched it,
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:05.040]   and it appeared in Playboy, and that's, you know,
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:10.040]   you would think that an idea like let's do nothing
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:15.360]   and let's be slothful would be really popular.
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:18.640]   You know, people would immediately grasp it,
[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:22.700]   but it's not, it's a slow idea,
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:28.000]   and I'll give you some ideas about it.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.440]   Earlier this year, I think it was in January or February,
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:34.640]   John Reckenthaler, who was writing I also love,
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:37.440]   he noted that index funds now account
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.860]   for half of all fund assets.
[00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:44.320]   That means they've removed hundreds of billions,
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.920]   I guess at this point trillions,
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:50.040]   from active asset management.
[00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:53.520]   Now, that can't happen overnight,
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:56.240]   but it's taken half a century,
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:17:01.260]   so I want to give you some kind of relative measures.
[00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:06.400]   Scholars tend to choose Charles Ellison's The Loser's Game
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:11.400]   in 1973 as the kind of bellwether thing
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:15.200]   on how professional managers can't beat the market
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:16.720]   because they were the market.
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:25.040]   I had a different vehicle of recognition.
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:29.440]   It was two double pages in The Wall Street Journal
[00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:32.720]   under the title Portfolios Without Managers,
[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:35.160]   in which a data freak at a newspaper company
[00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:38.160]   called Media General used computers
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:43.160]   to effectively create the millions of monkeys
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:46.280]   that would eventually write Shakespeare
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:48.640]   or manage a decent portfolio.
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:50.560]   You just had to pick the right monkey.
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:54.320]   Though that exercise routinely showed
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:18:00.480]   that the S&P 500 was at about the 70th percentile
[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:06.920]   from the top and that most of the funds,
[00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:12.080]   managed funds, were under the 50th percentile.
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:14.760]   So that was a kind of constant message
[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:18.640]   that humiliated active managers.
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:24.360]   It didn't last long,
[00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:28.560]   and neither did the media general effort.
[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:33.560]   So let's get some idea of just how slow this slow idea is.
[00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:41.640]   I think you're all aware that you can't use
[00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:46.120]   the word index investing and viral in the same sentence
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:48.080]   'cause it definitely wasn't.
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:50.000]   But here are some halftimes
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.680]   on some popular consumer products.
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:57.360]   Homes with TV sets rose from nearly nothing in 1946
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:00.440]   to half of all homes by 1955.
[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.400]   That's less than a decade.
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:06.400]   Homes with electricity rose from 8% in 1907
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:10.960]   to 50% in 1925, a period of 18 years.
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:16.960]   About 8.4% of households owned a home computer in 1984.
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:22.120]   The figure rose to 53.6% by 2001, that's 17 years,
[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:26.640]   and 69.7% by 2003, 19 years.
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:29.000]   You notice that index investing
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.760]   isn't anywhere in that ballpark.
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:35.200]   Henry Ford started producing the Model T in 1918.
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:39.440]   By 1920, 20% of households owned cars.
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:42.880]   By 1929, 60%.
[00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:44.040]   So you might be asking,
[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:47.880]   was anything slower than index investing?
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:49.360]   And yes, there was.
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:52.600]   I can proudly announce that it was
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:55.560]   the Insinkerator Manufacturing Company.
[00:19:55.560 --> 00:20:01.680]   It was the first kitchen disposal maker established in 1938.
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:05.840]   The household ownership reached 50% in 2007,
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.780]   a period of 69 years.
[00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:13.220]   And that, I think, everyone who lives
[00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:16.660]   without city septic sewer service knows
[00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:21.660]   that the reason that was so slow was the septic pushback,
[00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:27.260]   which I think also applies to the septic pushback
[00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:31.820]   that has come from the financial services industry
[00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:35.540]   against funds.
[00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:39.240]   And they do it in different ways.
[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:43.940]   Again, they are masters of content-free discussion.
[00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:48.740]   They say, it's a stock picker's market.
[00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:50.200]   What does that mean?
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:54.120]   They say, it's not a buy and hold market.
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:58.180]   There's danger ahead.
[00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:00.020]   There's always danger ahead.
[00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:02.140]   Life is dangerous.
[00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:05.180]   Do you really wanna be just average?
[00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:07.700]   Well, if it beats everyone else, you bet.
[00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:09.780]   (audience laughing)
[00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:14.100]   So I'd like to share a few things
[00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:18.140]   that I've never written about because,
[00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:21.700]   well, they're just so outrageous.
[00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:27.640]   They might make me appear to be a very biased,
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:32.640]   anti-professional person, but here are a few of them.
[00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:39.500]   A PI guy, PR guy, who worked for a very large
[00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:41.420]   insurance company that had been formed
[00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:44.260]   by an American revolutionary.
[00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:47.820]   We won't name the company, just, it's in Boston.
[00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:50.220]   (audience laughing)
[00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:53.900]   I was recently in a pub in Boston
[00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:57.320]   where I could drink his beer cold
[00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:59.140]   and look across to the cemetery
[00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:03.180]   where his cold corpse was, and they advertise that fact.
[00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:07.840]   The PR guy said, but you know, Scott,
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:11.360]   really one of my jobs is to make sure
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:14.580]   some of our people never see the media
[00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:20.580]   because they were not people that should be seen.
[00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:22.900]   They weren't proud of them.
[00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:28.980]   PI guy, PR guy at another large institution,
[00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:33.160]   the Boston Safe Department and Trust,
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.980]   looked at me one day and said, Scott,
[00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:37.320]   the best thing that could happen to this building
[00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:40.060]   is that the top two floors could be blown away.
[00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:44.240]   And I kind of looked at that, and he was right.
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:46.160]   Two guys named Monk and Christian
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:49.960]   later made a takeover offer and the top two floors
[00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:52.960]   were, in effect, blown away, but unfortunately,
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:54.400]   they were not impoverished.
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:23:01.320]   Another guy who is the head of a trust operation
[00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:03.300]   for the largest bank in Boston.
[00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:09.440]   I had this experience 'cause a guy had negotiated
[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:12.640]   to write a newsletter for their advisory group
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:16.640]   and the many vice presidents kept shooting down
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:18.940]   everything that he did, and he thought
[00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:21.240]   I had enough credibility that I would be able
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:26.240]   to get by this army of vice presidents.
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:30.060]   And I had written a thing suggesting,
[00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:33.320]   okay, CD rates aren't very good now,
[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:36.520]   but treasury bills are much higher
[00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:39.880]   because of the way the return on treasury bills
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:42.780]   is calculated compared to CDs.
[00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:46.080]   And because they're from the treasury,
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:48.200]   you know, it didn't go on much further than that.
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:50.160]   And he looked at me and said,
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:53.880]   well, we really can't write that.
[00:23:56.260 --> 00:24:01.260]   That money that stays in the bank,
[00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:03.920]   all that goes straight to our bottom line.
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:09.100]   And I was biting my tongue, I wanted to say,
[00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:11.960]   can you spell fiduciary?
[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:17.340]   And I didn't 'cause I knew that was hopeless.
[00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:21.500]   And to give you another idea of just how tone deaf
[00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:25.520]   this trust operation was, they were called
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:30.520]   the first advisory, first,
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:34.440]   I can't remember, having a senior moment.
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:38.720]   But if you turn it into an acronym, it was Fiasco.
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:41.720]   (audience laughing)
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:48.160]   Early on, Ned Johnson, and I'll talk about him
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:51.320]   a little later in spite of the excoriations
[00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:53.120]   he received from Jack Bogle,
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:25:00.160]   asked me to help write the original discussions
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:03.360]   of the Fidelity Equity Income Fund,
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:06.540]   which is one of the first funds that sought
[00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:11.540]   a higher dividend yield than the S&P 500, but also growth.
[00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:16.680]   So I wrote that, and then years later,
[00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:20.760]   I go to interview the anointed prince
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:24.720]   who managed that fund very successfully, Bruce Johnston.
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:29.720]   I meet him at the Four Seasons in Irving, Texas.
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:33.520]   I always feel lucky when I'm in a Four Seasons,
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:34.820]   which isn't very often.
[00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:36.760]   So I was having breakfast with him,
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:41.400]   and his breakfast arrives, and he sends it back.
[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:45.240]   How many of you have ever sent a breakfast back
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:48.720]   from anywhere, let alone a Four Seasons?
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:53.720]   So I asked him, what is this all about?
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:57.400]   And he said, "Well, they didn't meet my requirements."
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:00.360]   I said, "Do you have a lot of requirements?"
[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:01.200]   (audience laughing)
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:03.080]   And he said, "Yes, I do."
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:06.600]   And I said, "Could I see them?"
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:11.440]   And he gave me two pages of typewritten requirements
[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:15.540]   for his princely presence.
[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:21.520]   And so, you know, that kind of made me think
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:25.120]   about, you know, that maybe egos get a little bit big
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:27.740]   in financial services if they don't start big.
[00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:35.160]   Another is an experience with Peter Lynch, revered figure.
[00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:39.680]   He published an article in Worth Magazine
[00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:44.180]   in which he declared, much like Dave Ramsey,
[00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:50.000]   that you could take 7% from your investments in stocks
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   and never run out of money, because stocks return 10%,
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.080]   and you reserve 3% for inflation and 7%.
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:04.340]   So at that time, which is around 1995,
[00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:07.640]   there wasn't the kinds of software we have now
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:09.760]   that you can get online.
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:13.900]   So I went and visited with a broker friend
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:19.580]   who had the American Funds software called Hypo,
[00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:23.480]   and we ran a number of examinations about, okay,
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:27.720]   how many people would survive at different rates?
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:32.720]   And, well, it turned out to be a disappointing number at 7%.
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.940]   I can't remember what it is,
[00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:37.380]   but the column is on my website.
[00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:43.580]   So then I called Lynch, and he was kind of flustered.
[00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:47.260]   And he said, "I checked it with our quant."
[00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:50.240]   I'll give you a message about quants in a moment.
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:55.980]   And it turned out, actually,
[00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:58.900]   that he hadn't written the article.
[00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:00.940]   It had been ghostwritten.
[00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:05.440]   And, you know, I don't know what Lynch did to check it,
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:09.760]   but there it was, making declarations that are impossible.
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:13.060]   So he was the first Dave Ramsey.
[00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:15.900]   (audience laughs)
[00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:20.480]   Then, I'll tell you,
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:26.140]   I had a contact over at Mass Financial Services,
[00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:29.820]   a major rival of Fidelity,
[00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:32.980]   and Roger asked,
[00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:36.780]   "Scott, would you write our shareholder report?"
[00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:40.700]   And I said, "Roger, you know, you got a whole staff here.
[00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:44.940]   "Why would you want me to write your annual report?"
[00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:51.840]   And he said, "Scott, if anyone on staff does it,
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:54.840]   "they'll just be torn apart by all the egos here.
[00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:59.260]   "They'll behave if they have an outsider."
[00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:05.440]   So I wrote their annual report for quite a number of years.
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:10.440]   Now, I learned a lot of things during that,
[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:14.460]   and one of them was about
[00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:17.420]   the Massachusetts Financial Services quant.
[00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:19.500]   They, like all firms, they had a guy
[00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:21.140]   who did all the numbers.
[00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:24.680]   But I had a Russian friend
[00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:30.700]   who took care of their computer equipment.
[00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:32.300]   His name was Yuri.
[00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:36.500]   He was a physicist who worked in programming
[00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:38.040]   for Russian weapons.
[00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:42.460]   He wanted to take the opportunity to leave Russia
[00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:46.940]   and said so, and they said, "Fine, Yuri,
[00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:49.140]   "but you'll have to stay here
[00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:52.440]   "until your knowledge is out of date."
[00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:55.780]   So he worked for six years as a masseur
[00:29:55.780 --> 00:30:00.220]   before his knowledge was out of date,
[00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:03.860]   then came right over and got a job working with Otto Eckstein,
[00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:06.380]   one of the first big data providers.
[00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:09.320]   Then he went on to consulting things,
[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:11.640]   and he was taking care of the digital equipment
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:14.940]   that Mass Financial Services had.
[00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:18.980]   And what he found was that the quant at Mass Financial,
[00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:23.220]   his major use of the digital equipment computer
[00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:26.740]   was for all the calculations he was making
[00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:29.400]   for doing the Bermuda race in his sailboat.
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:37.180]   While I was in Boston, we were there on a Sunday,
[00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:39.880]   and it was sad, 'cause we were just around the corner
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:42.840]   from the Cafe Marleya, and some of you may remember
[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:46.200]   that was a scene in the Thomas Crown Affair.
[00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:52.160]   Well, my memorable time from that
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:54.220]   is I had lunch with Ned Johnson there.
[00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:58.280]   We were both downtown on a Saturday.
[00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:00.200]   I think we were both bachelor boys.
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:01.340]   My wife was on the Cape.
[00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:03.600]   His wife was probably in Nahant.
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:05.940]   And so there we were, and Ned said,
[00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:07.280]   "All right, let's go have lunch."
[00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:12.280]   So we did, and I took the opportunity to ask,
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:17.880]   "You know, Ned, you got, most of your funds
[00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:20.100]   "have their annual meetings here in Boston,
[00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:23.660]   "but the others, like the older funds,
[00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:28.380]   "Trend and so forth, they have their meetings in Miami.
[00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:31.280]   "What's, why?"
[00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:35.160]   He said, "Well, Scott, funds have a life cycle,
[00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:40.700]   "and as funds age, their shareholders age,
[00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:43.320]   "and that's where the shareholders are."
[00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:44.840]   And he said that, "You know, that's a problem,
[00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:48.680]   "'cause that money eventually will leave."
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:54.960]   And Ned was one of these kind of perverse thinkers
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:59.700]   who is always looking for a contrary thing,
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:04.160]   and I think it was 10 years later,
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:08.800]   I'm going to a meeting at the Dallas Country Club
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:12.640]   where Fidelity announced the introduction
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:14.540]   of the first charitable gift fund.
[00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:19.060]   Johnson had finally found the solution
[00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:21.120]   to the problem of asset runoff.
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:25.100]   "You can die, but leave your money behind,
[00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:27.700]   "and everything will be fine, at least for Fidelity.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   "You might be dead, but, you know, that happens."
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:39.080]   And you may wonder, I am a lowly journalist,
[00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:41.360]   how would I have contact with Ned Johnson?
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:42.440]   Well, it turns out, you know,
[00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:45.120]   this is a small, really weird world.
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:49.120]   We had two acquaintances in common.
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:52.240]   One was a manic-depressive sculptor
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:56.840]   whose grandfather was head of the New York Stock Exchange,
[00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:59.480]   and the other was a Buddhist,
[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:03.400]   head of the San Francisco Zen Center, named Richard Baker,
[00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:05.040]   both of whom had gone to Harvard,
[00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:08.580]   and Harvard has a lot of strange people.
[00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:15.800]   So when our mutual friend was in a manic state,
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:19.920]   he would call, create a foundation,
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:23.840]   and he would call Ned and a fellow named Jim Storey
[00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:28.840]   at one of the larger law firms that ran money, and me.
[00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:33.800]   The only reason he would have called me
[00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:37.880]   is that I figured out an equitable divorce formula
[00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:40.920]   for him and his wife, who were both friends.
[00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:47.840]   But I would watch him try to get some money from them
[00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:53.240]   to support his manic idea, of which he had many,
[00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:59.240]   and the other connection, Baker.
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:06.760]   Baker, some of you may know, he's the Roshi
[00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:09.520]   who was kicked out of the San Francisco Zen Center
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:13.640]   after he failed to recognize where his wife ended
[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:15.700]   and Paul Hawkins' wife began.
[00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:25.200]   So I am quite accustomed to the weirdness of we humans,
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:33.260]   and one of the things that I think is wonderful
[00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:36.480]   about this group, and I really wish I'd been here
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:39.700]   participating in it earlier, longer,
[00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:46.440]   is I think everyone here has a sense
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:49.560]   that money just has a place.
[00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:54.560]   It is not everything, and I think everyone here
[00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:58.440]   is wise enough to know that if a problem
[00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:03.400]   can be solved with money, it's not a real problem.
[00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:05.960]   The problems that get us are the ones
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:08.520]   that tear our hearts out, and they have nothing
[00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:12.780]   to do with money, so anyway, that's a, sorry.
[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:19.560]   Let's go a little further into why the media
[00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:22.600]   and financial services are a problem.
[00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:27.480]   Transactions are the lifeblood of financial services.
[00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:32.200]   Without transactions, they don't got no money.
[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:36.360]   They can't pay their Mercedes payments.
[00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:41.720]   That's why they need shifts in strategy,
[00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:44.240]   they need reasons to change, et cetera.
[00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:47.960]   There's an unholy alliance with media
[00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:52.960]   because media, any media, needs change
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:58.840]   to justify tomorrow's edition.
[00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:03.840]   That includes newspapers, it includes magazines, et cetera,
[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:10.360]   and if you look at the movement of communications
[00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:14.240]   over the last 30 years, it's a declining spiral.
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:19.240]   You compare books to newspapers and magazines,
[00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:21.880]   then compare newspapers and magazines
[00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:26.880]   to articles on the web, then compare the web
[00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:32.540]   to Instagram and other more transient forms,
[00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:40.120]   and it's this decreasing spiral of content.
[00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:44.520]   Just getting worse and worse.
[00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:51.520]   So the business responds to a threat.
[00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:58.960]   The threat is how can they respond to index funds,
[00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:05.320]   and they have this wonderful idea,
[00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:11.400]   well, mutual funds, index funds are popular.
[00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:16.440]   Let them have lots of them, and that's what they've done.
[00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:18.160]   They've done what law firms do
[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:20.560]   when they want to bury small firms.
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:22.320]   They bury them in discovery.
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:27.320]   So we are buried as consumers in a surfeit of indexes,
[00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:34.180]   most of which, many of them are entirely useless.
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:39.080]   I think we've had statistics like this earlier today,
[00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:42.120]   but between the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ,
[00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:44.840]   there are 5,700 traded stocks,
[00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:49.280]   but they've been used to create 3,300 ETFs
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:51.600]   and over 7,000 mutual funds,
[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:56.040]   and that, of course, includes some bond funds,
[00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:58.840]   so it's an exaggeration, but they've made
[00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:03.840]   kind of more funds than the church has saints.
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:15.960]   They've also gone on to create a whole bunch
[00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:20.800]   of other diversions that keep us from the main message,
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:22.360]   lifecycle funds.
[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:24.200]   All the research on lifecycle funds
[00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:27.860]   shows that their only benefit, which is a major one,
[00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:30.800]   is that they keep people from making a lot of transactions,
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:32.120]   so they're good in that sense,
[00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:36.040]   but every bit of research shows that A,
[00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:40.060]   there's no agreed way to invest.
[00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:42.000]   All the formulas are different.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:48.120]   You can go down, you can go up, you can stay constant,
[00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:51.080]   but it really doesn't have much effect.
[00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:56.840]   WRAP accounts, another way of disguising taking fees.
[00:38:56.840 --> 00:39:00.300]   Equity index funds from insurance companies.
[00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:03.620]   That's a formula for playing three-card monte
[00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:07.780]   with an actuary, you're just not gonna win.
[00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:10.720]   Alternative asset classes in pension funds.
[00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:15.700]   The Texas Teachers' Pension now has about 40%
[00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:18.460]   of its assets in alternative assets,
[00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:20.660]   all of which extracts higher fees,
[00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:22.460]   and they're doing this from people
[00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:26.140]   who report themselves to be quite smart,
[00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:28.300]   so why are they doing it?
[00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:31.580]   It doesn't make sense.
[00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:37.580]   We now are getting alternative asset classes in 401(k) funds.
[00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:40.260]   Then there's direct investing, I mean, excuse me,
[00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:43.420]   direct indexing, which has been discussed today,
[00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:45.500]   and of course, we have this movement
[00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:50.120]   toward getting life annuities in 401(k) and 403(b) plans,
[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:55.420]   and that's without going to the fact
[00:39:55.420 --> 00:40:00.420]   that if you go to a fidelity advisor,
[00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:05.520]   he will sell you an annuity product of some kind,
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:06.700]   whether you need it or not.
[00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:09.620]   Friend of mine's a recently retired Delta pilot,
[00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:14.100]   has a military pension, he has social security,
[00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:17.820]   he has a ton of cash, he owns his house free and clear,
[00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:22.700]   and he goes to this fidelity representative,
[00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:25.120]   and he wants him to buy an annuity.
[00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:31.120]   You know, like, this guy is very conservative,
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:34.000]   except he still flies.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:42.320]   He has a low-wing experimental plane,
[00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:47.600]   and we're gonna fly to Lajitas outside of Big Bend,
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:52.880]   where I want to interview the goat
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:54.800]   that is the mayor of Lajitas,
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:58.200]   and then interview the statue of Robert E. Lee
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:02.360]   that was taken out of Dallas and moved to Lajitas,
[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:06.240]   so I want to start, see if I can start a movement
[00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:11.240]   toward gathering all the forbidden statues in one place
[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:14.940]   so we can visit them.
[00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:21.740]   Not sure how that column will be received.
[00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:24.900]   (audience laughing)
[00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:29.340]   The other major problem we have is that, you know,
[00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:33.260]   we are wired to want a yes or no answer,
[00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:39.780]   and there's any number of sociopaths
[00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:42.940]   who will be delighted to give us our yes or no answer
[00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:44.020]   with great confidence.
[00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:46.820]   Yes, I can do that for you, yes,
[00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:48.940]   and you will have a superior performance.
[00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:50.700]   We have the smartest people.
[00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:53.480]   Convinced?
[00:41:53.480 --> 00:42:00.020]   The trouble is that all the answers that we look for,
[00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:01.940]   and that was made evident in the discussion
[00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:06.180]   of portfolio survivor rates today,
[00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:10.100]   are mushy, they're probabilistic.
[00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:13.860]   That was the great thing that Bill Bengen introduced.
[00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:16.060]   You know, he brought people up to date
[00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:22.580]   with data that actually showed how things performed.
[00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:28.660]   And there, there's a story I like to tell.
[00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:31.160]   I call it the missing bullets problem.
[00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:35.380]   This is how things get misrepresented.
[00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:38.540]   During World War II, they were concerned during the war
[00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:41.900]   about the number of planes that were not coming back,
[00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:45.140]   so they gathered the military people
[00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:47.880]   and a bunch of mathematicians in a room,
[00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:51.820]   a hangar filled with airplanes,
[00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:55.500]   and they examined them, and counted the bullet holes,
[00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:57.220]   and looked at the areas where they found
[00:42:57.220 --> 00:43:00.660]   the most bullet holes, and they started discussing,
[00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:04.260]   well, we could add some armor here,
[00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:06.140]   and we could add some armor there.
[00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:08.860]   It might protect those places where the bullet holes are.
[00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:12.420]   Then a number of theorists, Abraham Wald came in,
[00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:15.300]   and he said, well, no, that's really not the answer.
[00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:17.820]   And they asked him why.
[00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:19.980]   He said, well, we need to know
[00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:22.240]   where the missing bullet holes are.
[00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:28.620]   And they looked at him, didn't quite understand.
[00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:32.420]   He said, well, if you assume that the bullets,
[00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:34.680]   holes are distributed randomly,
[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:40.580]   the missing bullet holes are the ones on the planes
[00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:45.580]   that didn't come back, and that actually is
[00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:53.140]   an example put into money management of survivor bias.
[00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:58.800]   If you're only counting a limited sample,
[00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:02.940]   you're not getting the real number,
[00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:06.440]   and that's another way that the mutual fund industry
[00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:11.000]   misleads people, because return,
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.440]   the relative performance is significantly higher
[00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:19.440]   if you account for all the mutual funds and ETFs
[00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:26.280]   that are quietly interred when no one's looking,
[00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:29.000]   so that you don't really find out how many
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:34.960]   funds were just quietly taken out and shot.
[00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:39.640]   Here's some examples.
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:45.360]   For the year ending 2023, large cap managed funds
[00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:49.640]   trailed the S&P index 59.68% of the time.
[00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:51.200]   Over three and five year periods,
[00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:52.920]   the percentage rose to 80%.
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:56.240]   By 20 years, the fail rate rose to 93%.
[00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:59.920]   How much more does the industry need to know
[00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:06.640]   before they accept index funds and stop pushing back?
[00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:13.420]   Well, there's a wonderful quote about that,
[00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:19.040]   which is from Upton Sinclair, I'm trying to find it here.
[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:27.440]   But it's to the effect that you can't make a man
[00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:32.440]   change his mind if his salary depends on something else.
[00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:35.260]   It's often quoted and absolutely true.
[00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:40.120]   These figures go on, and the SPIVA report
[00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:43.140]   has been coming out for, I think it's 23 years now,
[00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:48.680]   and every issue shows the same thing.
[00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:52.920]   The longer the time period, the lower the possibility
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:56.960]   that managed funds will beat their appointed index.
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:01.960]   It goes still further, and this we can thank Alan Roth for.
[00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:08.960]   He did an exercise showing the increased failure rate
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:11.620]   when you started selecting more funds.
[00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:14.360]   If you had a portfolio of two funds,
[00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:15.620]   or three funds, or four funds.
[00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:18.960]   The more funds you have, the greater your chances
[00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:21.040]   of failure if they're managed funds.
[00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:27.360]   So I think the number there is that at 10 years,
[00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:31.640]   only 6% of managed fund portfolios with 10 funds
[00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:36.640]   beat comparable index fund portfolios, 6%.
[00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:42.920]   And yet, what do the people on Wall Street try to do?
[00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:47.640]   They give us portfolios with 13 funds in them,
[00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:52.640]   some with totally irrelevant percentages of investment,
[00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:58.240]   and we get confused.
[00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:02.560]   Because who wants to manage 13 funds
[00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:03.920]   and know about 13 funds?
[00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:04.760]   I know.
[00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:11.520]   So it all comes down, for me, to one question.
[00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:16.140]   Do you want your retirement to be a low probability event?
[00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:19.060]   (audience laughing)
[00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:21.820]   And I don't, and I didn't.
[00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:24.780]   And I can happily say that in spite of being
[00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:28.180]   an ink-stained wretch, the Burns family
[00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:32.540]   is doing quite nicely, and far better than we expected,
[00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:36.460]   because I've been a cheap investor,
[00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:41.460]   looking for index funds, and following that.
[00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:46.540]   Now, I would like to bring up another problem,
[00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:50.120]   and that's the last of my comments.
[00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:56.700]   Bogle cited a conversation between Kurt Vonnegut
[00:47:56.700 --> 00:47:59.340]   and Joseph Heller at a meeting,
[00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:02.460]   where Vonnegut said that the guy throwing the party
[00:48:02.460 --> 00:48:07.460]   had made more money in one day than Heller had made
[00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:12.020]   on the entire sales of his book.
[00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:15.460]   Heller answered back, yes, but I have something
[00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:18.160]   he will never have, enough.
[00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:24.660]   And Bogle quoted that, but I think it tells us
[00:48:24.660 --> 00:48:33.580]   of another problem, which I find myself
[00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:37.940]   more and more interested in, which is
[00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:42.820]   that what we really suffer from,
[00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:46.100]   in addition to what I call wealth porn,
[00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:49.220]   which is in most financial publications,
[00:48:49.220 --> 00:48:52.500]   is wealth addiction.
[00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:57.420]   And there's a story, there's a book by that title,
[00:48:57.420 --> 00:48:58.780]   by Philip Slater.
[00:48:58.780 --> 00:49:01.180]   Slater wrote The Pursuit of Loneliness,
[00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:02.740]   American Culture at the Breaking Point
[00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:04.940]   of the Mid '60s, very well-known book.
[00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:11.780]   And wealth addiction, he wrote in 1983.
[00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:14.500]   It's a sign of the times.
[00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:16.760]   That book is out of print.
[00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:21.060]   But it's something we should study.
[00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:22.260]   Thank you for listening.
[00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:26.340]   (audience applauds)
[00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:28.180]   - Thank you.
[00:49:28.180 --> 00:49:36.380]   Thanks a bunch for that, Scott.
[00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:39.140]   I want to amplify just one quickly quick point you made,
[00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:42.740]   which is to thank Morningstar, like 30 years ago,
[00:49:42.740 --> 00:49:46.100]   for the floppy disk sets that they would put out.
[00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:48.900]   Like you, it gave me a lot to write about.
[00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:51.020]   It was $99 a year, Christine.
[00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:57.020]   And my favorite, the favorite use I had for it
[00:49:57.020 --> 00:49:59.620]   was I would hear some money manager
[00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:04.420]   being interviewed by some gullible journalist,
[00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:06.340]   and I would immediately fire up my computer,
[00:50:06.340 --> 00:50:09.060]   throw in the disk, and see that this money manager
[00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:10.380]   was a moron.
[00:50:10.380 --> 00:50:15.440]   It was a constant source of joy.
[00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:19.540]   So, couple of questions here.
[00:50:19.540 --> 00:50:23.520]   Which column of yours is the one that you're most proud of?
[00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:25.740]   - I don't know.
[00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:30.360]   I don't know.
[00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:35.260]   The only thing I can say is that when I look back,
[00:50:35.260 --> 00:50:38.640]   I think, "Gee, I was so much smarter then."
[00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:41.480]   (audience laughs)
[00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:46.700]   I think the one, I'm really proud of the one
[00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:50.940]   about Peter Lynch because it,
[00:50:50.940 --> 00:50:56.920]   I got to work with a broker, with the tools he had,
[00:50:56.920 --> 00:51:02.900]   and prove something wasn't true.
[00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:07.100]   I'm kind of an, you know, an autodidact,
[00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:11.300]   and I don't learn things in the way normal people do.
[00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:15.300]   And so, I just gather things from everywhere,
[00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:17.500]   and I was really glad that I had a friend
[00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:21.780]   who was a broker, who was also interested in,
[00:51:21.780 --> 00:51:23.060]   he's one of the few brokers I know
[00:51:23.060 --> 00:51:24.700]   who really wanted to help people.
[00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:30.180]   - And then one final question, which is,
[00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:32.300]   you know, you wrote this very well-known piece
[00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:36.380]   about reinventing retirement income in America.
[00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:40.980]   If they made you retirement czar of the United States,
[00:51:40.980 --> 00:51:44.700]   and you had to build the system from the ground up,
[00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:47.500]   how would you, what would you design?
[00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:54.340]   - Oh, well, since violence is getting
[00:51:54.340 --> 00:51:55.980]   to be more and more popular,
[00:51:55.980 --> 00:51:58.640]   I'd probably have a few ritual executions.
[00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:01.480]   (audience laughs)
[00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:07.780]   Just, you know, I would like it if the people
[00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:14.420]   who got away with creating the crash of 2008 and 2009
[00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:16.260]   actually paid a price.
[00:52:16.260 --> 00:52:21.680]   They didn't, and they still go on.
[00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:25.660]   The worst that happened is they lost their jobs,
[00:52:25.660 --> 00:52:26.900]   but not their wealth.
[00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:29.580]   - Okay, yeah.
[00:52:29.580 --> 00:52:30.900]   - I know that's a harsh answer,
[00:52:30.900 --> 00:52:35.900]   but I mean, I've heard so much BS,
[00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:43.220]   and, you know, that's why I told the anecdotes
[00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:45.860]   that I did the, there, you know,
[00:52:45.860 --> 00:52:52.500]   the people in financial services,
[00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:56.380]   they, so many of them, particularly portfolio managers,
[00:52:56.380 --> 00:52:59.980]   they think they're so smart, and, you know,
[00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:02.140]   if you have any doubt,
[00:53:02.140 --> 00:53:04.660]   they'll tell you how smart they are, you know?
[00:53:04.660 --> 00:53:08.700]   And it just bothers me that there could be
[00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:11.980]   that much arrogance and so little humility
[00:53:11.980 --> 00:53:16.020]   in the face of all the uncertainties of human life
[00:53:16.020 --> 00:53:19.820]   that they could, yeah.
[00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:22.940]   So I would like to mete out punishments.
[00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:27.180]   Maybe something less harm, less violent than shootings,
[00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:30.180]   but some form of public humiliation.
[00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:32.940]   Let's bring the stocks back.
[00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:33.780]   - Yeah.
[00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:36.420]   - Not the common stocks, the lockup stocks.
[00:53:36.420 --> 00:53:38.180]   - Yeah, well, yeah, I mean,
[00:53:38.180 --> 00:53:40.700]   as long as we're into Old Testament wrath,
[00:53:40.700 --> 00:53:44.220]   I would like, I would reserve capital punishment
[00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:46.540]   for the designers and sellers
[00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:48.700]   of inverse and leveraged funds.
[00:53:48.700 --> 00:53:52.860]   Okay, well, with that, let's give Scott a round of applause.
[00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:56.020]   (audience applauding)
[00:53:56.020 --> 00:53:58.080]   you
[00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:08.080]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
