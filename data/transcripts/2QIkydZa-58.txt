[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   I've written recommendation letters for someone's promotion directly to their boss,
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:11.040]   but not even at my company, like at another company, because I wanted them to be recognized
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:18.640]   for what they did. And I explained to leadership at the other company why this thing is so hard
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.880]   and why this person is fantastic. I think various kinds of recognition, I think you got to get
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.200]   right. You know, they're doing it because they feel like that's the coolest thing to do, but
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.480]   they also have a life to live and there's a social aspect to it and there's an extrinsic
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.880]   aspect to it in their own terms that you try to help with.
