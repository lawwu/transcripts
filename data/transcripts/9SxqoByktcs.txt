[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920]   I want to tie in this issue with what you said about the off-ramp, okay?
[00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.380]   Which is, you know, what is the off-ramp from this?
[00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:12.160]   Look, everybody understands, I think, regardless of what side of the political spectrum you're on,
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:19.160]   that we are caught in a cycle of insane hyper-partisan warfare and tit-for-tat retaliation.
[00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:25.480]   And that is the thing that we need to, that is the ledge we need to walk back from, okay?
[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:31.160]   But the problem that everybody has is that they can only see the other side doing it.
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.960]   You know, they can't see themselves doing it.
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.660]   This is a two-way street.
[00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.100]   Both sides are doing it.
[00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.960]   And that's how de-escalation works, is both sides have to concede something.
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.520]   Yes, and unless you concede when your side is doing it, we're never going to break the cycle.
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.880]   Now, the thing that is happening right now, now what Trump did was absolutely outrageous.
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.460]   And I think it brought him to an ignominious end.
[00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.820]   And I think it brought him to an ignominious end in American politics.
[00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.020]   He will pay for it in the history books, if not in a court of law, okay?
[00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.380]   But now what has happened is the next step in the tit-for-tat retaliation,
[00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:13.140]   the storming of the Capitol has now been used to implement a sweeping attack on free speech.
[00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.260]   You know, the Twitter employees who sent that letter to Jack, who've been demanding this for years,
[00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.260]   have finally gotten their way, and there is a widespread purge going on.
[00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.120]   And not just of Trump.
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.360]   Not just a permanent ban on Trump.
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.320]   And then a whole bunch of other people, you know, conservatives.
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.040]   There are now liberal accounts.
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.840]   There's an account that I wasn't even aware of called Red Scare.
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.840]   They're basically, you know, pretty much on the left.
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.800]   No one can say exactly what it was that got them banned.
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.520]   I guess they had Steve Bannon on their podcast.
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.280]   They are suddenly banned from Twitter.
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.640]   Nobody knows why.
