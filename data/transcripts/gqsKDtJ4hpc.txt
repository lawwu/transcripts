[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.480]   An important question comes in to us from Brooke, a listener.
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:13.200]   "Hi Pastor John, my pastor believes that the Jewish people, those who believe the Messiah
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.080]   is yet to come, will go to heaven because they are God's chosen people."
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.440]   Referencing some parts in Revelation.
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:27.000]   "I disagree with him because I believe that all must get to heaven through Jesus Christ.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.440]   Where do you stand on this issue and on this debate?
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.640]   Will all Israelites be saved in the end?"
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.520]   No, all Israelites will not be saved in the end.
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:47.600]   And more specifically to Brooke's concern, no Jews who are waiting for a Messiah and
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.080]   rejecting Jesus while they wait will be saved.
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.200]   So let me take those one at a time.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:04.000]   Will all Israel be saved and will specifically Jews who are waiting for a Messiah be saved?
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.080]   First some passages on the first one.
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:14.840]   When Jesus saw the faith of this Gentile centurion in Matthew 8, he said he'd not seen such faith
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.160]   among the Israelites.
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.280]   And then he adds this in verses 11 and 12 of Matthew 8.
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:27.200]   "I tell you, many will come from east and west," that's Gentiles, "and recline at table
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:34.560]   with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven, while the sons of the kingdom,"
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:42.120]   that's the Jews that are rejecting him in his own day, "will be thrown into outer darkness.
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:48.320]   In that place will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:55.000]   Later in Matthew 23, he made it crystal clear what he was talking about when he said "outer
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.600]   darkness and gnashing of teeth."
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:04.320]   In verses 29 to 33, he says, "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees," so these are the Jewish
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:12.320]   leaders, "Woe to you, hypocrites, you serpents, you brood of vipers.
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:19.320]   How are you to escape being sentenced to hell?"
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:26.880]   The apostle Paul makes it clear that this was what broke his heart, and that his Jewish
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:34.600]   kinsmen, with all their covenant privileges, were rejecting Jesus as Messiah and were going
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.900]   to hell.
[00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:44.480]   So he says in Romans 9, 3, or 2 and 3, I guess, "I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:51.580]   in my heart, for I could wish that I myself were accursed and cut off from Christ for
[00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.340]   the sake of my brothers, my kinsmen according to the flesh."
[00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.440]   So they were accursed and they were cut off from Christ, and Paul said, "I could wish
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.560]   that I could take their place."
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:11.880]   Now that creates for Paul an enormous problem, and he spent all of Romans 9 to 11 dealing
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:18.920]   with the problem and answering it, namely, how could the covenant people, en masse almost,
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.080]   perish and be lost forever?
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:30.120]   And his answer, his central point in verses, in chapters 9 to 11 of Romans is, this is
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:36.400]   verses 6 to 8 of chapter 9, "It is not as though the word of God has failed."
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.220]   So he's answering his own concern.
[00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.280]   It looks like the word of God has failed.
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.240]   So many Jews are lost.
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:49.040]   And he says, "It is not as though the word of God has failed, because not all who are
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.600]   descended from Israel belong to Israel."
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.500]   His answer is, "Not all Israel is Israel."
[00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.180]   That's Paul's basic answer.
[00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.460]   So from the beginning with the difference between Isaac and Ishmael right down to this
[00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:10.360]   very day, with the distinction between Jews who believe in Jesus and those who don't,
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.360]   there is a true Israel, and then there is an ethnic Israel.
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.960]   And he makes that clear in verse 8, where he says, "This means it is not the children
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:28.520]   of the flesh who are the children of God, but the children of promise are counted as
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.520]   offspring."
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:35.560]   So the children of the flesh would be all ethnic Jews today, but not all of those are
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.960]   the children of God.
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:43.480]   So Paul prays in chapter 10 of Romans, "Brothers, my heart's desire and prayer to God for them
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.140]   is that they may be saved."
[00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.680]   And then he knows that only some will be.
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:58.840]   So he says in Romans 11, 14, "I magnify my ministry to the Gentiles in order somehow
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:05.760]   to make my fellow Jews jealous and thus save some of them."
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:11.360]   So only some, he expects, will be saved.
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.560]   Which will be saved?
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.320]   Who are those who will be saved?
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:27.080]   And he answers in Romans 11, 23, "Even if they do not continue in their unbelief, will
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.400]   be grafted in."
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.200]   That is to the true people of God, the Mosaic covenant.
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:37.760]   I mean, the Abrahamic covenant, which he talks about as an olive tree.
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.360]   "For God has the power to graft them in again."
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.920]   So right now they're lying there broken off in unbelief.
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:50.280]   And he says, if they would just believe, they would be grafted back in.
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:58.000]   So Paul does, however, look for a day, and this may be, I don't know what the pastor
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   was thinking.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.200]   There is coming a day, I think Paul says, where there'll be a great turning of Israel
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:10.240]   to Jesus, her Messiah, and the whole ethnic group of Israel will be saved by trusting
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.240]   in Jesus.
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:16.560]   I think that's what Paul is talking about in Romans 11, 23 to 26, where he says, "I
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.680]   do not want you to be unaware of this mystery, brothers.
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:26.120]   A partial hardening has come upon Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles come in.
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.960]   And in this way, all Israel will be saved.
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.240]   As it is written, the deliverer will come from Zion and he will banish ungodliness from
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.000]   Jacob."
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:46.040]   So my own view is that that refers to a future salvation of the great bulk of Israel.
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:53.560]   But the point is, only through Jesus will that salvation come to any Jew, any time.
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:59.080]   Paul says in 2 Corinthians 3, 16, "When one," that is, one of the Jews, "turns to the Lord,
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:03.280]   the veil," that's been lying over their minds, "the veil is removed."
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.400]   When they turn to the Lord, Jesus, the veil is removed.
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.600]   And when it's removed, what do they see?
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:12.560]   2 Corinthians 4, 4, they see the glory of Jesus.
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:20.040]   Now with regard to that other part of Brooke's question, what about Jewish people today who
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:27.320]   are waiting for a Messiah, but in the process, they are not believing Jesus is the Messiah?
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:32.900]   Well, that's exactly the situation in which John the Baptist found himself in his question
[00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:34.280]   in Luke 7, 19.
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:40.200]   He said, "Are you the one who is to come, or shall we look for another?"
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.360]   So that's John the Baptist's very question.
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:49.200]   And Jesus answers him by pointing to his miracles and the uniqueness of his preaching to the
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.200]   poor.
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:57.360]   And then he says, "And blessed is the one who does not stumble over me."
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:01.560]   Because Jesus didn't look like, he didn't look like they expected the Messiah to look.
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:04.520]   And so they stumble over the stumbling stone.
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:08.640]   And he said, "Only those will be blessed who don't stumble over me."
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:15.220]   And that blessing is valid for all who embrace Jesus and the opposite will be condemnation.
[00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:23.040]   So over and over again, Jesus tells us in the gospels, he tells the Jews that if they
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:28.280]   reject him, they reject God, the Father.
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:33.040]   If they don't love him and welcome him as Messiah and Son of God, they don't love the
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:34.040]   Father.
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:35.040]   They don't welcome the Father.
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:40.000]   So let me just give a few of those because they're really the very essence of the matter.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.560]   John 14, 7, "If you had known me," he says, "you would have known my Father."
[00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:52.480]   John 5, 23, "Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father."
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:57.440]   John 5, 42, "I know that you do not have the love of God within you.
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:01.360]   I've come in my Father's name and you don't receive me."
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:06.480]   John 8, 42, "If God were your Father, you would love me.
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.440]   I came from God and I'm here."
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:15.040]   First John 2, 23, "No one who denies the Son has the Father.
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:18.640]   Whoever confesses the Son has the Father also."
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:25.480]   John 6, 45, "Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me."
[00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:33.040]   It's just hard to imagine how Jesus could make himself clearer that to reject him and
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:41.000]   wait for another Messiah is to show you do not have a saving relationship with God.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:47.640]   That's true for Gentiles, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, secularists.
[00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:54.480]   Jesus is the way, the only way to God because he is the incarnation of God.
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:55.480]   Amen.
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:10:01.280]   Yeah, sobering realities pointing us back to Christ as our only divine hope.
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.040]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.980]   And thank you for the question, Brooke.
[00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:09.760]   If you have a question of your own that you just cannot figure out on your own or some

[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:33.640]   Well speaking of perplexing Bible questions, will we see God one day or is he completely
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.680]   invisible?
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:41.040]   Biblical texts seem to say yes and yes to both questions, that we will see him and that
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.000]   we can't see him.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.280]   Pastor John will help us untangle these issues for us when we return on Monday.
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.040]   Until then, I am your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:53.680]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast and have a wonderful weekend.
