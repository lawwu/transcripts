[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.180]   If you talk about true accidental deaths, automotive, uh, and falls and overdoses are
[00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:12.700]   the, are the three.
[00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.160]   That's basically what it comes down to.
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.120]   So you know, in our death bar analysis, we kind of list all this stuff out.
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.360]   In fact, I think that's actually one of the figures in the book is I have the accidental
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:28.420]   death, uh, figure that we've put together where we've adjusted by population and you'll
[00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:29.420]   see a couple of things.
[00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.880]   If you look at it in absolute terms, it's basically a pretty constant.
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.360]   So regardless of what decade of life you're in, once you're above, you know, 20 accidental
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.780]   deaths are a pretty sizable number of, of deaths.
[00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.480]   Now car accidents seem to be pretty constant throughout life, little more common if you're
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.240]   under 60 than over 60, but they never go away.
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:59.780]   I was told that, um, in teenage and boys and, and, uh, boys in their, in their early twenties,
[00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:06.060]   alcohol induced, uh, automotive fatalities would place them at, at this astronomic risk.
[00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.580]   Is that just not true?
[00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.900]   It's not true anymore compared to overdoses.
[00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.220]   Is that because young people now, um, aren't getting their driver's licenses.
[00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:14.220]   I've also heard that.
[00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.220]   Yeah.
[00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.500]   Well, I think it's also because we're seeing such an uptick in the deaths that come from
[00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.500]   fentanyl.
[00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.020]   Got it.
[00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.680]   So fentanyl related deaths have basically squashed all other deaths below 65 on the
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.680]   accidental front.
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.680]   Really?
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.600]   Oh, it, it, it's not even close.
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.960]   Because of the number of different substances that fentanyl is being woven into.
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.400]   It's winding its way into everything, right?
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.720]   So all counterfeit drugs, all illicit drugs, and look, most of the time you're not getting
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.720]   a lethal dose.
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:49.320]   So it's, you know, it's, it's, but, but you're getting lethal doses so often now that, um,
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.960]   well, you know, I did a little analysis actually the other day when I looked at how are deaths
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.640]   of despair increasing over the last five years.
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.360]   So what did I define as a death of despair?
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.960]   Suicide, alcohol related death, or overdose.
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.960]   Accidental overdose.
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.440]   So we differentiate that from suicide where suicide is obviously deliberate and accidental
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.440]   is not.
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.280]   So if you just look at those three things, so accidental overdoses, suicides, and alcohol
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:25.920]   use, or alcohol related death, um, not including driving, by the way, this is like cirrhosis
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:34.520]   of the liver that comes from, that number is going up at almost 20% per year since 2019.
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.320]   So the, I couldn't get 2022 numbers yet.
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:46.160]   So at the time of, the time I did this analysis, which was last week, um, the 2021 numbers
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.960]   was about 210,000 Americans.
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.160]   Goodness.
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:03:00.500]   Up from 180,000 in 2020 up from like 150,000 in 2019.
[00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.320]   So is this, um.
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.080]   And that is driven almost entirely by fentanyl use.
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.080]   What other sorts of drugs are people buying?
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.780]   No, so the majority of people are dying from fentanyl poisoning.
[00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.160]   And I had a guy on my podcast recently named Anthony Hippolito and if anybody's interested
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.280]   in this topic, they really need to go listen to that.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.280]   So Anthony.
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.000]   I watched the YouTube version of this and your podcasts are excellent.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   So if you're interested in this, and I think everyone should be interested in this.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.560]   If you have a child or know somebody who has a child, you just got to get this podcast
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.360]   into their hands because it's the most important public service announcement I'll probably
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:39.280]   ever do in terms of saving more lives potentially, um, where the majority of this is making its
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:45.800]   way into the, into the accidental poisonings is through illicit counterfeit pills.
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.280]   So it's when kids are out there buying, you know, oxy, they want oxy.
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.520]   Well, they can't, they can't get real oxy, right?
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.360]   Because they're not going to go to a doctor and get real oxy.
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.680]   So they're going to buy it through, you know, Snapchat, right?
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.720]   They're going to buy it through some drug dealer that they're finding on social media.
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.320]   Um, they're buying sleeping pills.
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.320]   They're buying all sorts of counterfeit stuff like Adderall.
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.160]   Many of these things are being laced with fentanyl.
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.160]   Adderall.
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.160]   Absolutely.
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.160]   Wow.
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.160]   I assumed the fentanyl.
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.900]   And again, the reasons are it's insanely cheap to use synthetic fentanyl.
[00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.240]   And secondly, and again, but the effects of fentanyl are nothing like the effects of Adderall.
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.720]   So cocaine, um, doesn't make sense for that reason.
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.840]   Cocaine doesn't make sense either.
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:27.840]   Yep.
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.080]   And yet it's still showing up in cocaine.
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.120]   Again, I don't think that's the dominant place it's showing up.
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:39.260]   I would, I would guess that the dominant place it's showing up is in counterfeit opioids.
[00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.960]   So any opioid, barbiturate, any sedative, depressant.
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.620]   Let me tell you what I'm telling my daughter, right?
[00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.120]   Because this is to me, it's a frontline problem.
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.640]   I have a 14 year old daughter.
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.480]   I'm like, listen, I don't care which friend of yours it is.
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.720]   I don't care how much she's amazing.
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.080]   If she tells you to try this sleeping pill because she took it the night before and it
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.240]   was really helpful or this will help you study better or this will help you do anything.
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.160]   I'm like, just come to us.
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.080]   We've got a better pill for you, right?
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.800]   Like in other words, you can't trust anything because you don't know where she got it.
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.120]   She has the best of intentions I'm sure when she's given it to you.
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.000]   And by the way, she probably took it the night before and was just fine.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.720]   But the people who are making these pills are not exactly up to GMP standards.
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:26.500]   So you know, you just have no idea which pill is getting what dose of fentanyl.
[00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.280]   One thing that Anthony Hippolito told me that I simply couldn't believe I had to ask him
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:36.520]   six times was that some of these pills have like one milligram of fentanyl in them.
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.780]   Now, I made the point on the podcast that a hundred milligrams of fentanyl for most
[00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.540]   people is a hit.
[00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.400]   Like they've like, I've had fentanyl before I've been in the hospital and I've had fentanyl.
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:52.560]   A hundred milligrams is like, wow, that is such a trip.
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.140]   Why are people dying from one milligram intake?
[00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:56.140]   Respiratory inhibition.
[00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:57.300]   You can't breathe.
[00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.640]   That shuts the brainstem off.
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.760]   Well, I don't think we can highlight this enough.
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:02.760]   You know, adults are dying.
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:03.760]   Kids are dying.
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:07.660]   I met someone earlier this week who told me her 35 year old son died of an accidental
[00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:12.760]   fentanyl overdose and he wasn't, at least by her description, a drug addict or anything
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:13.760]   of that sort.
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.060]   Yeah, this is, this is, we're talking about a different game now, right?
[00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.360]   So it's like, these are kids that have anxiety.
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:24.280]   These are kids that are, you know, are sort of addressing another issue with these, with
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.280]   these pills.
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:30.200]   And I think this, this whole concept of deaths of despair is, is, is a really important one.
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:36.040]   But back to your question, what do, what do accidental deaths primarily amount to for,
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.920]   for the aging population?
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:42.320]   Again, it is so clear that it is fall related.
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:51.320]   This is where, um, once you hit 60, 65, the, the risk of a fall that results either immediately
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:56.280]   in death, you know, you hit your head and die, going back to like cerebral hemorrhage,
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:02.120]   or it is the straw that basically leads you down the path to death within the next 12
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.720]   months, is astonishingly high.
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.880]   It's so high that it's sort of hard to wrap your head around.
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:15.840]   But if you're over 65 and you fall and break your femur or hip, so you either crack the
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:22.040]   femoral neck or the femur itself, your 12 month mortality, the probability you will
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:27.080]   be dead in 12 months after that break, if you're 65 or older, depending on the study,
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.760]   is about 15 to 30 percent.
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:30.760]   Wow.
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:31.760]   Wow.
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:36.280]   So in terms of offsetting the probability of falls, um, you talked a little bit about
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:41.480]   this, um, before, but I, uh, you and I have talked a little bit about this before, but
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.720]   maybe we could go a little bit deeper.
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:49.900]   Um, people's ability to jump and land seems to be highly correlated with one's ability
[00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:57.660]   to not fall or at least fall and control the fall in a way that, uh, leads to no or less
[00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:58.660]   severe injury.
[00:07:58.660 --> 00:07:59.660]   Yeah.
[00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:04.680]   So Andy Galpin talked about this on your podcast, he talked about it on my podcast.
[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:08.200]   What is the hallmark of aging on the muscle?
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.440]   It is atrophy of the type two muscle fiber.
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:12.440]   That's the hallmark.
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:13.440]   Fast twitch.
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:14.440]   Fast twitch muscle fiber.
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:19.760]   So if you want to understand what looks different in 50 year old Peter versus 18 year old Peter,
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:22.640]   it's not my type one fibers, it's my type two fibers.
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:23.640]   It's my fast twitch fibers.
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:24.640]   It's my explosive fibers.
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:28.640]   I mean, when I was 18 years old, I could vertical jump over 30 inches.
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:36.200]   Today, I'm lucky if I can vertical jump 24 inches and you know, and when I'm 60, boy,
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:40.240]   it's like my goal is to be able to vertical jump 60, uh, 20 inches when I'm 60 and I don't
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.240]   know if I'm gonna be able to do it.
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:45.680]   I've seen some videos of some, uh, 80 year old sprinters that are pretty impressive and
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.480]   certainly 80 year old gymnasts that are impressive.
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:54.920]   I've not seen very many videos of 80 year olds, um, dunking basketballs, for instance.
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:55.920]   Yeah.
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:00.120]   Who are not more, who are not, uh, taller than six feet, five inches.
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.120]   Yeah.
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:08.600]   Um, so, so when we lose, you know, our, so, so again, if you just think about size, strength,
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:11.440]   speed, we lose speed first.
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:15.320]   We lose speed, then strength, and the last thing you lose is size.
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:19.000]   So again, size is agnostic to fiber, right?
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.320]   You could, you could have big type one fibers and still have lots of size.
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.640]   They're not gonna be that strong and they're certainly not gonna be fast.
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:30.920]   So what I mean, like we could go through, we could spend hours on this particular topic,
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:35.600]   but I think the most important thing that people need to understand is you cannot age
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:42.960]   well if you are not doing the type of training that is there to strengthen and delay or minimize
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.160]   the hypertrophy of your type two fibers.
[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.640]   So everything matters, right?
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.480]   You have to be doing your zone two.
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:53.480]   You have to be doing, you know, all of these other things, but some component of your training
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.720]   needs to be stressing the type two fibers.
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:59.600]   You have to be doing strength training that taxes those fibers.
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.920]   You have to be doing reactivity training.
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.600]   You have to be doing explosive training.
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.720]   And ideally, some training that involves jumping and landing.
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.520]   Well, jumping is a very big part of it.
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:13.240]   And landing is a very big part of another one of what I kind of think of as my four
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.360]   pillars of strength training.
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:21.200]   So one of the pillars of strength training is eccentric strength, which is breaks.
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:28.240]   So you know, you're gonna hurt yourself 10 times more likely, I'm making that number
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.240]   up by the way.
[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:30.240]   I don't know if it's 10 times.
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.240]   Experientially it seems to be.
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:37.360]   You are 10 times more likely to hurt yourself stepping off something than stepping onto
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.640]   something, right?
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:42.040]   Stepping down versus stepping up.
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:47.520]   Because when you step up onto something, you are concentrically controlling the muscle.
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:51.240]   When you step down, you have to apply the breaks.
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.440]   And that's where most people falter.
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:55.600]   Much harder to walk downhill than uphill.
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:58.080]   Uphill is taxing your cardiovascular system.
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.320]   But if you slow down enough, you're fine.
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:03.280]   But a lot of people don't have the ability to slow themselves down when they're walking
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.280]   downhill.
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:10.000]   And so when an older person steps off a curb and can't fully stop themselves, and that
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.680]   results in a fall.
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.960]   So you know, I like doing things like a broad jump.
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:18.200]   Broad jump's a fun little test set I like to do every once in a while.
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:20.360]   I always want to make sure I can broad jump six feet.
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:22.880]   That's kind of my arbitrary number that I've chosen.
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:27.200]   And the reason is, on the takeoff, that's a very explosive movement.
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.920]   But the landing is just as important.
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:32.600]   If I can't stick that landing, it means I don't have the breaks.
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:37.440]   So those are kind of some of the tests I want to be able to do to make sure that I'm utilizing
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:38.440]   that system.
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:42.000]   Because I do think, you know, look, I've watched my mom.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:48.280]   My mom fell, gosh, probably been about four months ago, just fell in a typical way that
[00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:49.280]   people fall.
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:50.800]   By the way, it could have happened to anybody.
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:54.160]   It's not like, you know, my mom walks around and moves around just fine.
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:12:01.240]   And this particular day, she just tripped on a uneven stone and fell and landed and
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:02.240]   broke her hand.
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:04.160]   And she's really lucky she didn't break her hip.
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.400]   And I told her that because my mom was, you know, probably in her mid-70s.
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:12.640]   And I said, look, you know, if that was your femur, I'd give you a 30% chance of dying
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:13.640]   in the next year.
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:18.040]   I mean, it's just an un... those are such difficult to recover from injuries.
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:23.720]   Because first of all, you're dealing with the immobility of, you know, the hospitalization
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.400]   and immobility that follows that.
[00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:32.920]   And the amount of muscle loss that occurs could easily be, you know, four or five pounds
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:37.280]   of lean tissue lost, that for most people that age, becomes almost impossible to get
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:38.280]   back.
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:42.200]   And that says nothing about sort of the acute causes of death, like a fat embolism that
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:45.080]   results from a broken femur, a blood clot from laying in bed.
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:47.260]   Those things are also catastrophic.
[00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:52.600]   But what happens is a lot of these patients just never get back to the same level of mobility.
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:56.960]   And you know, now I think in many ways, we're kind of pivoting from what kills you to what
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:59.440]   ruins your quality of life.
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:05.440]   And we've spent so much time talking about what kills you, but I think you might as well
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:09.080]   be dead in some ways if you can't do the things you want to do.
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:14.480]   And if playing with your grandkids or gardening or playing golf or going for a walk with your
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:18.720]   spouse or think of any of the things that we all do today and take for granted, if you
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:24.000]   can't do those things, I don't know, you sort of lose the reason to be around.
