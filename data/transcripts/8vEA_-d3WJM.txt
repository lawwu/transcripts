[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.460]   Well, what is God accomplishing in my suffering
[00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.640]   and in your suffering?
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.440]   It's a question Pastor John set out to answer
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.600]   from 1 Peter 4:12-19.
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.440]   It's a very important text that we all need to understand
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.760]   and return to in times of personal suffering.
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.960]   I'm gonna read that text now, 1 Peter 4:12-19,
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.200]   and then we'll hear from Pastor John.
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.320]   The Apostle Peter writes this,
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.400]   "Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery trial
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.500]   "when it comes upon you to test you
[00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.660]   "as though something strange were happening to you.
[00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.680]   "But rejoice insofar as you share Christ's sufferings,
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.780]   "that you may also rejoice and be glad
[00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.260]   "when his glory is revealed.
[00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.380]   "If you are insulted for the name of Christ,
[00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.960]   "you are blessed because the spirit of glory
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.220]   "and of God rests upon you.
[00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.220]   "But let none of you suffer as a murderer,
[00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.020]   "or a thief, or an evildoer, or as a meddler.
[00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:05.540]   "Yet if anyone suffers as a Christian,
[00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.000]   "let him not be ashamed,
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.480]   "but let him glorify God in that name.
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.680]   "For it is time for judgment to begin
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.280]   "at the household of God.
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.080]   "And if it begins with us, what will be the outcome
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.660]   "for those who do not obey the gospel of God?
[00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.720]   "And if the righteous is scarcely saved,
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.840]   "what will become of the ungodly and the sinner?
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.640]   "Therefore, let those who suffer according to God's will
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.100]   "entrust their souls to a faithful creator
[00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.960]   "while doing good."
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.920]   To explain, here's Pastor John.
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.720]   - I'm gonna talk about why Christians suffer
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.880]   and how they can rise above it.
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.160]   But the same truth applies to whether or not
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.440]   the suffering is coming from inside, from a disease,
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.200]   from a broken clutch, from you name it,
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.840]   whatever is tending to tempt you to be angry
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.600]   at people and God, that is under God's sovereignty,
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.400]   an opportunity of testing to prove and refine your faith
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.000]   just as much as if you've been hit in the face
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   by a person that hated you because you were a Christian.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.420]   So the point is, while the text deals explicitly,
[00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.420]   most of it, with persecution,
[00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.560]   the principle under God's loving sovereignty over our lives
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.680]   and how we handle that is the same
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.400]   as to whether the suffering,
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.660]   as when the suffering comes from another source.
[00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.720]   The command is there, keep on rejoicing
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.880]   to the degree that you share the sufferings of Christ.
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.880]   I think any suffering in obedience to
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.360]   and union with Christ is sharing in the sufferings of Christ
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.760]   if it's a hangnail, all right?
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.520]   If you are walking in the path of obedience with Jesus
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.720]   and you get a stubbed toe, he cares
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.680]   and it is suffering with him
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.080]   and it tends to make you murmur and be angry
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.400]   and therefore it's a big deal.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.840]   Not as big as if you were gonna die,
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.760]   but it's the same principle.
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.940]   This text says, don't just rejoice because of,
[00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.840]   I mean, in spite of, but because of suffering.
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.420]   Now that's jolting.
[00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.880]   This is not kind of a little piece of advice this morning
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.440]   from the power of positive thinking.
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.740]   Let's make the best of it.
[00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:24.580]   Let's rise above it.
[00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.480]   Let's be heroic.
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.440]   Let's have some mind over matter here.
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.940]   That's not the point.
[00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.820]   The point is you're being called to do something
[00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.000]   that is so abnormal and so counter-cultural
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.520]   and so against human nature.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.920]   It is supernatural and you can't do it
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.560]   and it isn't for your honor.
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.880]   When it happens, it's because the spirit of glory
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.680]   and of God has come upon you and enabled you.
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.440]   And that's two of those little tough things day by day
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.800]   and that's two in the big dangerous things.
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.640]   You can't do it, but God can and he gets the glory.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.960]   Aliens and exiles are what we're reading about here
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.160]   and how they respond to suffering.
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.920]   Count it all joy, James said.
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.920]   Count it all joy when you meet various trials.
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.560]   I mean, maybe he should have said,
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.760]   count it a little joy.
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.980]   Count it, there is a little joy in it
[00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.560]   or maybe some way down the line, joy will come from it.
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.560]   But why this massive count it all joy?
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.560]   How do you handle that?
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.520]   There's only one way that I know of
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.220]   that that can be not stupid or not foolish.
[00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.680]   One reason, God.
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.200]   There's a God and if there's a God
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.440]   and if he's sovereign and if he rules Satan
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.800]   and suffering and me and causes kingdoms to go up
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.440]   and go down, have you been reading Jeremiah these weeks,
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:53.800]   moving through the Bible?
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.960]   One chapter after the other, how God up down Moab,
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.720]   up down Edom, up down Assyria, up down Babylon,
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.960]   he reigns, that's Jeremiah's command
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.040]   and his belief and his message to us.
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.360]   And if he reigns over all the nations
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.880]   and over all the circumstances
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.080]   and over my cars and my children and my wife
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.440]   and my marriage and my job and my sickness
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.200]   and this church and he's good,
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:25.840]   it's not stupid to say, count it all joy.
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:26.680]   He loves you.
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.560]   It's not easy, but it's there.
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.280]   Keep on rejoicing because the suffering is not a surprise
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.200]   but a plan, verse 12.
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.000]   Beloved, do not be surprised
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.120]   when the fiery ordeal comes upon you or among you,
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.960]   which comes upon you for your testing, purposeful,
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.920]   as though some strange thing were happening to you.
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.280]   It isn't strange, it isn't absurd, it isn't meaningless.
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.240]   You don't tear your hair out and say,
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.200]   there's no point if you believe in God.
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:03.160]   Verse 19, you'll see how it has a point.
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:08.160]   Let those who suffer according to the will of God
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:13.280]   and trust their souls to a faithful creator.
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:18.280]   It is according to the will of God when we suffer.
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.240]   God wills it,
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:26.760]   even when Satan may be the immediate cause of it.
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.080]   You know that from the book of Job.
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.640]   We know it from 2 Corinthians 12,
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.680]   where the thorn in the flesh was what?
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.200]   A minister of Satan.
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.440]   Doing what?
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.720]   Humbling him and making him holy
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.080]   so that he would love the glory of Jesus Christ
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.280]   because Christ was overruling Satan's minister
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.880]   and turning Satan into a means of Paul's holiness.
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.920]   That's the kind of God we have.
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.320]   God reigns over Satan, over suffering,
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.080]   and therefore it's okay to resist your suffering in prayer
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:02.400]   and pray against it and ask God to remove it like Paul did.
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.480]   And sometimes he does miraculously and wonderfully.
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.880]   And sometimes he doesn't for holy and wise purposes
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.320]   because he loves us.
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:13.600]   But his sovereignty is not called into question
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:17.400]   by the immediate causality of sin and Satan.
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.280]   So many passages of scripture show
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.080]   that God is overruling these things constantly
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.000]   for our great good.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.640]   Look at verse 17.
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:30.240]   "For it is time for judgment to begin
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.040]   with the household of God."
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.120]   You see the purposefulness in suffering now?
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:38.360]   This is God's judgment upon the church.
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.360]   "For it is time for judgment to begin
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.280]   with the household of God.
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.360]   And if it begins with us, Christians,
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.720]   whom he loves with all of his heart
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.680]   and gave his son to die for,
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:49.320]   what will be the outcome of those
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:52.600]   who do not obey the gospel?"
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.760]   So the judgment of God is moving through the earth
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:59.200]   and it begins with churches.
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:03.240]   And the judgment of God comes upon churches.
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.080]   Why?
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.080]   He hates us?
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:06.160]   Not at all.
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.600]   But because he loves us so much,
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.000]   he will not spare us anything
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.760]   to get out of us what he hates.
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:12.840]   Did you get that?
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.560]   It's not because he hates us
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.120]   when a church or a Christian
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.480]   goes through times of darkness and trial.
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.120]   It's because he loves us so much,
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.840]   he will spare us nothing
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:26.280]   to get out of us what he hates, namely sin.
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:31.600]   And we are to count it
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.520]   under the ashes, under the shadow,
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:37.760]   under the frown, joy.
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.160]   Not the kind of joy that heel clicks
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:42.680]   and leaps in that moment,
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:46.880]   but that as in Micah 7, 7 says,
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:50.000]   "Do not rejoice over me, oh, my enemy.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.120]   When I fall, I will rise.
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.560]   He who has brought me into this darkness
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:00.560]   will plead my cause and vindicate me in time."
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.920]   So much has to be burned up within us.
[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:04.360]   We're all imperfect.
[00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.800]   Everybody's imperfect.
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.360]   There'll be no imperfect people in heaven.
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:09.920]   And a lot of God's process
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.400]   of getting us ready for heaven
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.520]   is to burn the hell out of us.
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:17.680]   Solzhenitsyn, remember the novelist.
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:20.040]   He was in prison years ago in Siberia.
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.960]   Wasn't a Christian yet.
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.880]   He's suffering and Boris Kornfeld,
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:27.040]   a Jewish doctor, was sitting with him one night.
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.040]   He was also in prison
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.800]   and Boris had become a Christian.
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.200]   And he spent late into the night
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.080]   talking with Solzhenitsyn, he says,
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.720]   and gave his testimony about how this Jewish doctor
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.160]   had become a Christian.
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.880]   And then he was beaten to death in his bed that night.
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:45.560]   And Solzhenitsyn wrote,
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:50.560]   "His last words lay upon me as an inheritance.
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:55.000]   It was only when I lay there on rotting prison straw
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.720]   that I sensed within myself the first stirrings of good.
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:04.800]   Bless you, O prison, for having been my life."
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.080]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:11.000]   The judgment of God moves through the world.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.280]   It'll come to a crescendo one of these days,
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.480]   but it's moving through the world.
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:15.840]   It's moving on churches,
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.840]   hundreds, thousands of churches
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:20.160]   coming under the judgment of God.
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:21.160]   When it moves in a church,
[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:24.920]   it's meant for purity because He loves us.
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:27.160]   And when it moves on the world,
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:28.520]   it has one of two effects.
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:32.040]   Either it awakens like it did for Solzhenitsyn,
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:36.240]   or it condemns and destroys if it is resisted
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.960]   and does not bring people to repentance.
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:43.040]   But for the people of God, the apple of His eye,
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.960]   it refines, it purifies.
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:46.800]   - Amen.
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:51.720]   That was John Piper preaching way back on October 23rd, 1994
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:56.160]   in a sermon titled, "Why We Can Rejoice in Suffering."
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.680]   You can find the entire sermon right now
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.880]   at desiringgod.org.
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.160]   Well, I came upon this sermon clip
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.960]   just listening to sermons on my walks.
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:07.600]   And if you have a favorite sermon clip of Pastor John
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.960]   that you wanna share with us, send it to me.
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.760]   Give me the sermon title and the timestamps
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:15.480]   from the audio of when the clip begins.
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.920]   And when it ends, tell me how that clip has impacted you.
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:21.240]   Give me your name and the closest city to you
[00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.440]   and email me all those details
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.520]   at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:30.080]   And put the word clip in the subject line as well,
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.840]   if you would, I'd appreciate it.
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:34.440]   Well, the Apostle Paul introduces
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.800]   a haunting category of person
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.480]   in 2 Timothy 3:7.
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:42.960]   There he talks about someone who is, quote,
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:46.320]   "Always learning and never able to arrive
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:49.200]   "at a knowledge of the truth," end quote.
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:52.480]   It prompts a really good question from a listener
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.560]   who struggles to understand the Bible.
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.760]   A young woman who goes so far as to say, quote,
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:59.280]   "Sermons pass in and out of my ears
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:02.480]   "and I take away from them just about nothing,
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:05.320]   "or so it seems," end quote.
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.480]   So could she be this person,
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:10.440]   always learning but never able to arrive
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:12.420]   at a knowledge of the truth?
[00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:14.240]   And what would it mean to arrive
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.080]   at a knowledge of the truth?
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.100]   Really important stuff.
[00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:18.800]   I'm Tony Reinke and Pastor John and I
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:22.680]   will see you on Friday when we address 2 Timothy 3:7.
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:23.600]   We'll see you then.
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.180]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:28.760]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:38.760]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
