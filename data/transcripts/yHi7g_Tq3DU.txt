[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   Brian Armstrong.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   Brian Armstrong is the co-founder and CEO of Coinbase, which is the largest
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   exchange here in the United States. And according to Bill Gurley, he's hoping for
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   more regulation so he can pull up the ladder behind him. So let's start there.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   We're here for Bill Gurley's. Generally speaking, your reaction?
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   I thought that was such an amazing talk. I was like cheering backstage when I heard that.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   I think we need more of that. I haven't seen somebody laid out that clearly in a while.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   He's totally right. I mean, regulatory capture is a huge drain on innovation.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   And the incentives are set up in kind of a bad way. If you take our company, for instance,
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   if you ask me just personally, I think there should be less regulation around this.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   I think it would create more innovation. Society would have to tolerate greater variance.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   There'd be more scams. There'd be more highs. There'd be more lows.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   But the truth of the matter is a lot of times you have regulation and it ends up having
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   the opposite of the intended effect. So we don't live in that world where people are going to say,
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   "Let's just be hands-off and do nothing." So when I go to D.C., the Overton window of discussion
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   is basically we're going to do the regulation for you or you can engage and have a say.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   And so of course we're going to take the other side and say, "Okay, let's try to help craft that regulation."
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   But if you ask me just personally as a citizen, there should be less regulation, I think.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   What do you think the regulation should be as we kind of get through the boom-bust cycle,
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   all the scams and fraud that occurred? And now it seems like the enforcement has gotten
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   particularly intense. What would be a balance that would protect us from going,
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   protect us going forward and eliminate the massive amount of grift, the massive amount of crime
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   and stealing and fraud that happened in crypto that we all witnessed and is undisputable,
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   but then also would allow us to innovate and not have it all go offshore? Because you said,
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   "Listen, if you don't want us here, you opened, I think, on some foreign islands, some entities,
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   you're ready to walk out of America, I understand, if they don't make great regulations."
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   But we're not leaving America, that's for sure. I mean, this is our biggest market.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   I'm an American. We started here.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Well, if they delisted everything but Bitcoin and Ethereum, what would you do then?
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   The thing is, I don't think that's in the realm of possibility because that's not what the law says.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   So we can start with what I think regulation could be or should be, and then let's talk about
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   what the regulators are actually doing because it's a little bit different.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   So the actual regulation that would allow this industry to be built here in a safe way,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   but also protect the innovation, it would do things that are actually kind of similar
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   to the traditional financial services industry.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   So you would have some basic rules in place around, "Okay, you need to get these audits complete.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Washed trading is illegal. Let's make an actual process for somebody who wants to register
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   a crypto security, and it could trade on a broker-dealer or these kinds of things."
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   So these are actually not rocket science. They're just kind of copying a lot of the best practices
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   like AML, KYC, those kind of things from the traditional financial services industry,
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   and centralized players in crypto should have to follow those.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Now, if you're doing a decentralized thing, I don't think that's a financial service business.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   You're never taking possession of customer funds like these decentralized protocols
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   or self-custodial wallets. I think that should be treated more like the software industry,
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   and the centralized players should be more regulated.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Now, you can also do things like have a sandbox for innovation and say,
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   "Okay, if you're a startup and you can't afford $20 million a year in legal bills,
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   you're under a certain amount, then you can operate in this sandbox."
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   And there's other things other countries have done.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   What's actually happened is not quite that, although there are some good bills going through Congress.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Unfortunately, we have a regulator, the chair of the SEC, who's kind of weaponized the agency
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   for his own political purposes.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   Gary Gensler.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Right, along with Elizabeth Warren, who they just don't want crypto to exist in the United States.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Isn't their argument, "Well, just register like we all do when we sell securities?"
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   And what's your best argument for why crypto shouldn't just do what we all do every day,
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   which is register securities?
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   I'm all for that, yeah.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   I mean, there should be a robust, healthy market to trade crypto securities in the US.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   There is not currently a way to register.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   And so they've been sort of talking out of both sides of their mouth and then saying,
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   "Hey, just come in and register," and then you see these exchanges come in that have never traded a single coin
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   as the ones that are propped up as the ones that are following the rules.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   So I think what their true intention or belief is behind the scenes, and I'm speculating a little bit here,
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   is they just don't want it to exist.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   And so they're trying to cast a shadow over the whole industry to make it difficult.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   They're just sending subpoenas and well-known notices.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   Why don't they want it to exist? Why?
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   I believe it's because--and again, this is just me speculating a little bit.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   I think it's because they don't want to lose power.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   They think the government should run financial services.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   They have their hooks into the big banks.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   They can pressure the big banks to close accounts on--you know, if you have the wrong political opinion
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   or you're in the wrong industry, you're in oil and gas or whatever the flavor of the day is.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   They want to be able to pressure companies.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Because they can't get it done through Congress, they want to pressure it through the big banks.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   And crypto--in America, people should be free to have control of their own money, to use new technologies.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   It's fundamentally anti-American what they're doing, and I think next year in the elections,
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   we need to make sure that all voters and people who are pro-innovation, pro-technology,
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   vote people out of office who are trying to curtail our freedoms around crypto.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   [Applause]
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Their counterargument would be that your industry, which you're the largest player in,
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   stole a bunch of money from consumers and perpetrated tens of billions at a minimum of crimes.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   And so they would not say they're doing it to control.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   They would say they're doing it--I'm not saying this is my opinion,
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   but they said they would be doing it to protect customers.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   So you've had tons of fraud. You had issues inside your own company
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   with people pre-trading coins before they were listed.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   Yeah. Well, that wasn't us. That was an employee who got convicted.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Yep. So the space, you would agree, is rife with crime.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   So if they want to--and that's their counter. So respond to their counter.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   What's true about what they say?
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   Well, they're absolutely correct that this industry has attracted some really bad people.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   I will admit that. If you look at the beginnings of any new technology,
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   the Internet, there were lots of scams.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Even in traditional financial services, we have Bernie Madoff and Exxon periodically.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   So what you should do in a free society is if somebody commits fraud,
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   absolutely that's what the justice system should do is go after them, create a deterrent,
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   put them in jail. Sam Bankman Freed should go to jail.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   It does not mean that the industry should be outlawed.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   And one of the really dangerous things that's happening is that the Constitution says
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   that Congress creates the laws.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   What's happened is that we've created these agencies,
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   and because they can just send subpoenas to everybody or publish these guidance letters--
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   this is kind of the administrative state, if you will--they are de facto creating laws.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   Other industries, like in the FDA, if the FDA puts out a guidance letter
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   and you don't like it, what are you going to do? It's a de facto law.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   So there's an interesting constitutional argument around this of like,
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   is the administrative state overreaching?
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   And I think we've seen that in this example with the SEC.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   [applause]
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   Well said.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   But isn't one of the fundamental premises of Bitcoin, blockchain technology,
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   that we can wrestle away control from the government,
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   and so you are de facto putting yourself in this kind of opposing position to the government,
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   because you live in a country that the government has the laws
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   and the ability to create new laws and enforce those laws upon you.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   And ultimately, crypto is going to be challenged by the fact
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   that it is a challenge to centralized governments.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   Yeah, I mean, that's exactly right.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   Anytime you create a startup and you go up against some big incumbent,
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   there's going to be a shift of power.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   And in the U.S., the government enjoys this monopoly on issuing the currency.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   In the U.S., our banks are more privatized than, say, China or most other countries,
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   but they're quasi-nationalized in the U.S.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   I mean, we talked about the revolving door and all the kind of oversight,
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   and like a bank cannot launch a new product without government approval,
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   so how really private market is it?
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   I think Bill Gurley showed that graph of like,
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   there haven't been any new banks really created since Dodd-Frank.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   So it's a quasi-nationalized industry.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   Of course, some people are going to be upset about losing the power of that,
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   but in America, this is a free country,
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   and American citizens should be free to use any technology that they want.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   They should be free to use cryptocurrency.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   And as long as you're not hurting somebody else,
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   that should be protected as a freedom here.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   So what's the path, Brian?
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   Because it seems like what you guys have had to do, you and others,
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   basically use the courts to beat back the administrative state.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   Do you want to talk about that process?
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   And one example is this Bitcoin futures thing that just--
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   I'm not even sure if it was resolved in the last few weeks or not.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   There was a pretty important ruling.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   Do you want to just update people about that kind of stuff?
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   Yeah, well, so that is one of the great things about America
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   that makes me bullish on it,
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   is that we do have these different branches of government
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   that are such a great check and balance.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   And you're right, the judicial branch
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   has been kind of my favorite branch of government in the last few months.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   And they've really kind of--the SEC has gone zero for three in the courts.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   The courts kind of keep upholding rule of law,
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   which has been really great.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   So there's been a handful of cases.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   There was the Ripple one, there was the Terraform one,
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   which agreed on this idea that the underlying cryptoassets themselves
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   were not securities.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   That's a very important fact, by the way, in our case with the SEC.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   And then just recently there was this Grace Jail Trust ETF,
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   and the judge ruled that the SEC was arbitrary and capricious
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   and unlawful in not approving their application.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   This is what you mean when you say they're just de facto passing laws
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   where they don't necessarily have the rights to do it.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   They're blocking free enterprise.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   They're blocking the ability for you guys to just do business.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   Yeah, and unless you're a big company like Coinbase,
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   you don't have the legal budget to kind of go to court
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   and fight these things out.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   And I can tell you as a public company,
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   I talked to a number of other people, and they were like,
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   "Oh my gosh, you can't sue the SEC or engage in litigation with them.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   You're a public company. You have to settle. You have to settle."
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   And I was sort of--the settlement option on the table
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   was to essentially delist everything other than Bitcoin.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   And so that would have been the end of the industry in the U.S.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   It was an easy choice.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   Of course, if we think the law doesn't say that, we're going to go to court.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   [applause]
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   So--oh, go ahead, David.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   Yeah, so I want to ask you about use cases, Brian.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   So I think we've had Bitcoin now for over a decade.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   I think it's been volatile but I think proven very robust.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   No one's been able to double spend a Bitcoin.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   I think for store of value, I think that use case
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   is pretty much proven.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   Then we had the rise of Ethereum and this idea of a world computer,
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   and there was a lot of talk for a while, especially during the very frothy,
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   sort of bubbly period, that there'd be all these use cases
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   that would be built on the world computer.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   People might even be running social networks on them, stuff like that.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   I think there's sort of been a correction from that.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   I mean, I think people now sort of realize there's certain--
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   there's a lot of applications where it just makes sense
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   to use a centralized database.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   Blockchains wouldn't be efficient enough for that.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   I'm kind of wondering at this point, where do we stand in terms of use cases
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   being proven out beyond the original Bitcoin store of value?
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   Like, what are the other big applications that have either been validated
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   or that we should expect to be built on top of all this infrastructure?
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   Yeah, so I'll run through a couple of them that are there already today
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   and then there's a couple on the horizon.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   Obviously, trading was this first use case.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   Then we saw things like stablecoins have actually gotten quite a bit of adoption.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   There's about $150 billion or so locked up in stablecoins,
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   useful for payments, cross-border stuff, all kinds of things.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   DeFi obviously got to--I think it's probably at about $50 billion
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   total value locked up in that, which is meaningful.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   I wouldn't say it's been mainstream by any stretch,
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   but it's certainly material.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   Even NFTs got to a pretty--I think it came down like 90% plus,
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   but it's still--it's in the tens of billions.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   So those are things I'd say are--they worked, and I think they'll grow over time.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   I'll talk about what I think could unlock that next wave of growth too.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   But there's a couple others that are on the horizon.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   So decentralized identity, ENS is probably the most popular one.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   There's only been about 3 million or so people have used ENS so far,
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   but you see it show up a lot.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   Explain what that is.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   Well, ENS is the Ethereum name system, so it's a decentralized identity,
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   so you can control your own information online.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   It's not like using Google or Apple or a big company.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   So my Twitter ex-profile, my Facebook profile, this is who I am.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   I can prove it.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   Yeah, and this is kind of the vision of Web3 is that if everybody has
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   their decentralized identity, then you can now create a follower graph.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   You could make posts associated with that, like text, video, audio,
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   to make a decentralized social network.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   Artists could have a direct relationship with their fans and have provenance.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   If you're CNN and you want to publish an article,
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   it can be cryptographically proven that it came from that account.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   It's not like a fake GPT.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   To build on Sax's question, why has crypto as an industry
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   and the entrepreneurs there done such a terrible job at making it easy
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   for consumers to use the product?
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   I know that's something you've really spent a lot of time on making this
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   easier and trustworthy, but we're in the second decade here.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   If you ask somebody to do what you just said, create a decentralized identity,
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   they would not even know where to start.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   Can you talk about why that blocker exists?
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   Yeah, so I do think there's a few things that can help unlock
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   this next wave of adoption. UX is one of them.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   It starts with what we started with at the beginning.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   Pretty much every crypto startup is just getting a subpoena right now,
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   and that's not fun, especially if you're two kids with a laptop and a dream,
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   and your parents are worried you're going to go to jail or something.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   The regulatory apparatus has been quite bad, and I think that will hopefully
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   shift here in the next few years as we get Congress to act,
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   or a new SEC chair, or CFTC, or someone.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   But put that aside.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   The other big blocker has been the scalability of the blockchains.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   So every transaction on-chain is still--if you do it on layer one,
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   it's anywhere from $5 to $25.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   It takes anywhere from a few minutes to an hour to confirm.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   So that's not going to work to really build decentralized applications
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   where every upvote or like or post has to happen on-chain.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   So we're getting now to layer two solutions, which is sort of like
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   the internet going from dial-up to broadband,
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   and Coinbase is trying to help that.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   We launched our own layer two solution called Base recently,
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   and it gets the cost and the speed down by about an order of magnitude.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   The metric I've been tracking internally and I kind of push our team on is
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   we need every transaction to get under one cent in one second.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   That feels like a threshold where we'd see an explosion of new use cases.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   The last one is the UX, as you put it, and today it's kind of remarkable
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   actually how many people have used these things like DeFi and NFTs
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   because the process to actually use it is crazy.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   It's like you buy the crypto on Coinbase.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   Sometimes you'll move it to a Chrome extension.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   You have to connect your wallet into this thing.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   You have to know what private keys are.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   And so if we can just make that where it's sort of like a WeChat app
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   or something where you're instantly connected in your wallet and your identity
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   when you load it up in your browser or equivalent self-custodial wallet
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   and it's just one click and it's done,
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   that's what we need to get to as an industry.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   Scalability, UX, regulatory improvement.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   At the core, and this is where you and I, you've been on this week at StartupSaving
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   three times and we've had deep discussions about this,
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   the core of financial regulation in the United States
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   is based on accredited investors, qualified purchasers,
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   which are 6% of the country, and 94% of people in the country
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   are not allowed to participate in the wealth creation
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   that everybody on this stage has benefited from,
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   many people in the audience have benefited from,
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   which is the formation of companies.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   It sounds crazy that we have not evolved this since the 1930s.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   Would this entire problem be solved
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   if we could have an accreditation test, a sophistication test,
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   where if you passed it, like a driver's license,
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   you could get in the car and drive it knowing the responsibility it takes?
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   We could simply give people a test and make them sophisticated investors
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   and then if you wanted to buy cryptocurrency or startups or real estate,
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   you would be allowed to do it.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   Yeah, I know you're hot on this idea and I think the key part about what you said
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   is it's not based on your net worth, it's based on passing the test.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   By the way, I think accredited investor laws are sort of an example
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   of what I was saying earlier about regulation that had an unintended effect
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   where it was trying to protect people,
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   but it actually made it illegal to get rich unless you were already rich.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   It was like this incredibly exclusionary thing.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   So anyway, a version of it that was not based on net worth I think could be good.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   I'm not opposed to that.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   An economics professor making $150,000 a year
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   would not be able to participate in startups or crypto or whatever,
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   whereas somebody who inherited a million dollars would.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   It's crazy to think that that law exists.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   I agree.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   One of the things that you need for a vibrant ecosystem
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   is a lot of practical thinking sometimes.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   And just having been around crypto since 2011,
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   my observation, I just want your reaction, is too many people are caught up
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   in the philosophy of being unplugged from the system
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   and being unavailable to the man and all of this bullshit.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   And all it does is actually create shitty products actually
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   because people don't think about wanting to get to 500 million people.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   People like it when it's used by 5,000 people
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   because there's this weird culture of like,
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   "Let me just build for myself and my nine other friends
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   who want to live off the grid."
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   I really believe that crypto struggles with that.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   There are a few people like you who are like,
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   "I'm just a practical, ambitious person who wants to take it to every single person."
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   And I just want your reaction.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   Do you see that? Did you see it before? Is it changing?
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   It's an interesting point.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   I mean, there are a lot of people that are the early--
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   it's just like crossing the chasm or that book, right?
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   The early people who joined these things,
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   they really don't like the existing system.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   They're a little quirky. They have higher risk tolerance.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   And you do need to get into bigger concentric circles to cross the chasm, right?
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   And the internet was the same way.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   I mean, the early internet was weird, right?
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   And people would compare that to New York Times or watching cable TV,
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   and they'd be like, "Oh my gosh, this is so illegitimate,
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   like these silly blog posts and stuff."
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   And it slowly became bigger than the traditional thing.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   You guys are an example of that.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   So I think crypto will get there, but yes,
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   there has to be a willingness to bring in the next round of people
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   and the next one, and maybe they're into art
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   or maybe they're into just earning a living and paying their family overseas.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   They're not even into crypto itself for some libertarian paradise.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   Yeah, and I think-- exactly right.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   I think this is sort of what explains the massive complexity.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   Only somebody who wants to minimize the market
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   would create a nine-step process to be able to do something.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   Because the average smart person would say, "That should be two steps.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   That should be one click."
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   But doesn't a lot of that complexity arise from the sort of--
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   the substrate, which is you're building on top of blockchains,
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   and people want that decentralized, like trustless sort of layer?
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   I mean, isn't that--
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   I mean, I think all these companies could be doing a much better job with UI.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   I agree it's a problem, but does it arise from the limitations of the tech stack?
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   Yeah, well, remember, it's just like people used to only write desktop software,
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   like Microsoft Office, and then Google came along and they're like,
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   "Hey, what if we could do everything in a browser?"
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   And Google Docs and Sheets was initially way worse than a desktop software.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   It was always going to be slower because you're building on a web stack and all this.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   And the tools got better and JavaScript engines got better,
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   and I think that's the-- broadband happened.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   I think that's the era that crypto is going through,
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   and it's our responsibility as the companies in the space to make this happen.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   No one's going to do it for us.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   There's all these competing protocols.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   There's big egos. There's personalities.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   We've got to come together, make the tools simpler, integrate them, make them interoperable.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   This is where I feel like I could have done so much more over the last five years.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   Same happened in hardware earlier.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   What's that?
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   Same happened in hardware early on.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   And one of the big things I always try to do--
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   I know we have these court cases going on and stuff like that,
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   but I always try to make sure-- and I tell the team this too--
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   is we have great lawyers.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   5% of our resources is going to go deal with that and make sure that's not an issue.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   95% of us are here to build products.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   Let's never lose sight of that.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   Otherwise, we just become some lawsuit company.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   What is the product?
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   I'm going to ask you a question before I ask you.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   Does your mom use Coinbase?
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   But she's my mom.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   But she's your mom.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   Okay, yeah.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   But do you think if you weren't the founder and CEO, would your mom use it?
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   Meaning not out of love, but out of necessity or need or interest?
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   Yeah.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   We've had over 100 million people sign up globally.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   A lot of them are-- the biggest demographic is-- excuse younger.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   It's people in the 25- to 35-year-old bracket.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   Initially, the users were often doing--
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   they wanted to just own a piece of the future,
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   and it was some trading thing.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   Now about half our active customers do something other than trading.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   And it runs the gamut.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   They're spending crypto with Coinbase Card.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   They're earning staking rewards.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   They're starting to engage in some of these dApps
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   and doing payments with stable coins.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   But it's a wide range of things.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   Where I'm going with this is do you try to allocate resources inside your company
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   to answer that use case, which is, all right, folks,
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   we have this core, fervent, obvious demo,
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   and we can always grow with that demo and wait for that demo to be 50 years old,
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   but that's going to take 30 years.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   Instead, we have to get that 50-year-old today.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   What is it that he or she actually wants or needs that they'll actually adopt?
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   And then all of a sudden 100 million users can become 500, can become 2 billion.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   Absolutely.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   I do think that is our responsibility, and that's what I'm pushing people internally on.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   And we need to drive the utility of crypto because if it's just the speculative thing,
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   for what?
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   I didn't get into this because of trading.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   I'm not really like a trader.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   I got into it because I wanted there to be a more open and fair
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   and free financial system for the world that reduced friction,
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   allowed new businesses, capital formation, all these things to happen,
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   take out the middlemen who are just charging all these fees.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   So that's what I want to get to.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   Are you tempted to then go outside the U.S.?
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   Because then when you say that, I think most people would say,
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   "Oh, go to India and sit on top of UPI, go to Africa."
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   So how do you maintain that focus?
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   Yeah, so we are definitely focused on international expansion.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   I just wanted to make the point clear we're not giving up the home base.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   But, yeah, there's a lot.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   We just launched in Canada last month.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   We just launched an international exchange earlier this year,
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   which I think will help us get to a wide range of markets.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   Our self-custodial wallet could do better in emerging markets.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   India is its own challenge.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   We launched and it got shut down three days later,
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   and we're going to try to relaunch it again.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   So we need to get it there in emerging markets too.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   Brian, while we have a few minutes,
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   can you share with us some of your work outside of Coinbase?
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   You've been making investments in projects like Research Hub.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   You started New Limit.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   Maybe share with us if there's a common thread to some of the work
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   you're doing outside of Coinbase.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   Does it connect back or is it entirely distinct?
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   Yeah, well, I mean, the thing I get excited about is
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   how do we accelerate progress in the world?
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   And I think technology, innovation, some of the regulatory challenges,
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   all the stuff you guys talk about,
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   it's part of the reason why I love the pod is like this is a unique voice
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   in the world that is pro-builder, pro-crypto.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   It's like we can change--
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   He legit listens to the pod, by the way.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   You've been on--you're really the seventh bestie in terms of appearance.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   Frequency.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   Yeah, in terms of frequency.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   You've been on twice.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   Anyway, I think that voice is so missing in our society,
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   and so I just love that you guys have taken the mantle on that.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   But, yeah, so anyway, my investments have followed along with that.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   Research Hub is trying to make scientific research
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   more like open-source software and make that more efficient.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   New Limit is doing research into longevity with epigenetic reprogramming.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   So I'm trying to use my own capital to further this
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   and just accelerate progress in the world, get people to build more stuff.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   And before we wrap, I want to mention one thing.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   Everybody clapped when I mentioned the voting situation next year with crypto
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   and how important that is.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   And we created this website, standwithcrypto.org.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   Everybody should go check out.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   We're trying to get people to raise their hand and say
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   that they want to stand up in our democracy
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   and make sure that the right rules get put in place for crypto.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   So if people can check out--
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   Which candidate is the most pro-crypto at this point?
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   I mean, I know RFK seems to be, right?
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   Yeah, I mean, it's been interesting--
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   and, by the way, Coinbase is apolitical,
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   but if anything in service of our mission around crypto, it's fair game.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   But a lot of the challenger presidential candidates have all been pretty pro-crypto.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   I mean, the Vake.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   I think Tim Scott is good on this.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   I think DeSantis is good on this.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   I think RFK.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   So I'm hoping this becomes a bigger issue in the presidential race.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   And, you know, the Biden administration with Warren and Gensler
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   has not been good for Americans on this dimension,
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   and it's pushed a lot of tech jobs overseas.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   How much of a crater has Sam Bankman fraud put on the industry?
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   It's definitely not good.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   I mean, it reminds me a little bit of Mt. Gox when that happened back in the day.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   And luckily, people turn the page on this thing,
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   and they move on after about a year, and so I think we're coming up on that.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   Have you met-- Did you meet with him?
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   I know he wanted to do business with you.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   At what point did you realize this guy was a complete sociopathic fraud?
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   You know, I wish I could have told you that I knew in advance.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   I had met him and spent time with him here and there periodically.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   You didn't know, right?
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   Sorry?
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   Didn't get a sense when you met him?
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   No, I got the sense that he was very smart
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   and that he was perhaps a bit reckless and young,
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   and I wondered at times, like, where is he getting all this liquidity
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   to go write these huge checks and everything?
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   I knew what our budget was, and I was like, I don't know where he was getting the money.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   Customer accounts.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   Apparently.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   Everyone said the same thing about Bernie Madoff, by the way.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   No one knew when they met him.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   No one meets the guy and says, "I think that guy's a fraud."
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   And what about CZ?
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   There's, like, every few months, there's something on Twitter that blows up
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   about how Binance is just-- there's something amiss.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   Yeah.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   You know, I don't want to comment on that.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   I've met CZ a number of times, too,
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   and I think he's done a lot of good things for crypto,
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   but I don't have any inside information into what's going on inside their house,
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   so we'll have to see.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   Ryan, I just want to say, you know, it's very brave, I think, the work you're doing.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   Both in terms of-- and we talked about it on the pod.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   People can refer to the episode about, you know, the cancel culture
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   and hysteria, you know, in people's Slack rooms,
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   and you getting focused and being a mission-driven CEO
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   that really wants to do good for people in the world who--
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   You and Toby, the two most seminal business CEO essays of the last two years.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   Yeah, and I think you turned the tide and made people really focused on what matters,
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   which is building products that help humanity,
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   and for that, we thank you.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   Thank you.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   [applause]
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   [music]
