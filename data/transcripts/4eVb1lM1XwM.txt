[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720]   One night we had childcare set up and instead of going out to a nice restaurant, going to have
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:12.640]   drinks, I think we actually snuck back into the house and just hung out watching TV and eating
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:19.040]   pizza and going to bed early. We just didn't even go out. And I don't even remember whether we told
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.520]   anyone that we were still in the house. I think they thought we left and we were in the basement
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.760]   in the office. I can't remember what we did exactly, but a date night does not have to be
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.560]   fancy. It's whatever you want it to be. I think it's just important to make sure, especially as
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:38.560]   you have kids, to just get out and have some time for you because that's something that I've talked
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.920]   to a handful of friends and they just lost that. And when I've encouraged people to bring it back,
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.520]   it was really awesome. And even tell their kids, "Hey, it's important for mommy and
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.160]   daddy to have some time together also." And they understand that. And I imagine someday we're
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.120]   going to be like, "Hey, do you guys want to plan something? You plan whatever we're doing for date
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.440]   night and we'll report back. We'll take pictures.
