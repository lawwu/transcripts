[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.680]   Welcome everybody to this little afternoon session of mine. I'll keep it very short but
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.240]   this is going to be the most exciting presentation of the day because I'm
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:26.520]   talking to you about construction. Thank you. We are Trunk Tools. Trunk Tools is
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.500]   the leading general AI provider for the construction industry which probably none
[00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.960]   of you have ever thought about it but you are consuming construction every
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.740]   single day. You're sitting in it right now, you're driving in it on your day home,
[00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:43.760]   on your right home and it is the most exciting industry in the world. I'm going
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.440]   to level set the stage here a little bit. This is a building that is being built in
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.120]   New York City right now and it's using our software. We asked this building to give
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.920]   us access to all the documentation, okay? Raise your hand if you think they give
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.600]   us access to more than a thousand pages. Come on, don't be shy. This is not an
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.940]   engineering conference. Keep your hand up if you think there's more than 10,000
[00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.140]   pages of documentation, 100,000 pages of documentation, a million pages of
[00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:12.740]   documentation to build a single skyscraper. They gave us access to a total of 3.6
[00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:19.820]   million pages of contract, okay? 3.6 million pages of pictures and blueprints and
[00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.500]   schedules and RFIs and all of this stuff. If you were to print that, a stack of paper, three
[00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.840]   times as high as the building itself. That's why I'm super excited about this industry and
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.600]   that's why this industry is literally built for RAC. That's why they put me up on this
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.840]   RAC stage here. Why do we have such a problem in construction doing this? There's massive amounts
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.600]   of people making decisions every single day and they're documenting the heck out of this
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.880]   because it's one of the most litigious industries that you will ever see. Similar to software
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.420]   development, right? Like, I have a PhD in AI and construction, so I kind of know what I'm
[00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.420]   talking about, but I'm not an expert. That's why we have better people on my team. But similar
[00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.460]   to software development, right? You have lots of people writing code, but once you merge it together,
[00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.640]   it actually breaks and you have bugs. In construction, that happens once you are in the field and you're
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.840]   trying to pour the concrete or you're trying to squeeze a pipe into a hole and it just doesn't fit.
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:19.380]   construction is $15 trillion a year. Trillion with a T. 10% of it is rework. 10% is because there's data
[00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:25.060]   discrepancies in this pile of data that the people don't know about it. $1.5 trillion US dollars every
[00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.340]   single year. And that's what we are solving. We are putting all of this knowledge in one place,
[00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.840]   which is what we call the brain behind construction, obviously a RAC product that goes in, perfectly
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.840]   digest and memorizes all of these construction specific file types. Yes, we built RAC specifically
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:48.260]   for a vertical. This vertical, however, is 10% of GDP. Once we have built this, we are deploying
[00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.960]   on top of this brain an army of AI-based agents. Agents are more or less intelligent and we can
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.220]   dive into this if you come to our booth a little bit later. I show you one of these agents live
[00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.160]   in practice in the field. This is a traditional copilot. You have all seen this a million times.
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.100]   You ask a question about your 3.6 million pages of construction data. Within a few seconds you
[00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:15.460]   get an answer and you obviously also want to source the original file document. Used on billions
[00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:21.220]   of the construction volume right now, I'm showing you an example from an actual construction site.
[00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:31.600]   Yes, a very important question on a construction site. The way this works for us, you throw this
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.720]   question against the system via text message or via web app. Within a few seconds we give
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.320]   you the enterprise search results and obviously we also give you a semantic answer to your actual
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.380]   question. Interestingly enough for anybody who actually wants to read what's up there, there's
[00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.840]   discrepancies in the answer. The answer itself shows that in the 3.6 million pages of documentation,
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.520]   actually somebody made a mistake and that mistake is going to be very very expensive.
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:00.140]   To give you a sense of the unstructured mess of data we are dealing with in construction,
[00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:07.320]   let me open one of these files. Beautiful. That's how we structure documentation in construction.
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:12.540]   Three feet wide tables with a ton of numbers, unusable for any human. That's why we're throwing
[00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.480]   AI against it. Obviously I was talking about data discrepancies. Instead of stopping where
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.600]   we have the data discrepancies, why don't you use an agent that is just actually creating
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:27.380]   an RFI and solving the discrepancy for the human so that the human can go back doing their job
[00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:33.000]   and not being a victim of bureaucracy. I'm on a RAC stage but personally I believe that RAC is
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.860]   completely commoditized. So what am I doing here? I'm here to tell you for whoever is building
[00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:44.520]   RAC that the future of RAC is actually keeping the human in the center and augmenting the human
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:50.040]   with an army of agents that is solving real life problems. Because if you actually want
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.880]   to have an impact in the real life then in my opinion vertical agents solving real world problems
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:01.120]   are the future. If you're interested in joining us on that path and being in the sexiest industry
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.360]   in the world, come join us at our booth in the expo hall. We're called Trunk Tools. Here's the QR code.
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.760]   We are hiring left and right and we're very excited to be dominating one of the most impactful industries
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.240]   in the world. Thank you.
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:30.920]   We'll see you next time.
