[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920]   What's happening at an individual company can be wildly different than what's happening
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.680]   with the market in general.
[00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.860]   When the market is down, there can be companies that are up, and when the market's up, there
[00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.920]   can be companies that are down.
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.540]   But when I'm deploying capital in my investment portfolio and trying to invest in individual
[00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:21.640]   businesses, what I'm trying to do is optimize at any given time for the best combination
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:28.520]   of high-quality businesses, according to criteria that I selected, times the highest long-term
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:34.080]   potential times the companies that are trading at the most attractive valuation at any given
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.080]   time.
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.400]   So it's really the combination of those things that I look to deploy my capital into at any
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.400]   given month.
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:46.040]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All the Hacks, a show about upgrading your life,
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.680]   money, and travel.
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.600]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I am excited you're here today to talk about investing.
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.800]   And we're joined by none other than Brian Feraldi.
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.020]   He's a financial educator and author of a new book called Why Does the Stock Market
[00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.520]   Go Up?
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.280]   Everything You Should Have Been Taught About Investing in School But Weren't.
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.080]   It comes out April 5th, but I got an advance copy, and I really enjoyed it.
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.400]   Brian has also written more than 3,000 articles on stocks, investing, and personal finance
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.160]   for The Motley Fool.
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.520]   But I got to know his content through the detailed investing checklists he publishes
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.520]   and follows for all his new investments.
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.640]   In our conversation, we'll talk about current market volatility, Brian's counterintuitive
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:36.320]   investing philosophy, making an investor checklist, evaluating risk, figuring out when to sell,
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.520]   taking asymmetric bets, and a lot more.
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.240]   That is so much to cover.
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.240]   So let's jump in.
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:49.160]   Brian, thanks for being here.
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.160]   Chris, awesome to be here.
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.000]   I'm pretty sure I'm a day one listener to this podcast, so it's cool to be on it.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   That is awesome.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.800]   Thank you for your support and for everyone else here listening.
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.560]   So you've got a book coming out in a few weeks, Why Does the Stock Market Go Up?
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.520]   And I was thinking about that this morning.
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.000]   And for anyone listening, we're recording on Wednesday, March 9th.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.120]   I was like, gosh, you know, in the last month, the market's down about 7%.
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:15.320]   But somehow today we're up 2.5%, which seems like some wild volatility.
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.400]   You wrote the book.
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.800]   How do you make sense of all this?
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.560]   Yeah, the last two years have been fascinating to watch as an investor.
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.140]   I mean, it was really February and March of 2020 when COVID was taking over.
[00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.000]   We saw the fastest bear market in stock market history, where over the course of a month,
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.480]   didn't matter what you did, whatever stock or fund that you held, it was going down and
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.040]   it was going down hard.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.240]   And then immediately after that, with everything changing in the world, I would have predicted
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.440]   that it was going to be a terrible year for the markets and a terrible year for investors.
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.240]   In fact, we saw the exact opposite, where stocks just shot up to the moon, and it was
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.560]   almost like the higher risk the stock, the better the stock did.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.720]   I mean, the numbers were off the charts good.
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.040]   And then over the last year, we've seen kind of reversal of that, when a lot of the stocks
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.280]   that were left behind in 2020 have since caught up, things like energy stocks and real estate
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:17.680]   stocks, and stocks that were the go-go stocks of 2020, things like Zoom and Roku and Peloton
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.400]   have just been train wrecks from an investing perspective.
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.960]   But that's just how investing works.
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:29.440]   Over the short term, what determines the value of any given stock or any given indice is
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.160]   just the collective emotions of all market participants, how investors feel about the
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.160]   markets.
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.160]   And that is always so hard to predict and so hard to read.
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.640]   So I view the stock market, what it's done over the last couple of years as fascinating,
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.160]   but entirely normal.
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.600]   Okay.
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.680]   And how do you think about calm times, volatile times?
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.680]   Are we in one of them?
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.520]   Are they all one and the same, and you should just prepare for them at any moment?
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.820]   Yeah, when you're investing in the stock market, you never know what you're going to get over
[00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.120]   any short period of time.
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.520]   That's why the stock market is a great, great place to put capital that you don't need for
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.480]   at least three to five years.
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.360]   But it's a really poor place to put money that you're going to need in any shorter period
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.360]   of time.
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.400]   So if you need money in the next three years for college or for a house or for a car, anything
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.300]   like that, there's a reason why people say don't put it in the market, because no matter
[00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:26.760]   how good times see right now, that doesn't mean that the market's going to perform well.
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.200]   The inverse is also true.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.400]   It looks pretty dark out there right now.
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.640]   We have a war going on, we have inflation going on, we have interest rates that are
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:35.640]   rising.
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:40.540]   Lots of high growth stocks have been pulverized and are down huge, but there's still no telling
[00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.840]   what the near term returns of the stock market are going to be.
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.360]   So it's really important that if you're going to invest in the market, which I think everybody
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.000]   should be doing with their long term capital, you have to do so in a way that allows you
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.480]   to endure short periods of extreme volatility, because that is the norm for the market.
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.500]   What advice do you have for people who are just today thinking about, wow, we are in
[00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.560]   this very volatile time.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.000]   Should they be investing right now?
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.120]   Is now a good time to get in the market?
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.360]   Or how do you feel about trying to time things like this?
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.840]   I never try and time things myself, because again, if you were to ask me what's going
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.200]   to happen in 2020, I would have said the market's going down.
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.880]   If you asked me what's going to happen in 2021, I would have said the market's going
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:19.880]   up.
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.480]   And I would have been wrong, essentially, on both accounts.
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:28.040]   So my own history with trying to time the market shows how poor I am at it.
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.000]   For that reason, I just say ignore the timing and when to get in.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.880]   Instead, just focus on being in the market and being a continual buyer of the market.
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.080]   It's just called dollar cost averaging.
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.800]   If you can dollar cost average for a long period of time, the timing of your buys becomes
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.000]   irrelevant.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.720]   Do you think there's at least some argument to if the market is down and you're able to
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:57.160]   see that that's the case to get in now, like people who invested after the crash in 2020?
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.160]   No, absolutely.
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.760]   I mean, the best time to buy the market is when it's on sale.
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:08.320]   However, predicting when those sales are going to be, it's always an endeavor that isn't
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.880]   really worth the time or even that hard to do.
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.360]   However, if you're the type of person that has cash on the sidelines, saving it for a
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.520]   time when the market does fall, I think right now is a great time to put extra capital in
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.800]   if you have that ability, with the foresight being that you don't know what's going to
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:25.800]   happen next.
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:33.320]   I think we're down 20% from the highs last year, which is officially in bear market territory,
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:37.480]   but that doesn't mean that stocks can't continue to fall further.
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:41.040]   If you're in that fortunate position of having cash that you've been waiting to invest and
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:49.100]   you're looking to do so, one trick that I like to tell people to do is come up with
[00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.160]   a schedule for investing that capital.
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:56.560]   Let's say you have, to make things easy, $5,000 and you want to invest $1,000 a month over
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:57.560]   the next five months.
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:01.840]   You don't know what's going to happen to the market over that time, but you just create
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.080]   a schedule for yourself.
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:08.560]   Well, if by chance you invest $1,000 on the first day, and then the next week the stock
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:15.880]   market falls 5% or 10%, then accelerate your next purchase early, and that way you can
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:20.760]   take advantage of that temporary dip and then just stick to the schedule thereafter.
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:25.880]   But if the stock market stays flat or goes up, you just stick to your regular investing
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:26.880]   schedule.
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:32.120]   That's one way that you can deploy capital more efficiently if you want to take advantage
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.120]   of dips.
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.200]   That makes sense.
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:38.540]   We haven't really talked about what to invest in, so before we get there, how do you think
[00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:41.280]   about building your own investment portfolio?
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:45.000]   I know there's a massive world of investments out there, and we've had on some folks like
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.760]   Andy Ratcliffe and Ben Carlson, and we've talked about passive investing and index funds
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:50.760]   and that kind of stuff.
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:53.440]   But for you personally, how do you think about your portfolio?
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:57.440]   I'm a massive fan of index funds, always have been, always will be.
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:02.160]   I think that index funds plus dollar cost averaging, as those gentlemen pointed out,
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:06.660]   is just a wonderful formula for building wealth over long periods of time.
[00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:09.520]   And that's what I personally do with all of my retirement funds.
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:14.400]   I just kind of set it up once to drip into, to steadily build into index funds, and that's
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:15.400]   what they do.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:21.920]   And with my capital that I have in my regular brokerage account, I love analyzing businesses,
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.760]   studying businesses, and buying individual stocks.
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:29.280]   I've been doing that personally for about 15 plus years now.
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:34.840]   So any capital that I have beyond my retirement funds, that's where I deploy it.
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:39.840]   So at any given time over the course of a month, I typically buy a handful of stocks
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:40.840]   myself.
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:47.720]   And to do so, I just created a list of companies that I'm interested in investing in, according
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.360]   to a checklist that I created.
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:53.360]   And prices are changing dynamically all the time.
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:57.960]   And what's so fascinating about if you invest in the individual company level, what's happening
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:03.760]   at an individual company can be wildly different than what's happening with the market in general.
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:06.960]   When the market is down, there can be companies that are up, and when the market's up, there
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.000]   can be companies that are down.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.600]   But when I'm deploying capital in my investment portfolio and trying to invest in individual
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:18.720]   businesses, what I'm trying to do is optimize at any given time for the best combination
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:25.600]   of high-quality businesses, according to criteria that I selected, times the highest long-term
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:31.160]   potential times the companies that are trading at the most attractive valuation at any given
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:32.160]   time.
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:36.440]   So it's really the combination of those things that I look to deploy my capital into at any
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:37.440]   given month.
[00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:39.600]   So I want to get into those three things.
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.880]   But before that, how do you think about risk-taking?
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:48.040]   Do you think of your single-stock investing as a more portfolio approach where you can
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:52.360]   kind of diversify amongst stocks and it's actually not quite as risky?
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:57.840]   Or I think if you talk to most passive investors, they would say, "Gosh, if you go buy a stock,
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:58.840]   that's really risky.
[00:09:58.840 --> 00:09:59.840]   You don't want to do that.
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:00.840]   You want to bet on the market."
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:04.680]   So how do you think your type of stock investing fits into general investing risk?
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.760]   Yeah, I think that they're actually two of the same.
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:09.080]   It really depends on how you are investing.
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:12.200]   When most people think about investing in individual stocks or businesses, what they're
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:17.680]   really trying to think about is timing the market and trading stocks, trying to buy them
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:20.220]   when they're low and sell them when they're high.
[00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:23.000]   And I have no interest in trading stocks myself.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.480]   I view the portfolio, the investments that I'm making outside of my retirement funds,
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.880]   as essentially building my own index fund.
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:36.360]   So my style of investing is I look for high-quality businesses that I think can grow for many,
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:37.560]   many, many years.
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:43.240]   I buy those companies and I try and hold them as long as they remain great businesses.
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:46.400]   So I'm not trying to trade in and trade out of companies.
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:49.080]   I move my portfolio very, very slowly.
[00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:56.440]   So what I'm trying to do is handpick, essentially, my own index fund and let those businesses
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:58.320]   grow for long periods of time.
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:02.840]   I know you're a fan of the investment policy or investment policy statement.
[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:08.280]   How have you used that concept, and for anyone who isn't familiar, maybe walk through what
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:11.100]   it is to guide your investing decision?
[00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:15.920]   I think this is something that so many people overlook when they start investing, is they
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:21.280]   don't really sit down and write down why they're investing in the first place.
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:22.920]   They just think, "I have some money.
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.600]   This stock thing sounds interesting.
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.720]   I'm just going to do that."
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:29.640]   But I think it's really important to take a step back and ask yourself, "What is the
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:31.440]   purpose of this capital?
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:35.560]   Why am I choosing it to invest it in any given way?"
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:40.040]   One tool that you can use to do that is just called an investor policy statement.
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:45.480]   Just a very simple set of rules that you set up for yourself before you start investing,
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:49.320]   and you can use it to guide your decision making over time.
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:57.320]   For me, for example, my long-term investing goal is to grow my capital over long periods
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:02.760]   of time for as long as possible at as high of a rate as possible, while simultaneously
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:06.720]   assuming as little business risk as possible.
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:10.680]   Now, business risk means that the companies that I'm investing in, I actually think are
[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.800]   low-risk businesses.
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:17.040]   That doesn't mean that their stocks aren't high-risk and very volatile, but the underlying
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:21.660]   businesses that I invest in are actually fairly low-risk businesses.
[00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:27.260]   All capital that I put into the market, I don't plan on touching for at least five years,
[00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:33.160]   and all of my short-term capital needs are funded by cash that I have on hand, and then
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:37.600]   income from mine and my wife's jobs.
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:42.820]   Because of that, we actually take a very conservative approach to our personal finances.
[00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:50.200]   We have a large emergency fund, we have a high savings rate, we have multiple sources
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:56.120]   of income, we have no debt of any kind, so our personal finances are very, very conservative.
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:13:02.640]   By doing that, that allows us to essentially, with our investment portfolio, be 100% stocks
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:05.600]   and 0% bonds.
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:09.960]   That in itself means that my portfolio is going to be far more volatile than the average
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:13.480]   portfolio that has a mix of cash or a mix of bonds in there.
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:18.840]   However, I'm perfectly fine with that volatility because I know that any money that I put into
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:24.640]   there, I don't need to touch for a period of years, but I think that people could do
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:28.760]   so much better for themselves if they just sat down and asked themselves, "The money
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:32.720]   that I'm going to put into the markets, what's its purpose?
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:37.320]   What are my investing goals, and how long can I keep it in there?"
[00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.320]   I like that.
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:43.260]   Is there a place to get some examples, maybe your book or your website, of those policy
[00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.840]   statements and how to start thinking about writing one?
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:49.760]   Yeah, now that you're saying that, I missed a big opportunity by not putting it into my
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:50.760]   book.
[00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:53.960]   But if you just Google the terms "investor policy statement," there's lots of examples
[00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:56.320]   online that you can use as a guide.
[00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:57.320]   Cool.
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:58.320]   Okay.
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:02.800]   And so you've got your policy statement, and now let's move on to this process of finding
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:05.520]   something to invest in, to start building out that portfolio.
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:09.160]   I know you're pretty well known for creating an investing checklist.
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:12.640]   So where did that come from, and how has it evolved?
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:13.960]   And talk a little bit more about it.
[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:14.960]   Sure.
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:19.440]   So if you're into investing, as I am, I started to research.
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:23.360]   It's not hard to find companies to invest in once you know what to look for.
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:27.420]   I mean, there's so many places that you can get investing ideas, whether it's following
[00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:32.440]   some big, famous investors like Warren Buffett or Cathie Wood, reading free articles that
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:37.240]   are online, cracking open exchange-traded funds, looking at your own life and seeing
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:41.640]   what products or services do I use or does my company use.
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:43.840]   The list of potential investments that you can make is huge.
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:48.420]   I mean, there's thousands of publicly-traded companies for anybody to invest in.
[00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:52.960]   When I first started out, I quickly became overwhelmed with choice, and I was essentially
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:58.440]   trying to think in my own head, "Well, this business I really like because it's run by
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:03.400]   its founder and it has a great balance sheet, but this other business has great margins,
[00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:07.640]   high long-term potential, and there are all these factors that I was trying to keep in
[00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:10.080]   my head to weigh investments against each other."
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:15.120]   Turns out that's a really poor way to do it because our brains are not built that way.
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:20.720]   Finally, I got smart enough to say, "Maybe I should write this down and create some rules
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:24.360]   for myself that I can use to guide my decision making."
[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:28.520]   I would suggest that everybody that invests in anything beyond index funds goes through
[00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:30.560]   this very process themselves.
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:36.480]   First, write down all of the attributes that would make any investment, a stock investment
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:39.080]   for example, attractive to you.
[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:43.880]   I did that, and I came up with things like, "I want the management team to have a high
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:46.160]   percentage of ownership percentage.
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:49.120]   I wanted the revenue to be growing at a very high rate.
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:51.440]   I wanted revenue to be recurring in nature.
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:52.960]   I wanted it to be profitable.
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:57.760]   I wanted the company's balance sheet, how much cash it has, to far outweigh how much
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:00.320]   debt that it has," et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:05.000]   I made a list of 30 things that I really wanted in any investment that I made.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.800]   Simultaneously, I made another list, which is, "What are all the things that I don't
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.200]   want to see in an investment that I make?"
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:14.960]   For me, that's things like, "I don't like it when a company gets the majority of its
[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:19.720]   revenue from just a handful of customers," that's called customer concentration.
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:24.840]   "I don't like it when a company is operating in an industry that I think is actively being
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:28.400]   disrupted, like the oil and gas industry right now.
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:31.440]   I think it's primed for disruption over the next 10 or 20 years.
[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:34.400]   I don't want to make any investments in that.
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:38.360]   I don't like it when a company's stock-based compensation, the amount of options that they
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:43.840]   hand out to employees, is such a high rate that the dilution rate is high," et cetera,
[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:44.840]   et cetera.
[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:47.080]   I have my list of things that I'm looking for.
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:52.120]   I have my list of things that I don't want to see, and then I rank them in order of most
[00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:55.360]   important to least important.
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:59.940]   That's a tricky exercise to do when you really have to force yourself to rank things against
[00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:02.440]   each other, but it's so useful to do so.
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:08.440]   Finally, I have both of those things in place, and I just applied a very simple scoring system
[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:13.960]   to weigh my criteria based on the factors that are most important to me, and the same
[00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:16.960]   goes for the factors that I'm not looking for.
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:22.320]   I just came up with a simple 100-point scoring system where I doled out 100 points in total
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:26.220]   based on the factors that I just listed.
[00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:32.320]   From there, I now have my criteria built out, so I can take any company that I come across,
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:37.460]   I can research it, and as I'm researching it, I'm filling out this checklist.
[00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:42.400]   At the end, when this process is all done, I get to know whether a company is a match
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:46.300]   for what I'm looking for in investment or not.
[00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:52.460]   From there, after you do this, I've done this now hundreds of times, I have a list of companies
[00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:57.360]   that are very attractive to me as an investor, and simultaneously, I have another group of
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:03.200]   companies that there's just no way I'm going to invest in.
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:08.380]   The process of creating a checklist for myself, ranking it, and scoring it has helped to clarify
[00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:11.120]   my decision-making so much.
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:13.680]   I have so many follow-up questions right now.
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:17.320]   I'm trying to take notes to organize them.
[00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:18.320]   A few things.
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:21.600]   One, you make this checklist of your own available on your website, correct?
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:22.600]   Yep.
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:23.600]   I made it freely downloadable.
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:24.600]   Yep.
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:26.600]   We'll make sure we link to that in the show notes.
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:30.520]   As you were walking through your criteria, it made me think, "Gosh, I'm not sure even
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:34.000]   I have an opinion on these things.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.100]   Is this something that takes years of playing in the stock market to build?
[00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:43.460]   Do I care about whether there are a lot of options granted to employees?"
[00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:47.920]   These seem like things that the average person might not have an opinion on.
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:52.800]   Where do you suggest people get started, or is it best to use someone else's list, or
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:56.360]   is there a way to educate yourself on why you may or may not care about some of these
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:57.360]   things?
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:58.360]   Yeah.
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:03.320]   The checklist as it exists today is a constantly evolving process.
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:08.840]   What it is today is through trial, error, and most importantly, feedback that I've gotten
[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:11.960]   from other smart investors that I respect.
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:17.080]   By studying the styles of great investors that I deeply respect, I find out what really
[00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:21.960]   matters to them, and then I took that and evolved it into what matters to me.
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:25.960]   I don't claim that the version that I have right now is "perfect."
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:30.840]   It's just the best version that I've come up with so far.
[00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:36.760]   To your point, all of these things do take time to research.
[00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:41.440]   If you want to go through the process of researching a stock, there's a lot that you have to learn.
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:42.440]   You have to learn accounting.
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:43.440]   You have to learn how to read SEC filings.
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:49.140]   You have to learn how to think about competitive advantages, studying the competition, thinking
[00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:52.460]   through the business model, studying potential risks.
[00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:55.120]   There's a lot to evaluating individual stocks.
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:58.000]   This is a big reason why so many people say, "Forget all that.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.360]   Just stick with index funds."
[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:01.720]   It's so much easier to do that.
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:08.200]   This process, I think, is a good process if you're in that 1% or 2% of the population
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:12.560]   that is really fascinated by business the way that I am and is really interested in
[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:15.480]   studying the subject.
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.600]   That's why I created this.
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:21.720]   I absolutely love everything about investing in research companies, but I'm right there
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:22.720]   with you.
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:23.720]   This is a time-consuming process.
[00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:26.880]   It just turns off a lot of people.
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.600]   If there are specific companies that people listening to this are thinking about, I've
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:30.600]   actually gone and...
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:34.400]   Brian has a YouTube page where you actually break down going through your checklist for
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:35.400]   different companies.
[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:39.640]   So I'll just give that a shout out because I thought that was really fun to go and look
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.320]   at a couple companies.
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:43.840]   And then even some where I think like Peloton is a great example.
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:47.860]   You did one and then you came back and did a recheck in because it had been an interesting
[00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:49.080]   adventure for that company.
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:52.720]   Yeah, we got that one wrong.
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:53.720]   And that happens, right?
[00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:55.880]   That's why you're making more than one bet.
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:59.480]   But what you said about it taking a lot of time.
[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:04.840]   If someone listening to this is like, "Gosh, index fund investing is fine, but there's
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:06.600]   some companies that I like."
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:11.320]   Is there a place for trying to invest in those stocks that, whether you like them or you
[00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:15.200]   think they're exciting or the company has potential, that doesn't need to take this
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:16.200]   much time?
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:19.280]   Or is your general advice, if you're not going to take the time, you probably shouldn't do
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:20.280]   it?
[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:25.200]   The best advice that I can give there would be always think about your overall asset allocation.
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:29.000]   So some people say that stock picking is a complete waste of time, they're not interested
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   in it.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.880]   Fine, just stick with 100% index funds and call it a day.
[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:35.800]   But I think there's room for a happy medium in the middle.
[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:41.920]   There are some people that I think should put say 90% or 95% of their assets into index
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:42.920]   funds.
[00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:45.880]   But if they have a hunkering or there's some businesses that they're really interested
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:50.720]   in or they want to research, I see nothing wrong with taking a few percent of your overall
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:54.800]   portfolio and putting it into investments that you pick out.
[00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:59.080]   So if you can pick say five companies or something like that, that you're really passionate about
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:03.680]   and put one or 2% of your portfolio in it, even if you're wrong, even if the process
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:06.800]   that you go through, or if you don't want to do the research, you just want to make
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:11.280]   an investment in those companies, even if you're wrong about them, well, 90% of your
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:14.640]   net worth is perfectly fine and put in the market.
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:18.000]   So if you don't want to go through the research process and you just want to put a little
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.440]   bit of capital in, I think that's fine so long as you size it appropriately.
[00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:27.960]   As I walk through what you're saying, I'm realizing that you're presenting us all with
[00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:35.480]   an option for building a part of your long-term diversified portfolio on your own with stocks.
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:39.720]   So I think some people listening might think, "Well, gosh, the advice is usually it's okay
[00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:46.240]   to take some bets with 5% of your portfolio, but be safe with 95%."
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:50.720]   You echoed that sentiment, but you've said, "Look, if you take the 95%, there's a different
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:55.040]   way than index funds that you could invest that 95%."
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:58.680]   And for you, it sounds like some of it is index funds, but some of it is building a
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:02.520]   portfolio of a lot of stocks that you spend time and research on.
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:08.240]   Do you think that the type of stock investing you're doing is more like passive investing,
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:13.880]   or is it more like the kind of wild bets people often say they're taking with stocks?
[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:16.960]   And I ask that because it feels like it actually is more like passive investing.
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:24.320]   Yeah, if you crack open the S&P 500, you might naturally think that you're diversified equally
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:26.440]   across 500 companies.
[00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:27.960]   That's actually not the case.
[00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:33.640]   The S&P 500 is weighed by market capitalization, meaning the larger the company, the bigger
[00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:36.680]   a portion of the S&P 500 that is.
[00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:40.760]   Now, there's still 500 companies in there, but if you look at the giant companies that
[00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:50.600]   are in there, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, etc., they take up a pretty sizable portion of the portfolio.
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:54.700]   Last time I looked, they were at least 3% or 4% each.
[00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:59.760]   So, those businesses, the market is saying, "If you're investing in the S&P 500, you have
[00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:04.620]   a higher concentration of your funds in those businesses just by the nature of investing
[00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:06.240]   in an index fund."
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:11.360]   To your point, with the vast majority of my capital, especially the capital that's outside
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:15.560]   of retirement funds, I don't think that I'm taking on a huge amount of risk because I
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:24.360]   own a collection of a few dozen stocks, but the top 20 stocks that I have have earned
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:29.560]   their spot in my portfolio, meaning I bought these companies a long time ago and I just
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:34.040]   got them right, that they just happen to be great companies that grew and grew and grew.
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:38.760]   For that reason, when a company does very, very well on the markets, it's typically because
[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:42.080]   the business underneath it is succeeding.
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:49.680]   One of my top holdings is Google, which I bought 13 years ago now at this point.
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:54.200]   It's grown into a top holding for me, not because I set out to make it a top holding,
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:57.920]   but I just bought it many, many years ago and have just held onto it.
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:01.760]   If you look at Google's business alphabet, as it's called Google's business today, it's
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:04.820]   an extremely reliable blue chip company.
[00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:07.360]   The company has hundreds of billions of dollars that come in.
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:13.760]   It generates huge profitability, it has a war chest balance sheet, and it's still growing
[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:14.760]   to this day.
[00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:20.240]   If you're invested in the S&P 500 Index Fund or Total Stock Market Index Fund, it's a top
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:22.440]   holding for you, too.
[00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:26.760]   I don't think what I'm doing with my portfolio, since I'm diversified, since I'm buying good
[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:30.640]   businesses, and since I'm holding them for long periods of time, is all that drastically
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:33.680]   different than people that just invest in index funds.
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:37.260]   It's just more time intensive, and that's okay with me.
[00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:40.240]   We talked a lot about different types of stock buying, but one thing I noticed you never
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:45.240]   mentioned you cared about, or at least I didn't hear, was what's the price of the stock right
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:46.240]   now?
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:47.680]   Is that even a factor in when you make a decision?
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:51.760]   That is such a confusing thing about investing.
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:56.080]   In fact, when I first started investing, I had no clue about the relationship between
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:58.720]   price and market cap.
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:04.120]   So many people, I thought that the success in individual investing was looking for companies
[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:07.320]   that trade at a very low share price.
[00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:11.120]   A lot of my first investments, "investments" in air quotes, because I had no idea what
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:13.480]   I was doing, was in penny stocks.
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:17.560]   It turns out that penny stocks have the reputation they have because they're typically places
[00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:20.260]   that you can go to destroy capital.
[00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:25.520]   So many of my first forays into the market were buying awful businesses solely because
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:27.640]   their share price was really low.
[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:33.640]   Again, the way that prices work in the stock market is so different than the way prices
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:38.320]   work in every other consumer good that we buy that it's naturally very confusing.
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:43.160]   If you were to go in the market and find a company that was trading at $500 per share,
[00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:48.880]   and you found another one that was trading $5 per share and say, "Which one is more expensive?"
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:52.120]   Only in investing can you say, "Not enough information."
[00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:58.280]   The stock that's trading at $500 per share might be less expensive, might be a better
[00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:03.840]   bargain price than the stock that's trading at $5 per share.
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:09.400]   The reason for that is the value of a company is made up of two things, or the equity of
[00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:11.080]   a company is two things.
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:15.740]   One, the dollar price of a share, which is the number that's quoted everywhere that
[00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:16.740]   you look, right?
[00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:19.920]   You go on Google, you open the stocks app on your phone, what do you see?
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:22.400]   You see the price of one share.
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:26.880]   However, what you don't often see is the market capitalization of the company.
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:30.740]   That is like the dollar value of the company's total equity.
[00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:36.640]   To find that number, you have to look at how many shares exist at a company.
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:39.920]   Here's something that not many people know.
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:45.000]   The number of shares that exist at a company is a totally arbitrary number that the company
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.320]   chose.
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:50.920]   A company can go out there and say, "I want to have a million shares of stock," or that
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:56.160]   same company could say, "I want to have a billion shares of stock."
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:28:00.420]   What we look at when we're looking at the price isn't enough information to tell us
[00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:05.680]   if that company is trading at an attractive number or if it's cheap or if it's expensive.
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:10.360]   However, that's such a counterintuitive thing that so many people assume the dollar price
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:13.400]   of a stock will tell you what you need to know about the company.
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:18.360]   Two follow-ups, one is, so the valuation of the company or the market cap is something
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:21.040]   that you do pay attention to when deciding to invest?
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:22.040]   Is that what I'm hearing?
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:23.040]   Yes.
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:28.960]   I care much more about the market capitalization of a company than they do about the dollar
[00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:32.040]   price of one share.
[00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:36.200]   If I'm analyzing a company, one of the first things I look at is the market cap.
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:39.760]   That will give you a rough size about the total value of the business.
[00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:44.200]   The reason I focus on that is, when I'm looking to make an investment in a company, I typically
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:48.660]   want to buy companies or add companies to my portfolio that I think I can at least earn
[00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:53.680]   a 5X return on, or better yet, a 10X return on.
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:59.280]   The size of a business is going to show me how hard that is for that company to do that.
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:04.920]   For example, if I come across a company and it's trading at a $1 billion valuation, that's
[00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:09.840]   the size of the market cap, well, for me to earn a 10X return on that company, all things
[00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:15.320]   else held equally, that company would have to grow into a $10 billion valuation.
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:19.240]   There's lots of companies out there that are currently worth $10 billion, $50 billion,
[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:21.840]   $100 billion, or more.
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:26.320]   It doesn't take a huge amount of imagination to believe that a company can grow from $1
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:28.600]   billion to $10 billion.
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:34.560]   Conversely, if you come across a company like Apple, for example, Apple's market capitalization
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:36.600]   is currently enormous.
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:44.120]   The company is currently trading at $2.7 trillion.
[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:51.200]   For Apple to grow five times in value from here, it would have to be essentially an $11
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:55.120]   or $12 trillion company.
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:30:01.000]   That is such a gargantuanly huge number that I personally have a really hard time seeing
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.720]   Apple ever do that.
[00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:07.160]   I'm not going to say it's never going to happen, but holy cow, is that a lot of market
[00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:13.360]   capitalization that has to be added onto Apple for it to stock to 5X from here.
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:17.540]   That's why I'm really focused on the market capitalization of a company, not the dollar
[00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:19.040]   price of one share.
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:20.280]   How does that change over time?
[00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:25.920]   You mentioned one of your investments early on was Google.
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:30.880]   Even though it's clear that in the last 13 years, Google probably did 5X the business,
[00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:34.800]   but now let's say you're looking at it and you think, "Gosh, now it's a lot harder.
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:35.800]   It might be for Apple."
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:39.920]   Does that mean you have to get out or how do you think about exiting positions that
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:40.920]   you've made?
[00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:46.600]   When I first made an investment in Google, it was far, far, far smaller than it was today.
[00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:53.760]   The market capitalization was well under $100 billion when I started buying it.
[00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:56.600]   Today I'm quite happy to continue holding Google.
[00:30:56.600 --> 00:31:01.720]   I do not expect Google to 5X in any period of time.
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:07.140]   Google is a $1.7 trillion company, so for it to 5X, it would have to be a $9 trillion company.
[00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:11.120]   I'd be very happy with that outcome, but I don't think that it's going to happen.
[00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:17.160]   Instead, I view Google as a part of my portfolio that is more of a bedrock anchor, something
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:22.620]   that I think can grow at a low double-digit rate, but I don't expect the company to deliver
[00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:25.260]   a 5X return from here.
[00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:31.720]   In general, while I'm very happy as a Google shareholder, I'm interested in buying this
[00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:33.860]   company today.
[00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:38.060]   I would be more interested and likely to sell it to fund purchases of other companies that
[00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:43.100]   I think have higher growth potential, but I'm not going to sell a company solely because
[00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:46.500]   it's huge if I've owned that company for a long period of time and I'm still happy to
[00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:47.500]   own it.
[00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:49.300]   When do you decide to sell?
[00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:54.660]   Whether it was a pick that didn't work out or a company that's worked out and now doesn't
[00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:56.500]   have that potential.
[00:31:56.500 --> 00:32:00.900]   I can tell people listening that I have some random stocks I've invested over the years
[00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:03.220]   and I personally am struggling.
[00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:04.220]   When do you exit?
[00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:07.500]   How do you help people think about when's it time to either cut your losses if it's
[00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:10.220]   down or take your gains off the table?
[00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:11.220]   Yes.
[00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:12.220]   First off, let's acknowledge something.
[00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:19.620]   Knowing when to buy a stock is much easier than knowing when to sell a stock.
[00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:23.060]   It's much more fun for me to research and think about companies that can grow in value
[00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:25.620]   than it is to be on the other side of the transaction.
[00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:30.380]   However, there are some reasons that I think a stock should be sold.
[00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:33.340]   First and foremost, the number one reason to sell a stock or the number one reason that
[00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:37.220]   I sell a stock, and it's the most common, is I was wrong.
[00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:42.340]   I came up with a thesis for a company, I thought that the company was going to grow to take
[00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:46.540]   advantage of a blank market opportunity and I thought the company had an advantage over
[00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:48.160]   its rivals.
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:53.460]   If that proves to be incorrect, if the company is clearly struggling to execute that and
[00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:58.660]   I am proven wrong, I have no problem saying, "Well, I got that one wrong," and selling
[00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:02.700]   to be deployed in my capital into something else.
[00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:09.540]   Two, if I'm right about a company and it grows to be too large a position in my portfolio
[00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:14.820]   and I'm too concentrated in that company, that is a situation where I'm also happy to
[00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:17.540]   trim that company over time.
[00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:21.920]   More recently, I personally trimmed a little bit off of my position in Tesla, not because
[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:25.700]   I don't think Tesla is a great company with a bright future ahead, but Tesla has grown
[00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:30.860]   to be my No. 1 position by far, simply because of how well that company has done, and I've
[00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:34.540]   been trimming my position surely for risk management purposes.
[00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:40.640]   So, that's a happy reason to sell a stock, in my opinion.
[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:46.720]   Number three, if you have a better use for that capital, so if you're no longer interested
[00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:50.640]   in following a company or own a company, and it might be a lukewarm investment, but you
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:54.820]   find another investment that you're more interested in, I see nothing wrong with selling the one
[00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:59.580]   that you're not interested in to buy more of the one that you are interested in.
[00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:04.820]   The best reason of all to sell is that you need the money for your personal life, right?
[00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:09.220]   The whole reason we invest in the first place is to grow our capital so that we can live
[00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:10.220]   a better life.
[00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:14.900]   So, I see nothing wrong with selling a stock if you need to use that money for a purchase
[00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:15.900]   that you have.
[00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:20.160]   So, I think one takeaway for me out of this is the best I can remember, I'm going to go
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:24.660]   through the handful of stocks I own and try to write down why I invested them in the first
[00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:25.660]   place.
[00:34:25.660 --> 00:34:32.060]   And that'll give me a place to look to decide when it's appropriate to sell, because maybe
[00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:33.340]   I don't believe in that thing anymore.
[00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:37.240]   One thing that I personally do, and I'm a big advocate for, in addition to writing an
[00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:40.860]   investor policy statement for yourself, is to keep an investing journal.
[00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:46.980]   So, every time that I go and I buy a stock, I just write down what stock I'm buying, a
[00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:52.540]   few words on why I'm buying it, and also the valuation that I'm paying at the time of my
[00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:53.540]   purchase.
[00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:58.340]   It's obviously time-intensive to do that, but so often if we buy a stock, it's not all
[00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:05.300]   that uncommon for us to change our thesis over time as the business results come in,
[00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:10.260]   and to your point, it's really helpful to have an anchor point to look back and say,
[00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:15.740]   what was I thinking at the time of this purchase, and to match up the reality that the business
[00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:19.700]   is doing against your initial predictions for those businesses.
[00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:23.940]   If those two things are mismatched for the worst, that can be a sign that that company
[00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:26.900]   is no longer for you and it's time to sell that company.
[00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:32.220]   But again, broadly speaking, buying is much more fun than selling, and knowing when to
[00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:34.620]   sell a stock is very, very hard.
[00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:37.060]   So we talked about buying, we talked about selling.
[00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:38.460]   What about adding to a position?
[00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:42.260]   Is that something you find yourself doing over time and how do you decide that you want
[00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:43.460]   to double down?
[00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:47.020]   I don't invest all the capital that I'm going to invest in a company up front.
[00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:52.980]   I tend to buy in small chunks over periods of time that are spaced out periods of months,
[00:35:52.980 --> 00:36:00.580]   and I do so because I know from my own track record that I'm often wrong.
[00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:05.820]   A company can check a lot of the boxes that I look for in a business, but that business
[00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:10.820]   still has to go on and execute against the opportunity that it presents for itself.
[00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:16.020]   Sometimes new competition can come along or the market can change.
[00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:19.980]   It's common for me to be completely wrong about a stock.
[00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:26.780]   So when I'm looking to add to a position over time, what I'm attempting to do is two things.
[00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:31.280]   First, I'm looking to invest in companies that are winning.
[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:33.000]   That's a very counterintuitive thing.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.340]   Most people think, "Oh, I bought a stock for $10.
[00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:37.340]   It went to $20.
[00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:39.540]   I can't buy any more of that stock.
[00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:41.620]   It was at $10 before, now it's at $20."
[00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:45.780]   Conversely, they buy a stock at $10, it falls to $5, and that's the one that they're interested
[00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:48.700]   in adding to because it's at a lower price.
[00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:52.380]   What I've actually discovered the hard way is that more often than not, it's actually
[00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:55.980]   better to take additional capital and put it into the company that's already doubled
[00:36:55.980 --> 00:37:00.300]   for you as opposed to the one that's already halved for you.
[00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:03.860]   The reason that companies go up and their stocks tend to do well is because something
[00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:09.380]   about the underlying business is succeeding, and Wall Street is recognizing that that business
[00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:10.380]   is succeeding.
[00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:15.660]   Conversely, if a stock is underperforming the market, that's a sign that the company
[00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:20.900]   is having a hard time succeeding and it's not meeting investors' expectations.
[00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:28.300]   Broadly speaking, winners tend to keep on winning and losers tend to keep on losing.
[00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:32.220]   So when I'm looking to add to companies, I'm typically looking at the companies that are
[00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:37.660]   winning in my portfolio first, and those are the ones I'm actually adding to.
[00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:41.740]   So I think some people might hear that and think, "Wow, that sounds a lot like the opposite
[00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:44.920]   of the tried-and-true buy low, sell high.
[00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:48.980]   That sounds like buy high, sell low," which I think everyone says that's what you shouldn't
[00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:49.980]   do.
[00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:56.540]   How do you juxtapose what you just said with what I would say is pretty commonly believed
[00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:59.620]   advice, maybe you disagree with it, of buy low, sell high?
[00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:05.340]   Well, I think it's helpful to actually look at some studies of investing and how the market
[00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:10.420]   actually works, which are hidden from us if you're investing in just index funds.
[00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:15.620]   JPMorgan did this wonderful study where they looked at thousands of companies, publicly
[00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:22.140]   traded companies, over a period of 30 years, and they looked at the returns of those companies.
[00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:27.740]   What they found was that if you bought 10 companies, if you put your capital into 10
[00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:32.220]   companies, 10 random companies, what you can expect is that four of those companies will
[00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:38.360]   suffer a catastrophic loss and stay down permanently.
[00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:47.140]   Three of those companies will go up in value, but they will underperform the market in general.
[00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:48.700]   That leaves three other companies.
[00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:54.300]   Two of those companies will be modest market beaters, and one of those companies will deliver
[00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:57.420]   multi-bagger returns.
[00:38:57.420 --> 00:39:03.420]   What actually drives the market forward over time is actually a very small minority of
[00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:04.420]   companies.
[00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:08.260]   It's really about the top 10% of companies or so, so one out of 10, that are literally
[00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:14.740]   responsible for 90% of the market's returns over long periods of time.
[00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:18.180]   When I've looked at that and I've studied some investors that have taught me, again,
[00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:22.700]   this really counterintuitive lesson, what you actually want to do is it really matters
[00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:27.740]   that you get some of your portfolio to include some of those 10% of companies that are the
[00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:29.060]   mega winners.
[00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:31.140]   What do mega winners have in common?
[00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:35.060]   Their stocks have already gone up a lot.
[00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:40.860]   If you think back to some of the mega winners that are today, Tesla, Google, Apple, Netflix,
[00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:47.320]   Chipotle, if you bought those companies after their stock doubled, tripled, or quadrupled,
[00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:53.500]   you then went on to earn a massive return, even after their stocks were up huge.
[00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:57.900]   That's why it can actually be a good sign if a company's stock is going up.
[00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:02.660]   That's an indication that the business model is working and that Wall Street is recognizing
[00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:04.420]   that the business model is working.
[00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:11.340]   Conversely, if you want to buy a stock that has lost badly to the market, underperformed
[00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:16.820]   the market, history shows that the chances are pretty good it's in that 7 out of 10 stocks
[00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:21.060]   that is going to permanently underperform the market.
[00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:26.940]   I think the phrase "buy low, sell high" sounds really good in theory, but when you actually
[00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:31.620]   get into the actual practicality of investments, some of the best investments that I've ever
[00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:40.020]   made was buying stocks that were already up big and were at all-time highs.
[00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:44.940]   My conversation with Andy Ratcliffe was that some of the best investors are quite contrarian.
[00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:48.660]   I like that you're taking a different approach, and I'm glad we got to dig into some of the
[00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:50.500]   data about it.
[00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:54.760]   We talked a lot about ways to invest, but I want to ask what platform you're doing this
[00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:59.080]   on and if it makes any of the things you're doing easier.
[00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:05.380]   You mentioned buying a stock, maybe you want to deploy over time, but gosh, let's say you
[00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:11.800]   wanted to put $500 into Google today, there's not an easy way to say, "I want to put $500
[00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:14.880]   for the next five months," and then stop.
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:16.800]   At least I'm not familiar with one.
[00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:21.040]   Is there an investing site that you like or recommend that makes some of those kinds of
[00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:22.040]   things easy?
[00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:26.320]   I'm pretty sure that M1 Finance has done many of those things with like, you can create
[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:31.800]   a pie for your portfolio, and as you put capital into it, it automatically allocates, and you
[00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:35.560]   don't have to worry about things like buying exactly one share, you can buy fractional
[00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:36.560]   shares.
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:40.680]   To answer your question, though, the broker that I use is called Interactive Brokers.
[00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:46.360]   I signed up with them like nine years ago, and what I liked about them is actually, it's
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:48.560]   a hassle to use their system.
[00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:55.000]   It is a pain in the butt to log in, and once you're in, buying and selling is easy, just
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:59.920]   like it is on any other platform, but I actually like that there's friction to the platform.
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:05.520]   I don't use any app on my phone because I don't want trading to be an easy thing for
[00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:06.520]   me.
[00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:10.780]   The easier trading is, the easier it is to buy or sell, the more tempted I would be to
[00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:13.080]   do it when I'm feeling emotional.
[00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:17.800]   If I owned a stock and that stock was down big or up big in response to whatever the
[00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:25.440]   news of the day, I'm a human, I would be emotionally, my decision-making skills would be compromised
[00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:27.520]   because of what I was seeing on the screen.
[00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:32.360]   I also use Interactive Brokers, and it's funny, it's one of the few products that I've probably
[00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:37.080]   never even mentioned I use on this show because I think most people would hate it.
[00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:38.080]   Yes.
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:39.080]   I agree.
[00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:40.080]   (laughs)
[00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:41.080]   It is...
[00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:42.520]   The interface is difficult.
[00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:47.120]   I'm often unsure of how to find things and have to read long manuals.
[00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:53.120]   But for me, the other big perk of Interactive Brokers is that if you need to borrow against
[00:42:53.120 --> 00:43:00.080]   your portfolio, the amount of interest many institutions charge is very high.
[00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:03.240]   And so Interactive Brokers is quite low.
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:07.080]   At Wealthfront, we have a portfolio line of credit that's also low for index funds.
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:10.020]   And everywhere else I've seen is like 5%, 6%, 7%.
[00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:13.120]   So that's another plus on Interactive Brokers.
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:17.300]   But in general, I will say it is a confusing interface.
[00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:22.740]   I'm happy to put my referral link in the show notes, but I don't expect a lot of usage of
[00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:24.400]   it because of that.
[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:28.680]   But it's funny, I also use that for my single stock investing.
[00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:33.840]   And I'm also not familiar with an easy way to say, "Oh, I want to invest $1,000 in this
[00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:34.840]   company.
[00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:36.680]   Can I do it over 5 months?"
[00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:42.360]   Because doing it each month manually, I feel like it just invites emotion to change the
[00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:44.600]   decision you made in advance.
[00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:50.560]   One other platform technology question I have, so often I see people say, "Gosh, I picked
[00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:54.320]   this stock and over the last 3 months, it's gone down.
[00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:55.320]   Let's take the last month.
[00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:57.600]   In the last month, it's down 7%.
[00:43:57.600 --> 00:43:59.760]   So how should I feel about that?"
[00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:02.880]   And I'm like, "Well, the entire market is down 7%."
[00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:08.880]   So relative to the benchmark of the market, your stock hasn't really done anything.
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:12.980]   It hasn't gone up, it hasn't gone down relative to the benchmark.
[00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:14.500]   Is that a way you look at things?
[00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:19.060]   Do you look at how a stock's done absolute on its own?
[00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:23.920]   Or do you try to compare how it's done to the general market to get a sense of relative
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:24.920]   performance?
[00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:26.820]   I always like to compare things to the market.
[00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:29.400]   You have to have something to compare it to.
[00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:34.720]   I'm happy just to compare it to the standard benchmark, which is the S&P 500.
[00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:37.360]   But yeah, you can't look at stocks in a vacuum.
[00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:43.000]   And what's even more confusing about investing is that there is a one-to-one relationship
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:47.840]   between the performance of a business and the performance of a stock over long periods
[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:48.840]   of time.
[00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:53.600]   The reason that companies go up substantially over long periods of time is the underlying
[00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:57.000]   business that underneath them has improved dramatically.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:01.880]   Maybe revenue is up a whole lot, margins are better, profits are improving, they've made
[00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:06.220]   an acquisition, or whatever the reason is, there's a direct tie between what happens
[00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:10.500]   to a business and what happens to the stock over long periods of time.
[00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:15.160]   Over short periods of time, there's almost no connection at all to what a business and
[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:16.420]   a stock are doing.
[00:45:16.420 --> 00:45:21.500]   And what's happening in the macro environment can often so overwhelm the actual business
[00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:22.880]   performance of a company.
[00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:27.800]   And this can be so confusing to you as an investor, because you can buy a company and
[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:31.220]   you can say, "I think this company is going to become more profitable, its revenue is
[00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:34.540]   going to grow, and the stock is going to do well."
[00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:37.160]   And you could be right about the business.
[00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:40.640]   When they come out with a quarterly report, they could say, "Revenue is up, profits are
[00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:44.640]   up, we're hiring more people, we're expanding, hey, we've got this new product that's coming
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:46.860]   out," and that stock can fall.
[00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:50.300]   And that stock can fall really, really hard.
[00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:55.200]   So in the short term, there isn't always a direct relationship between the performance
[00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:58.240]   of the company and the performance of the business.
[00:45:58.240 --> 00:46:02.840]   And that's why investing can be so trying on your emotions.
[00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:09.280]   However, over long periods of time, the performance of the business always is eventually reflected
[00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:10.480]   in the stock price.
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:17.000]   So when I'm judging how my companies are doing that I own, I'm almost never looking at just
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   the stock price.
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:21.280]   I'm always asking myself, "How did the company do?
[00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:23.120]   What's the general direction of the business?"
[00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:26.320]   And I'm focused very heavily on the business itself.
[00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:32.720]   In those short-term scenarios where comparing how it's done to the benchmark is really helpful,
[00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:33.720]   right?
[00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:36.520]   Because you might feel like you got a dud, but really just the market, as you said earlier,
[00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:39.300]   it's down almost 20% from highs.
[00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:42.960]   Is there an easy way to do that online for someone who's maybe wants to look at their
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:47.400]   portfolio and say, "Gosh, I invested in Square 12 months ago.
[00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:49.280]   How has Square done relative to the market?"
[00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:52.300]   Is that an easy calculation anywhere you know?
[00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:56.640]   Interactive Brokers gives me a kind of overall portfolio versus the market over various periods
[00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:57.640]   of time.
[00:46:57.640 --> 00:46:58.720]   So that's what I do.
[00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:02.500]   But you can use some very simple charting tools, especially ones that are on Yahoo Finance
[00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:07.080]   or Google if you want to look up an individual holding over shorter periods of time.
[00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:12.440]   We went a lot of places and we talked briefly at least a couple times on asymmetric bets.
[00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:16.560]   And I think most people listening might have thought, "Gosh, Brian's this guy that's investing
[00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:17.600]   a lot of stocks.
[00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:23.400]   All he's doing is making a bunch of high-risk asymmetric bets across his whole portfolio."
[00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:28.280]   And hopefully, if they're still here, they've come to the conclusion that's not the case,
[00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:33.000]   that you're actually trying to do a different type of investing with the bulk of your portfolio.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:36.160]   But I'm curious where those asymmetric bets do fit in.
[00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:43.080]   And do you take those kind of much higher-risk bets in your portfolio and how do they fit
[00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:44.080]   into everything?
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:52.060]   Yeah, the bulk of my individual holdings are in companies that are low-risk businesses
[00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:56.000]   with strong competitive advantages, they're growing at an above-average rate, they tend
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:01.040]   to be profitable, free cash flow positive, but they tend to be very high-quality businesses.
[00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:05.920]   And I don't think I'm taking on a whole lot of risk by investing in those companies directly.
[00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:14.880]   However, with a portion of my portfolio, I also am happy to invest in higher-risk situations,
[00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:20.180]   knowing full well going in that I'm assuming a whole lot more risk, so I better be compensated
[00:48:20.180 --> 00:48:23.440]   for that risk with the potential for higher return.
[00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:28.520]   I know you've talked about in the show in the past about making investments in crypto,
[00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:30.000]   like Ethereum and Bitcoin.
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.880]   I view those the same way, they're asymmetric opportunities.
[00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:39.340]   If you invest, say, $1,000 into a high-risk stock, well, the wonderful thing about investing
[00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:44.560]   is the worst you can do, assuming you use no leverage, is lose $1,000.
[00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:49.920]   You are completely wrong about the company, it goes belly up, you lose your $1,000.
[00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:56.480]   However, if you're right about that company, that $1,000 can grow into $2,000, $5,000,
[00:48:56.480 --> 00:49:01.760]   $10,000, even $100,000 if you are right about the business.
[00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:06.080]   Yes, those companies are extremely rare, but they are out there.
[00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:13.880]   With a portion of my individual stock portfolio, I'm happy to buy higher-risk companies if
[00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:17.400]   I believe that I can earn 10x plus returns on them.
[00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:21.440]   When you're thinking about these asymmetric bets, do you try to limit them?
[00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:23.680]   Do you try to make them regularly?
[00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:25.520]   Do you have a way to come up with ideas for them?
[00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:27.120]   How do you find them?
[00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:32.480]   Well, I'm a stock market junkie, so one of my favorite things to do is to research companies.
[00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:38.680]   But to answer your question, I'm a contractor for The Motley Fool, so I get access to all
[00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:42.440]   of their recommendations, and that's one place that I go to.
[00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:48.560]   There's also tons of ways to find investors by looking at high-growth portfolios, high-growth
[00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:49.560]   ETFs.
[00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:53.680]   I mean, the ARK funds, for example, have become very popular with investors, although those
[00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:56.720]   things are losing very badly to the market over the last year.
[00:49:56.720 --> 00:50:00.880]   There's lots of asymmetric risk-reward companies that are in there.
[00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:04.600]   So finding potential ideas isn't the hard part.
[00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:10.000]   What's the hard part is vetting the ideas and asking yourself, "What kind of risk level
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:15.880]   am I taking, and what are the odds that this company is going to go on to beat the market?"
[00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:19.120]   But finding ideas is really easy nowadays.
[00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:24.220]   Is the vetting process for these kind of higher-risk, higher-return investments, is that a different
[00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:29.480]   investing checklist, or how do you think about making those picks differently than you would
[00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:30.480]   others?
[00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:33.980]   No, I still take it through my exact same checklist, it's just that the companies typically
[00:50:33.980 --> 00:50:40.280]   score very poorly on my checklist for doing so because I value things like free cash flow,
[00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:46.360]   I value things like net income, I value a competitive advantage, etc.
[00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:51.320]   So I still go through the exact same process that I go to, but even after that process
[00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:56.800]   is done, if the company scores poorly, but I still believe that the potential is huge,
[00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:59.880]   I will go in and make an investment in that case.
[00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:06.320]   I just do so knowing, going eyes wide open, that this is a high-risk, high-reward bet
[00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:09.400]   that I'm making, and I just size it appropriately in my portfolio.
[00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:10.400]   Cool.
[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:14.440]   This is a question that I'm not sure I was going to ask, and I feel like I'll probably
[00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:18.040]   get some emails from listeners if I don't ask it, but I'll probably also get some if
[00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:19.200]   I do.
[00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:23.880]   But are there any companies right now that you're particularly excited about?
[00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:27.760]   And to be clear, this is not an investment recommendation for Brian or an endorsement
[00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:33.400]   by me, but if someone's sourcing ideas, are there any you want to kind of seed out there
[00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:34.400]   right now?
[00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:35.400]   Sure.
[00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:38.760]   As part of the show notes, you asked me to come up with the five stocks that I like.
[00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:45.160]   So I like stepping up to the plate and swinging, but to your point, I actually think I own
[00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:46.160]   four of these stocks.
[00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:50.800]   I don't own one of them, and I'll tell you which one I don't own, but I have confidence
[00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:53.160]   that all these stocks will beat the market from here.
[00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:57.680]   But again, going back to the percentages we talked about earlier, history shows that when
[00:51:57.680 --> 00:52:04.080]   I make 10 investments, I'm wrong about half the time, but that's okay, because the other
[00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:08.920]   half of the time that I'm right, I do so well on just a few of them that the losses that
[00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:12.960]   I have and the ones that I'm wrong on are dwarfed by the gains that you get than the
[00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:14.160]   ones that you're right on.
[00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:21.400]   But to play the game, five stocks that I think are good buys right now are Roku, Pinterest,
[00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:26.720]   Zoom, how's that for contrarian, Fiverr, and Upstart.
[00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:28.400]   Upstart is the fifth one.
[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:33.520]   That's one that I don't own, but that is a high-growth, profitable company that I'm very
[00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:34.780]   interested in.
[00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:38.640]   For the second or maybe the third time with the disclosure at the beginning, say, like,
[00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:40.440]   this is not a recommendation.
[00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:43.800]   Brian is not telling anyone here to go buy these stocks, but I love playing the game.
[00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:47.080]   I love hearing what's on top of your mind.
[00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:48.080]   Thank you.
[00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:50.640]   And what's fun about that is it's not hard to track ourselves.
[00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:54.320]   So I'll create a little spreadsheet for us right now on today's recording date.
[00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:57.600]   I'll put these companies in there so I actually could see how these companies do over time.
[00:52:57.600 --> 00:52:58.600]   Oh, that's great.
[00:52:58.600 --> 00:52:59.600]   Let's make it a Google Sheet.
[00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:00.600]   Let's make it public.
[00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:01.840]   I'll put it in the show notes.
[00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:04.000]   And even a few weeks from now when this comes out...
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   Years.
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:06.000]   Years.
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:07.000]   People will be able to see how we've done.
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   These are multi-year investments.
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:09.000]   These aren't multi-week investments.
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:10.000]   Oh, sorry.
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:11.000]   Sorry.
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:12.000]   Oh, yes.
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.740]   So when this episode's out in a few weeks, people will see how it's done.
[00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:21.240]   But yes, don't judge them on their short nature returns.
[00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:24.760]   Last thing on investing, and then I have a couple kind of totally different questions
[00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:26.120]   for you.
[00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:27.680]   One is on just books, right?
[00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:31.440]   People listening to this that think, "Gosh, I want to get more educated."
[00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:34.420]   I'd love it if you could throw out a few of your favorite resources.
[00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:35.420]   They don't have to be books.
[00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:39.320]   They could be online, both for people who are like, "I need to brush up," and people
[00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:42.960]   who are like, "Yeah, what are the next level books that I should be reading if I've read
[00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:43.960]   the basics?"
[00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:47.440]   Anyway, that's interested in individual stock investing, there are a couple of books I'll
[00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:50.600]   throw out there that I think are wonderful resources.
[00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:56.120]   The first is called Warren Buffett and the Interpretation of Financial Statements.
[00:53:56.120 --> 00:54:00.360]   This is a book that was written by Warren Buffett's daughter-in-law, Mary Buffett.
[00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:04.280]   And it basically takes the three major financial statements, the income statement, the balance
[00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:08.720]   sheet, and the cash flow statement, and it goes through them line by line, and it shows
[00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:11.720]   you how Warren Buffett thinks about those numbers.
[00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:17.480]   So it's a wonderful book for learning accounting and thinking through how financial statements
[00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:19.960]   can be turned into investment decisions.
[00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:23.120]   So that one is a hidden gem.
[00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:26.860]   Another one is called The Little Book That Builds Wealth.
[00:54:26.860 --> 00:54:29.320]   That one is by Pat Dorsey.
[00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:34.320]   Pat Dorsey is the former head of research at Morningstar, and that book really goes
[00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:40.840]   into how to think about competitive advantage in businesses and how to spot investments
[00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:42.760]   that have a competitive advantage.
[00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:46.120]   That's a very important topic that everybody needs to learn about.
[00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:50.960]   And the third one I'll throw out there is a fun book called 100 Baggers by Christopher
[00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:51.960]   Meyer.
[00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:58.120]   So that's a study of public companies that returned over their lifetime, earned investors
[00:54:58.120 --> 00:55:01.240]   a 100x return on their investment.
[00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:05.000]   It talks through some of the principles that they had in common and what investors can
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:06.000]   look for.
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:10.040]   So those are three kind of like under-the-radar books that I think are wonderful.
[00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:11.040]   That's great.
[00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:12.560]   Thank you for sharing those.
[00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:18.320]   The interesting thing I want to jump to, which has nothing to do with, I guess, stock investing
[00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:23.800]   at all, but what reminded me of it was I both heard you talk about it on another podcast,
[00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:28.760]   and I recently got an email from a listener asking about picking their mortgage.
[00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:33.320]   And it'll draw back to investing a little, but they said, "Gosh, if you start from a
[00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:34.320]   30-year fix..."
[00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:37.920]   They were like, "I could make a strong argument to try to get a 15-year mortgage to pay it
[00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:43.260]   down faster, but I could make an equally strong argument to go for an interest-only mortgage
[00:55:43.260 --> 00:55:47.680]   and take all the money that I would have put in the house and invest it, which I believe
[00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:52.120]   will outperform the kind of low interest rates I'm facing now."
[00:55:52.120 --> 00:55:58.680]   And I kind of always fall on the, let's call it financially rational decision of, "Well,
[00:55:58.680 --> 00:56:03.000]   you're going to earn a higher return here, so maybe that's the path, but I know you disagree."
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:08.180]   And so I want to make sure a contrarian opinion makes it out here, because I love giving people
[00:56:08.180 --> 00:56:10.080]   both sides to every story.
[00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:12.560]   So what would your response be to a question like that?
[00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:19.440]   I actually made the decision to pay off my mortgage fully aware of the math that goes
[00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:20.440]   into it.
[00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:25.400]   So there is a very strong mathematical argument that you should never pay off your mortgage.
[00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:28.960]   You should leverage it as much as possible, and you should take the difference, and you
[00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:31.680]   should invest it into the stock market, right?
[00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:35.620]   You'll earn a spread on the return.
[00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:40.640]   So why on earth would I pay off my mortgage if I do believe that?
[00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:44.420]   And it just, to me, gets back to what's the whole point of money?
[00:56:44.420 --> 00:56:47.600]   Why do we invest in the first place with the highest use of money?
[00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:52.960]   The highest use of money is for us to live the life we want without my money being a
[00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:55.120]   financial factor.
[00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:59.460]   So when I made the decision to do so, me and my wife made the decision to do so, what we
[00:56:59.460 --> 00:57:07.240]   asked ourselves was, "Does permanently eliminating our largest fixed monthly cost make our lives
[00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:08.240]   better?"
[00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:09.240]   Yes!
[00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:12.000]   Yes, it does, right?
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:18.920]   By paying off my mortgage, my future expense rate is permanently lower, literally, for
[00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:20.360]   the rest of my life.
[00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:25.560]   So I don't really care that the money would be better spent by putting it into the market.
[00:57:25.560 --> 00:57:31.640]   What I cared about was lowering my fixed monthly costs forever, so that way, the future amount
[00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:37.680]   of money that I have to make in any given month, the amount that I need to live on,
[00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:39.120]   is permanently lower.
[00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:44.280]   And it really gets something back to what Morgan Housel, I think, said so brilliantly.
[00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:48.060]   My financial goal is to make my finances unbreakable, right?
[00:57:48.060 --> 00:57:53.120]   I want to make myself immune to the economic cycle.
[00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:57.500]   I don't want to have to worry about losing my job or my family's life being disrupted
[00:57:57.500 --> 00:58:00.040]   at all for financial reasons.
[00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:04.820]   That's why I keep a pretty sizable amount of cash out there, and that's why I also have
[00:58:04.820 --> 00:58:06.940]   zero debt to myself.
[00:58:06.940 --> 00:58:12.240]   Doing so gives me a level of freedom and allows me to think and act long-term and really helps
[00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:14.360]   me to sleep at night.
[00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:19.260]   Knowing full well that the mathematics of that decision is unfavorable.
[00:58:19.260 --> 00:58:25.420]   I would be richer today if I didn't decide to pay off my mortgage, but I would go back
[00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:28.240]   and do the exact same thing in a heartbeat.
[00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:33.940]   And just for all the credit card nerds listening, a no-debt lifestyle does not mean you don't
[00:58:33.940 --> 00:58:36.740]   use credit cards to earn points and cash back.
[00:58:36.740 --> 00:58:37.740]   Oh, yeah.
[00:58:37.740 --> 00:58:39.380]   I love credit cards.
[00:58:39.380 --> 00:58:41.400]   I love credit card hacking.
[00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:43.260]   So I'm a big fan of credit cards.
[00:58:43.260 --> 00:58:46.420]   I'm just a bigger fan of living debt free.
[00:58:46.420 --> 00:58:50.200]   So like people say that are in the travel hacking world all the time, I mean, table
[00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:52.460]   stakes is no credit card debt, right?
[00:58:52.460 --> 00:58:54.780]   Table stakes is paying them off every month.
[00:58:54.780 --> 00:58:59.300]   I think there's a way to use credit cards responsibly to earn higher rewards like you
[00:58:59.300 --> 00:59:00.300]   promote.
[00:59:00.300 --> 00:59:02.420]   So yes, I also do that.
[00:59:02.420 --> 00:59:06.060]   I just have to throw it out there because I know there's kind of the Dave Ramsey contingency
[00:59:06.060 --> 00:59:09.880]   of no debt means not even using credit cards.
[00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:14.740]   So I don't want people to think, "Oh, Brian, this guy doesn't even believe in credit card
[00:59:14.740 --> 00:59:15.740]   points."
[00:59:15.740 --> 00:59:17.680]   Because I know you play that game as well.
[00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:22.840]   So to wrap us up, I want to hear some of your local recommendations for anyone who's taking
[00:59:22.840 --> 00:59:25.140]   a trip to Rhode Island.
[00:59:25.140 --> 00:59:30.040]   Would love to hear favorite meal or someplace people should go check out to eat, a place
[00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:35.140]   to meet up, grab a drink with a friend, and an activity that's not the most obvious thing
[00:59:35.140 --> 00:59:37.180]   for anyone to do.
[00:59:37.180 --> 00:59:42.560]   We're blessed in Rhode Island to have Providence, which has tons of great restaurants in it,
[00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:47.920]   no matter if you're into steak or seafood or sushi or Indian food or that kind of thing.
[00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:54.280]   But there's a wonderful restaurant downtown called Hemingway's, which is a perennial popular
[00:59:54.280 --> 00:59:56.420]   pick for seafood fans.
[00:59:56.420 --> 01:00:03.880]   So I would say that's a great place to get a meal, a great activity to do.
[01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:10.360]   Also in Providence, at night over the summer, there's something called a water fire, which
[01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:16.440]   is when they take gondolas and on the little river that's downtown, they do bonfires in
[01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:21.160]   the middle of the river up and down them, and it's right by Rhode Island School of Design,
[01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:22.160]   so RISD.
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:26.320]   So there's all kinds of paintings and sculptures that are on display at the time.
[01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:30.200]   It's just a really nice way to spend the night, especially if it's a nice night out, walking
[01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:34.920]   along the river, watching these fires and seeing some kind of artsy things on the side
[01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:35.920]   of the road.
[01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:38.440]   Not something that many people know about Rhode Island.
[01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:43.240]   And the last one was a great place to meet up.
[01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:46.040]   Where to grab a drink after.
[01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:52.840]   Like many parts of the world, we have also seen an explosion of breweries come in Rhode
[01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:53.840]   Island.
[01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:59.520]   So Rhode Island's a pretty small state, and I think there's like 17 breweries in our state.
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:04.560]   One of them that I'll give a shout out to is Tilted Barn Brewery in Exeter, Rhode Island.
[01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:08.400]   It's just got a wonderful atmosphere and some very tasty beers, if that's your thing.
[01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:09.400]   Awesome.
[01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:11.360]   Thank you so much for joining us on the show.
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:16.440]   I think in the last few years, there's been so much conversation about the craziness of
[01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:21.720]   meme stock investing and people taking wild, risky bets with stocks.
[01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:25.960]   I feel like it was really a breath of fresh air to talk about stock investing and what
[01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:31.160]   I'll call a more civilized and rational approach than just taking crazy bets.
[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:33.400]   So thank you so much for being here.
[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:37.200]   Where can people find everything you're writing and the content you're creating online?
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:38.200]   Sure.
[01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:39.920]   The best place to connect with me is on Twitter.
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:41.240]   That's where I'm the most active.
[01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:45.760]   If you're interested in learning how to invest in individual stocks or my checklist, check
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:49.280]   out my YouTube channel, which is just my name, Brian Feraldi on YouTube.
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:50.280]   Awesome.
[01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:51.280]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:52.280]   Chris, thanks so much for having me.
[01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:53.280]   You're welcome.
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:53.280]   Thanks for having me.
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:54.280]   Bye.
[01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:54.280]   Bye.
[01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:55.280]   Bye.
[01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:55.280]   Bye.
[01:01:55.280 --> 01:02:00.280]   Bye.
[01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:03.280]   Bye.
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:06.280]   Bye.
[01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:08.860]   (upbeat music)
[01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:11.440]   (upbeat music)
