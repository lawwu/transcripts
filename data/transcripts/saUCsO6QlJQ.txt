[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480]   We come this evening in our consideration of the eighth chapter of Paul's epistle to
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:13.880]   the Romans to the 32nd verse. The 32nd verse in the eighth chapter of Paul's epistle to
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:22.240]   the Romans. "He that spared not his own son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:31.440]   with him also freely give us all things?" Now we are engaged in at the moment in analyzing and
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:38.480]   studying and considering together this last section or subsection in this great eighth
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.800]   chapter of this epistle. It starts at verse 31 and as I was explaining last Friday night,
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:52.040]   what the Apostle does from here to the end of the chapter is to put up four kind of challenges to
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:58.280]   the great doctrine of the final perseverance of the saints, which he has been expounding in verses
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:05.040]   28, 29, and 30. Indeed he's been expounding it right through the chapter, but particularly in
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.680]   those three verses. And what he does of course is to put up these challenges in order that he may
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:20.400]   answer them, deal with them, demolish them, and thereby undergird, reemphasize, prove still
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:29.400]   further his great contention and establish his argument. Now last Friday night we considered
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.480]   the first of these challenges, the one that he puts in verse 31. What shall we then say to these
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:45.000]   things? Here's the first challenge. "If God be for us, who can be against us?" The challenge is,
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:54.560]   who can be against us if God is for us? In other words, he puts up this question as to whether
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:02.280]   there is any possibility of any power ever appearing or arising which could take us out
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.920]   of God's hands. Or to use the language of the tenth chapter of John's Gospel, he tries to
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:18.040]   envisage the possibility of any power capable of plucking us out of the hands of God, and so
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:25.520]   leaving us in a state of final perdition. It refers of course only to those who are God's
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:32.120]   children, those who love God, those who are the called according to his purpose, those whom he
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:39.200]   has already glorified. Well, we considered that and we saw how the apostle is able to argue in
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.240]   terms of the whole being and nature and character of God, that the thing is an absurdity. It is
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:54.160]   impossible. "If God be for us." There is nothing, there is no one who can ever be against us. So
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.480]   we come this evening to the second challenge that he puts up. And the second challenge I
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:06.720]   described last Friday night as being this. Is there any danger of God's love to us lessening,
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:17.440]   or waning, or indeed ceasing altogether? Here is the most important question of God. Our whole
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:25.200]   position is dependent upon the love of God. We've got nothing at all apart from that. So it's a
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:32.840]   very serious question, this. Is it conceivable, is it possible, that there may be variations in
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.760]   the love of God, or that a day may come when he'll not love us as much as he loves us now?
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:46.240]   Because if that is a possibility, then our whole position is again in jeopardy, and we are left in
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:52.200]   a state of complete uncertainty. Nothing is more important than that we should know, and know
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:04:00.040]   beyond any doubt or peradventure, that it is impossible for the love of God toward us ever
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:07.760]   to change at all, still less to disappear. Now then, but that is the thing that the apostle
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:16.280]   deals with here. As I've reminded you, he never takes anything for granted. He always supplies
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:24.000]   us with proofs, with demonstrations, and that's what he does in this particular verse. Now this
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.280]   verse that we're looking at is not only a masterly argument in and of itself, it is at the same time
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.120]   one of the greatest statements of the doctrine of the atonement that you can find anywhere in the
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:45.480]   whole of Scripture. And it is in addition one of the most comforting and reassuring statements that
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:54.160]   is to be found in the whole realm and range of the Word of God. Someone has said this, that a
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:02.120]   number of emphatic expressions are crowded together in this sentence. And how true it is. A number of
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:09.560]   emphatic expressions, that's incidentally said in Heblon, a number of emphatic expressions are
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:18.200]   crowded together in this sentence. Yes, we can go beyond it. A number of the most wonderful and
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:26.960]   the most crucial Christian doctrines are crowded together in the space and the confines of just
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:40.000]   this one verse. But now I say that this verse is an argument. The whole form of it suggested,
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.280]   of course, and the question at the end, "He that spared not his own son, but delivered him up for
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:52.760]   us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?" Now let's try and look at it like
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:06:01.680]   this. Let's for a moment look at the argument in general. I mean by that the nature or the
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:08.080]   character of the argument, or if you prefer it, the mere mechanics of the argument. Because you'll
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:14.360]   find that that is something which is full of interest. What is the object of the argument?
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:21.800]   Let's start with that. Let's be sure about this. The object of the argument is to prove and to
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:30.920]   demonstrate that God's love to us can never possibly fail or even lessen in any extent at
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:40.440]   all. That's what he sets out to prove. What's his method? Well, you notice the method is that of
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:49.120]   arguing from a greater to a lesser. The Apostles were the founder of this method of argumentation,
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:55.800]   and it's always a very good one. He's done exactly the same thing already in chapter 5 in verses 9
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:03.080]   and 10. There he puts it like this. Perhaps I'd better read verse 8 as well. "But God, he says,
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:11.560]   commendeth his love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us, much more
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:21.000]   than, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him. For if, when we
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:30.240]   were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, how much more, being reconciled,
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:38.240]   shall we be saved by his life?" I put it in the form of a question, which is what it really is,
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:44.360]   but here in the Authorized it actually reads, "much more being reconciled, we shall be saved
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:52.320]   in or by his life." Now, it's exactly the same argument, and it's exactly the same type of
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:08:02.120]   argument. He starts with the greater, and then deduces from that the lesser. In other words,
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:11.160]   what he's saying is this. If God has already done for us the greatest thing that even God himself
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:22.480]   could possibly do, how can he conceivably fail or refuse to do anything for us that is smaller than
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:31.200]   that? That's the argument. If God has already done the greatest thing of all, well then it's
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:39.360]   quite inconceivable that he should fail to continue his work in us until he has brought
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:46.720]   us to that final goal of ultimate perfection and glorification. That's his argument. That's the
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:51.640]   sort of character, the nature of the argument. Now, this comes out in a very interesting way
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:58.080]   in the actual words that the Apostle uses. It's very interesting to notice that this
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:05.560]   authorized version, and the same applies to the revised version, the standard revised version,
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:13.640]   and this new English Bible, they all fail to pay any attention to a word that the Apostle
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:20.360]   actually used, a little word that is there in the original, but which is a most important one,
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:26.760]   and comes right at the beginning of the verse, the statement. It's a particle, and it's an
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:35.040]   intensive particle, which the Apostle puts in in order to magnify the deed. So there ought to be a
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:41.360]   word added to this translation which isn't here. And the word that should be added is the word,
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:50.160]   "surely." "Surely he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:56.960]   also with him freely give us all things?" "Surely." Or, if you like, you can put in the word, "indeed."
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:08.680]   The famous American grammarian A.T. Robertson, he would translate it like this, "Who as much as this
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:17.200]   has done for us?" You see, it's intensive, it's adding to it. Let me say that even Dr. Moffat has
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:24.400]   got this point. He puts in "surely," and it's quite right. J.M. Darby had also seen it. He puts in
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:33.040]   the word "yea," in order to bring in emphasis. "Yea, he who has done this for us, how shall he not
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:40.640]   also with him freely give us all things?" Now, it's interesting that the word is actually there.
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:46.200]   I'm not supplying it, but it's there in the original, and yet somehow or another, so many
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:52.040]   of these translations seem to have missed it. And the whole object and purpose of the word,
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:59.160]   this little particle, is to intensify, to magnify the thing. "The God who's done that for us,
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:08.800]   surely." That's the effect. That's exactly what the Apostle was saying. The form in which you
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:15.600]   find it in this new translation not only doesn't put in the word, but it misses the argument,
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:22.040]   it seems to me, completely. It doesn't only leave out the intensive particle, but even the very form
[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:29.480]   in which they put it and split it up into different sentences loses the whole point and intensity of
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:36.600]   the argument as the Apostle is implying it here. But there it is. Now, that's his method. "Surely,
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:44.360]   the God who's done that can't refuse to do this or anything else that is so obviously smaller and
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:51.680]   lesser." Or the other way of putting it is, "The God who's already done that, surely he can't stop
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:57.760]   with anything smaller than that which is designed to lead us to the ultimate goal for which he did
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:04.000]   that." That's the argument. That's the form of the argument. Now, another thing, therefore,
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:14.280]   which we must pay attention to and notice is this. Notice the way in which the Apostle gives us this
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:21.960]   assurance. Everybody wants, every believer wants this assurance. We want to know for certain that
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:26.560]   God's love toward us can never vary and can never fail. Now, what's interesting is this,
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:32.320]   that the Apostle doesn't merely say, "Oh, you needn't worry about that, you know, because God
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:38.800]   is love." That's how it's done today. That's how people tend to do it now. That isn't how the
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:46.800]   Apostle does it. He doesn't give us the assurance only on the basis of the fact that God is love.
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:54.040]   That is true. But the Apostle knows us so well. He knows that we are liable to have our thoughts,
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:59.320]   and the devil is ready to suggest things to us which would question and query, and when things
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:05.000]   happen to us which we don't like, we begin to say, "Does God love us after all?" And you see,
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.160]   if it's merely left as a general statement, you'd very soon lose your assurance. That isn't the way
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:20.680]   he does it. He does it like this. The Apostle bases this assurance on facts, on certain things which
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:30.120]   God has done. He bases his argument on the fact of the Lord Jesus Christ. He bases it on the fact
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:36.720]   of the death of the Lord Jesus Christ on the cross on Calvary's Hill. See, he doesn't leave it merely
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:41.440]   as a general statement about God being love, and because God loves me everything's going to be
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:47.080]   all right. No, no, the Apostle comes down to particularities, to facts. Here's this person,
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:53.040]   there he is dying upon a cross. You're looking at an event, at a fact which belongs to the realm
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:14:02.120]   of history. But he doesn't stop at that. He bases the assurance not only on the facts, but also on
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:09.600]   the meaning and the significance of the facts. Or, if you prefer it in other language, he bases it
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:18.040]   upon doctrines. Because a doctrine, after all, is nothing but an explanation of the meaning and the
[00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:24.720]   significance of facts and events. You can look at a fact and an event, but if you don't understand
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:29.640]   its meaning and its purpose it's not going to help you. Now doctrine is that which explains the
[00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:37.120]   object and the meaning of the purpose of the facts. So the Apostle here, in addition to giving us the
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:46.600]   facts, gives us the great doctrines concerning God's plan, the person of Christ, and the meaning
[00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:53.560]   of Christ's death upon the cross. Now those are the great doctrines, the cardinal central doctrines
[00:14:53.560 --> 00:15:01.400]   of the Christian's faith. Now what I'm emphasizing at the moment, as I'm showing you the nature of
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:10.080]   the argument and how important this is, that the Apostle's argument is based directly upon that,
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:21.600]   facts plus meaning, facts plus the doctrines that explain the facts. Now this is always the method
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:29.360]   of this Apostle. Indeed it's the method of the Bible everywhere, from beginning to end. And I'm
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:36.280]   emphasizing it just to show you that it's so essentially different from what is so popular
[00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:43.000]   at the present time. Now there's a popular teaching on the continent of Europe today,
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:50.240]   it's the most popular teaching in the theological colleges in Germany and in most other parts of the
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:16:01.720]   continent of Europe. It's a teaching which says that facts don't matter at all, and that actually
[00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:09.280]   you can't be sure of most of the facts with regard to the Lord Jesus Christ. But this teaching says,
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:16.040]   the propounder of it is a man called Bultman, and I'm simply calling attention to it because
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:21.840]   it is so popular on the continent, it's seeping into this country, and there are many people in
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:26.160]   their ignorance think it sounds rather wonderful that it doesn't matter whether these are facts
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:32.760]   or not, as long as you hold on to these great truths. I'm trying to show you that what the
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:41.480]   Apostle does is the exact opposite of it. He bases everything upon the facts. This teaching says that
[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:46.440]   the facts don't matter at all. Now I'm calling attention to this because we are coming up to
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:52.000]   the period of Good Friday and Easter Sunday, and you'll find this very popular teaching doesn't
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.920]   matter whether Christ literally rose in the body after all, the fact is that there's a kind of
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:02.200]   influence of Christ still. That's the thing they say that matters. Doesn't matter whether it really
[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:09.040]   happened literally, physically, or not. Now that's the complete denial of the Apostle's method. His
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:17.000]   arguments are always based solidly and entirely upon facts. And how much stronger this is,
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:24.560]   what greater security it gives us. That's one of the things with which I would contrast the
[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:31.560]   Apostle's teaching. But there's another, and the other unfortunately is much more common in this
[00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:42.040]   country than the first one. It's quite as bad as the first one in some ways. It's this, that doctrine
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:49.440]   doesn't matter at all. This unfortunately has been far too common a teaching even in evangelical
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:55.200]   circles. They say we are not theologians, we are just simply evangelical people, we are not bothered
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:18:00.040]   about theology. People used to waste such a lot of time and divide from one another. I'm a simple man,
[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:03.640]   says the man. I've heard people saying this. I've heard a man saying, I'm only an evangelist,
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:07.960]   I don't understand doctrine. I'm just a simple evangelist, I just offer Christ to people,
[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:16.000]   I don't understand. As if that was something very wonderful to say. Here we find that the comfort
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:23.240]   and the assurance that the Apostle gives us is based directly upon doctrine. And if you want to
[00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:29.120]   have real assurance of your salvation, well the firmer you are grasp upon Christian doctrines,
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:37.840]   the greater your assurance will be. Facts plus doctrine, to drop either is wrong. We need the
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:44.900]   facts, we need the doctrines that explain the facts. And here in this one verse, as I say the
[00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:55.280]   great Apostle provides us with both, there is nothing more foolish or self-defeating than to
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:19:02.960]   say that you're not interested in doctrine. That's the high road to being ready to listen
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:09.960]   to the latest teaching that comes along that may sound very wonderful. You'll hear people saying,
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:14.840]   so-and-so is now preaching the cross. Wonderful this is, he's preaching the cross now,
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:20.160]   he's changed. I remember hearing people saying that about a certain popular preacher. He hadn't
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:25.960]   changed at all. What matters is not that a man is talking about the cross, what matters is what's
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:31.800]   he saying about the cross. There are all sorts of people who put up crosses, but the question is
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:36.280]   what do they believe about it? What's their doctrine of the death of Christ? Now the Apostle's
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:44.400]   whole argument depends upon the meaning and an understanding of what was happening when our Lord
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:54.800]   died upon the cross. Now I'm emphasizing all this, I say for this reason, that the whole argument as
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:20:05.040]   presented by the Apostle depends upon our grasping the facts and the explanation of the facts. The
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:11.160]   way to combat death and the way to resist the devil and to rejoice in hope of the glory of God
[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:18.560]   is to be able to work out this sort of argument that the Apostle works out here, based solidly
[00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:27.200]   upon events that have taken place in the realm of history, and an understanding of their meaning.
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:34.760]   Very well, I've spent all that time on the mechanics of the argument, because I find so
[00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:42.160]   constantly that it's people who don't trouble to do this who are always in trouble. The kind of
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:47.120]   people who go to a service or who come to a minister just to get a word of comfort. If you
[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:52.560]   only understand the doctrine, you'll be able to work out this argument for yourself. And this is
[00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:58.840]   the assurance that you can take these things and draw your deductions, work out the argument even
[00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:03.440]   as the Apostle does it here before our eyes. Very well, what is the argument? This comes,
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:11.000]   this is our second great matter, the argument itself. The first part of the argument is this,
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:21.960]   is to remind us of what God has already done for us. It is to remind us, I say again,
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:30.960]   of the fact of the cross on Calvary's hill, and the realization of what was happening there.
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:39.840]   Now each of the terms that he uses here is full of meaning and full of significance,
[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:48.840]   and we therefore must take them one by one and give them their full value. The first thing the
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:57.080]   Apostle tells us is this, that what was happening on the cross on Calvary's hill was the action of
[00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:09.760]   God. He that spared not his own son, but delivered him up for us all. He, this is a reference to God.
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:19.240]   And this is the basis of the Apostle's whole argument. Now I think I can prove this to you
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:29.960]   quite easily. You see, his argument is this, if God has already done that for us, he cannot refuse
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:37.480]   to do anything less for us. Now everybody's clear about the second half, how shall he not with him
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:44.840]   also freely give us all things? It's quite clear, isn't it, in the second half that it's God who's
[00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:51.400]   giving. It is the action of God. Very well, it is essential to the Apostle's argument, therefore,
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:59.000]   that the first part is also the action of God. Otherwise, he hasn't got his parallel. His
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:05.080]   parallel is, the God who's done this can't refuse to do that. It's the same one who is acting in
[00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:13.400]   both parts of the statement. Why do I emphasize that? Well, for this reason. I'm preparing you
[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:20.800]   for Good Friday. This is what is being taught popularly and commonly about what happened on
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:30.440]   the cross on Calvary's Hill. That it was solely and entirely the action of men. Awful tragedy,
[00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:38.360]   great shame. I remember a man asking me the question, "Why do you call it Good Friday?"
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:44.600]   He said, "I'd have thought it was the worst Friday that had ever been. Bad Friday, but you call it
[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:49.880]   Good Friday." I said, "Why do you say that?" But he said, "There's nothing to be said for it. Look
[00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:55.160]   at those cruel men, those ignorant men, those men who couldn't recognize him, couldn't understand
[00:23:55.160 --> 00:24:00.840]   him, didn't see his significance. And their jealousy and their envy and their malice and
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:06.120]   their spite. So you see, they tell us all about these characters around the cross and their
[00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:14.720]   teaching is that the cross is solely and entirely the action of men. Isn't that common teaching? Of
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:20.560]   course it is. But it's the exact opposite of what the Apostle says. Then there are others who say
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:32.220]   that it isn't so much the action of men as the action of the devil and the principalities and
[00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:39.080]   powers, the fallen angels and all these powers that are governed and controlled by the devil.
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:44.360]   They say it was the devil using the men. But the action is ultimately, of course,
[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:49.480]   the action of the devil who set out at the very beginning to try to destroy the Son of God. He
[00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:53.760]   tried through King Herod to kill him when he was a babe, the moment he was born. And he followed
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:59.440]   him, he tempted him, tried to trap him. And at long last he manipulated these people in such a
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:05.520]   way that he encompassed and brought about his death. That's another very common way in which
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:12.160]   it's put. Either entirely the action of men, explained in natural terms, or else men being
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:18.960]   used by the malignity and the enmity of the devil and the evil power. And then you see they go on
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:25.480]   to put it like this. You say, well then if that is what happened on the cross on Calvary's Hill,
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:36.360]   what's its meaning? Oh, they say its meaning is this, that God is saying to us, indeed he is
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:48.560]   saying to all men, though you did that, even that, to my son, I still forgive you. Now this is the
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:54.840]   common teaching of the meaning of the death of Christ upon the cross. The message of the cross,
[00:25:54.840 --> 00:26:00.760]   they say, is just that, that God is saying to men, though you killed my own son, I'll forgive
[00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:07.560]   you for it. And that that is its great message. So that God doesn't do anything on Calvary. God
[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:14.880]   is entirely passive. It's men acting. And God passively is looking on and he's saying to us,
[00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:24.320]   though you've done even that, I still am ready to forgive you. You must have heard that many times.
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:32.040]   You'll hear it a great deal in these next few weeks. I do trust I shall make it plain and clear
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:38.200]   tonight that it's entirely wrong and utterly false. Misses the whole glory of the cross,
[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:46.600]   and is a blank contradiction of the teaching of this verse. My dear friends, you can't afford to
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:53.240]   be hazy in your ideas as to the meaning of the death on the cross. I've heard evangelical people
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:59.160]   accepting that false teaching and thinking it's wonderful. It isn't. I've heard them calling men
[00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:04.680]   evangelical who taught just that and no more. That isn't evangelical. That misses the whole
[00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:12.040]   glory of the evangelical teaching about the cross. What is it then? Well, it's as I say,
[00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:21.680]   it is a proclamation that it is God who acts on Calvary. He, he's the actor. He's the one who's
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:27.680]   going to give us all these other things. Yes, and I know that because of what he, he has already done.
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:36.080]   It was God who was acting on Calvary. He did it through men, through the instrumentality of men.
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:42.320]   But the action is the action of God. Now, I want to demonstrate this, because if we don't believe
[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:47.320]   this, we are missing the whole point of the Apostle's argument. That is why I read that
[00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:53.520]   great 53rd chapter of Isaiah's prophecy to you at the beginning, because he there puts it several
[00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:59.440]   times over. Here's the prophet being given a preview under the divine inspiration of the
[00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:06.800]   Spirit. He sees it all. And here he goes on repeating it. Look at it for instance as it's
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:13.560]   there in verse 4. "Surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows, yet we did esteem him
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:25.480]   stricken, smitten of God." Smitten of God, and afflicted. "He was wounded for our transgressions,
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:31.640]   he was bruised for our iniquities. The chastisement of our peace was upon him. With his stripes we are
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:42.000]   healed." Look at verse 6. "And the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all." It's God, the Lord,
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:51.640]   the Father, who's acting and putting on him the iniquity of us all. And he goes on repeating it.
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:29:03.200]   "Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him. He hath put him to grief." And so on and so forth. Now
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:11.360]   there it is, you see, clearly taught us in the prophetic foreview, the prophetic preparation
[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:17.640]   of this great thing which happened. But listen to it in the New Testament. I could give you more
[00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:22.920]   from the Old Testament, but there's of course the classical and crucial passage. But listen to our
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:31.120]   Lord saying it himself, addressing Pontius Pilate. Pilate says, "You know, I've got power to release
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:37.680]   you, or power to keep you bound." Our Lord turns to him in John 19 11 and says, "Thou couldest have
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:47.200]   no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above." That's a plain statement of Pilate
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:53.600]   to this effect. You're not doing as much as you think you're doing. You don't understand indeed
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:59.920]   what you are doing. "You'd have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above."
[00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:06.560]   Then listen to the Apostle Peter expounding it in his way in his sermon on the day of Pentecost
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:15.320]   at Jerusalem, as recorded in the second chapter of Acts. Let me begin to read at verse 22. "Ye men
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:22.960]   of Israel, hear these words. Jesus of Nazareth, the man approved of God among you by miracles
[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:29.800]   and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know."
[00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:39.600]   Then listen to this in verse 23. "Him being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:50.120]   of God, you have taken and by wicked hands have crucified and slain." Yes, but he was delivered
[00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:58.600]   by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God. Here's the inspired Apostle filled with the
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:03.880]   Spirit explaining to these people at Jerusalem that though it was their hands that had done it,
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:09.520]   it was God's purpose that was being carried out. The predeterminate counsel and foreknowledge of
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:15.800]   God. Then you remember the prayer that we are given in Acts 4, the prayer of this persecuted
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:21.200]   early church. Here they are threatened. Peter and John have been threatened by the authorities
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:26.240]   that if they go on preaching or teaching in the name of this Jesus, they'll not only be arrested
[00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:31.400]   again but probably put to death and the whole church exterminated. So the church meets together
[00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:37.600]   and this is how they pray. They say, "The kings of the earth stood up and the rulers were gathered
[00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:43.640]   together against the Lord and against his Christ." Acts 4, 26. "For of a truth against thy holy child
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:50.080]   Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate with the Gentiles and the people
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:59.920]   of Israel were gathered together for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined
[00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:06.640]   before to be done." They're addressing God. And what they say in their prayer is that Herod and
[00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:12.800]   Pontius Pilate and the Gentiles and the people were simply carrying out what thy hand and thy
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:22.360]   counsel determined beforehand to be done. Exactly the same thing stated again. Now this is most
[00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:28.440]   important, obviously. And then you've got a very explicit statement about it in that famous
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:39.880]   statement of the Apostle Paul in 2 Corinthians 5, 21. "For he, God, hath made him Christ to be
[00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:51.600]   sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him." You see,
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:58.800]   he's expounding here, God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself. That's what he's expounding.
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:05.920]   And that's the ultimate exposition. "For he hath made him," God has made his son, "to be sin for us,
[00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:12.920]   who knew no sin himself, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him." Most important,
[00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:22.280]   you've got exactly the same idea, really, in Colossians 2, where you read this. About the
[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:28.960]   cross again, verse 13, "And you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh,
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:34.600]   hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses, blotting out the
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:39.680]   handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:46.880]   way, nailing it to his cross. And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them
[00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:53.520]   openly, triumphing over them in it." Christ wasn't altogether passive on the cross. God was not
[00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:59.400]   passive. What is it? Well, they're doing something there that is putting these principalities and
[00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:07.120]   powers to an open shame. And the Apostle Peter teaches exactly the same doctrine. Listen to him
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:14.480]   in the first epistle in chapter 2 and verse 6, "Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture,
[00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:26.880]   Behold, I lay in fire, the chief cornerstone, elect, precious, and he that believeth on him
[00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:33.360]   shall not be confounded." And the whole context is the context of men rejecting him, the stone
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:37.760]   which the builders disallowed. The same is made the head of the corner, disallowed indeed of men,
[00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:43.600]   but chosen of God and precious. It's all a disposition upon the death and the cross and
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:49.040]   the resurrection. And what is it? It's God doing it. God, as the prophet had foreseen, says,
[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:56.120]   "I'm going to lay in Zion a chief cornerstone, elect and precious, and he that believeth in him
[00:34:56.120 --> 00:35:02.160]   shall not be confounded." That's a reference to the work of the cross. And you see, in each case,
[00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:11.200]   it is God himself who is doing this. So the teaching is this, that what was happening on
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:19.200]   the cross was something that God had planned and prepared and foreordained before the foundation
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:25.800]   of the world. The cross isn't an accident. The cross isn't the result of the malice and the
[00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:32.120]   jealousy and the envy and the blindness and the folly of men, predetermined at counsel and fore
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:40.760]   knowledge of God. God planned it, and it's God who's acting on the cross. He that spared not
[00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:47.000]   his own son but delivered him up for us all. It's God who's doing it all. It's essential to this
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:53.120]   argument. It's God acting. It's God, what God has done is my guarantee of what God is going to do.
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:58.200]   If you say that God was doing nothing but looking on passively and saying, "Well, even though you've
[00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:04.400]   done that yet, I forgive you," there's no argument here at all. The apostles got no argument. How
[00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:10.080]   important it is that we should pay attention to the details as they're given to us in the
[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:20.720]   Scripture. The cross on Calvary's Hill was determined upon and foreordained before the
[00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:29.240]   foundation of the world. Let us allow Peter to have the final word about this. In the first
[00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:38.400]   epistle, again in the first chapter, where he puts it like this, verse 18, "For as much as he
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:44.440]   know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation
[00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:50.960]   received by tradition from your fathers, but with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without
[00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:57.400]   blemish and spot, who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was
[00:36:57.400 --> 00:37:04.800]   manifest in these last times for you who by him who do believe in God that raised him up from the
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:12.920]   dead and gave him glory." It's God who smote him. It's God who raised him up. The actor is God. He
[00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:22.720]   that spared not his own son. Oh, how they rob us of the glory of the cross and of our own assurance
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:31.720]   by failing to see exactly what happened there. I don't worry with the reason why they do this. The
[00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:38.720]   reason they do it, of course, is this, that not believing the scriptures, but substituting for
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:46.040]   the teaching of the scriptures their ideas of God, they don't believe in the wrath of God. They don't
[00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:52.160]   believe that God punishes sin. They say that's impossible. God is only love to them. There's no
[00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:57.800]   justice. There's no righteousness. There's very little holiness. There's no wrath at all. So as
[00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:02.920]   that's impossible, they've got to explain it in some other way. And they miss its whole glory.
[00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:19.040]   The simple answer is that what was happening there is the action of the Almighty God the Father. Let
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:31.480]   me take you just one further step tonight. His own son. Who is this who is dying now? This is again
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:40.160]   absolutely vital to the argument. Is he just a good man? Is he just a great religious teacher?
[00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:47.840]   Is he just some pure soul like Socrates? This is what we're always being told. He's one of them,
[00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:54.920]   one of the martyrs, Socrates and others. Truth forever on the scaffold, wrong forever on the
[00:38:54.920 --> 00:39:00.480]   throne. They put him into these categories. A good man dying for his principles, a good man
[00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:06.240]   before his time, people couldn't follow him, couldn't receive him, and so on. Is he just a
[00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:14.160]   good man? Is he just a great man? Is he just a godly man? We've got the answer to that here.
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:25.440]   Is he just a son of God in general? As we are being told that all men are sons of God,
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:33.880]   the universal fatherhood of God and the universal brotherhood of man. Is he just a son in that
[00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:41.840]   sense? Many say that he is. I was reading only recently, I'd read it before, it brought it back
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:50.720]   to me. Somebody asked one of these skeptical writers who passed on to the name of Christian,
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:40:00.120]   "Do you or do you not believe in the divinity of Jesus Christ?" He said, "Of course I do,
[00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:10.520]   I believe in the divinity of all men." Is that what we are being told here? Let me go one step
[00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:16.760]   further. Earlier on in this chapter the Apostle has been telling us that we are the sons of God.
[00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:23.400]   As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God, for he have not received
[00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:28.080]   the spirit of bondage again to fear, but he have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry,
[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:34.040]   "Abba, Father." The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God,
[00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:45.840]   we are sons of God. Is that all we're being told about him? No, no. He that spared not his own son.
[00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:55.080]   This is unique. This separates him from everybody else, even from those of us who are Christians and
[00:40:55.080 --> 00:41:03.440]   who have become the children of God. It's in a special sense. He is the only begotten of the
[00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:15.240]   Father, his own son. Not created, not adopted into the family of God as we are who are Christians.
[00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:22.640]   He was always in it. He's always been the son of God. He is the eternal son of God. He's in the
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:27.200]   bosom of the Father. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:36.240]   God, always has been, from all eternity. This is my son, the beloved. God never said that about
[00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:43.400]   anybody except about this one. Here is one who is God's own son. He's a partaker of God's own
[00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:51.200]   nature. He's the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person. And that is true of
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:42:01.320]   no one except of this person. This is the person who said, "I and the Father are one." Nobody ever
[00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:07.600]   dared to say that except this person. He was charged with saying that, he said that God is
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:18.280]   his own Father. He did, and it's true. And it's only true of him. We are sons by adoption. He is
[00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:28.080]   son by eternal generation. The eternal son of God, ever always in the bosom of the Father.
[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:37.120]   Do you see the importance of paying attention to every word? He that spared not his own son. You
[00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:44.200]   see how it comes into the argument? It isn't a man he's sparing, not sparing. It isn't an adopted
[00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:50.880]   son that he's not sparing. It's his own son. The whole glorious doctrine of the incarnation is in
[00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:59.280]   those two words. His own son. So here you see, you've got the whole doctrine of the incarnation,
[00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:04.560]   that God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law when the fullness of the times had
[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:12.120]   come. And the Apostle's argument loses most of its currency and its final power to convince us,
[00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:23.400]   unless we realize who it is that he's not sparing then. It is none other than his only begotten,
[00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:36.040]   beloved son. The one who was one with him, sharer of his divine eternal nature with the Holy Ghost,
[00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:47.920]   whom he loved with all the intensity of the Godhead. That's the one whom the Father didn't
[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:55.840]   spare, but rather delivered up for us all on the cross on Calvary's hill. We've got to leave it
[00:43:55.840 --> 00:44:06.680]   for tonight, my dear friends. Every single word here is of inestimable importance, charged with
[00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:17.600]   all the glorious doctrine of the Christian faith. Is there anything more terrible than the way in
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:25.840]   which men detract from it, evacuate it, go on using the language as it were, but take the meaning
[00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:34.960]   out of it, evacuate the glory out of it? And is there anything more sad than that foolish people
[00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:39.800]   should say, "I can't be bothered about this doctrine. All I know is I've got my experience."
[00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:46.160]   My dear friend, get hold of every word here, and don't yield anything, not a single letter of any
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:51.280]   word. Every part of it counts if you want to see the glory, if you want to know anything about the
[00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:58.040]   love of God, and if you want to have an unshakable assurance, hold on to every detail, every word,
[00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:07.400]   every letter, and see its glorious content in the mind and in the eternal purpose of God.
[00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:12.880]   Well, God willing, we'll go on to complete this argument, this statement, next Friday night.
[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:22.640]   Let us pray. O Lord, our God, we come to thee, and we feel, O God, that we know not what to say.
[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:34.960]   We but bow before thee, O Lord, lost in wonder, love, and praise. O God, open our understandings
[00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:42.040]   more and more. Give us a thirst for this blessed knowledge and a true understanding of it.
[00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:49.520]   O God, forgive us if we have at any time been guilty of detracting from the glory of thy love,
[00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:58.000]   and of what thou hast done in and through thy dear, only begotten, beloved Son, thine own Son.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:08.360]   Lord, help us, O, to see these things, that our whole being shall go out in praise,
[00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:18.120]   in thanksgiving, in worship, and in adoration. And now, may the grace of our Lord and Savior,
[00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:24.600]   Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship and the communion of the Holy Spirit,
[00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:31.480]   abide and continue with us now this night, throughout the remainder of this hour's short
[00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:41.200]   and sudden earthly life and pilgrimage, and until we shall see the Lamb that once was slain,
[00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:49.560]   and hath redeemed us in all his glory. Amen.
[00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:54.560]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
