[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   I want to welcome you to our Q&A session with the Pastors Johns.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.580]   How do you pluralize that?
[00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:10.580]   Pastor Johns.
[00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.320]   That's good enough.
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.400]   Pastors Johns.
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.160]   There's something wonderful about this opportunity.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.960]   Both of these men are known for their deep well of biblical and theological knowledge.
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:30.420]   Their years and years of pastoral faithfulness have prepared them for moments like these.
[00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.560]   They both have a burden to answer people's questions.
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:40.480]   Dr. MacArthur, you have had hundreds of sessions with your local church where you'll just open
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.520]   up the microphone on Sunday night and ask and answer people's questions.
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.520]   And they'll line up.
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:52.000]   And it was, I think, two weeks ago you answered questions for two hours, extemporaneous, just
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.080]   what was on people's hearts.
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:02.640]   Pastor John, Piper, also, Dr. MacArthur, Dr. Piper, just to fix this problem, Dr. Piper,
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.240]   you have a podcast called Ask Pastor John.
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.560]   Do you listen to that?
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:18.020]   It's incredibly helpful as the dear Tony Reinke asks you so many questions.
[00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:27.600]   And I want to tell the guys right away that that podcast has produced a book of 750 Bible
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.200]   answers to life's most important questions.
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.720]   So Ask Pastor John, it's totally sold out in the book tent already.
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.040]   So it just disappeared quickly.
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.580]   You can get it online.
[00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.720]   So I recommend that to you men.
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.960]   And obviously, Dr. MacArthur's years and years of answers to Bible questions are at gty.org.
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:55.000]   And I think that's where I'd like to start is why is it so important for the pastor to
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.400]   be accessible, to ask and answer questions, to be there for people's needs?
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.760]   And why has that become such an important part of your ministries?
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.240]   Dr. MacArthur, start with you.
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.840]   Well, because you don't want to spend your whole ministry telling people what they don't
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.880]   want to know.
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:19.880]   Sometimes we do.
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:20.880]   Yeah.
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:21.880]   Yes.
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.160]   But I said you don't want to spend your whole ministry.
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:33.460]   You want to spend some of your ministry telling them what they don't want to know.
[00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.400]   But you also want to spend a lot of your ministry telling them what they desperately want to
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.400]   know.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.800]   The cries of their heart, the dilemmas that they face.
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:49.020]   And particularly in a pastoral role where there's trust.
[00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:57.800]   So you don't have to sort of give an apologia for every answer you give, because you've
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.600]   built in trust by feeding them the Word of God.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:10.360]   I think Paul set me on that course when he dialogued D'Alego, talked back and forth with
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.000]   the people he ministered to to answer their compelling questions.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.080]   And for him, it would have been more difficult because all they would have had at most would
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.320]   be the Old Testament.
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.280]   For us, we can direct them to the New Testament.
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.600]   But this has always been a vital part of our ministry.
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:34.680]   And I think what I hear from deconstruction people, the ex-evangelical hashtag people,
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.680]   is that they went to a church, but they never got their questions answered.
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.520]   There's no reason for that.
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.200]   We have the answers.
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.040]   AUSTIN: So it's about the contemporaneity of those questions.
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.800]   It's what's on people's hearts.
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.320]   It's also about the sufficiency of Scripture.
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.720]   What's the burden behind your desire to answer people's questions, Dr. Piper?
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:59.720]   DR.
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:00.720]   PIPER Yeah.
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:07.480]   Well, at my stage in life, when I don't have a local church anymore that I oversee as the
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:15.160]   pastor, look at the book, which is the other little thing I do online, has kind of replaced
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:21.240]   my preaching role, and Ask Pastor John has replaced my counseling role.
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.800]   So I get to do all my pastoral work online.
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.400]   That's one way to look at it.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:35.600]   The other is the pulpit John MacArthur and John Piper, I think, is not exactly the same
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:42.040]   as the Q&A John Piper, John MacArthur, or the conversational John MacArthur.
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.600]   At least that's what people tell me about you, and I think that's what I've found.
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.320]   They say you're a bulldog in the pulpit.
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:55.960]   And then they say you're the kindest, gentlest, most gracious person in conversation.
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.480]   And I've seen both of those.
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:02.280]   I have no idea whether I'm viewed as a bulldog or a kind person, but I think I am viewed
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.880]   as a different person.
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:10.240]   So I think that your flock needs to know you both ways.
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:16.640]   It is not a bad thing to be a prophetic authority in the pulpit that scares the heebie-jeebies
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.520]   out of people.
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:28.200]   And it's not a bad thing to be a lowly servant, quiet listener who gets your arms around people
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.200]   out of the pulpit.
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.840]   JOHN MACARTHUR Yeah, you preach with boldness, and you give an answer with meekness and fear.
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:34.840]   Yeah.
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.000]   [END PLAYBACK]
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:43.300]   So we've highlighted before in Q&As with the two of you how different you both are.
[00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:48.600]   Different personalities wired in different ways, and I think that's something that we
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.880]   thank God for in the way He makes people different.
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.920]   But there's something that has been noticed at this conference, and it's that you two
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.260]   have an unusual bond.
[00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:04.600]   People are taking pictures of you two greeting and hugging each other and talking together
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:10.000]   and posting them online and just talking about how encouraged they are by the bond and friendship
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.120]   that the two of you share.
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.760]   I really want this Q&A to be helpful to these pastors that are watching and listening to
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:17.920]   this.
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:24.180]   And I think that there's something that you could teach us about why relationships with
[00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.640]   another pastor are so important.
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:32.120]   What is it about friendship that will enhance a man's pastoral ministry?
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.340]   And we've heard a little bit about that in this conference, but speak experientially
[00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:40.040]   to these brothers and help them think about the pastor and friendship.
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:51.420]   I've heard people say that your best friends are going to have to be outside the church,
[00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:57.600]   not your own church, not your own staff, not your own elders, deacons.
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:03.400]   I did not find that true, and I don't think it's a healthy thing to talk that way.
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:14.880]   I, for 33 years, considered my staff my best friends, and the elders were absolutely trustworthy
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:15.880]   with my life.
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:24.560]   So if Noel and I were having problems, I didn't try to hide it from anybody on the staff.
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:28.440]   They were my closest friends.
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:33.920]   They are still today the ones that I still have around me.
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:39.280]   So that's the first thing I'd say, is don't feel like, "Oh, you can't have a good friend
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:43.880]   inside the church because you can't really be honest with them," but baloney.
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:51.700]   You really ought to be honest with the people closest to you and work with you.
[00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.960]   We need to know each other through and through.
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:59.760]   For whatever reason, Jesus had his Peter, James, and John, and he had his 12, and he
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:06.680]   had his 70, and so there are these concentric circles of intimacy, it seems, that mattered
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:07.680]   to him.
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:08.800]   They certainly mattered to me.
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:15.480]   To this day, I meet with two guys every other week, and they know me like nobody else knows
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:18.320]   me, and I think that keeps me accountable.
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:23.140]   That's a big deal today, accountability, but it never feels quite that way if you're with
[00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:25.840]   really good friends.
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:31.400]   So that matters, that they know me, they can speak into my life, and those friends need
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:35.840]   to be not "yes men."
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:41.680]   They need to be fearless around you and speak into your life without feeling like they're
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:46.140]   going to be squashed because you have more authority than they do.
[00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:49.600]   So I think that makes a huge difference, whether you're accountable, whether your heart is
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:55.520]   open, and whether they can bear your burdens that you share with them, can pray for you
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:59.600]   at the deepest levels where very few other people are praying for you because they don't
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.200]   know what you're dealing with.
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.440]   Dr. MacArthur, what would you add about friendship?
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:10.040]   Well, let me talk about John.
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:13.680]   I was asked, "Why would you have John Piper at the conference?"
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:26.520]   And my immediate answer was because, one, I love him; two, he is as formidable a lover
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:36.360]   of Christ as there exists in the world today; three, because he feeds me.
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:46.720]   I don't get a lot of time with John, but I did get 1,000 pages plus of Providence delivered
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:54.200]   to me, delivered to me through your mind and your heart and your faces on every page because
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:10:02.600]   I know you, and I'm reading, but I'm hearing you, and I know you well enough to know what
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:08.060]   went on for you to be able to produce such a massive, massive work.
[00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:15.520]   I don't know that there's more than a handful of people who have had that kind of biblical
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.920]   effect on me of modern people.
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:24.840]   I mean, you probably read more old authors than you do current authors like I do.
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:28.680]   But for a current author, you've delivered your soul to me in so many ways.
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:33.320]   I remember we were at the SING conference one year - you might not remember this - and
[00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:37.680]   you were speaking at the early session, whether it was 7, 45, or 8 in the morning.
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:41.520]   I was in the green room when you showed up, and you said, "What are you doing here?"
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:42.520]   Do you remember that?
[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:43.520]   JOHN PIPER No.
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:44.520]   But I'm eager to hear.
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:45.520]   R.C.
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:46.520]   SPROUL And I said, "What do you mean, 'What am I
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:47.520]   doing here?'"
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:48.520]   You're speaking.
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:49.520]   You said, "You came to hear me speak?"
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:50.520]   I said, "Of course."
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:11:01.840]   I mean, you're processing - you flew from California last night.
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:02.840]   You got in late.
[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:07.440]   It's 7 in the morning, which is 4 or 5 in the morning.
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:15.920]   I wait for the Lord to use you to bring me what I need for my heart and soul.
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:21.160]   So anytime I can do that, I'm going to be there.
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:27.360]   JOHN PIPER Be of your kind.
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.360]   C.S.
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:36.280]   Lewis made the distinctions about the four kinds of loves, and Eros - lovers are looking
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:40.680]   at each other in the face, and they're telling each other how delicious they are.
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:41.680]   R.C.
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:48.200]   SPROUL No, it's not that kind of love, John.
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:52.120]   (Laughter and applause.)
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:59.280]   JOHN PIPER Don't interrupt; I'm getting there.
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:04.120]   And philos is friendship, and you're not facing each other.
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:11.440]   You're facing a passionate goal, right, shoulder-to-shoulder, and you're not doing
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.240]   a lot of intimate talk.
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:17.400]   I started with the intimacy piece of those guys know me through and through.
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:25.020]   But what makes it friendship is the shoulder-to-shoulder pulling in a worthy, great cause you're willing
[00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:26.020]   to die for.
[00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:32.160]   And when you smell in another person that you're pulling in the same reins, in the same
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.440]   yoke, then you feel like, "We could die together.
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.440]   This would be good.
[00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:37.440]   This would be good."
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:38.440]   (Laughter and applause.)
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:41.360]   So that's the kind of friendship you want.
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:46.320]   You want a shoulder-to-shoulder, common goal, common vision.
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:53.400]   And this might be a good place to say, "I don't believe it's a good goal to have a theologically
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:54.400]   diverse staff."
[00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:59.120]   I mean, I've heard pastors say, like, "Oh, we don't need to agree on all the theological
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.320]   things on the staff."
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:05.480]   I say, "Baloney, you've got to lead your people together.
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:06.480]   You've got to lead."
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:10.760]   So when you're shoulder-to-shoulder, you know what the other person is thinking, you know
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:15.120]   what the other person is feeling, and oh, the camaraderie that brings you.
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:21.280]   So when the church gets into a crisis, oh my goodness, how glorious is it to have a
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:25.560]   few close friends that you absolutely know they're going to be standing by you through
[00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:26.560]   the crisis.
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:29.040]   LARSON: Yeah, that's a great answer.
[00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:34.600]   JOHN: That's why J.C. Ryle said that friendship is that beautiful thing, gift from God, that
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:38.560]   doubles our joys and halves our sorrows.
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:41.120]   And that's what you men are sharing with us.
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:47.960]   And that's why pastors need Christ-honoring, Christ-centered, Christ-pursuing friendships.
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:50.560]   So let's dig deeper into that and talk about...
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:53.560]   LARSON: Can I say one more thing?
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:55.660]   You got me going on this.
[00:13:55.660 --> 00:14:02.360]   If you're really bound together deeply, theologically deeply, spiritually deeply, you don't have
[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:04.920]   to spend a lot of time together.
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:08.240]   I mean, I've got a few friends, I see them once a year or so.
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:11.880]   I see him less often than that probably.
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:14.880]   And when you get together, you just pick up where you were.
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:16.520]   That's the way it was with those people.
[00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:18.760]   For years, I've related to some people that way.
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:22.960]   It's like a once-a-year friendship, but it feels deeper than some people you see every
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:30.280]   week because the shoulder-to-shoulder common convictions and ground and goal is so deep.
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:36.200]   So don't feel like you can't have significant friendships with people that you knew in college
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:41.320]   or you knew in seminary, but you keep up with them at a distance.
[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:44.760]   JOHN: You know, I had that kind of relationship with R.C.
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:52.100]   I mean, we were on opposite coasts, and we spent some time together, maybe once or twice
[00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:54.000]   a year, Steve.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   And yet there was this shoulder-to-shoulder attitude that we knew if we ever were in a
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.880]   severe battle, we needed to be together, and that's where we were at ECT.
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:09.040]   And that kind of defined that relationship.
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:13.880]   And people said, "How could you have such a friendship when you had different theological
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:15.800]   views on certain things?"
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:19.200]   And again, it's right back to exactly what John said.
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:23.480]   R.C. would always say, "When I'm in a foxhole, I'm going to call you."
[00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:24.480]   That's good.
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:33.720]   Let's talk about the flip side of this, or maybe the deepest and darkest part of friendship,
[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:36.720]   which is when a friend fails us.
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:42.480]   And we've all had that experience of betrayal, a friend that drifts into error, or a friend
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:44.940]   that drifts into sin.
[00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:49.440]   Maybe you could help the pastors here process what was a common experience for the Apostle
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:54.360]   Paul, for the Lord Jesus, when friends fail you.
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:16:02.040]   When that happens, how do you continue to pour yourself into the lives of people?
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:07.880]   How do you ensure that you don't become self-protective, but you continue to invest and pour in and
[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:12.000]   love your friends, even when friends fail?
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.760]   Talk a little bit about that experience and ministry.
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:16.200]   Pastor John MacArthur.
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:25.320]   Well, I guess for me, it goes back to our Lord in Judas, or it goes back to Paul and
[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:26.320]   Demas.
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:34.920]   The best of the best of the best of the best are going to be betrayed, and the more you
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:39.760]   invest in someone, the more potential they have to devastate you.
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:42.560]   So you can be gun-shy.
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:47.640]   My dad told me when I was just starting out in ministry something that you referred to
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:53.880]   a minute ago, "Don't make close friends with the people you serve with because you'll find
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:57.440]   yourself being so terribly disappointed."
[00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:04.280]   I usually took my dad's advice; I never took that advice because it was overpowered for
[00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:09.440]   me by the experience of Christ, and not just with Judas, but even with Peter.
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:18.160]   If he was disappointed with Judas, who was a devil, how much more disappointed was he
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:22.940]   with Peter, who was a true believer?
[00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:29.840]   So who am I to expect loyalty from everybody all the time?
[00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:35.020]   We know what Paul endured, whether it was John Mark or Demas or whatever, and who knows
[00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:38.480]   all the other stories, all in Asia have forsaken me.
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:45.240]   How can you come to the end of your ministry and say, "Everybody has forsaken me"?
[00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:50.040]   How is that even possible, and you're the Apostle Paul, and you're the reason that anybody
[00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:54.520]   is even a Christian?
[00:17:54.520 --> 00:18:00.740]   But you have to understand that that goes with the territory.
[00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:06.520]   That's part of it, and you can't - I mean, you do some inventory on your own heart - could
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:12.320]   have done something different, but for me, the Lord has always balanced that with many
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:17.640]   more who are faithful over the long haul, and I focus on that and rest in the fact that
[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:23.520]   if it was true of the Apostle Paul and of our Lord, I should probably expect a whole
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:26.120]   lot more disloyalty than I get.
[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:32.360]   You know, there's an interesting connection that I didn't see until about three years
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:37.200]   ago in the Demas text.
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:41.320]   In verse 7, I think it's, "I've fought the good fight, I've finished the course, I've
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:46.120]   kept the faith, henceforth there's laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:52.040]   Lord, the righteous judge, will give to me, and not only to me, but to all who have loved
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:53.040]   His appearing."
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:58.280]   And two verses later, Demas disappeared in love for the world.
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:04.400]   And so I think one answer to the question of how you survive Demas is by loving the
[00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:11.520]   second coming, which generalized means something like this, "This world is one conveyor belt
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:12.760]   of disappointments."
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:18.960]   I mean, every day has a disappointment in it.
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:22.880]   Some situation didn't go the way you want, somebody lets you down.
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:25.960]   Life is disappointment, and some of them are awful.
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:28.120]   Demas probably broke his heart.
[00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:33.680]   But he so loved Christ, and he so loved the second coming, and he knew that everything's
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:37.400]   going to be worked out, it's all going to be okay.
[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:44.480]   So I think having a heavenly mindset, which is the way Jesus told us to deal with slander
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:46.040]   in Matthew 5, right?
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:53.080]   When they say, "All kinds of evil against you falsely, rejoice and be glad," why?
[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:54.960]   Great is your reward in heaven.
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:20:00.680]   But how do you even function in the midst of slander unless you love heaven, unless
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:04.880]   you believe in the future, the world to come?
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:07.480]   So that's one piece.
[00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:15.200]   Another piece I'd say about betrayal is don't become embittered, lean into reconciliation
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:16.520]   possibilities.
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:21.400]   It might seem absolutely impossible that this relationship could be fixed.
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:22.600]   It's just not going to happen.
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:24.240]   It's just so ugly.
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.440]   Don't believe that.
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:27.140]   God does miracles.
[00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:36.280]   So the worst betrayal I ever experienced was 1993, seven-year adultery, man I'd worked
[00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:42.080]   with for 10 years, devastated the church, 230 people left in those days.
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:46.240]   I think we had about an attendance of 1,200 in those days, 230 people walk because they
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:54.960]   didn't like church discipline, and I had dinner with that man 10 years later, and we wept,
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:59.940]   and we held each other, and I attended his funeral, and I hugged his wife, and we made
[00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:01.600]   it okay.
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.120]   It was okay.
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:08.360]   We're going to be in heaven together, and that's possible, guys, really possible.
[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:13.560]   And your job is to believe that and not to be the one who's just sneering and saying,
[00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:17.360]   "You just get out of my life, and you stay out of my life because of what you wrecked
[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:20.880]   in this church or what you wrecked in my relationship."
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:27.080]   So believe the miracle is possible that reconciliation could happen.
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:37.240]   Building on that, I think you also have to look at that person as an instrument through
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:39.920]   which the Lord is perfecting you.
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:42.460]   That's right.
[00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:48.000]   Those are the best times for your spiritual benefit.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:56.960]   They tear down your pride, and self-confidence, and sense of privilege, and expected rights.
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:03.840]   And if you will look at the person that hurt you the most as the instrument that God used,
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:07.240]   then you'll understand what Paul was talking about when he wrote to the Corinthians about
[00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:11.600]   the thorn in the flesh, and the Lord said, "I'm not going to remove it because when you're
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:14.960]   the weakest, you're the strongest."
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:27.040]   And I think we never are going to be too weak to be effective.
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:36.520]   That 2 Corinthians reality of chapter 12 really runs through that whole book, doesn't it?
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:40.720]   That pastoral suffering is for the sake of their people.
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:42.680]   It's just all through the book.
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:44.640]   It just starts off in chapter 1.
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:50.080]   "May you be comforted with the comfort with which you have been comforted by God."
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:53.400]   So if you wonder why you're going through the hell you're going through right now, it's
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:56.320]   for the sake of your people.
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:04.440]   God wants to do something in your shepherd heart that will make you a more wise, compassionate,
[00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:10.800]   loving, insightful, caring shepherd.
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:20.620]   AUSTIN: You both have battled for truth, various difficult doctrinal controversies, battle
[00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:25.640]   for truth in ethical matters like the ones you're addressing where someone drifts into
[00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:26.920]   error.
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:33.400]   I think you model both of you being warriors for the truth, and this conference is about
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:36.640]   truth, triumphing truth.
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:47.440]   How do we think about battling for truth and maintaining that full awareness of grace?
[00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:52.840]   Another way to say it is how do we differentiate in our battling for truth between contending
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:55.080]   and being contentious?
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:58.880]   How do we be bulldogs and followers of the Lamb?
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:00.960]   Yeah, that's good.
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:09.120]   You should be a preacher.
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:10.120]   Sound like H.B.
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:11.120]   Charles.
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:17.160]   What do you think?
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:25.960]   Yeah, I'll give you some more time.
[00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:35.760]   So I love John Owen, and I love Machen, and so I did this little book years ago on contending
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:38.440]   for our all, we called it.
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:39.440]   R.C.
[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:45.080]   Sproul wrote something for it, or forward, or blurb, or something, but he liked it.
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:47.600]   And that made me feel really good.
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:52.880]   But here's the one quote that made all the difference for me, and it's been a goal.
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:25:01.720]   I don't know that I've achieved it, but Owen said that we should commune with the Lord
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:09.840]   in the doctrine for which we contend, commune with the Lord in the doctrine for which we
[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:10.840]   contend.
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:13.080]   Now, here's what that means to me.
[00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:16.120]   So I'm fighting for justification, say, with N.T.
[00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:25.840]   Wright, or I'm fighting with Calvinism against Roger Olson, or whatever, and I've had, I
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:27.920]   know these guys, I've communicated with them.
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:33.240]   It's not like throwing hate bombs over the fence.
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:44.840]   My desire is that I would be authentic with them, and real with them, and that I would
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:47.080]   not be contentious.
[00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:53.280]   But when it's justification or the sovereignty of God, as I go into battle, whether it's
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:59.520]   over lunch or in a book, I'm saying, "Lord, I don't want this to be a game.
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:01.960]   I don't want us to have a little tiff here.
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:06.920]   I don't want to play word games, or doctrine games, or proposition games.
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:10.960]   I want to know the sweetness of justification.
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:14.720]   I want to know the preciousness of the sovereignty of God."
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:17.120]   That's the only reason I want to defend this.
[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:18.560]   I don't want to win anything.
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:20.720]   I'm not out to get strokes or be famous.
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:22.920]   I want to enjoy you.
[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:24.160]   I think that's what Owen meant.
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:29.760]   I want to enjoy God in the doctrine for which I contend.
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:38.880]   I think that changes the spirit from contentiousness to a humble, holy, courageous contending.
[00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:39.880]   That's one factor.
[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:45.740]   No, I think that's true.
[00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:55.280]   That will prevent you from being angry or being hostile, because if you love that truth,
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:58.840]   that basically takes over your heart.
[00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:03.120]   So that is the first thing, that this is a truth you love, not a club with which you
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:05.240]   want to beat people.
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:10.500]   The second thing is this is a person that you love or that you care about.
[00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:14.640]   So your attitude is going to be the combination of how you feel about the truth and how you
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:16.800]   feel about the person.
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:22.880]   If you lose it on either side, if you're trying to win an argument, you're going to be cantankerous.
[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:27.560]   Or if you're indifferent to the person, you're going to become frustrated with dealing with
[00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:32.240]   the person, and you're going to lose the tenderness and persuasiveness that the Spirit of God
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:36.280]   would want you to have while you're trying to convince them.
[00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:39.800]   That's very helpful.
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:53.240]   I would add, joy, along with love, has a huge effect, because you can lose your joy like
[00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:55.520]   that in an argument.
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:28:00.600]   Anger becomes - anger is an omnivorous emotion.
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:03.160]   It eats everything.
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:07.720]   It eats compassion, it eats joy, it eats everything.
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:15.200]   If you get taken over by anger, and joy is a great antidote.
[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:18.080]   In your local church, there'll be little controversies.
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:21.960]   We're kind of talking big controversies here, public controversies, but in your church you'll
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:23.000]   have controversies.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.880]   People don't like what you just said or believed.
[00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:28.760]   So I had a guy one time who did not like my eschatology.
[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:32.960]   I won't even tell you which side anybody's on here.
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:39.520]   But I preached on a Sunday evening, went public kind of, and I said, "I can't imagine anybody
[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:40.520]   wanting to do that."
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:44.040]   He said, he was at the back of the row, he said, "I don't believe that!"
[00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:47.240]   Right out loud in the service.
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:51.200]   Now here's another illustration of somebody you get really reconciled with.
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:56.280]   And I said to him, along with the other people sitting like this in the back row, "I'm going
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:29:06.960]   to out-rejoice you and out-live you."
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:13.080]   And I did.
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:19.840]   But that particular man, that particular man, that was, I was brand new, like three years
[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:25.820]   into my 33-year ministry, and we became precious friends.
[00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:27.680]   We never agreed.
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:29.920]   Precious friends.
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:36.920]   And when he moved away to Iowa later, he called me after about six years and said his wife
[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:40.040]   had died and would I do the funeral.
[00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:44.840]   So don't think that the people who stand up and shout out in your service, "I agree with
[00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:45.840]   you, Pastor."
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:51.160]   Don't think they won't do a 180 and love you like crazy before you're done.
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:54.380]   Because what was under that, and it's one of the reasons we like each other so much,
[00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:57.620]   is he loved the Bible.
[00:29:57.620 --> 00:29:59.340]   He loved the Bible.
[00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:00.660]   He thought I was unbiblical.
[00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:09.620]   But then after two or three years, he said, "Hyper's not unbiblical.
[00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:17.260]   He's totally under this book, and we'll just have to agree to disagree on that one."
[00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:23.700]   So, to think about your ministries and how they will be thought of in the future is beyond
[00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:30.980]   our capability as people with our limited understanding of how God works and how providence
[00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:31.980]   unfolds.
[00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:37.700]   But I think it's not speculation to say that though you've written hundreds of books between
[00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:43.820]   the two of you, tens of thousands of pages and millions of words, many, many years from
[00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:53.420]   now, you both will be known for one book first and foremost that you wrote.
[00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:57.880]   I think you'll be known for Desiring God, and you will be known for Gospel According
[00:30:57.880 --> 00:30:59.660]   to Jesus.
[00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:09.020]   Those are formative, definitive, huge impact books that reflect the heartbeat of your ministries
[00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:12.420]   and the emphasis of your lives.
[00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:20.300]   I would like you to just consider why those books, especially I'm interested in, Dr. Piper,
[00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:24.780]   you telling me why is that the case for Dr. MacArthur?
[00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:27.180]   And Dr. MacArthur, why do you think that's the case for John Piper?
[00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:28.180]   DR.
[00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:29.180]   PIPER No, that's not what I expected.
[00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:37.540]   You didn't put that in the notes.
[00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:38.540]   That's going to be fun.
[00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:46.780]   Let's go for it.
[00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:59.060]   I can give maybe a sort of sophomoric answer to the question regarding John Piper.
[00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:05.420]   And I think why that book meant so much to him was his life was revolutionized permanently
[00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:08.500]   by Jonathan Edwards.
[00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:13.380]   I don't know a John Piper without Jonathan Edwards.
[00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:23.260]   I mean, this is what comes across to me, and obviously I'm on the outside looking in, but
[00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:24.980]   you can't shake this.
[00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:30.700]   I mean, last night you were saying what you said 50 years ago.
[00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:32.540]   You can't shake it.
[00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:33.540]   Somebody said, "What did you think?"
[00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:38.340]   And I said, "It was the best of the best of the best of John Piper."
[00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:39.900]   Because it runs so deep.
[00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:49.980]   It's in every fiber of his being, and everything in the Bible leads him to that, that pleasure.
[00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:54.260]   And I think God used Jonathan Edwards.
[00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:59.260]   I mean, that's all I can say, because the first thing you said last night is, "I'm an
[00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:03.140]   Edwardian," by your own confession.
[00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:10.440]   That is - that's amazing with all the opportunities there are for us to be influenced by people.
[00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:17.660]   What was the Lord doing when He dropped Jonathan Edwards in you in an irretrievable act you
[00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:19.180]   could never undo?
[00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:26.480]   I mean, you took Jonathan Edwards, I think, even beyond where Jonathan Edwards thought
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:30.440]   he could go.
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:42.340]   So yeah, I mean, the awakening, the awakening to those truths define him.
[00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:43.340]   In my case -
[00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:46.660]   No, let's make others say that.
[00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:54.120]   Well, I was just going to say, in my case, and probably all of our cases - this is a
[00:33:54.120 --> 00:34:02.500]   final comment - it took us longer to get on the bandwagon than it did you.
[00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:09.520]   Even when you started it early on saying this Christian hedonism, I mean, you were double
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:13.620]   clutching because you knew this sounded weird.
[00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:27.620]   But I mean, right here, you won us over, John, through these years.
[00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:28.620]   Thank you.
[00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:31.880]   Was that somewhat true?
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:33.300]   Everything you just said was true.
[00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:36.180]   The last part, "I'll wait and see," kind of like.
[00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:39.900]   Well, I can't speak for everybody, but I'm in.
[00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:42.180]   I hope it's true.
[00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:46.460]   God will wait and see.
[00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:51.540]   He's already answered my half of the question by preaching the sermon you preached two nights
[00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:53.820]   ago.
[00:34:53.820 --> 00:35:02.860]   This is your theme from 40 years ago with gospel according to Jesus, and where's obedience
[00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:04.340]   in the church today?
[00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:09.540]   And so here's my interpretation of why that took hold of him, gripped him, held him, preaching
[00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:13.140]   the same sermon now that he wrote in the book there.
[00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:14.900]   And I wrote a review of that book.
[00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:15.900]   I couldn't put that book down.
[00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:21.700]   I was so excited with it because of what I was fighting in those days, a kind of easy
[00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:29.180]   believism that we both consider then rampant and just as rampant today - lots of unbelievers
[00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:30.820]   in the church.
[00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:37.420]   And so what John saw was that in the radical words of Jesus, "If you don't love me more
[00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:40.740]   than you love mother, father, son, or daughter, you're not worthy of me," period.
[00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:44.060]   I mean, that's just totally crazy, radical, right?
[00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:48.700]   You just won't be a Christian if you don't love me, and obedience flows from love.
[00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:50.900]   Why do you call me "Lord, Lord" and don't do what I say?
[00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:54.580]   Lots of people are going to hear the word at the end, and they'll be shocked.
[00:35:54.580 --> 00:36:01.700]   And he saw all these radical words, and he looked out at the evangelical church, and
[00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:05.980]   he thought, "Do they read the same Bible I read?
[00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:07.500]   Do they hear the same gospel?"
[00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:18.900]   So basically, that book argued that James 2 should be in the Bible, that it's not an
[00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:20.540]   epistle of straw.
[00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:27.580]   If your faith does not transform you into a person who loves other people and produces
[00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:30.700]   good works, it isn't saving faith.
[00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:38.460]   And therefore, churches need to be confronted with the carnality as dangerous to their souls.
[00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:39.940]   And that's what I was dealing with.
[00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:46.500]   I felt like I've never considered myself to be a very effective evangelist, although I
[00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:52.260]   thrill with every story of anybody that gets saved, which I heard yesterday from one of
[00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:54.540]   you brothers who's in this room right now.
[00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:56.460]   Thank you for that encouragement.
[00:36:56.460 --> 00:37:02.860]   But I've always felt myself talking to the church that doesn't look saved, churches that
[00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:04.900]   don't look saved.
[00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:10.180]   Their Christianity is so lukewarm, which Jesus is going to spit out of his mouth, that I've
[00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:14.600]   wanted to do a Christian hedonist kind of revival.
[00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:19.180]   And you know, the relationship between the two books is this, when you publish that,
[00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:24.540]   and then I later publish a book, "Future Grace and What is Saving Faith," I said, "All I'm
[00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:30.140]   doing is trying to complete what MacArthur is saying."
[00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:33.820]   MacArthur is saying, "You must obey in order to have saving faith."
[00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:36.780]   And I'm saying, "You know why that is, folks?
[00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:40.700]   Because saving faith is being satisfied in Jesus, and that changes everything.
[00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:41.700]   That's all it is.
[00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:46.480]   I mean, it's just like two gloves, two hand and glove fitting together."
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:51.480]   It's good.
[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:55.800]   It's good.
[00:37:55.800 --> 00:38:01.600]   Let's continue to talk about preaching, but more specifically about the act of preaching.
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:09.120]   And I want you to think about encouraging these brothers in there that the grind that
[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:17.880]   is preaching, the continual, ever-present, burdensome joy, it's been called, of preaching
[00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:20.280]   the Word of God to the people of God.
[00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:27.440]   How has your view of preaching changed since you were a young preacher?
[00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:30.240]   How do you think about preaching now?
[00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:36.560]   And maybe the question is, why do you still believe?
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:40.240]   And where did this commitment come from in expository preaching?
[00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:46.400]   After all these years and all these thousands of sermons, how has your view of preaching
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:47.400]   changed?
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:50.000]   Why do you still believe in expository preaching?
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.640]   Dr. MacArthur?
[00:38:52.640 --> 00:39:03.960]   Well, that's a simple question because it's the approach by which you maximize the content
[00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:06.080]   of the Bible.
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:15.120]   If every word of God is pure, if there is - and there is - a milk aspect of truth, as
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:20.720]   Paul talks about, and a meat aspect of truth, that means you start somewhere and you keep
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:23.760]   going deeper.
[00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:33.360]   I would say now I probably love expository preaching more than I ever have, and I find
[00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:34.360]   it inexhaustible.
[00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:41.360]   By the time I get to Sunday, I could be dangerous so I couldn't preach.
[00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:44.240]   Do you understand that, John?
[00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:47.120]   I would like to see you be dangerous.
[00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:49.640]   Because I'm going to bend your ear.
[00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:54.800]   I might say to my wife, "You might want to go away on Monday if I didn't - because you're
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:59.640]   going to get a sermon."
[00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:08.000]   It's the inexhaustibility of Scripture, the depth, and breadth, and height, and length,
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:17.760]   the inexhaustible reality of Scripture reveals itself to me every single week.
[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:18.760]   Every single week.
[00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:25.280]   I've never felt like I've - I feel like somebody on the shore of the Pacific Ocean with a bucket
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:28.760]   full of water, and you ask me, "Is that the ocean?"
[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:29.760]   No.
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:32.600]   It's just one little tiny part.
[00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:44.160]   So I could preach, I don't know, endless lifetimes and never exhaust the truth of Scripture.
[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:51.920]   So at the same time, expository preaching not only covers everything, but it goes in
[00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:54.200]   depth.
[00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:59.240]   It has to, because you can't get away with not explaining something.
[00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:03.400]   So I love expository preaching.
[00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:07.240]   One other thing that comes to mind when I think about this a lot is I'm never trying
[00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:12.760]   to figure out what I'm going to say on Sunday, because I'm progressing through a book and
[00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:15.940]   everything is building on everything else.
[00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:22.240]   I wouldn't know another way to preach, really.
[00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:26.600]   The short way of saying that is you believe in expository preaching because God wrote
[00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:27.600]   a book.
[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:31.200]   I mean, just let it sink in.
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:36.380]   God gave us a book.
[00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:38.440]   God gave us a book.
[00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:39.440]   What would you do?
[00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:43.440]   What else would you do but tell people what's in the book?
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:46.640]   You don't know anything.
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:48.660]   God knows everything.
[00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:53.580]   He's totally smart.
[00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:58.040]   So I mean, just let it sink in, brothers.
[00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:06.700]   If you believe this, this is the Word of the Creator of the universe, why would you waste
[00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:09.540]   your time talking about anything else?
[00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:21.620]   So that's what he just said.
[00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:25.740]   So the other part of the question, so that's great.
[00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:32.460]   The other part of the question about change, you know, you're asking two guys who probably
[00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:37.400]   more than any other two people on the planet haven't changed anything.
[00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:39.860]   We don't change.
[00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:45.060]   People ask me, you know, "What have you changed since your theology formed?"
[00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:50.140]   I said, "Yikes, I can't think of anything."
[00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:59.700]   But with regard to preaching, I would say I think if I had to do over again, those 33
[00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:11.140]   years in the pulpit, I would try to be more intentional about combining careful, local,
[00:43:11.140 --> 00:43:18.340]   immediate, expository explanation of texts with doctrinal formation of the church.
[00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:22.460]   I don't think I did that the way I would do it now.
[00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:24.860]   I want to do more of this.
[00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:29.140]   That's dangerous to say because I know some of you maybe come out of confessional traditions
[00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:34.820]   where you start with system and you have to work to be expositionally faithful, and others
[00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:39.080]   of you start with expositional, immediate faithfulness, and you have to work to get
[00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:40.860]   to system and doctrine.
[00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:47.720]   And somewhere in the middle, I want to be because I think churches can listen to us,
[00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:54.760]   do exposition, and never form a framework of theology of their own without some help.
[00:43:54.760 --> 00:44:01.160]   So that's one change I'd probably make is that I would take...I don't mean necessarily
[00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:09.920]   preach theme sermons, like a whole series on predestination or a whole series on regeneration,
[00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:11.560]   but that would be great.
[00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:12.560]   I would do that.
[00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:17.840]   But rather, as you're going through texts and you bump into a word that's just laden
[00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:23.240]   with doctrinal content, and you don't have to go into that, or you can, I probably would
[00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:27.800]   go into it more now than I would have back in the day.
[00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:30.460]   That's one difference.
[00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:40.880]   Another is that I...the actual delivery has changed in that I feel much more free to go
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:47.240]   off-script, right, all the time.
[00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:52.160]   I feel the ability to look right into people's eyes while I'm talking.
[00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:55.660]   That used to throw me for a loop in the first five years of preaching.
[00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:58.440]   If I looked at somebody, I'd lose my place.
[00:44:58.440 --> 00:44:59.440]   I couldn't think.
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:04.840]   I think young preachers have a hard time of being immediately, directly engaged with human
[00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:06.500]   beings.
[00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:14.440]   And thirdly, as an older person, I feel more warranted to press into people's consciences,
[00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:15.440]   even older people.
[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:22.520]   I mean, a 30-year-old pastor with about 160 old people in his church is a little bit hesitant
[00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:28.640]   to get serious with them and press into their sins.
[00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:35.080]   I don't care anymore.
[00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:37.640]   That's one difference, I think.
[00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:44.960]   But in summary, I think what I've discovered, so this is my summary of preaching that where
[00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:50.160]   I land, I'd be happy to die tomorrow and believe this.
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:46:00.640]   It's a combination of faithful, rigorous exposition of what's really there, mingled with a passionate
[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:07.480]   demonstration or exaltation in the reality of what it's talking about, mingled with a
[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:11.400]   in-your-face application to their consciences.
[00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:15.680]   Those three things is what I want to do when I preach.
[00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:19.680]   It's actually a little easier to do that on the Internet.
[00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:22.000]   It is?
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:28.640]   Than to face the same people every week and do that.
[00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:30.280]   I see.
[00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:39.880]   No, you've got to – well, you know what I'm saying.
[00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:48.020]   I mean, you've got to come back next week, John.
[00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:59.480]   You lose some and you win some, right?
[00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:01.680]   More about preaching, okay?
[00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:06.360]   Titus 1, "Paul, a servant of God and the Apostle of Jesus Christ for the faith of God's
[00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:12.920]   elect and the knowledge of the truth that leads to godliness, a faith and knowledge
[00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:19.880]   resting on the hope of eternal life which God who does not lie promised before the beginning
[00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:28.800]   of time and at His appointed season He brought His Word to light through the preaching entrusted
[00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:33.760]   to me by the command of God our Savior."
[00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:42.520]   Let's encourage these brothers in their preaching and how preaching triumphs.
[00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:44.440]   Talk to us about the triumph of preaching.
[00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:51.000]   How can you help them see that they're preaching, which we're able to forget our own sermons
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.160]   in a week's time sometimes.
[00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:54.160]   Easy.
[00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:56.200]   By Monday.
[00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:58.120]   Yeah.
[00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:05.280]   But there's something about preaching that's got eternal significance and lasting, persevering
[00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:07.320]   power in it.
[00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:10.960]   Encourage the brothers that their preaching will triumph.
[00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:13.400]   Help them think about triumphant preaching.
[00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:21.760]   As the rain and the snow come down from heaven and return not thither, causing it to bring
[00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:27.760]   forth and sprout, giving seed to the sower and bread to the eater, so will my Word be
[00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:29.320]   that goes forth from my mouth.
[00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:31.220]   It will not return to me empty.
[00:48:31.220 --> 00:48:34.120]   It will accomplish the thing for which I said it.
[00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:38.800]   It's just absolute glorious promise that God doesn't speak in vain.
[00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:44.720]   And the closer you can get to His Word, when your Word sounds, the more confident you can
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:48.860]   be this wasn't wasted.
[00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:53.200]   It may look for a moment like it had little effect.
[00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:55.940]   It is never without effect.
[00:48:55.940 --> 00:48:58.880]   If you're faithful to God's Word, so there's a promise.
[00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:06.160]   I will cause my Word to accomplish my purposes.
[00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:13.640]   That's what I say to myself over and over again when I step into the pulpit.
[00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:26.660]   And I would say this, lasting effect doesn't come from homiletical cleverness, meaning
[00:49:26.660 --> 00:49:30.320]   acronyms or like this conference has all P's.
[00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:36.780]   How you ever did that, I have no idea, like 11 P's, strength, the triumph of the truth
[00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:39.940]   through pleasure, the strength of the truth through providence, the strength of the truth
[00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:40.940]   through prayer.
[00:49:40.940 --> 00:49:41.940]   I said, "That's cool.
[00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:44.160]   How do they do that?"
[00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:48.920]   That has zero effect on the lasting nature of these sermons, okay?
[00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:50.200]   You just know that.
[00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:55.800]   And when you come up with a...and you use C's in yours, like compassion, whatever, wherever.
[00:49:55.800 --> 00:50:02.600]   That has zero effect on...
[00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:08.200]   That will help you remember His outline about three days, okay?
[00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:11.800]   And we're talking about three million years.
[00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:14.020]   That's all we care about.
[00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:19.740]   And what will affect people in three million years in your sermon is whether they were
[00:50:19.740 --> 00:50:27.700]   born again and whether the Holy Spirit convicted them of a sin in their lives, and they killed
[00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:32.920]   it, and they walked in holiness until they saw Jesus.
[00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:39.180]   In other words, the legacy of preaching, the lasting effect of preaching is the work of
[00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:41.280]   the Holy Spirit.
[00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:45.420]   And so you do the best you can with your acronyms, and you do the best you can with stories,
[00:50:45.420 --> 00:50:47.540]   and you do the best you can with H.B.
[00:50:47.540 --> 00:50:53.340]   Charles' amazing ability to put these little things together that you just say, "That's
[00:50:53.340 --> 00:50:54.340]   great.
[00:50:54.340 --> 00:50:55.800]   How did you do that?"
[00:50:55.800 --> 00:51:00.720]   And you do the best you can, and it holds people's attention, and that's good.
[00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:05.700]   But in the end, you're talking about what's going to be true in 10 years.
[00:51:05.700 --> 00:51:11.620]   And the answer is only if they were born again, and if some major mental structures in their
[00:51:11.620 --> 00:51:19.180]   life just went 180 degrees - sovereignty of God, free will of man, regeneration - just
[00:51:19.180 --> 00:51:22.940]   massive alterations in their thinking.
[00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:28.580]   That's what you're after, and that's the work of the Holy Spirit through a faithful rendering
[00:51:28.580 --> 00:51:30.260]   of His Word.
[00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:34.580]   Yeah, I think I would agree with all that.
[00:51:34.580 --> 00:51:40.620]   I would simply say that effective preaching is a journey.
[00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:43.700]   You start somewhere, and you're going somewhere.
[00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:47.220]   And you illustrated that last night.
[00:51:47.220 --> 00:51:53.140]   You told us where you were going to go, and you were going to get us to pleasure.
[00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:58.740]   And we bought into that, so we followed the journey.
[00:51:58.740 --> 00:52:04.420]   The four points, whatever you called them, the four connections, weren't the reality
[00:52:04.420 --> 00:52:05.560]   of the message.
[00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:10.420]   They were just the progression to get to the main point.
[00:52:10.420 --> 00:52:17.660]   So I always think of an outline or any kind of structure as the necessary logical chronology
[00:52:17.660 --> 00:52:20.820]   to get you to the main point.
[00:52:20.820 --> 00:52:29.140]   And one of the things with preaching is people have to be willing to stay with you until
[00:52:29.140 --> 00:52:36.060]   the end, because they know that they're going to be given some precious reality if they'll
[00:52:36.060 --> 00:52:38.540]   stay.
[00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:45.740]   So I think you handle the Scripture in a progressive way that keeps them involved in that journey.
[00:52:45.740 --> 00:52:53.460]   Some of it is the device, mnemonic devices, or whatever you use.
[00:52:53.460 --> 00:52:56.780]   Preaching is not just shooting out one idea and another idea and another idea and another
[00:52:56.780 --> 00:52:59.500]   idea and an emotional thing and a story.
[00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:01.120]   It's going somewhere.
[00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:03.900]   It's an argument.
[00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:11.060]   It's a crafted argument, and it has all the necessary devices to hold them to that.
[00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:14.980]   You have to shift and change and pace all of that.
[00:53:14.980 --> 00:53:21.120]   But if they'll stay on the journey, they'll learn eventually in your preaching that the
[00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:23.820]   finish is worth the trip.
[00:53:23.820 --> 00:53:26.700]   So stay on the journey.
[00:53:26.700 --> 00:53:32.500]   AUSTIN: And I think that's what makes your preaching, both Pastor John's preaching, so
[00:53:32.500 --> 00:53:39.640]   similar, is that it's driven and logical and focused on the text.
[00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:44.180]   And though you sound different when you listen to, as we have our seminarians do, listen
[00:53:44.180 --> 00:53:50.660]   to the same passage from John MacArthur and listen to the same passage from John Piper,
[00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:52.340]   the central truth is the same.
[00:53:52.340 --> 00:53:53.340]   It's the same passage.
[00:53:53.340 --> 00:53:57.060]   It's the same meaning because that's what Paul said.
[00:53:57.060 --> 00:54:05.780]   But the way you get there, what's common, you move a lot more than he does in the pulpit.
[00:54:05.780 --> 00:54:09.460]   But it's driven by logic, right?
[00:54:09.460 --> 00:54:17.260]   Both of you are so fastidious and logical and movement-oriented towards this is the
[00:54:17.260 --> 00:54:23.760]   meaning of the text and how it needs to be brought into light and life.
[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:28.540]   So talk a little bit, just for a moment, about each other's preaching.
[00:54:28.540 --> 00:54:35.700]   What is it that you see in MacArthur's preaching that is of such preciousness to you?
[00:54:35.700 --> 00:54:39.180]   And what do you see, Dr. MacArthur, about John Piper's preaching that you love?
[00:54:39.180 --> 00:54:40.180]   DR.
[00:54:40.180 --> 00:54:43.700]   MACARTHUR I think, I'm not going to say anything that
[00:54:43.700 --> 00:54:51.180]   we don't all say, is that Dr. MacArthur's preaching is incredibly clear.
[00:54:51.180 --> 00:55:03.940]   It is so clear, and it doesn't fumble around to get to the clear point.
[00:55:03.940 --> 00:55:08.620]   As I'm listening, I think, he's not wasting any words here.
[00:55:08.620 --> 00:55:11.980]   He's not blowing smoke anywhere.
[00:55:11.980 --> 00:55:13.580]   It's just clear.
[00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:17.860]   And then second thing is, that's really there in the text.
[00:55:17.860 --> 00:55:18.860]   That's really there.
[00:55:18.860 --> 00:55:20.700]   Look at that.
[00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:22.060]   And people love that.
[00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:23.420]   I love that.
[00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:28.620]   Like tell me what the text says, I want to know what God says.
[00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:36.900]   And third, he has the ability to relate the immediacy of the text to doctoral concerns
[00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:42.260]   or cultural concerns, without getting off on a tangent that gets you bogged down in
[00:55:42.260 --> 00:55:46.500]   excessive application, but rather, wow, you feel the force.
[00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:47.500]   That's relevant.
[00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:50.660]   Right now, in this situation, that's relevant.
[00:55:50.660 --> 00:55:55.020]   So those three things at least strike me and attract me, draw me in.
[00:55:55.020 --> 00:55:57.020]   I want to hear clarity.
[00:55:57.020 --> 00:55:59.380]   I want to see what's really in the text.
[00:55:59.380 --> 00:56:04.780]   I want it to be relevant to my life in this culture right now.
[00:56:04.780 --> 00:56:07.700]   And there's just plain earnestness.
[00:56:07.700 --> 00:56:09.380]   I think preaching that's not earnest.
[00:56:09.380 --> 00:56:12.300]   A lot of preachers are playful.
[00:56:12.300 --> 00:56:13.300]   They think playful.
[00:56:13.300 --> 00:56:18.300]   I mean, we all know one preacher who crashed and burned a while back, and he said, "The
[00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:21.220]   main model you should have are stand-up comedians."
[00:56:21.220 --> 00:56:22.220]   That's what he said.
[00:56:22.220 --> 00:56:24.300]   He said, "That should be the main model.
[00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:25.900]   You want to learn how to communicate?
[00:56:25.900 --> 00:56:27.220]   Watch stand-up comedians."
[00:56:27.220 --> 00:56:33.380]   And I thought, "You don't watch many comedians."
[00:56:33.380 --> 00:56:45.660]   I don't even have a television.
[00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:56.820]   No, I would say the same about John for the very same reason - clarity, the meaning of
[00:56:56.820 --> 00:57:01.960]   the text, and the doctoral implications.
[00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:06.300]   His preaching - I like to think of it this way - his application is one thing.
[00:57:06.300 --> 00:57:08.420]   Implication is something else.
[00:57:08.420 --> 00:57:13.960]   There may be a thousand applications, but there's usually just a few implications that
[00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:19.100]   just are so pervasive it changes how you approach life.
[00:57:19.100 --> 00:57:24.260]   And John is a genius at the implication of a given text without saying, "This is what
[00:57:24.260 --> 00:57:29.020]   you do on Tuesday afternoon when this happens, and this happens, and this happens."
[00:57:29.020 --> 00:57:35.340]   It's the power of that implication drawn because you know the text said it, and you understand
[00:57:35.340 --> 00:57:40.780]   the bigger picture of the theology that undergirds that specific revelation.
[00:57:40.780 --> 00:57:44.660]   And that - I just - I want to feel the implication.
[00:57:44.660 --> 00:57:50.820]   I want to feel the burden of that text, and I want the people to feel that burden.
[00:57:50.820 --> 00:57:56.380]   And I don't want to over-define it on a practical level lest I leave something out.
[00:57:56.380 --> 00:58:02.060]   AUSTIN: So what you just heard was not me trying to get them to compliment each other.
[00:58:02.060 --> 00:58:03.940]   I'm being serious.
[00:58:03.940 --> 00:58:08.200]   This is a good word for young preachers, and you've both poured your life into training
[00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:14.540]   men, and immature people are drawn to personality instead of truth.
[00:58:14.540 --> 00:58:18.380]   And so they're of Paul, they're of Cephas, they're of MacArthur, they're of Piper.
[00:58:18.380 --> 00:58:23.300]   And what that just was was a master class for young preachers to learn what they have
[00:58:23.300 --> 00:58:24.300]   to prioritize.
[00:58:24.300 --> 00:58:26.780]   And it's not style.
[00:58:26.780 --> 00:58:31.680]   It's substance and truth and a focus on the text.
[00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:35.960]   And that's what we're so grateful for, for you men and your impact in our lives because
[00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:38.500]   of that and the model of preaching that that is.
[00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:45.260]   JOHN: Just one caution.
[00:58:45.260 --> 00:58:52.380]   The fact that I love to hear that kind of preaching is owing to the fact that I'm born
[00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:58.660]   again and have a spiritual taste bud on my tongue.
[00:58:58.660 --> 00:59:02.300]   His preaching is going to alienate a lot of people.
[00:59:02.300 --> 00:59:03.840]   So is mine.
[00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:09.100]   Which means the fact that we like each other, and almost everybody in this room likes everybody,
[00:59:09.100 --> 00:59:10.100]   right?
[00:59:10.100 --> 00:59:13.980]   This is a nice group to be among.
[00:59:13.980 --> 00:59:20.040]   But you're going to have churches where you preach like he does or like I do, and they
[00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:26.460]   will not hear it because they don't, they're not attracted to, "Give me more Bible, I want
[00:59:26.460 --> 00:59:28.220]   to hear more Bible."
[00:59:28.220 --> 00:59:31.140]   That takes a spiritual mind.
[00:59:31.140 --> 00:59:35.240]   So that's why prayer, which H.P. reminded us of, is absolutely essential.
[00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:38.580]   We pray for our people to have ears to hear.
[00:59:38.580 --> 00:59:43.520]   LARSON: Final question.
[00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:47.780]   Our culture idolizes the young.
[00:59:47.780 --> 00:59:52.540]   The Bible reveres the aged.
[00:59:52.540 --> 00:59:58.880]   Old age in the Bible is a gift from God, it's a blessing, a tribute of divine favor, a cause
[00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:02.500]   for honor, respect, blessing.
[01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:12.500]   You both, if I could say it with all the force of what the Bible is saying, are old.
[01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:13.660]   And we love you.
[01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:21.240]   We love you old, and 78 and 84.
[01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:28.480]   And you are modeling for all of us, if the Lord gives us that many breaths, what it looks
[01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:31.820]   like to age in a way that honors Christ.
[01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:37.700]   So let's talk about that for just a few more moments here.
[01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:44.100]   Talk about aging as a believer and as a pastor.
[01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:51.220]   How do you think about growing old in your experience to honor Christ and serve His church?
[01:00:51.220 --> 01:01:00.640]   JOHN: Well, I don't know that I've created a sort of paradigm in which to think about
[01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:01.640]   myself.
[01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:05.680]   I just do what I do.
[01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:24.860]   Old age has its issues, like putting on your socks and getting a longer shoehorn every
[01:01:24.860 --> 01:01:25.860]   year.
[01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:26.860]   But I don't know that I even think about that.
[01:01:26.860 --> 01:01:28.860]   I'll tell you what I do think about is, "Lord, please keep me faithful."
[01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:35.220]   I just don't want...
[01:01:35.220 --> 01:01:48.260]   I don't want to say something somewhere or do something that would undo a lifetime of
[01:01:48.260 --> 01:01:49.260]   endeavoring to be faithful.
[01:01:49.260 --> 01:01:50.260]   No.
[01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:56.640]   I mean, that's, "Lord, just keep me faithful."
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:57.640]   And I think...
[01:01:57.640 --> 01:01:59.260]   I mean, I trust the Holy Spirit.
[01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:00.900]   I don't fear.
[01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:03.700]   I'm not afraid to live my life.
[01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:05.420]   I trust the Spirit of God.
[01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:06.420]   I love the Lord.
[01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:11.860]   I love His Word, but I'm not invincible.
[01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:17.100]   And the second thing is, "Lord, don't let some people say things about me that aren't
[01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:24.460]   true that are destructive," because I don't ever want to be in a position to have to defend
[01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:31.060]   myself, because that's so impossible.
[01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:40.180]   So yeah, I just pray that the Lord would take heed to myself and my doctrine and stay faithful,
[01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:48.940]   and Lord, protect me from my enemies who could undo so much if they were believed when they
[01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:51.340]   said things that weren't true.
[01:02:51.340 --> 01:03:02.940]   Oh my goodness, so many things to say.
[01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:06.260]   That prayer, "Hold me.
[01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:08.380]   He will hold me fast.
[01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:10.540]   He will hold me fast.
[01:03:10.540 --> 01:03:12.880]   For my Savior loves me so.
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:14.440]   He will hold me fast.
[01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:16.740]   No hope without it."
[01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:23.580]   Because if you think sanctification is progressive in the sense that there's no battle after
[01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:31.940]   age 70 of walking with Jesus, you're not thinking straight.
[01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:45.140]   The danger of the sins of lust at age 78, sloth, doubt.
[01:03:45.140 --> 01:03:47.540]   When Paul said, "I have fought the good fight.
[01:03:47.540 --> 01:03:56.220]   I have finished the course," he meant to the end, right, till they cut my throat, because
[01:03:56.220 --> 01:04:04.100]   on the way to the gallows, I could betray Him.
[01:04:04.100 --> 01:04:12.060]   My view of eternal security, which is a Romans 8:30 kind, is it's a community project and
[01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:14.180]   is to be fought for.
[01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:15.380]   That's the way God keeps you.
[01:04:15.380 --> 01:04:16.860]   He keeps you.
[01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:23.620]   So I just fully expect that as long as I have a brain, it has to be engaged in, "Keep me.
[01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:24.980]   Keep me.
[01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:28.900]   Don't let me do anything stupid to undermine the ministry.
[01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:31.640]   Don't let me betray my wife.
[01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:33.620]   Don't let me give up on prayer.
[01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:36.500]   Don't let me become superficial.
[01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:40.660]   Don't let me cave in to just watching videos every night.
[01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:46.460]   Oh, God, protect me from the world and the worldliness that can creep into a 78-year-old
[01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:48.900]   heart."
[01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:52.460]   So that's the battle piece that I just...
[01:04:52.460 --> 01:04:57.940]   I mean, I used to think, I don't know if you thought this way, that since sanctification
[01:04:57.940 --> 01:05:07.500]   is progressive, that my 30-year-old patience would be 40 years old more patient, 40 years
[01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:08.500]   more patient.
[01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:13.500]   It didn't work.
[01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:18.820]   I mean, that might be just absolutely self-indicting for me to say that because of progressive
[01:05:18.820 --> 01:05:19.820]   sanctification.
[01:05:19.820 --> 01:05:27.180]   You ought to be a 78-year-old more holy person than at 38, and it doesn't feel quite like
[01:05:27.180 --> 01:05:28.180]   that.
[01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:32.700]   Like I'm in a battled soul every day.
[01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:37.980]   These arrows just keep flying, and you've got to be, you know, the shield of faith every
[01:05:37.980 --> 01:05:40.980]   day, sword of the Spirit every day.
[01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:46.360]   So just, if you think you're going to coast someday, you're going to be destroyed because
[01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:48.980]   there's no coasting in this life.
[01:05:48.980 --> 01:05:59.940]   Now, just to put a more positive spin on it, or reality to it, first of all, a caution.
[01:05:59.940 --> 01:06:05.980]   I know that we are going to get to the point where we can't preach.
[01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:09.500]   I mean, whether we could die, right, before we get there.
[01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:11.020]   But that's up to God.
[01:06:11.020 --> 01:06:18.180]   We don't believe in mercy killing, no matter what California or Oregon or Minnesota says.
[01:06:18.180 --> 01:06:19.180]   We don't believe in that.
[01:06:19.180 --> 01:06:25.700]   So God will decide if we have to sit in a nursing home and not have all our faculties.
[01:06:25.700 --> 01:06:28.860]   That's going to come if we don't die.
[01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:33.380]   And the question is then, will we be able to be faithful?
[01:06:33.380 --> 01:06:38.380]   So don't hear this as a kind of triumphalistic, "Yeah, strong old people."
[01:06:38.380 --> 01:06:48.340]   However, I sat under the ministry of Oswald Sanders at age 89.
[01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:49.340]   He was 89.
[01:06:49.340 --> 01:06:51.180]   I was 50-something.
[01:06:51.180 --> 01:06:56.140]   And he said, "I've written a book a year since I was 70."
[01:06:56.140 --> 01:07:01.480]   And I just went, "Yes, oh, that's what I want to be like."
[01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:06.540]   Now my new model is Thomas Sowell, who's 93, right?
[01:07:06.540 --> 01:07:12.100]   And when he turned 90, the interviewer asked him, "How is it that you've written a book
[01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:15.940]   every 18 months since you were 80?"
[01:07:15.940 --> 01:07:17.440]   So I said, "Great.
[01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:18.660]   Life begins at 80.
[01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:25.060]   I got two years to run up to it, and then we take off."
[01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:35.020]   So the way that balances out with the fight is, don't view aging as so embattled and so
[01:07:35.020 --> 01:07:40.660]   beleaguered and so, you know, your body's giving away your eyes, "I've got hearing aids
[01:07:40.660 --> 01:07:41.660]   on here."
[01:07:41.660 --> 01:07:47.020]   I mean, just everything, this outer nature is wasting away.
[01:07:47.020 --> 01:07:50.380]   Believe that while you have life, you have ministry.
[01:07:50.380 --> 01:07:54.180]   I hate the American view of retirement.
[01:07:54.180 --> 01:07:56.060]   I think it's totally unbiblical.
[01:07:56.060 --> 01:07:58.620]   I think it destroys souls.
[01:07:58.620 --> 01:08:05.980]   Ralph Winter used to say, "Men in America don't die of old age, they die of retirement,"
[01:08:05.980 --> 01:08:09.300]   meaning they lose heart, they lose meaning.
[01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:14.700]   So pastors, you don't have to do like he does and stay in the pastorate forever.
[01:08:14.700 --> 01:08:19.620]   You don't have to do that.
[01:08:19.620 --> 01:08:20.980]   That's a good thing.
[01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:21.980]   That's a good thing.
[01:08:21.980 --> 01:08:25.940]   I stopped at age 67, not sure I should have.
[01:08:25.940 --> 01:08:30.060]   I don't have total confidence about that, but I've tried to be useful, right?
[01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:33.620]   Tried to be useful from 67 to 78.
[01:08:33.620 --> 01:08:42.540]   So all that to say, be sober-minded about the battle and be hopeful and optimistic and
[01:08:42.540 --> 01:08:58.460]   energetic about what God might call you to do between 65 and 85.
[01:08:58.460 --> 01:09:03.900]   This Q&A was not brought to you by the AARP.
[01:09:03.900 --> 01:09:10.660]   I have never responded to one of those 10,000 envelopes, never.
[01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:13.380]   Never have I.
[01:09:13.380 --> 01:09:20.580]   We know that, yeah, we're well aware.
[01:09:20.580 --> 01:09:28.740]   So grateful for God's faithfulness on display in both of your lives and this was a very
[01:09:28.740 --> 01:09:29.740]   fruitful, profitable hour.
[01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:30.740]   Thank you so much, brother.
[01:09:30.740 --> 01:09:59.820]   You can sit down, calm down.
[01:09:59.820 --> 01:10:00.820]   Dr.
[01:10:00.820 --> 01:10:05.980]   MacArthur, will you pray for these men and that God would be faithful in their ministries
[01:10:05.980 --> 01:10:06.980]   and lives?
[01:10:06.980 --> 01:10:07.980]   Sure.
[01:10:07.980 --> 01:10:12.020]   Tom, I'll have you come up and give some announcements.
[01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:21.860]   Father, this has been such a refreshing hour together and in so many ways our hearts have
[01:10:21.860 --> 01:10:33.980]   been warmed and even thrilled to feel the impulse of every heart beating in this room
[01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:44.940]   about ministry, preaching, so that they can embrace every thought, every answer that we
[01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:55.660]   tried to offer and just it felt like we were giving water to their souls and strengthening
[01:10:55.660 --> 01:11:01.420]   them and that's the way it came across, just their exuberant response.
[01:11:01.420 --> 01:11:12.460]   So Lord, we ask that this might be used to raise this generation of pastors, these men
[01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:19.980]   who are right here, to a level of faithfulness and an endurance that will glorify and honor
[01:11:19.980 --> 01:11:20.980]   Your name.
[01:11:20.980 --> 01:11:32.180]   We don't want this to have just been a moment's experience, as enjoyable as it was, but an
[01:11:32.180 --> 01:11:43.180]   experience that bears lasting power so that we'll see a difference in the future.
[01:11:43.180 --> 01:11:50.700]   So many defectors, so many people who are superficial and shallow in their approach
[01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:53.100]   to ministry, and we need none of that.
[01:11:53.100 --> 01:12:00.220]   We need the best and the most dedicated and the most devout and the most faithful and
[01:12:00.220 --> 01:12:02.420]   most powerful.
[01:12:02.420 --> 01:12:10.900]   So use this, Lord, by Your Spirit in the life of everyone who's here to make a difference,
[01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:20.420]   a notable, significant difference in the next decade and even beyond in the church.
[01:12:20.420 --> 01:12:23.060]   For Your glory we pray in Christ's name, amen.
[01:12:23.060 --> 01:12:24.060]   Amen.
[01:12:24.060 --> 01:12:25.060]   Amen.
[01:12:25.060 --> 01:12:25.060]   Amen.
[01:12:25.060 --> 01:12:26.060]   Amen.
[01:12:26.060 --> 01:12:26.060]   Amen.
[01:12:26.060 --> 01:12:31.060]   Amen.
[01:12:31.060 --> 01:12:33.120]   you
