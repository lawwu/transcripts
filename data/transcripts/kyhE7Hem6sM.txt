[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.500]   The sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will they be able to sit
[00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:17.360]   down together at the table of brotherhood. I have a dream that one day even the state
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:26.920]   of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:33.760]   of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice. I have a dream
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:44.400]   that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:52.840]   by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. I have a dream today.
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:59.840]   I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:06.840]   not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. I have
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.840]   a dream today. I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:20.840]   where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:27.840]   character. I have a dream today. I have a dream that my four little children will one
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.840]   day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.840]   content of their character. I have a dream today. I have a dream that my four little
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.840]   children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:53.840]   skin but by the content of their character. I have a dream today. I have a dream that
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.840]   my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.840]   by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. I have a dream today.
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.840]   I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:19.840]   not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. I have
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:26.840]   a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:33.840]   be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. I have a dream
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.840]   that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.840]   by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:51.840]   I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:58.840]   not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. I have
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:05.840]   a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:12.840]   be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:19.840]   I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:26.840]   not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:33.840]   I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:40.840]   not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:47.840]   I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.840]   not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:00.840]   I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:07.840]   not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:14.840]   I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:21.840]   not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:28.840]   I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.840]   not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:40.840]   I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:46.840]   not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:53.840]   I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.840]   not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:05.840]   I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:11.840]   not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:18.840]   I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.840]   not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:30.840]   I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.840]   not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:42.840]   I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.840]   not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.840]   If it had not been for my work, his would have been much more difficult.
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.840]   We demanded integration almost from the beginning of our meetings in the South.
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.840]   I think that laid a groundwork.
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:07.840]   Now, today, it's almost impossible for present—this is still Graham talking—almost impossible
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:14.840]   for the present generation to imagine what it took to be that way and how many threatening
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:21.840]   letters we got and how many threats against my family as a result of the stand we took
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.840]   at that time to demand the Crusades be integrated.
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:31.840]   And one biographer wrote, "He held Crusades in Little Rock in 1859 and in Birmingham,
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.840]   Alabama in 1964, not long after the racial tensions erupted there.
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:42.840]   And Howard Jones recalls King telling Graham, 'Your Crusades have done more to help race
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.840]   relations than anything else I know.'"
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:51.840]   Now, here are a couple observations that I would draw out as perhaps implications for
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.840]   our situation.
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:07:01.840]   Two things accompanied Graham's simple, straightforward, powerful, decisive, confrontive gospel message
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.840]   about sin, salvation, and faith.
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:13.840]   One was that he absolutely refused to hold a crusade that was not integrated.
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.840]   This he did across the South.
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.840]   This was simply unheard of in those days.
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:26.840]   The church I grew up in at that time—this is 1960, '61, '62—didn't even allow
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:30.840]   blacks in the services to our great shame.
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.840]   So that's the first thing.
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:41.840]   He took a decisive stand on a particularly pressing indignity, and that accompanied his
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.840]   simple gospel preaching.
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:53.840]   The second thing that accompanied this simple gospel message was that punctuating his message
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:08:01.840]   time after time, regularly, in this explosive season—and you can find him online and see
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:07.840]   more than once how he says the almost identical words, eyeball to eyeball, looking into the
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:10.840]   camera, "Jesus was not a white man."
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.840]   And this is a direct quote from a YouTube clip, okay?
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.840]   "Jesus was not a white man.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:16.840]   He was not a black man.
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:21.840]   He came from that part of the world that touches Africa and Asia and Europe.
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.840]   Christianity is not a white man's religion.
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.840]   It's not a black man's religion.
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:31.840]   Let nobody, never let anybody tell you that it's white or black.
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.840]   Christ belongs to all people.
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:37.840]   He belongs to the whole world."
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:43.840]   Now, that note he struck, just very briefly—it took him a minute, say, to say that, or two
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:49.840]   minutes if he expanded it—he struck that note in the midst of his simple gospel message
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:59.840]   again and again into a very explosive situation, because that message is part of the New Testament
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.840]   global relevance of Jesus for all the peoples.
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:07.840]   That's not an extraneous thing tacked on to the gospel, if you read the New Testament,
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:13.840]   and its global definition of Christ's purpose in the cross.
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:19.840]   In the context of the 1950s, that message, combined with the integration of his crusades,
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.840]   could get his family killed.
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:27.840]   He said in an interview with Harvey, "I don't think of myself any longer as an American
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.840]   citizen," and he added, quietly, "only."
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:31.840]   That's good.
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:32.840]   That's true.
[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:35.840]   "I think of myself as a world citizen.
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:40.840]   I've traveled all over the world a great deal, and I feel that I am part of a great
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:47.840]   mosaic of the human race that God has created, each made in his image, each needing the gospel
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:53.840]   of Christ, each having the same basic problems and desires and longings, and I'm part of
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:54.840]   this mosaic."
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:10:00.840]   Now, I'm assuming, Tony, that virtually everybody who listens to APJ—I'm sure there are exceptions,
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:08.840]   but most people who listen to Pastor John love the gospel of Jesus Christ, love Christ-exalting
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:16.840]   ethnic diversity in the body of Christ, love true justice in all of society, love God's
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:22.840]   grace that goes beyond justice, love the truth of God's Word, love the power of the Holy
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:28.840]   Spirit that conquers sin in our lives, and loves the global glory of Jesus Christ.
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:35.840]   And it's that last note that I want to trumpet on this Martin Luther King Day.
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:42.840]   The global glory—you could call it the pan-ethnic glory of Jesus.
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:50.840]   The note that both MLK—most people don't realize how international MLK's vision was—and
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:52.840]   Billy Graham, they both struck this.
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:57.840]   Jesus does not belong to America but to the world.
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:02.840]   Therefore, to belong to Jesus is also to belong to the world.
[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:10.840]   The more Billy Graham walked with Jesus among the peoples of the world, the less distinctly
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:19.840]   American he felt, the less decisively defined he was by his nation and his ethnicity or
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:30.840]   his race—a spirit of confined, narrow, limited parochialism that has no glad heart, no biblical
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:38.840]   heart for the thousands of peoples of the world is going to be missing one of the great
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:44.840]   healing impulses for ethnic challenges in our day here in America or wherever you live
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:46.840]   around the world.
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:55.840]   Let's let Martin Luther King Day give us an impulse for what Billy Graham called "the
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:59.840]   great mosaic of the human race."
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:05.840]   It will make a great difference in our lives and in our ministries.
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:06.840]   Amen.
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:08.840]   Wonderful reflection on two lives.
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:09.840]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:14.840]   Here's that clip from Billy Graham's sermon in Chicago in 1971.
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:15.840]   We'll close with it.
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:16.840]   Here he is.
[00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:24.840]   Anyone that can see Jesus on that cross and not be touched has a heart of stone.
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:31.840]   They first took off his clothes, then they took long leather thongs with steel pellets
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:39.840]   or lead pellets on the end and beat him across the back until he could hardly stand up.
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:44.840]   Then they put a crown of thorns on his brow and his face was bleeding.
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:49.840]   And they laughed at him and they spit on him and they mocked him.
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:55.840]   And with one snap of his finger, 72,000 angels had already drawn their swords ready to come
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:13:00.840]   to his rescue and wipe this planet out of existence in the universe.
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:05.840]   And Jesus said, "No, to this end was I born."
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:09.840]   And he dragged and lifted and hauled that cross.
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:13.840]   And don't you black people ever forget one thing.
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:20.840]   The man that helped Jesus carry that cross was a black man.
[00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:22.840]   And don't ever forget another thing.
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:31.840]   Jesus belongs to Africa as much as he does to Europe and Asia.
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:36.840]   He was born in that part of the world that touches Africa and Asia and Europe.
[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:41.840]   And Jesus was not a white man like me.
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:44.840]   Nor was he as black as some of you.
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:49.840]   We don't know what the color of his skin, but it must have been a dark color like the people of his day
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:52.840]   because he was a man like them.
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:57.840]   Don't ever say it's a white man's religion or a black man's religion.
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.840]   It's a world religion.
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:05.840]   He belongs to the world.
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.840]   Powerful. That is a powerful clip.
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:09.840]   We will see you on Wednesday. I'm Tony Reinke.
