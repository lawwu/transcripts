[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.760]   When we read the Bible, what are we doing? Or what is it doing to us? To explain, we
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.080]   are once again joined by author and pastor Ray Ortlund, who serves as the
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.280]   senior pastor of Emanuel Church in Nashville, Tennessee. Ray, explain this to
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:27.720]   us. What are we doing when we read the Bible? Mm-hmm. Yeah, what's striking to me
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.680]   about the Bible is just that it exists at all as a book, as this--I'm holding
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.680]   mine in my hand right now--it's this thing external to me, external to my
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.840]   own thoughts and feelings. That is significant. By being external, by being a
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.800]   book outside my head, the Bible provides a unifying rallying point for all
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.240]   Christians, so that we can gather around the Lord Himself in worship, in community,
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.640]   in mission. If all we had to go by was our own thoughts and feelings, our own
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.040]   intuitions and leadings, we would fragment. If we think we have a lot of
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.440]   disagreements now with the Bible, imagine what would happen, how we would explode
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.680]   apart if all we had was our own personal subjectivity to define the gospel. So the
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:21.440]   exteriority of the book pulls us out of ourselves and into something we can all
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:27.040]   share together. So I think of the Bible as the scepter of the King among His
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:33.240]   subjects. It's the practical mechanism by which the will of the King exerts
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.280]   influence among us, pulling us together. It makes the Lordship of Christ a
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.160]   practical reality among us. I mean, think of all the times the prophets
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.360]   cried out, "Hear the word of the Lord." Now that is basically what the Christian
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.000]   life boils down to, listening together. If we're at home alone, we're just
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.360]   sitting there reading and receiving. Or if we're at church, we're sitting there
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.120]   hearing the Bible preached. And what happens? God Himself enters into that
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:09.120]   experience. He blesses us, speaks to us, comforts us, corrects us, motivates us
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:14.520]   through His Word. The Word of God and the power of God always go together.
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.080]   1 Thessalonians chapter 1 says, "Our gospel came to you not only in word, but also
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.320]   in power and in the Holy Spirit and with full conviction." What else can do that
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.740]   for us? What we're doing when we read the Bible is we're opening up,
[00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:33.960]   getting out of ourselves, opening up to the power of God, and getting into God's
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:40.920]   thoughts about God and about everything. And that's when we can come together.
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.240]   Yeah, so the posture of humbling ourselves under Scripture is really
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.500]   essential. Oh my, yes. We're going to humble ourselves under something. If not
[00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.880]   the Bible, why something else? How is that alternative qualified? Did that
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.760]   alternative reveal to us the dying love of Jesus for the undeserving? Let's be
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.560]   careful what we listen to. Yeah, excellent. Well said. Thank you, Ray. And tomorrow I
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.320]   want to ask you, in the midst of all the perplexing anxieties and uncertainties
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:18.240]   of life, what are the keys to regaining and maintaining our joy in Christ? This
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.840]   has been our friend, pastor and author Ray Ortlunds. I'm your host Tony Rehnke.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.600]   We'll see you tomorrow.
