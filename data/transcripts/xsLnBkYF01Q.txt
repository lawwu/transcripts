[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   adversity shapes you as a person and i think for me the back injuries were that basketball came so
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   easy to me like i ended up being the number one player in the world for my age when i committed
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   to mizzou like the whole attendance of the college went up like a lot just from me committing so i
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.760]   was getting ready to go in there and put on a show and it was going to be lit that's when my first
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.160]   back injury happened and i think going from here to then just like crashing and everybody saying
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.600]   all types of things about me and because of that it shaped me into the person i've been now i look
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.600]   back at those back injuries and i'm able to have some appreciation for them they still suck
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.120]   like i'm still sad that that happened to me but i can look at them with some appreciation
