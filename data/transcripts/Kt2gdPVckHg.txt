[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.600]   - Welcome back to Portfolio Rescue, our show where we take questions straight from you,
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.600]   the viewer.
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.040]   Remember, if you have a question for us, askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.600]   This week we had Barry Ritholtz on the show, the namesake of our firm, and Barry had a
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.400]   lot of interesting things to say about writing and producing content and blogging, and he's
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.800]   been doing this for a couple decades now.
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.080]   And I mentioned with Barry that I answer questions, when I started my blog, my whole reason for
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.400]   doing it was answering questions for friends and family, 'cause I was sick of them asking
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.920]   me, 'cause I was the finance investment guy.
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.440]   And I typically get two questions from my high school friends especially, high school
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.600]   and college friends, on text messages.
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.960]   One is like, "Should I buy or sell this stock?
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:57.960]   What should I do with this here?
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:58.960]   Is this a good buy?
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:59.960]   Is this a good sell?"
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:00.960]   And two, "Is this gonna get worse?"
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.120]   So I hear from people way more when things are getting worse, and things right now are
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.120]   getting worse.
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.640]   So I have a question, I think our first one we're gonna do today is actually from someone
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.000]   who texted me this week, one of my friends, and so we're gonna use that, but what do we
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   got here, Duncan?
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   - All right, cool.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.080]   So before we get started, I just wanna say for those who haven't watched, you have to
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.000]   watch the latest Animal Spirits, it's episode 247.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.680]   There's a clip in there of Ben scoring a touchdown at, what was the stadium?
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.000]   - The Silverdome in Detroit, Michigan, which is not there anymore.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.320]   I think it's been torn down, but that was the old stadium before they had it.
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.680]   So my glory days, I played there a couple times for the state championship.
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.560]   - That was like '98, '99, right?
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.560]   - Yeah.
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.400]   - Okay, so everyone needs to watch that, but first I had a football question for you, which
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.880]   is I've always wondered, I see you evading tackles in that long run, would you rather
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.800]   see someone coming to tackle you, or not know that they're coming?
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.160]   - I'll definitely see them.
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.160]   - Okay.
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.880]   Well, the reason I ask is because of the car crash thing.
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.920]   People say like, "Oh, if you tense up, that's when it hurts the most, and you get injured
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:00.920]   the most."
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.960]   So I didn't know if it's preferable to just be tackled and not know that they're coming.
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:04.960]   - Okay, yeah.
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.520]   I think preparing for one, it's kind of now unlike the stock market, right?
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.880]   You'd rather be prepared for a downturn than get hit from the side, right?
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:11.880]   - Okay, cool, cool.
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.280]   I ran cross country, so we don't tackle, but yeah.
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.520]   Okay, so first up, today we have a short and sweet one.
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.920]   Inflation was already out of control, now the war has made gas prices spike.
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.960]   How does this not end in recession?
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.740]   - Yeah, I think this is a question a lot of people are asking these days, and unfortunately,
[00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.360]   the odds of a recession are much higher now than they were, call it, two, two and a half
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.360]   weeks ago.
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.880]   I think you'd have to be pretty dense to not at least think that.
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.720]   It's obviously impossible to predict these things with 100% certainty, but I would almost
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.480]   be surprised if we didn't have some sort of minor economic contraction because of this.
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.000]   And it's not just the U.S., right?
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.840]   This thing will probably be global, and I'm guessing the U.S. will probably fare the best
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:51.840]   out of most developed nations.
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.120]   So, John, throw up this chart of electricity and natural gas.
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.860]   This is from Michael Sembles at J.P. Morgan, and he compares electricity prices and natural
[00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.920]   gas prices between some countries in Europe and then the U.S.
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.960]   And you can see the spike in Europe is just massive.
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.240]   And they're far more dependent on Russia for some of their commodities, and their prices
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.920]   there were much higher to begin with.
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:12.920]   It's funny.
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.800]   We're complaining about $4 gas here in the U.S., but in Europe, people have been paying
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.320]   well over that price for a long time now.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.960]   They already have a lot more, and they do it in liters, so I can't do the actual conversion
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:25.960]   in my head.
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.060]   But let's just say it's higher.
[00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.520]   It is important to note that inflation doesn't always cause a recession, but every inflationary
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.760]   spike in history has only been alleviated by a recession, right?
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.600]   So what happens to get that inflation back down?
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.040]   Unfortunately, every time, it's a recession.
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.920]   So let's look at this next chart, John, of inflationary spikes.
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.960]   So I looked at every inflationary spike of 5% or more going back to 1940, and you can
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.960]   see the gray bars on this chart show when a recession happened.
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.600]   The little red circles I did there was every time inflation spiked above 5%.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.240]   It's not a perfect relationship in the sense that you can gauge the timing on these things.
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.040]   Sometimes inflation fell, then we went into a recession.
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.920]   Sometimes a recession occurred during that spike in inflation, and then sometimes that
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.480]   inflationary spike probably didn't have anything to do with it, like, say, the 2008 crisis.
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.920]   That's the last time we had oil this high.
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.760]   That was probably going to happen anyway.
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.900]   But the only way inflation came down in any of these instances was because a recession
[00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.560]   came afterwards or a recession happened because of it.
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.880]   So I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but this is kind of where we're at.
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.440]   So if we pull up this next table, John, this just shows that the pre-inflation or the pre-recession
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.800]   inflationary spike, again, go back to the '40s and then what happened afterwards.
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.000]   We just had our inflation print this morning of 7.9%.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.640]   That happened before all this stuff with Ukraine and Russia happened, before energy prices
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.520]   spiked, before agricultural commodities prices spiked.
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.920]   Again, it's hard to see getting out of this situation where we could, in the coming months,
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:02.640]   in this year especially, probably see 8, 9, I wouldn't be shocked if we saw 10% inflation
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.400]   print this year, which is really going to freak people out, I think.
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:12.920]   And so, unfortunately, I think that a recession is really on the table and it's probably much
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.960]   higher than 50/50 odds of happening right now.
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.840]   Again, I'd be surprised if it didn't happen.
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.080]   Now, what does this mean for the stock market?
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.360]   I mean, we could actually bottom before it happens because it seems like the scenario
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.200]   where we kind of can see it coming now, kind of not quite the same parallel as what we
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.760]   saw in the corona crash where everyone knew the day it happened.
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:36.120]   Like Tom Hanks got COVID, NBA shut down, we're going into recession the next day.
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.000]   And so the stock market, it's kind of who knows how hairy and volatile it gets.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.440]   I guess a lot of that depends on how long the war lasts and how long this commodity
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.440]   spike lasts.
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.440]   Now, of course, recessions are not great because people lose their jobs.
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:53.080]   One of the interesting factors going on right now is there are 11.3 million job openings
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.080]   in the US.
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.080]   That's the highest number ever.
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.600]   The highest number this ever, the highest this number ever was pre-pandemic was 7.5
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.600]   million.
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:01.720]   So there's more jobs than ever.
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.520]   So you think a recession happens, people lose their jobs.
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.680]   And obviously, this kind of stat can change overnight if there's a slowdown.
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.200]   But consumers have repaired their balance sheets for years.
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.680]   We've paid down credit card debt, increased savings rates, home equity is through the
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.240]   roof for people who own a home.
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.440]   So if we do have a slowdown, I would expect it to be minor, depending on how all this
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.440]   shakes out.
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.440]   But I think the odds of a recession are so much higher now than they were even a month
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:25.440]   ago.
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.080]   And it's probably going to happen, with the caveat that I cannot predict the future.
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.680]   Yeah, it's crazy how fast things shifted, you know.
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.760]   I mean, it was like the war on top of everything that was already going on.
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:36.760]   It just accelerated.
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.240]   It's like unimaginable from a year ago.
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.360]   The butterfly flapping its wings.
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.200]   I mean, this is kind of one man decided to do this, and the whole world has essentially
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.200]   changed.
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.200]   And yeah, I think we could see a slowdown.
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:50.340]   Again, I think it's probably worse in Europe, unfortunately, than it will be here.
[00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.880]   So yeah, kind of a downer.
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.400]   But I think a recession is probably coming at some point.
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.980]   Yeah, it seems like that's what people are expecting, too, right, based on the moves
[00:06:58.980 --> 00:06:59.980]   that we're seeing.
[00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:02.980]   All right, let's do the next one.
[00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:09.320]   Okay, so up next we have, "I feel like the wealthiest 10% of investors have taken profits
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.360]   during this year's massive selloff.
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.360]   Where is this money going?
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:16.920]   Bonds, cash, or just back into Apple, Microsoft, and Google?"
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:21.800]   So the reasonable assumption here is that it must be the wealthy selling stocks, because
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.600]   the top 10% own something like 90% of stocks, right?
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.600]   So it has to be the wealthy.
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.560]   I'm not so sure of this.
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:32.320]   It's also kind of hard to gauge these questions, because it hurts your brain to think about
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.320]   it.
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.800]   Like, what happens to the money in a selloff?
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.280]   Is it just because people are selling?
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:40.880]   And if you think about it, for every buyer there is a seller, and for every seller there
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:42.040]   has to be a buyer.
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:47.400]   So there can be new shares issued if a company goes public, if there's a SPAC, so you have
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.720]   an IPO, you have companies issue stock options.
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:55.120]   But money essentially disappears during a selloff, right?
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:58.240]   Just like it kind of magically appears during a bull market.
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:02.960]   So I'll put this chart about the tech rec from the FT on here.
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.800]   So this is from the FT this morning, actually.
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:08.580]   They said $5 trillion in marketable capitalization was shaved off the NASDAQ, and this is pretty
[00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:10.360]   much in the past year or so.
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:15.680]   If we look at two examples, the next chart of PayPal and Facebook, I refuse to call it
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:16.680]   meta still.
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:21.160]   And Duncan, I'm angry, because if I go on YCharts and I type in "Facebook," it doesn't
[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.160]   come up anymore.
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.160]   I have to type in "meta."
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.160]   And I refuse to call it meta.
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.160]   You have to acknowledge it.
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.480]   Yes, I have to acknowledge it.
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:32.480]   So Facebook went from a high of $1.1 trillion to a little over $500 billion now.
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:35.320]   So that's, you know, half a trillion dollars gone.
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:40.400]   PayPal is even crazier, I think, from a relative perspective -- $362 billion at the top.
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.520]   And again, these numbers are from, like, last February, so not that long ago, to a little
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:44.980]   over $100 billion now.
[00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:47.020]   Just that it's gone.
[00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:52.520]   And so that money is just -- it's essentially evaporated, which is kind of what happened.
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:54.180]   So it doesn't take that much selling.
[00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:57.720]   All it is is sort of a supply-demand thing, where people were willing to pay up, and you
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.920]   have a gap up in prices, and now the gap is going down.
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.320]   And so that money is just going away.
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.920]   So we look at the flows.
[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:05.800]   Surprisingly, in January, it was still pretty strong.
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:06.960]   So this is from Ed Yardeni.
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.280]   This is the equity mutual funds and ETF flows.
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.280]   It was still pretty positive.
[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:14.720]   It would be interesting to see if this trails off a little in February, and especially in
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:15.720]   March.
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:16.720]   And then we look at the bond flows.
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.320]   Bonds are actually coming down a little bit in January.
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.880]   But the money is still pouring in.
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:24.660]   Now, of course, you have all these different competing investors.
[00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:28.860]   You have index funds and equity-managed funds and institutions and corporate executives
[00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:30.340]   and individual shareholders and hedge funds.
[00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:33.500]   So you have all these millions of investors who have different opinions and time horizons
[00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:36.620]   and goals and risk profiles and reasons for selling.
[00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:40.100]   So it's always kind of hard to know who's doing the selling and why and what the reason
[00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:41.780]   is and who's freaking out.
[00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:46.540]   I do want to get back to the 10% comment, because it seems to make sense, again, the
[00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:47.980]   top 10% sell.
[00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:52.480]   But William Bernstein had this piece at the beginning of the pandemic, and he used this
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:56.400]   quote from J.P. Morgan that said, "In bear markets, stocks return to their rightful owners."
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:00.960]   And a lot of people have taken that quote from way back in the early 1900s to be like,
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:04.540]   "Okay, in bear markets, the people who are patient and disciplined and willing to put
[00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:06.860]   money in, those are the ones who are going to make out okay."
[00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:08.560]   But Bernstein said, "Yeah, that's great.
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.760]   But guess who has the money in a downturn?
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:11.760]   Rich people."
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:16.560]   And so bear markets actually make wealth inequality worse, because rich people have the financial
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:21.240]   means to buy financial assets when they're at depressed prices.
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:24.840]   And so a lot of people were shaking their fists at the sky and saying, "Oh, the rich
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.000]   people are getting richer during the pandemic."
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.800]   That's probably going to happen in every bear market in the future as wealth inequality
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:33.280]   continues to have a separate, you know, between the haves and the have-nots.
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:38.060]   So unfortunately, downturns level the playing field for a little bit in the short run as
[00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:41.360]   those holders of financial assets see their prices fall.
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:43.560]   But they're also buying when they're falling.
[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.980]   And so over the long run, that's a positive for rich people.
[00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:50.000]   And unfortunately, it probably makes wealth inequality even worse.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.800]   I know this is, we're kind of on a downer here, Duncan, for the first two recessions.
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:56.840]   I'm feeling a little depressed now.
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:59.560]   But I think that's how it probably plays out.
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:02.200]   It'd be nice to think, like, all the wealthy people are selling and they're panicking.
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.160]   But that's probably not the case, because they have the financial means to actually
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:05.160]   hold on.
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:06.160]   Yeah, right.
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.160]   Yeah, they don't have to.
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:08.160]   Yeah.
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.160]   Yeah.
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:10.160]   Yeah.
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.160]   Okay, let's see if we can get cheered up with the next question.
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:13.160]   Let's do it.
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:14.160]   Okay.
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.760]   Do you think it's a good idea to use an S-block or a down payment on your house if you don't
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:18.760]   want to sell any stock?
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:21.800]   Can you first explain what an S-block is for newboyals like me?
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:22.800]   Yes.
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.120]   I just have to do the acronyms for you.
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.960]   We're gonna have to do like a sheet of all the acronyms for Duncan.
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.220]   So S-block is securities-based line of credit.
[00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:34.280]   So that's like borrowing against your portfolio, taking it, you can use that as collateral,
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:38.320]   borrow against it, pay a low level of interest, and then use that money for something else.
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:42.280]   So this is really more of a financial planning question than it is an investment question,
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:43.280]   I think.
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:47.600]   So let's bring a certified financial planner on here from our firm, Kevin Young, who's
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:48.600]   in the office with Duncan.
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:52.520]   He's in an undisclosed location because they can't be next to each other.
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:55.080]   So Kevin, when thinking through something like this, and this is a question we've been
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:12:00.160]   getting a lot actually, like, can I, I don't want to take taxes into account and have to
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:04.680]   sell something and pay taxes on it, but I have this big outlay coming up.
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:07.080]   When you, when you have to think through something like this from a financial planning perspective,
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:11.640]   like, what are the main areas of concern or what are like, what are some of the variables
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.680]   people think about when taking a loan against their portfolio?
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:15.680]   Yeah.
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:21.080]   So, you know, these lines of credit have become really popular the last couple of years.
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:27.760]   And I think partially people are seeing what's going on with the ultra wealthy.
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:31.280]   And there was an article in the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, maybe a year, 18
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:35.800]   months ago, talking about, well, how did these people that have so much money pay zero tax,
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:39.160]   but they're still managing to pull money out of their portfolios?
[00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.060]   S blocks are high.
[00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:46.800]   And the reason you might use one is if you're sitting on some large appreciated portfolio,
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:53.200]   the idea is you take the line of credit at call it 3% and use the money for a down payment,
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:59.140]   as opposed to selling out of the stocks that you own and getting yourself hit with a capital
[00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:04.200]   gains tax somewhere between, you know, 18 to could be as high as 30% with state and
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.420]   federal depending on where you live.
[00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:09.360]   So that's ultimately why you might do it.
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:13.920]   I think it can make a lot of sense in the right scenario.
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:17.360]   You just got to be very careful about how you use the leverage.
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.480]   This seems to me like it would be a decent scenario for this.
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:20.940]   So you want to have a down payment on the house.
[00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:23.080]   You don't want to have to get out of your investments to do it.
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.620]   You're borrowing against your portfolio.
[00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:26.400]   You're paying probably a low interest rate.
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:27.400]   Does this kind of thing make sense?
[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:33.560]   And like, does the reason for the loan, obviously, if you're leveraging up to buy other stocks
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:37.120]   or some other risky asset, that might not make a lot of sense for a lot of people.
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:40.480]   But for a down payment where you have, you know, the house as collateral, it seems to
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:41.480]   make more sense.
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:42.480]   Right?
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:43.480]   Yeah, it definitely can.
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:46.800]   And again, it's really you're looking at just the spread between the interest rate that
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:51.720]   you're paying and the returns on the assets that you potentially make, as well as the
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.040]   taxes coming into play.
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.880]   So yeah, I think for a down payment for a house, certainly if you're sitting on a large
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:02.860]   portfolio, it can make a lot of sense to leave those assets in the portfolio and let them
[00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:06.080]   continue to grow.
[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:10.120]   Where you made a great point, it's got to make sense for what you're actually using
[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:11.120]   the money for.
[00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:12.120]   Right?
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:16.200]   If you're taking money out and putting on an eight leg parlay on DraftKings, maybe not
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:17.800]   the best idea.
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:22.240]   But certainly for a home purchase, it can be very useful.
[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:26.320]   Again, using leverage in the right way can be a good tool.
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:32.000]   The other thing I want to think about there is the way these loans work is like any other
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.640]   asset you're borrowing against, there's a loan to value ratio that the lender wants
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:38.640]   to stay below.
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:42.320]   What's like the ceiling there that you'd want to borrow against?
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:46.080]   I would say average is probably around 50%.
[00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:50.760]   Depending on the lender, depending on the assets, I've seen some as high as 70%, right?
[00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:55.640]   So if you have a million dollar portfolio, most places, they'll say, "We will give you
[00:14:55.640 --> 00:15:01.700]   half a million dollars at 3%," or whatever the interest rate is going to be.
[00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:06.560]   The danger then becomes, and what the lender is trying to prevent and protect against,
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:11.200]   is that the value of your securities fall, forcing effectively a margin call.
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:15.280]   What they'll do is they'll either liquidate positions without needing to ask you to pay
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:21.600]   themselves back to keep that value the same, or they'll say, "Hey, you need to put 10
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:26.640]   grand, 20 grand, 30 grand into the portfolio to keep that ratio correct."
[00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:27.640]   By the way-
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:28.640]   Go ahead.
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:35.460]   Parker in the comments says that Kelvin Ridley did not appreciate the Parlay comment.
[00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:36.460]   That's a good point.
[00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:37.460]   Yeah.
[00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:43.460]   That was a rough trade for him, however many millions of dollars he is for a year's salary.
[00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:53.300]   But the last point I wanted to make on this is, with that loan to value, if you set something
[00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:58.540]   like this up last year and your collateral securities that we're using were Facebook
[00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:03.420]   and the Ark Complex or tech-heavy names-
[00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:05.880]   Anything that's gotten crushed.
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:09.380]   Those are down 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%.
[00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:14.900]   If you're in a broad-based, globally diversified equity portfolio, you're probably down 8%
[00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:17.020]   or 9% year to date.
[00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:22.620]   So make sure what you are going to put up as collateral is not going to be something
[00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:25.860]   that could potentially draw down 50% in short order.
[00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:26.860]   Right.
[00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:27.860]   Okay.
[00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:30.260]   Dunkels, the next one.
[00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:31.820]   Okay.
[00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:34.740]   So up next we have, here's a challenge question for you.
[00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:35.740]   This is fun.
[00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:36.740]   We all like a challenge, right?
[00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:43.020]   So I'm 53, and as of January 2022, I had a net worth of $600,000, which was composed
[00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:46.580]   of cash, IRA, stocks, and home value minus mortgage.
[00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:47.940]   No debt.
[00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:51.620]   After the sale of my company, I now find myself with $2 million in cash.
[00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:57.380]   A year ago, I would have gone Warren Buffett and put 90% in S&P and 10% in bonds.
[00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:02.300]   I love to work, but I have the goal of retiring by 60 with at least 5 million in net worth.
[00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:08.100]   What in God's name should I do with $2 million in this new economy full of uncertainty?
[00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:09.220]   Great question.
[00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:13.100]   And obviously the value here doesn't matter as much as the thought process of investing
[00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:15.940]   in windfall when things seem scary and uncertain.
[00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:19.940]   And my one rule of thumb for this is obviously you have to take into account what's going
[00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:24.160]   on in the world and where the stock market is and interest rates and all these things.
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:29.060]   But it's far down the list in terms of setting up a financial investment plan, right?
[00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:32.980]   Like when it's not the first variable, it might not even be in the top five in terms
[00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:35.900]   of what's going on in the macro right now and how should this impact what I do with
[00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:36.900]   my portfolio.
[00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:42.340]   So Kevin, you have a client come to you and they say, listen, here's a certain time horizon.
[00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:47.140]   So this person says, you know, in seven years, I want to go from A to B. They're telling
[00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:49.980]   you I want to retire at 60, I want to have this much money.
[00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:54.380]   How do you handle a situation like that where they give you like the outcomes that they
[00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:55.380]   want to get?
[00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:58.700]   And then they say, okay, create a portfolio from your financial plan that gets me there.
[00:17:58.700 --> 00:17:59.700]   Right.
[00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:00.700]   Yeah.
[00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:03.140]   And I love this question because it allows us to touch on a lot of different concepts
[00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:05.740]   in financial planning.
[00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:07.700]   You know, ultimately this is just a math problem, right?
[00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:14.580]   This is just a question of assumed rates of returns and what you have and what you're
[00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:16.860]   going to contribute to it.
[00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:22.300]   If you took the simple math and let's say, let's say that this person, again, wants to
[00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:29.140]   get to $5 million in seven years, currently has about $2.6 million in net worth.
[00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:35.260]   If they're a regular W-2 worker contributing, you know, the max to their 401k, they're going
[00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:42.740]   to need around a 9% annualized rate of return to get to $5 million.
[00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:47.100]   That's obviously the tricky part in that we don't know for sure what those rates of return
[00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:48.280]   are going to be.
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:55.020]   So ultimately, you know, you end up with a situation that you have something that is
[00:18:55.020 --> 00:19:00.460]   true on a piece of paper in your plan or on a spreadsheet, but the real world obviously
[00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:01.460]   comes into play here.
[00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:04.180]   So that's where the variables can be tough to figure out.
[00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:05.180]   Right.
[00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:07.820]   And I guess if you have that end goal, you can use it to set expectations, right?
[00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:09.620]   Like here's what you need.
[00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:12.480]   Here's how this could, here's like your range of outcomes.
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:16.060]   And then as you get closer and you build a financial plan, you kind of say, all right,
[00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:17.060]   we're getting a little closer.
[00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:18.260]   Here's what the actual returns are going to be.
[00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:19.580]   Here's what you wanted.
[00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:23.520]   And sometimes I guess the good thing is you can tell someone, listen, your expectations
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:26.340]   are so far out of whack with reality in the current situation that you're never going
[00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:27.340]   to get there.
[00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:29.740]   And so you can use that as a conversation starter.
[00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:32.780]   Maybe you're going to have to put more money in, or maybe you're going to have to work
[00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:35.700]   longer, or maybe you're just not going to have as much at retirement as you think.
[00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:40.020]   So you can use those all as sort of signposts along the way to help them understand their
[00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:41.700]   goals.
[00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:44.580]   But I like the idea of managing a financial plan when we have this target.
[00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:46.820]   And then I guess the other thing is, is that, right?
[00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:48.380]   I'm sure you have this conversation a lot.
[00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:51.640]   Like when you turn 60 and retire, that doesn't mean your financial plan is done.
[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:53.860]   And then that's like when the hard work begins.
[00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:54.860]   Right?
[00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:55.860]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:19:55.860 --> 00:20:02.860]   And, you know, one other point on kind of the math side of this is that 9% rate of return.
[00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:09.140]   If this guy is saying that, you know, he's really uncomfortable right now, 13% off the
[00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:11.460]   all time highs.
[00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:17.820]   If he had put this money in a year ago, if he can't stick with that 90/10, that might
[00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:20.260]   not be the portfolio for him.
[00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:24.380]   And so that's where the behavioral coaching comes in that I think we can help a lot of
[00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:30.340]   people with is, yes, you might need 9%, but if the volatility that we're experiencing
[00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:34.940]   now is making you really uncomfortable and it's going to cause you to do something silly
[00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:43.620]   like panic sell or something like that, then we need to kind of marry the rational, right?
[00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:48.960]   Which is, okay, you need a 9% rate of return with the reasonable, which is what portfolio
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:52.200]   and plan can we develop for you that you'll stick with?
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:55.940]   Because ultimately that's going to be what the biggest driver of success is.
[00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:59.980]   And to your point, if we've got, we don't have seven years to make this work.
[00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:02.880]   We've got seven years until potentially he's going to start drawing the money.
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:06.740]   Then we've got another 30 years that this money needs to keep up with things like inflation
[00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:09.260]   and spending and things like that.
[00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:10.260]   Yeah.
[00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:14.660]   And I always like to remind people too that this is by far one of the craziest macro environments
[00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:19.060]   I've ever seen, especially just with all the really cross trends going on.
[00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:22.420]   But you're never 100% certain what's going to go on.
[00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:24.260]   Uncertainty is always at an all time high, I guess.
[00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:26.020]   It hits a new high every single day.
[00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:27.580]   So it's really hard to know.
[00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:30.200]   So that was a great question.
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:31.200]   So thanks.
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:32.200]   Thanks for coming on, Kevin.
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.200]   Yeah.
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:34.200]   Thank you for having me.
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:35.620]   This, this is a really crazy macro environment.
[00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:39.860]   I see we've got a bunch of questions here on the side, a lot of people asking about
[00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:42.620]   inflation hedges and can housing help there.
[00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:44.500]   So keep those comments and questions coming.
[00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:45.500]   We're always looking for more.
[00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:46.500]   Remember, askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:52.500]   On that note too, I wanted to mention, if we pull your question from the chat and you
[00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:56.300]   see it on a future show, just email us and we'll send you a sticker.
[00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:58.820]   Usually we can't like track you down just from a comment though.
[00:21:58.820 --> 00:21:59.820]   So if you want a sticker.
[00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:00.820]   What's the sticker look like Duncan?
[00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:02.060]   Did I even get one of these yet?
[00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:03.060]   I think you got one.
[00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:04.060]   The compound sticker?
[00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:05.060]   It's this one back here.
[00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:06.060]   Okay.
[00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:07.060]   Yeah.
[00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:08.060]   And we're not even selling those, right?
[00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:09.060]   We're just giving them away.
[00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:10.060]   The only way you get it is from having a question selected.
[00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:11.060]   It's exclusive.
[00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:12.060]   That might be an inflation hedge.
[00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:13.060]   Turn it into an NFT, Duncan.
[00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:14.060]   It's true.
[00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:15.060]   All right.
[00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:16.900]   Remember, askthecompoundshow@gmail.com.
[00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:20.100]   Thanks to Duncan and Kevin for joining me and we will see you next time.
[00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:20.380]   See ya.
[00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:25.380]   Bye.
[00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:30.380]   Bye.
[00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:35.380]   Bye.
