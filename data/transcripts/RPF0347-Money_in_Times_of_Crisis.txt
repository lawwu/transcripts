[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040]   Today on Radical Personal Finance, we're going to talk about tough times and some disaster
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:12.580]   scenarios and we're going to talk about how, hopefully, proper prior planning with your
[00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:21.000]   money can lead to better results for you and your loved ones when disaster strikes.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:38.480]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.960]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.280]   Thank you for being with me.
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.920]   This is the show where we work hard to provide you with the knowledge, skills, insight, and
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.400]   encouragement that you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while building a plan
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.960]   for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.280]   A lot of difficult things going on around the world.
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.280]   I don't know that money is going to improve them, but let's do some planning in case it
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.280]   can for you.
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:11.880]   I've been wanting to do a show here about disaster planning.
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.760]   There have been a number of things that are kind of coalesced and I wanted to do it at
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.760]   the beginning of June.
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.160]   You know, June 1 is the start of hurricane season here in South Florida.
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:24.800]   That's how some of you guys have to live with earthquakes and forest fires and tornadoes.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.800]   Those all have unique characteristics, but in general, the only natural disasters that
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.800]   we have to plan for here in Florida, well, not the only, but earthquakes are not a major
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.720]   factor.
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.040]   Winter blizzards and ice storms are not a major factor.
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.000]   The big one for us is hurricanes.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.760]   Hurricanes sometimes can be associated with tornadoes, but we don't have anything like
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.000]   the tornado activity that those of you in the Midwest of the United States have.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.320]   This time of year, I always turn my head to hurricane season.
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.320]   I consider, you know, am I prepared to go through some hurricanes with my family and
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.520]   have I done all the planning that I need to plan?
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.440]   Have I put in position everything that I need to assure their safety and their comfort?
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.640]   It's an important time of year where I kind of go through my checklists and go through
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.440]   our disaster plans and make sure that everything's buttoned up.
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.760]   So we've been thinking about that, but then there have also been a number of other scenarios
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.440]   that I've just been watching intensely.
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.680]   Probably the two most graphic ones have been the forest fires in Canada, the Fort McMurray
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:35.520]   forest fires up in Alberta that just swept through this town and just led to incredible
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.520]   video footage.
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.680]   I mean, incredibly terrible situations, but just the video footage is stunning.
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.880]   And so I've watched it closely to see, you know, all the people fleeing from the forest
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.640]   fires, if you're not familiar with the details of that scenario, you should spend some time
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.200]   on YouTube just looking at some of the footage from people's dash cams, people's cell phones,
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.160]   but just heart stopping footage.
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:04.120]   The other one that I have been watching very seriously and very closely is Venezuela.
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.240]   The economic crisis that's been happening in Venezuela over the past year and just intensifying
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.080]   and intensifying and intensifying.
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.240]   And it's just, it's heart wrenching to see the disaster that's happening there.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.520]   And so I've been considering these and wanting to do this show for a little while of some
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.840]   planning, some intelligent financial planning that you can do to protect yourself from financial
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:24.840]   planning.
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.880]   And today I bring it to you.
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.680]   I wasn't sure if I should do the show today because today as I record is Monday, June
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.200]   13, 2016.
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:42.120]   This is one day after the massacre here in Orlando, Florida at the Pulse nightclub in
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.120]   Orlando.
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:51.960]   And obviously that is the primary story that's on the top of mind for the nation and some
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:52.960]   parts of the world, I'm sure.
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.360]   And it's an absolutely heartbreaking story.
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:05.840]   And I'm not specifically doing a show about that story because it's just, in my opinion,
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:06.840]   too soon.
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:15.160]   All I've been doing is just been grieving and crying and praying for the people affected
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.640]   and the families who lost loved ones.
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.120]   It's just absolutely heartbreaking.
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.400]   So I don't like to, I know it's popular these days to jump on things and kind of exploit
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:30.760]   them for your own goals, but I personally am not interested in participating in that.
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.840]   But I'm going to go ahead and record today's show because there are some aspects that are
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.560]   relevant to that situation.
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:42.240]   But also just simply I was sick the last week or so and then had some personal things going
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.600]   on the week before that.
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.040]   So I've played a lot of interviews and then tomorrow I'm leaving town for two days.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.000]   And so I don't want to just constantly do interview shows.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.080]   And this was the show that's been planned since June 1.
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.000]   So I'm going to go ahead and release the show, but just please note that this is not specifically
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   related to the Orlando shooting.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   There are a few things that you can do to prepare for that financially.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.280]   There are very few things you can do to prepare for it emotionally, but unfortunately that's
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:15.680]   the world we live in where in some ways it's just all too common.
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:24.400]   And although in some instances it's unimaginable, perhaps few of us are shocked when these occurrences
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.400]   happen.
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.000]   And so there are some things that can be done with planning for such circumstances, but
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.640]   I'm not going to be talking about those today.
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:37.360]   I am going to be talking about and using as my examples hurricane season and Venezuela
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.720]   and the fires in Canada because those are very current thoughtful things that you can
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:43.720]   see.
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:49.640]   But I want you to use these circumstances to consider what would happen for you.
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:56.120]   One important theme with financial planning is many people don't consider their own circumstances
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:01.520]   in light of potential things that could happen until it hits close to home.
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.560]   But most of us go through our lives with generally pretty good circumstances.
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.960]   Few of us face the death of a close loved ones.
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.960]   Few of us face disaster right at hand.
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.880]   Few of us go through a collapsed economy like those in Venezuela.
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:20.800]   Few of us go through having to flee our homes in a firestorm like those in Fort McMurray
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:21.800]   have.
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:26.040]   Very few of us experience those things, thankfully.
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:32.400]   But if you will take the experience of others and apply it to your own life in advance,
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:39.160]   should you find yourself facing those circumstances, you might be able to get through it from a
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.520]   stronger position.
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.200]   And that's the essence of what good planning is.
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.120]   Good planning is to look at other people's circumstances and situations and then make
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.680]   plans to prepare for those things in your own life.
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.560]   Thankfully a lot of this is mental.
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:58.280]   By going through mental scenarios and wargaming the scenarios and thinking, "Okay, in this
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.600]   what will I do?"
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:04.060]   Those of us who are parents should be instructing our children, "When this happens, here's what
[00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.120]   you do and let's practice."
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.200]   We should be doing the same thing for ourselves.
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:13.600]   Anytime you see a story or a disaster story or whatever it is, you should be considering,
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:17.560]   "If this happens to me, what will I do?"
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.080]   So today we're going to talk about that.
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:25.640]   So before I begin today's show, sponsor of today's show is Paladin Registry.
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:29.120]   Financial planning and wargaming is all about thinking through scenarios, what's going to
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.320]   happen.
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.800]   If this happens then what would I do?
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.880]   Some of us can do it on our own.
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.400]   Most of us need to do it with other people.
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.080]   Now you can do this with a trusted friend.
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.520]   You can do this with your spouse.
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.720]   You might also need to hire a professional and that's where Paladin Registry comes in.
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:48.640]   If you've thought about hiring a financial advisor or if you've thought that perhaps
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:52.640]   you'd like to get a financial advisor's opinion or perspective on your personal financial
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.060]   situation, check them out.
[00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:56.060]   Check out Paladin Registry.
[00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:59.520]   Paladin Registry is a registry service of financial advisors.
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.320]   They take applicants for the system and for the service.
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:07.640]   They screen them based upon their own internal careful screening protocols and then if you
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:12.400]   go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/Paladin, you'll put in your information, your name,
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.760]   your address, the amount of money that you have.
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:18.440]   You'll put those details in there on that screening form and then they will provide
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:23.240]   for you a carefully vetted list of a few advisors in your local area.
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:28.100]   I can't promise you're going to find a great financial advisor at Paladin but I can promise
[00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:33.080]   it's a better place to start than a simple web search because you actually have advisors
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:38.960]   whose backgrounds have been checked, whose disciplinary records have been checked out.
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:39.960]   RadicalPersonalFinance.com/Paladin.
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:45.480]   So let's talk about crisis and money.
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:53.720]   The key theme that I want to emphasize to you in today's show is that money either solves
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:09:01.000]   or improves most issues in times of crisis.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.280]   There are many things that money cannot solve.
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:09.820]   Death, dismemberment, disability, physical problems, these things money cannot solve
[00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:15.040]   but even in the context of these situations, the experience of somebody who's done good
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:20.960]   financial planning prior to the event will be very different than somebody who's not
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:24.440]   done good financial planning prior to the event.
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:28.780]   When I was involved in the life insurance business, it's one thing that life insurance
[00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:30.480]   agents would commonly talk about.
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:36.780]   One of the worst things that can happen is we are perhaps more so than usual keenly aware
[00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:42.720]   of today is the death of a loved one.
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:46.120]   It's a terrible, terrible event.
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:48.440]   It rocks your world.
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:52.160]   But what's worse than the death of a loved one is experiencing the death of a loved one
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.200]   and also experiencing financial stress at the same time.
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:02.780]   It's one of the reasons why life insurance is such an important part of financial planning.
[00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:08.260]   But it goes beyond that because money really does either solve many issues in times of
[00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:15.020]   crisis or improve your experience in many issues in times of crisis.
[00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:20.720]   Money is the most marketable commodity in existence.
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:21.720]   That's what money is.
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:25.520]   It's the most marketable commodity in existence.
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:31.500]   So when you're thinking about disaster planning, money should be at the forefront of your planning.
[00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:39.340]   You should be considering what to do with money before considering many other things.
[00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:44.760]   Toward the latter end of today's show, I will talk about the times when money is not useful
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:45.760]   in a disaster situation.
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:51.240]   There are at least three different circumstances and probably more in which money simply doesn't
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.680]   work and it doesn't solve the problems.
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:57.640]   But in the majority of circumstances, money will solve the problem.
[00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:03.760]   Let's talk about these events that I'm using as a catalyst for today's show.
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:07.340]   Again, June, hurricane season here in Florida.
[00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:08.340]   Hurricane comes.
[00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:14.560]   If you have money, it's pretty simple to get out of the way of it, pretty simple to leave,
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:22.240]   and everything can be pretty much put together with some money when you get back home.
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.240]   What about Venezuela?
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.240]   Economic crisis.
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:29.000]   Well, if you have money, your experience of an economic crisis can be very different than
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.920]   the experience of those who don't.
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:34.800]   We'll talk about some of the planning steps you need to do.
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:37.000]   Fires in Canada.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.600]   Money doesn't solve the initial danger, which is what I'll talk about at the end of today's
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:43.600]   show.
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.240]   Money doesn't solve the initial danger.
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.040]   Money smooths the way.
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:50.440]   Money is what allows you to get a hotel room and fill the car up with gas so you can get
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:54.160]   from the disaster zone to a place where you can get some relief.
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.760]   So money solves almost all issues in times of crisis.
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:02.660]   And because of that, you should think about having money available to you in all of its
[00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:07.920]   forms under as many circumstances as you can plan for.
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:11.920]   You do need to approach this problem in an appropriate way.
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:19.000]   You need to start where you are and consider your current level of wealth and make plans
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.080]   in accordance with where you are in your wealth-building stage.
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:28.420]   There's a big difference between a young man or woman, 19 years old, a few hundred bucks
[00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:34.000]   to their name, just getting their start on the world, and the type of planning for disasters
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:40.120]   that they can or should do with money as compared to the middle-aged millionaire.
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:41.500]   Big difference.
[00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:44.040]   But the theme is constant.
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:49.080]   So let's talk about some simple preparedness items.
[00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:51.440]   Simple financial preparedness.
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:57.880]   Recognizing and remembering that money either solves issues in times of crisis or it improves
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:01.760]   your experience of issues in times of crisis.
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:03.680]   So simple beginner step.
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:09.240]   Make a habit of carrying an appropriate amount of cash on your person.
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:17.080]   Now in times past, this was always just, I guess, at least in my observation, either
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:19.400]   common practice or a commonly held desire.
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:22.680]   I remember when I was growing up, my dad always had cash in his wallet.
[00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:24.960]   If he needed money, he went to dad.
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.560]   He always had the change that you needed.
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.960]   If you needed change for a 20, he had change.
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:34.080]   He pulled out his wallet and pulled open the cash and did what needed to be done.
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:39.760]   And so I always thought that was normal and you aspire when you're adult, you always have
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:41.000]   money in your wallet.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.680]   Well, most people today don't actually carry money in their wallet.
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:51.040]   Most of us have a wallet full of plastic and that's about it.
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:56.720]   My generation especially, but it's gone far beyond my generation, we don't carry cash.
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:59.680]   We don't use cash.
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:05.160]   The popular theme nowadays is to have a wallet connected with your cell phone holder and
[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:08.360]   these wallets don't generally have provision for cash.
[00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:13.640]   If people do carry cash, they carry something like a $20 bill wrapped up in an elastic band
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:14.640]   in their wallet.
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:20.080]   But this is a tremendous disadvantage because many times in times of disaster, the cards
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:24.320]   don't work, but cash does.
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:30.500]   So simple starting places, make sure that if you run into a problem, you've got cash.
[00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:39.600]   Having cash in your wallet will solve many of your problems.
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:46.320]   From the difficult big disasters, what was the good one to think about is times of blackout.
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:52.440]   There've been a number of these major electricity outages over the past few years and these
[00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:58.360]   events come with very compelling images of people walking home and the bridges are clogged
[00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:59.360]   and things like that.
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:03.000]   Well, when there's no electricity, the cards don't work.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.120]   When there's no signal for the credit card machines, the cards don't work.
[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:11.060]   This happens routinely, but cash still works.
[00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:13.760]   You can still get what you need.
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:17.120]   Cash has the unique advantage because it's so marketable.
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.800]   Remember, money is the most marketable commodity in existence.
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:24.020]   It has the unique advantage of being universally accepted.
[00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:25.960]   You need to ride out of a dangerous situation.
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:30.320]   There are riots happening in your city and you need to ride out of a dangerous situation.
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:33.160]   Your Uber pass, your Uber fare may or may not work.
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.700]   Your credit card may or may not work in the taxi company.
[00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:38.640]   But if you can just ask somebody and say, "Hey, 20 bucks, can you get me a few miles
[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:39.640]   down the road?"
[00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:42.640]   You can get you and your family out of the area of danger.
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:45.920]   A $20 bill goes a long way.
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:48.160]   Now I'm talking about some of the extreme disaster scenarios.
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:49.880]   What about smaller disaster scenarios?
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:51.880]   They won't seat you properly in the restaurant.
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:52.880]   Guess what?
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:55.920]   A $20 bill usually fixes that problem.
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:16:00.280]   It's much less attractive to the person who's having trouble finding a spot for you on the
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:05.180]   seating chart to say, "Here, would you be willing to accept my American Express in your
[00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:10.480]   swipe card reader in your smartphone than it is to palm a $20 bill in your pocket and
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:11.880]   reach across and shake the hand?"
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:14.560]   If you don't know that technique, you should practice it.
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:21.520]   All you need to do – it's a little sad that I'm doing this, but the simple way
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:25.720]   to do it, if you haven't ever practiced passing a $20 bill or a $100 bill or whatever
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:30.480]   scale is appropriate, fold it up, put your hand out in front of you, curl it up kind
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.340]   of like you're going to go for a handshake.
[00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:36.480]   If you take a bill and you put it right in your fingers there, you can reach out and
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:38.760]   shake somebody's hand in a situation like that.
[00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:41.400]   They'll know what's going on and nobody else around will see.
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:42.840]   It's good for their privacy.
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:44.400]   Very, very simple.
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:45.840]   Very, very easy.
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:48.040]   Money will solve the problem.
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:53.140]   So get in the habit of carrying an appropriate amount of cash on your person.
[00:16:53.140 --> 00:17:01.680]   If you right now are stuck, whether it's because you're in Fort McMurray and you've
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:06.120]   got to get out of town and you're out to eat at a restaurant and all of a sudden something's
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:10.200]   going on and you've got to get out, look in your wallet and ask yourself, "How much
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:11.640]   money is there in my wallet?
[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:16.080]   Would I be able to get from the problem zone to where things are better?"
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:21.160]   If there's a terrorist attack and things are freezing up and no one's sure what's
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:26.760]   going on, open your wallet right now and ask yourself, "How much money do I have and
[00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:32.000]   would it be enough to get me and my family to safety?"
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:38.720]   Now, in some circumstances, one person is pretty easy to get out of danger, but what
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:41.800]   about the other people you're responsible for?
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:49.160]   Whether it's children, a little harder to get me with my family and children to safety.
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:51.820]   What if it's your coworkers?
[00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:55.080]   What if it's a team that you're responsible for?
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:59.600]   How are you going to protect those around you in a time of crisis?
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:04.800]   Think about how much money is in your wallet right now and ask yourself, "If I removed
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:12.320]   access to your credit cards and there was a disaster facing you, an acute, current,
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:19.200]   time-bound disaster, how confident are you with the amount of money that's in your wallet?"
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.600]   Have cash available to you.
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:27.160]   Make a habit of carrying an appropriate amount of cash readily accessible to you on your
[00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:28.880]   person.
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:34.580]   Next, make a habit of keeping a substantial amount of cash readily accessible to you without
[00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:37.480]   needing to ask anybody for it.
[00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:43.880]   I'm not sure that for some of you, maybe carrying $20,000 around on a daily basis is simple
[00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:46.080]   for you and you're accustomed to that.
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:51.120]   I would say for most of us, most of us are not going to feel very confident or comfortable
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:55.440]   with $20,000 and $100 bills in our wallet.
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:19:00.400]   Maybe someday I will, but I'm not there.
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:05.980]   You might like to have access to some money though and you might like to have access to
[00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:10.300]   it without having to go and ask anybody for it.
[00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:14.240]   Now, sometimes this is in case of a disaster.
[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:17.620]   Disaster can strike at the worst of times.
[00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:23.460]   You might come, a natural disaster often occurs when you don't want it, when you're not expecting
[00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:24.460]   it.
[00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:29.620]   Whether it's a terrorist attack or whether it's a, some of you get faced an earthquake
[00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:34.320]   or tornadoes or things that blow up quickly.
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:38.860]   Having the ability to put your hand on a few thousand dollars or $10,000 or $20,000, that
[00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:42.020]   can be life-changing in many circumstances.
[00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:45.180]   Of course, you need to always, with all of these things, you need to make sure that you're
[00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:48.980]   keeping things properly secured.
[00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:53.300]   Don't be foolish with the money that you keep on your person and don't advertise its existence.
[00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:55.800]   Take care for the safety of your person.
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:59.260]   Make sure that you have good practice of knowing where your wallet is.
[00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:04.220]   With regard to keeping more cash readily accessible, you need to make sure that it's protected,
[00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:08.980]   whether that's a safe in your home, a safety deposit box in your local bank or some other
[00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:12.040]   method of securing and concealing the money.
[00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:18.520]   Make sure, if possible, that you have a substantial amount of cash readily accessible to you.
[00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:20.960]   You might need to make your buddies bail.
[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:23.820]   You might need to make your spouses bail.
[00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:30.180]   If you have the means, place some cash where you can get to it quickly.
[00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:37.140]   Next, make a habit of keeping bank reserves readily accessible.
[00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:41.420]   What that means is simply don't over-leverage yourself into illiquid investments if you
[00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:42.980]   can help it.
[00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:49.580]   Money, cash, currency is king, not having valuable stuff that you could convert to cash
[00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:52.260]   in a period of time.
[00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:54.020]   Money is helpful.
[00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:58.780]   So if you've made the mistake of having all your money invested, for example, you put
[00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:04.820]   all your money into your 401(k) but you don't keep any of it in a savings account, well,
[00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:08.060]   undo that mistake and keep some money in a savings account.
[00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:11.180]   Don't over-leverage yourself and don't ever wipe out your liquidity.
[00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:16.220]   Don't ever wipe out your ability to cover your bills for a few months.
[00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:21.260]   Also, keep those bank reserves readily and conveniently accessible.
[00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:25.340]   Think about how you actually access your accounts.
[00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:29.460]   For example, do you have debit cards for all of your appropriate accounts and do you know
[00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:34.100]   the PIN numbers to those debit cards or do you keep those PIN numbers?
[00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:38.860]   Perhaps simple idea, keep all the PIN numbers on all your accounts the same.
[00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:44.820]   Most of us are not going to keep a huge amount of currency and cash in our checking accounts.
[00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:46.180]   So you're going to have multiple accounts.
[00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:51.100]   Well, do you have a debit card for that account where you can access the money out of an ATM?
[00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:56.260]   Is your banking system set up in a way that you can easily transfer money from one account
[00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:59.260]   to another or is there a three-day hold on the money?
[00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:04.700]   A little bit of planning, a little bit of thought with your banking accounts.
[00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:08.220]   You can have it set up so you can keep a large amount of money in a savings account and then
[00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:13.380]   if you need to make an immediate transfer to your checking account, you can do that.
[00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:19.460]   One very simple and very practical suggestion for you is make sure that you've asked for
[00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:24.380]   and gotten permanent high ATM limits on your accounts.
[00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:25.980]   I discovered that I could do this a number of years ago.
[00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:31.300]   I was buying a car and whenever possible, I prefer to do these types of transactions
[00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:35.180]   and using currency, cash.
[00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:41.140]   Quick note, when I use the word cash, I'm usually referring to the idea that we're not
[00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:42.700]   using credit.
[00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:51.220]   So if I say use cash, it doesn't necessarily mean use a personal check or $20 bills.
[00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:53.100]   I try – I make mistakes with this.
[00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:58.980]   I try to refer to $20 bills as currency, but I do slip up and sometimes refer to that as
[00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:03.140]   cash but I will try to keep an eye on that and try to clarify that for yourself.
[00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:10.540]   So when I do various types of transactions like buying a car, if it's at the smaller
[00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:15.420]   end and it works, in the used market, a lot of times going to the transaction with currency
[00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:17.980]   is the best scenario.
[00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:21.860]   I wanted to buy a car and I needed to get currency out so I could make the transaction
[00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:23.220]   that day.
[00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:28.040]   I was seeking to – a quick little lesson in buying.
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:33.060]   In a transaction, the number involved is only one of the terms.
[00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:38.540]   When you're negotiating a transaction between two parties, there are multiple terms that
[00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:40.460]   can be negotiated.
[00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:48.260]   So one number might be the actual amount of the – the actual dollar amount of the bill.
[00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:53.180]   Another amount or another factor might be the form of payment and another factor might
[00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:54.420]   be the timing of payment.
[00:23:54.420 --> 00:24:00.000]   Those are usually the three most common things to negotiate in any transaction that you have.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.860]   So what you should do is get in the habit of looking at any financial transaction and
[00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:08.340]   asking, "Is there a way that I can negotiate this to my best interest?"
[00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:16.620]   And so sometimes you can pay a higher price, but if you can negotiate more favorable terms,
[00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:19.460]   you negotiate a longer payment period.
[00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:22.500]   You negotiate a different form of payment that's more helpful to you.
[00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:24.900]   That's going to put you in a better situation.
[00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:29.080]   But you can often negotiate the price because that's what most people negotiate and then
[00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:34.500]   negotiate off of the price based upon the form of the payment and the timing of the
[00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:35.500]   payment.
[00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:40.940]   So having – this is one reason why getting your hand on cash is so valuable.
[00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:41.940]   You go to buy a car.
[00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:46.400]   Well, you can buy the car and you can buy the car with a wire transfer or a personal
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:47.840]   check or something like that.
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:50.860]   You might – a certified check.
[00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:58.060]   You might do that, but you might also be able to take a stack of currency with you and if
[00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:06.860]   you are ready to move right then, you use that negotiating chip to negotiate off a bit
[00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:13.300]   more off the price or use the fact that you're willing to buy right now to allow you to negotiate
[00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:17.460]   some off the price because for the seller, their interest might be to have the highest
[00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:21.500]   amount of money, the highest price, or their interest might be to get rid of the thing
[00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:22.680]   quickly.
[00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:28.180]   And so having money in your pocket, having currency in your pocket will make a big difference.
[00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:32.660]   It's very simple – a very simple negotiating technique if you're buying something like
[00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:34.180]   that, something like a used car.
[00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:38.980]   Say this car is probably worth – let's say it's worth $5,000.
[00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:42.020]   This car is probably worth $5,000 and I think you could probably get that.
[00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:43.540]   It's a good-looking car.
[00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:46.240]   I think you could probably find someone that can do that.
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:47.240]   But I tell you what.
[00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:52.060]   I'm not willing to pay you $5,000, but I am willing to buy the car right now and I'd
[00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:55.660]   be willing to give you $4,200 for it right now.
[00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:59.660]   So if you'd like, here's $4,200 in $20 bills.
[00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:03.980]   I'd be happy to take the car right now and you can have the thing sold.
[00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:04.980]   Very simple.
[00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:05.980]   There's no manipulation.
[00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:08.980]   You're just simply adjusting the terms of your offer.
[00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:11.220]   Always keep this in mind when working with service providers.
[00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:17.220]   You have a mechanic or somebody is working on your house or something like that.
[00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:20.180]   They prepare the price for their proposal or they prepare the price for the bill.
[00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:21.920]   You're going to pay the bill.
[00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:23.260]   You can pay that price with a check.
[00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:25.780]   You can pay that price with a credit card.
[00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:29.980]   Ask them what the discount of cash paying with currency would be.
[00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:35.540]   A lot of times by adjusting the form of payment, you'll be able to negotiate a better deal.
[00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:39.220]   So back to the story of the car, I was going to look at a car.
[00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:40.220]   I was fairly confident.
[00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:41.220]   I'd done my research.
[00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:43.820]   I knew this particular car was the one I wanted and I needed to get currency.
[00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:47.740]   I didn't have enough currency available to me to make the deal and I wanted to make
[00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:52.260]   sure that I was ready to make the deal quickly in order to buy the car.
[00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:55.660]   Called the bank, asked for an increase on the ATM limit so I could go and make multiple
[00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:58.260]   ATM withdrawals without them shutting my card down.
[00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:03.300]   I found out from speaking with a representative that I could have a permanent higher limit
[00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:04.300]   applied to my account.
[00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:09.500]   So instead of dealing with the $700 or the $1,200 very low ATM limit, which is common
[00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:12.020]   on checking accounts, they raised my limit on my account.
[00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:13.780]   I think it's something like $5,000.
[00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:18.220]   So at any point in time without calling them or getting special considerations, I can withdraw
[00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:26.340]   $5,000 from an ATM or any ATM in a series of transactions without them flagging my account.
[00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:31.060]   That's really useful because what might happen is you might find yourself in a position where
[00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:32.260]   you're heading out of town.
[00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:37.020]   You're escaping from the – you're trying to get out of the forest fire zone and so
[00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:40.920]   you get just a point of safety, but you don't have any currency in your pocket for whatever
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:42.980]   reason and you need to go to the ATM.
[00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:48.180]   Well, if your account is limited and you can only make a $400 withdrawal and another $400
[00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:52.540]   withdrawal and then they shut you down for the day, you got $800 in your pocket.
[00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:57.220]   But if you can withdraw $400 multiple times up to a total of $5,000 and you can just sit
[00:27:57.220 --> 00:28:01.660]   there and do it, it'll take 20 minutes of sitting there at the ATM.
[00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:03.940]   But sometimes that's really useful.
[00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:07.100]   And if you're doing that at 3 o'clock in the morning while you're fleeing a difficult
[00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:11.920]   situation, you'll be glad that you had the foresight to go ahead and set that up.
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:17.040]   Also, consider making a habit of keeping those bank reserves readily accessible to you by
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:19.520]   asking for higher ATM limits.
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:22.600]   And always consider maintaining a bank account with local banks so you have access to that
[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:23.600]   bank services.
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:27.760]   I've banked my entire adult life with USAA and have been thrilled with their banking
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:30.720]   services, but they don't have any local branches.
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:34.040]   They have no brick and mortar banking institutions.
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:38.860]   And so that leads to a couple of things that I can't conveniently do with them.
[00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:42.500]   So it's good to make sure that in a circumstance like that, you have a relationship with a
[00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:46.040]   local bank so you have access to that bank's services.
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:48.440]   Next, back on track here.
[00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:52.140]   We're talking about make a habit of carrying an appropriate amount of cash on your person.
[00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:55.480]   Make a habit of keeping a substantial amount of cash readily accessible to you, currency
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:56.620]   available to you.
[00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:59.840]   Make a habit of keeping bank reserves readily accessible to you.
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:04.340]   And then make a habit of maintaining several credit cards with various issuers and have
[00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:09.360]   as much credit available to you as possible at all times.
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:12.540]   And make sure it's with different issuers.
[00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:17.320]   Good recommendation, make sure that in your wallet or secreted on your person or distributed
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:22.000]   in your baggage in various places if you're traveling, you have access to a Visa card,
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.240]   a MasterCard, an American Express card, and a Discover card.
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:29.260]   Because some of those will work sometimes in some places, some of them won't work in
[00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:30.600]   other times in other places.
[00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:33.680]   I remember one time, I think it was in Costa Rica.
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:39.000]   I was in Costa Rica and I went to make a withdrawal from the bank or do a credit card transaction.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.520]   For some reason, that time they wouldn't accept Visa.
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:44.680]   Okay, well I switched and pulled out the MasterCard.
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:48.560]   So make sure you have access to several credit cards with various issues.
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:51.920]   Consider a scenario such as 9/11.
[00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:55.160]   Consider how important it would be to have those credit cards available to you.
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:30:00.920]   9/11, if you were traveling and away from home on 9/11, you were in a tough spot, a
[00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:08.400]   very tough spot because all of the air transportation was shut down for a few days.
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:11.240]   I think it was at least a few days.
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:17.520]   And then the resulting mess from having all air transportation shut down for a few days
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:20.200]   just made a mess of everything else.
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:22.920]   Well, in a situation like that, what do you do?
[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:26.400]   You should immediately say, "I need to get home with my family," most circumstances.
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:28.080]   "I need to get home with my family."
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:31.600]   So you look and say, "I need to book a bus ticket or a train ticket," or you might
[00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:33.400]   just need to go rent a car.
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:37.920]   Well, if you at that point in time had done your monthly budget and you didn't have
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:42.640]   money available to you in your checking account because it was all allocated and everything
[00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:45.800]   was messed up and you didn't have access to some credit cards, you might not be able
[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:47.800]   to go and rent that car.
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:51.680]   But if you can move quickly in a circumstance like that, move before the crowds, go rent
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:55.920]   the car, and if it takes you a day to drive across the country and get home, at least
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:56.920]   you're home.
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:58.640]   Well, think ahead.
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:02.400]   Make sure that you have various credit cards available to you with different issuers and
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:07.480]   have as much credit available to you on those cards as possible.
[00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:12.680]   And then next, make a habit of keeping various forms of money available to you.
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:14.640]   Again, remember, doing this with scale.
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:18.280]   Consider where you are and consider if you might better your situation by thinking about
[00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:19.680]   something else.
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:20.680]   Currency is good.
[00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:21.680]   It's very useful.
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:22.680]   Credit cards are useful.
[00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:25.920]   But are there other valuable items that might also be useful?
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:30.240]   Can you lay your hands on some gold coins or some silver coins or gold or silver bullion
[00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:33.080]   if you need to to make a transaction?
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:37.280]   Are you at the point where you should consider having some precious gems around or other
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:39.480]   items of value?
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:48.160]   After a hurricane, a chainsaw is a much more useful barter item than is a stack of currency.
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:55.080]   After some circumstances, a gun is a much more useful barter item than a credit card.
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:59.340]   So depending on the situation, you might be able to plan ahead and just by accumulating
[00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:06.320]   some things of value, you can set yourself up to where you're in a good situation.
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:09.720]   In times of trouble, you can trade tools to people pretty quickly and your transactions
[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:11.320]   will go much farther.
[00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:16.320]   Back to doing a deal, form of payment is useful and sometimes currency is the most useful
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:17.960]   form of payment.
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:22.100]   Sometimes currency is not the most useful form of payment.
[00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:25.600]   And you might be able to trade an item of value to somebody else because they don't
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:30.680]   particularly have use for the currency, but they'd really like to have the item of value.
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:34.400]   Always look for those things because if you can trade something that you have for something
[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:39.120]   that somebody else has that you'd rather have, then they'd like to have your item that can
[00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:43.820]   be very useful to them.
[00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:50.280]   Think in advance and establish yourself with options, recognizing that money will solve
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:54.800]   many of your issues or improve your situation.
[00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:57.760]   If you got to get from one side of the country to the other, you need money.
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:01.560]   You need money to rent the car, put the gas in the car.
[00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:06.120]   You need money to buy the bus ticket, buy the train ticket, buy the plane ticket.
[00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:10.080]   If you're fleeing from a hurricane, you need money to get yourself a hotel room in another
[00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:15.280]   city, money to get some groceries so you have something to eat.
[00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:19.100]   Money improves situations.
[00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:24.400]   If you need to, again, bail your spouse out of jail or bail a good friend out of jail,
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:27.440]   money improves the situations.
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:34.160]   Now, notice that I've talked a lot in today's show thus far about leaving.
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:37.880]   The reason I do that is important.
[00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:42.620]   In most disasters, the very best thing that you can do for yourself and for your loved
[00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:45.840]   ones is to leave.
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:51.160]   If you can leave the affected area, leave.
[00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:54.000]   Leaving is usually going to be your best option.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:59.680]   Obviously, there are situations which is better to stay, but leaving many times gets you out
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:02.120]   of trouble.
[00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:06.580]   If you're in a situation and things are starting to feel a little bit strange, you're noticing
[00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:11.100]   people's behavior is a little bit off, get up and leave.
[00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:14.680]   If the hackles on the back of your neck go up and you kind of have a question about maybe
[00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:18.040]   this isn't the safest place to be, get up and leave.
[00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:22.920]   If you're in a situation and you see political protests going on and people are starting
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:28.100]   to yell at each other and cause problems, get up and leave.
[00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:31.640]   If you're looking around at your country and you're saying, "My government is causing all
[00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:32.640]   kinds of problems.
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:41.120]   We're starting to have some real warning signs on the horizon here," get up and leave.
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:42.120]   Leave the country.
[00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:43.120]   Leave the city.
[00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:44.120]   Leave the bar.
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:48.120]   Get out before the fight starts.
[00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:53.920]   It might be heroic to be on the last plane out.
[00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:58.520]   Fidel Castro is coming into power and you got your family on the last plane out.
[00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:01.720]   You might say, "Okay, we got on the last plane out, but how much better to have gotten on
[00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:05.080]   the plane out a year ago when it was easy?"
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:07.080]   It's very expensive to leave last minute.
[00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:09.760]   It's usually a lot cheaper to leave quickly.
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:14.980]   The reason I'm talking so much about money and leaving is because the best way to escape
[00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:21.320]   the impact of most disaster scenarios is not to be there when the disaster happens.
[00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:24.480]   It's like things like fights and problems.
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:28.380]   I heard it from a firearms trainer years ago.
[00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:31.400]   Don't be with stupid people in stupid places doing stupid things.
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:36.280]   You avoid most of your problems, so leave.
[00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:37.480]   But what do you need to do to leave?
[00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:38.880]   Well, you need money to leave.
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:43.400]   A lot of times you need papers to leave and you need money to use while you're gone.
[00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:45.000]   Let's continue talking about money.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:51.140]   You need money to buy the tickets or to put gas in the car to get you out of the area.
[00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:54.920]   Sometimes you need money to bribe the government officials that are keeping you in or keeping
[00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:55.920]   you out.
[00:35:55.920 --> 00:36:02.400]   I always think about the stories of the Jews that were fleeing Germany back under the Nazi
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:03.400]   regime.
[00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:07.800]   They had to wipe out their life savings and they've got jewels and gold and everything
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:11.940]   secreted in their coats and they basically wiped out their life savings to bribe the
[00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:14.080]   government officials to let them out.
[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:16.280]   Well, thank God many of them got out.
[00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:18.880]   A lot of them didn't.
[00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:22.480]   So you need money on hand to get you out.
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:24.120]   You need money on hand to get you on the plane.
[00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:31.240]   You need money on hand to get you in the car with somebody who's leaving the affected area.
[00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:33.080]   You need money to leave.
[00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:36.900]   You also need papers to leave a lot of times.
[00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:43.440]   This means make sure that you have a passport that's current for you and for your spouse
[00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:45.740]   and for every member of your family.
[00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:51.900]   This is probably the most neglected preparedness item, especially financial preparedness item
[00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:53.920]   that most of you listening have neglected.
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:57.120]   US Americans were terrible about having passports.
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:01.400]   We just say, "Well, the United States is the best place ever and it's really big so why
[00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:02.960]   would I need to go anywhere?"
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:06.900]   I was considering this recently myself and I realized that I was lacking.
[00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:11.320]   I hadn't gotten around to getting passports for my kids because we haven't really traveled
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:13.620]   much internationally in the last couple of years.
[00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:19.380]   I don't have any plans right now for an international trip and I realized that I hadn't bought passports
[00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:20.380]   for my kids.
[00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:21.380]   My son's two and a half years.
[00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:23.580]   The last two and a half years he hasn't had a passport available to him.
[00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:26.780]   What would I need to do if I needed to get out of the country?
[00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:30.260]   Can't go.
[00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:34.960]   I was even more chagrined to pull open my passport and realize mine expired about three
[00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:35.960]   months ago.
[00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:40.520]   What would I need to do if I needed to get out of the country?
[00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:43.580]   Make sure that you have a passport for you and for all of your family members and you're
[00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:44.580]   ready to go.
[00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:51.460]   A passport and a credit card can get you out of a lot of problems.
[00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:54.600]   Good financial preparedness item, get your passports lined up.
[00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:56.720]   I'm doing it for me and for my family.
[00:37:56.720 --> 00:38:00.840]   That was one of the things that when I was again going through my checklist and I realized,
[00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:03.860]   "Wait a second, I am remiss."
[00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:07.660]   Also keep money outside of your affected area if possible.
[00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:16.260]   Now this is not generally important for things like natural disasters, but it's very important
[00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:19.740]   in times of economic problems.
[00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:23.540]   It's very important in times of political problems.
[00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:29.540]   If you're going through economic unrest or recession, depression in your country and
[00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:34.460]   maybe the government is mismanaging the currency and you're facing inflation or hyperinflation
[00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:38.940]   or deflation, one of the things that's often associated with those circumstances is capital
[00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:45.340]   controls or currency controls where you're not allowed to get out of the country.
[00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:49.140]   Now all of a sudden, you're in Venezuela and you had lots of money in a Venezuelan bank
[00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:52.780]   account, but now it's all stuck in Venezuela.
[00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:58.180]   You are getting out of Venezuela, but you don't have any money.
[00:38:58.180 --> 00:39:03.460]   Another thing that happens if you're a political dissident and unfortunately, many of us either
[00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:06.900]   have or will become political dissidents in our lifetime.
[00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:11.380]   As our governments change, as what's popular changes, you become a political dissident
[00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:18.520]   and now you are labeled with that label and now your access to your money and your stuff
[00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:21.820]   is going to be challenging sometimes.
[00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:26.180]   Again, these are some of the more extreme human cost scenarios.
[00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:30.940]   Hurricane, generally not a problem to have money outside of the affected area.
[00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:33.940]   So pay attention to Venezuela with this regard.
[00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:38.140]   Make a habit if you're concerned and many of you listeners are international listeners,
[00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:42.660]   make a habit of diversifying your savings in terms of their currency.
[00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:47.100]   It's probably a mistake to have all of your money in one currency, especially if you've
[00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:49.060]   accumulated a substantial amount.
[00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:52.900]   Again, I'm differentiating here between somebody who has 10,000 bucks.
[00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:59.580]   You don't have a lot to worry about with regard to currency selection if you have 10,000 bucks.
[00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:01.220]   That's different than somebody with a million dollars.
[00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:04.320]   So you need to diversify your currencies.
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:09.300]   It's very simple to open a bank account in another country and very wise to open a bank
[00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:13.220]   account in another country and maintain some reserves there in a savings account in a foreign
[00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:16.460]   currency.
[00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:18.820]   Probably for US Americans, Canada is your best bet.
[00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:27.620]   It's pretty simple and probably a very important plan for most of you to go up across the border,
[00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:31.300]   open a Canadian bank account and keep some money up in a Canadian bank account in Canadian
[00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:34.460]   currency, something that's not in the US dollar, something that's diversified.
[00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:37.780]   Now in the United States, we get very lazy with this because the US dollar is the reserve
[00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:38.980]   currency of choice of the world.
[00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:40.540]   It's the strongest currency.
[00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:43.460]   There's no guarantee that continues forever.
[00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:48.620]   It's probably not going to continue for as long as those who say, "Well, the US dollar
[00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:52.220]   will always be the world's greatest currency."
[00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:56.180]   It's probably not going to continue for as long as they say it's going to continue and
[00:40:56.180 --> 00:41:02.020]   it's probably going to lose its status a little bit later than those who say, "It's a terrible
[00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:03.580]   currency and it's all going to collapse."
[00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:05.740]   It's probably going to be somewhere in between those.
[00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:09.240]   But it doesn't mean you shouldn't plan for it.
[00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:11.540]   So open up a savings account in another country.
[00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:16.900]   Again, thinking of a situation, economic crisis usually comes with currency controls, capital
[00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:18.980]   controls, controls on the money.
[00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:22.980]   A little bit of planning ahead if you were in Venezuela, making sure that you'd already
[00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:31.340]   expatriated some money gives you the money to get through a difficult circumstance.
[00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:37.180]   Hyperinflation, if you get into a hyperinflation economic scenario in your country of residence,
[00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:39.500]   hyperinflation usually only lasts for a couple of years.
[00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:42.260]   And so the best thing to do, it can't last for any longer.
[00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:44.740]   It implodes and they reset it and start a new currency.
[00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:47.980]   So the best thing to do in hyperinflation is usually just leave.
[00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:54.440]   If you can set aside enough money in a foreign country where you can go and take your money,
[00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:58.540]   and take your family and your loved ones and just be gone for a couple of years and you
[00:41:58.540 --> 00:42:04.340]   have enough money outside of your country of origin, outside of that currency of origin
[00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:08.260]   to where you can be gone, you can get through those two years in comfort.
[00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:13.420]   And then you can come back and start rebuilding at that point in time.
[00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:17.220]   You should also consider having a savings account, keeping foreign currency in a savings
[00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:19.300]   account in another country.
[00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:21.660]   It's very simple if you're trying to purchase a currency.
[00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:26.660]   There are many currencies that are very strong, but they won't allow US Americans especially.
[00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:30.100]   Some of you from other countries can do it, but they won't allow US Americans to open
[00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:31.740]   a bank account in that country.
[00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:35.300]   Probably the most notable one would be something like the Swiss.
[00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:39.500]   If you are a US American, you are persona non grata in Switzerland.
[00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:41.780]   Swiss bank accounts are effectively barred to you.
[00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:46.380]   But that doesn't mean you can't buy Swiss francs and put them in a safe deposit box
[00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:49.940]   in a Caribbean bank or in a Canadian bank.
[00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:55.260]   This allows you to have money in a stable currency outside of your country of origin,
[00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:58.500]   but it allows you to do it in a way that you can actually get it done.
[00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:01.780]   There's also some foreign reporting requirements.
[00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:04.580]   One little tidbit on foreign reporting requirements.
[00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:12.380]   US tax law requires all US taxpayers to report bank accounts held in foreign countries.
[00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:14.700]   You need to report all of those bank accounts.
[00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:20.260]   They do not require you to report currency that's held in a foreign country.
[00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:25.820]   So if your financial plan and your asset allocation plan calls for you to hold currency, physical
[00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:30.020]   currency in a safe deposit box in another country, that might be a way for you to do
[00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:33.940]   it and you might not have to fulfill as many reporting requirements.
[00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:36.820]   That's my understanding of the law.
[00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:40.660]   So think ahead and if you can leave the affected area, leave.
[00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:46.740]   Here I'm dealing again with those big time national disaster scenarios.
[00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:55.060]   Now you should note that thus far I've only discussed money and I emphasize to you again
[00:43:55.060 --> 00:44:04.220]   that's because in almost every situation all you need is enough money to get you through.
[00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:09.380]   If I have a problem and I have a credit card and a passport for me and all of my family
[00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:14.700]   members, I can go down to the airport, I can buy a supplantic to another country, and I
[00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:19.120]   can buy a toothbrush in a hotel room when I get there, and I can get everything figured
[00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:22.240]   out once I'm there.
[00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:29.340]   Money solves almost all of the situations better than just about anything else.
[00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:34.540]   But there are at least three situations and probably more where money doesn't work.
[00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:39.940]   One, if you don't have enough money, you've got to go to something else.
[00:44:39.940 --> 00:44:43.820]   Either if you don't have enough money or access to enough money.
[00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:46.900]   That's where having a credit card is important, having a home equity line of credit available
[00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:50.860]   to you in your house, having lines of credit secured before you need them is important
[00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:53.940]   because you might just not have enough money.
[00:44:53.940 --> 00:45:00.020]   What is the person who says, "I'm facing a natural disaster, but I have $3,000 and
[00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:02.740]   that's not enough to buy plane tickets out of the area.
[00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:04.060]   What do I do?"
[00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:07.180]   Or what if they don't have access to enough money to buy plane tickets out?
[00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:11.480]   Well, you've got to do another method of planning.
[00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:16.780]   The second time that money is probably not going to work is if money is too slow to be
[00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:19.060]   of use.
[00:45:19.060 --> 00:45:20.480]   Think about it.
[00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:26.540]   Money can buy you great medical care, but if you've just been shot and you don't have
[00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:32.940]   a medical kit or if you've just fallen and hit your head or you're bleeding severely
[00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:36.100]   and you don't have a tourniquet handy to you and you don't have a first aid kit handy to
[00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:40.020]   you or your kid is bleeding from a head wound and you don't have some band-aids or some
[00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:44.660]   gauze to put on as a pressure dressing, now you've got a problem.
[00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:47.460]   Doesn't matter how much money you wave around.
[00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:52.180]   Help is only minutes or hours away when you need it.
[00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:57.420]   Sometimes money is just too slow to be of use.
[00:45:57.420 --> 00:46:02.000]   Sometimes the money might, third reason, money might not be valued because of other things
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   that are going on.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.880]   Let's talk about some examples.
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:08.220]   Think about the forest fires in Fort McMurray, Alberta.
[00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:13.560]   In that circumstance, what did you need to do to protect yourself and your family?
[00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:15.880]   Money was probably not the problem.
[00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:20.200]   It's a problem for people who are at the lower end of the economic scale, they're worried
[00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:26.000]   about work and things like that, but the money was not the acute problem.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.600]   The fire was bearing down on the town.
[00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:29.800]   Some people had a 10-minute warning and had to get out.
[00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:33.840]   Well, in that situation, the money doesn't help, but having a full tank of gas in your
[00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:41.280]   car or at least a half a tank of gas, you've got 200 miles of range, that goes a long distance.
[00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:47.700]   Some things you can't solve with money, but you can solve with simple planning and preparation.
[00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:51.300]   Don't let the gas in your car get below a half or a third of a tank.
[00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:53.640]   Make sure you always have at least a third of a tank in your car.
[00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:57.360]   That requires discipline, but when you got to get your child to the hospital or you got
[00:46:57.360 --> 00:47:03.320]   to get out because of the forest fire, you'll be glad you have some gas in your tank.
[00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:07.260]   Think about hurricanes and hurricanes is often gas lines.
[00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:10.240]   Gas is available, but you might have hours waiting.
[00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:14.520]   You might spend hours sitting, waiting in line, waiting for the gas.
[00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:21.120]   You have plenty of money for it, but is it really worth it to you to spend time standing
[00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:22.680]   in line for 10 hours?
[00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:27.800]   Wouldn't it be a little bit smarter to have some cans of gas tucked aside?
[00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:30.320]   A little bit smarter.
[00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:31.320]   Not a financial thing.
[00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:34.440]   It's just recognizing that it's not the money that's the problem there.
[00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:39.320]   It's which local gas station has a generator to be able to run itself to accept credit
[00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:40.320]   cards.
[00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:42.560]   Well, avoid all that nonsense.
[00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:48.120]   Store aside 30, 40 gallons of gas in your back shed and you're in good shape.
[00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:50.800]   Or think about a situation like Venezuela.
[00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:55.320]   Venezuela has food, some.
[00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:59.360]   Major problem in Venezuela is the variety of food is very small.
[00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:03.280]   They have just a few basic staples.
[00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:09.080]   And because it's being rationed not according to price, what always happens in a situation
[00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:14.200]   when prices are controlled, rationing has to happen due to some other force.
[00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:18.040]   Usually it's going to be a queue, a line waiting for rations.
[00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:22.640]   That's why if you let the free market open, the free market will often regulate itself
[00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:24.280]   based upon price.
[00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:27.720]   But if you freeze price, it has to regulate itself some other way.
[00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:33.320]   To read the accounts coming out of Venezuela, what you find is that food is available, but
[00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:36.640]   you might spend hours standing in line waiting for food.
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:43.420]   And you might be spending those hours putting your life in danger due to somebody coming
[00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:47.440]   and stealing your money or stealing your food.
[00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:53.020]   Times of economic crisis, personal insecurity usually goes up.
[00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:58.520]   People are generally willing to commit more crime during times of crisis than other times.
[00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:02.080]   So again, how do you avoid the risky situation?
[00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:07.520]   Well, a stack of money in your house, but no food means you might have to go out and
[00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:13.080]   face the lines and now you're putting yourself at risk due to the criminal element.
[00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:17.080]   Better to go ahead and have the food stocked up in your house so you don't have to put
[00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:23.240]   your life in danger.
[00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:28.000]   A lot of times also, it's not the money that keeps people from responding to a crisis.
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   It's the lack of a plan, of not knowing where to go.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.920]   Many times, look at hurricanes and there have been some very sad ones.
[00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:36.840]   It was Katrina and it was Ike in Texas.
[00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:44.640]   A lot of times in a hurricane evacuation, people wait and wait and wait to leave because
[00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:46.940]   they don't know where to go.
[00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:49.160]   Because they don't think they can get off work.
[00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:52.680]   They don't think that they can afford to be gone for a few days and so they wait and wait.
[00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:56.420]   But many people that can get off work and can afford to be gone, they just sit and wait
[00:49:56.420 --> 00:49:58.920]   because they don't know where to go.
[00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:00.840]   The key to getting out is get out early.
[00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:04.960]   So if there's a hurricane coming, make sure you have a plan.
[00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:06.320]   My family, I got a plan.
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:08.560]   Okay, hurricane's going to come up coming up from the Gulf.
[00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:10.840]   Well, it means I'm going to head this direction.
[00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:12.160]   Hurricane's coming in from the Atlantic.
[00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:13.200]   I've got the north plan.
[00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:14.200]   I've got the west plan.
[00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:15.200]   I've got the northwest plan.
[00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:16.200]   I've got the south plan.
[00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:17.560]   I'm down here on the tip of the state.
[00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:19.280]   So the south plan is generally not a good idea.
[00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:23.800]   I don't want to get trapped on the keys when a hurricane's coming.
[00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:26.840]   But the point is have some plans out in advance.
[00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:29.820]   And by plan, I mean, okay, my family lives in X city.
[00:50:29.820 --> 00:50:31.480]   It's X number of hours away.
[00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:35.920]   I've got enough gas in the car and a gas stored up that I can put gas in the car.
[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:37.560]   I don't have to stop in lines.
[00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:40.720]   I know that I can put gas in the car and I have reserves in case we get stuck on the
[00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:43.480]   highway in a traffic jam to get where I'm going.
[00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:44.480]   Doesn't take money to do that.
[00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:45.480]   It takes planning.
[00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:49.160]   So by doing the planning when the disaster hits, you're not sitting there paralyzed.
[00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:51.400]   Hopefully, I've never been in this situation.
[00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:56.160]   But from watching and studying a lot of disasters, I hope I'm not sitting there paralyzed saying,
[00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:58.560]   "Oh no, I can't just get out of town."
[00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:04.600]   Leave a day early rather than a day late.
[00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:05.600]   That's one of the key.
[00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:08.680]   So what we're talking about here is ultimately a bug out strategy.
[00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:11.000]   Think of a military withdrawal strategy.
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:14.840]   Bugging out is the term that most popularized by the military.
[00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:15.840]   I don't know where it came from.
[00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:19.760]   I think it came into use most commonly in the '50s when I looked up the etymology of
[00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:21.000]   the word one time.
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:26.080]   But the point is that when you're in a problem situation, you're being overrun by the enemy,
[00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:28.520]   at some point in time, you just say, "Hey, we got to get out.
[00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:30.120]   We got to bug out."
[00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:33.880]   And in most acute disasters, getting out is the key.
[00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:35.720]   So you need different levels of escape.
[00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:38.720]   You need different levels of planning.
[00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:40.480]   Sometimes you need a quick plan.
[00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:41.480]   Forest fire is coming.
[00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:42.480]   We've got 10 minutes.
[00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:47.440]   So you need a 10 minutes to get out plan.
[00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:52.160]   This happened to thousands of people in Fort McMurray a month ago.
[00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:53.760]   So what's the plan?
[00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:55.080]   Written list is really useful.
[00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:56.600]   Think it through if you haven't done it.
[00:51:56.600 --> 00:51:57.600]   Put the kids in the car.
[00:51:57.600 --> 00:51:58.600]   Put the dogs in the car.
[00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:01.120]   If we have time, grab our bug out bags.
[00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:04.120]   If you got it, you should have a bag ready to go with some basic medicine.
[00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:05.640]   If you take medicine, have that ready to go.
[00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:06.640]   Have some basic food.
[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:09.000]   Have some credit cards, some financial papers.
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:10.880]   Have a checklist on the outside of it.
[00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:12.880]   Here, grab the financial papers if we have time.
[00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:14.560]   And you just go down the list with as much time as you have.
[00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:17.200]   So if you've got 10 minutes to go, be on the road in seven.
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:21.280]   But at least then you're on the road in seven with the box of important financial papers
[00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:24.200]   and all the insurance paperwork, the box of family pictures.
[00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:26.800]   Hopefully that stuff's backed up digitally at this point in time.
[00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:28.880]   Still working on my archives.
[00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:32.420]   And you've got toys and food for the kid and formula for your baby if you need it.
[00:52:32.420 --> 00:52:35.480]   Whatever you need to get out in 10 minutes.
[00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:40.920]   You also need to plan for an hour, a couple hours, and be ready to go.
[00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:41.920]   Make sure you don't forget the passports.
[00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:44.160]   Make sure you don't forget the extra credit cards.
[00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:48.080]   Make sure you don't forget the cash, currency.
[00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:49.800]   So you need a quick plan.
[00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:50.800]   You need a slow plan.
[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:53.680]   You need a couple of plans.
[00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:57.360]   It's not that difficult to do.
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:02.120]   One of the things I don't like about all the preparedness people is oftentimes they make
[00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:03.640]   things sound so complicated.
[00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:05.140]   It's not complicated.
[00:53:05.140 --> 00:53:07.520]   You take a bag, like a bug out bag.
[00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:11.560]   If you're interested in bug out bags, I hesitate to say go online as people are obsessed with
[00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:12.560]   the topic.
[00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:13.600]   But it's really not that big a deal.
[00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:17.520]   You take an extra duffel bag or an extra backpack and you toss some stuff in there.
[00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:19.280]   You toss an extra phone charger.
[00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:21.680]   Buy one for five bucks or 10 bucks if you need one.
[00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:23.040]   You put some extra clothes in there.
[00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:26.120]   You put some toys for the kids and a couple of books so they have something to do in case
[00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:27.960]   you get stuck on the road.
[00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:29.040]   You put in some food.
[00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:31.080]   You put some bottled water.
[00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:33.640]   And you put in, it's basically it.
[00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:34.640]   Book of matches.
[00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:36.480]   It doesn't need to be any more elaborate than that.
[00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:39.120]   I mean, some of these guys on the internet, I don't understand it.
[00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:40.800]   It's like, think they're going to fight World War III.
[00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:43.720]   We're talking about leaving in the face of a forest fire.
[00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:45.920]   That's about it.
[00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:47.560]   But it does require a little bit of planning.
[00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:54.460]   But by putting the plan together, when you're facing the circumstance, now all of a sudden
[00:53:54.460 --> 00:53:56.640]   you're ready to go.
[00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:58.640]   And that's the key.
[00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:05.280]   I think that's just about everything I wanted to share with you in today's show.
[00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:14.960]   It's always difficult to know how to restrict the scope of a show appropriately.
[00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:19.400]   The major theme I wanted to convey to you today is that money solves most of your issues
[00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:21.000]   in times of crisis.
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:25.120]   So just think about having access to money and how to set that up.
[00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:28.040]   The vast majority of you can set that up now.
[00:54:28.040 --> 00:54:30.000]   Just takes a little bit of planning.
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:31.000]   Get some currency out.
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:34.700]   Make a habit of keeping more than $3 in your wallet.
[00:54:34.700 --> 00:54:36.200]   Get some currency out.
[00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:40.840]   Secure it somewhere in a safe and concealed location in your house or put it in a safe
[00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:45.480]   deposit box at the bank so you can get to it.
[00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:46.480]   Then go from there.
[00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:47.480]   Call up your bank.
[00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:48.800]   Set up an ATM.
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:53.520]   Order an extra credit card from a different manufacturer, different distributors so that
[00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:55.640]   you have access to a different line of credit.
[00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:56.760]   Maybe call your current ones.
[00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:58.240]   Get the credit lines lifted.
[00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:00.160]   Make sure that you have access to money in times of disaster.
[00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:01.920]   Then you're basically done.
[00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:07.400]   Some of you probably need to drive up to Canada, open up a bank account and put $20,000 in
[00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:08.400]   there.
[00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:10.400]   Pretty simple to do.
[00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:13.760]   But if you need it, it'll be helpful.
[00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:16.200]   So look at situations.
[00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:17.920]   Look at situations like Venezuela.
[00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:21.360]   I'll put some links in today's show notes for articles on Venezuela.
[00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:23.960]   Look at the situations like Fort McMurray.
[00:55:23.960 --> 00:55:24.960]   Think about hurricanes.
[00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:28.160]   Think about a terrorist attack like the shooting in Orlando.
[00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:36.920]   Just ask yourself, what steps can you take should an economic crisis happen?
[00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:39.280]   Should a hurricane come?
[00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:42.520]   What steps can you take now to make things better for them?
[00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:43.520]   Get the passports.
[00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:47.240]   It'll cost you, I don't know, I can't remember what the fees are, $100 or whatever, but get
[00:55:47.240 --> 00:55:49.920]   the passports for you and your kids.
[00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:53.120]   Passport and a credit card gets you out of a lot of problems.
[00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:55.920]   Number one financial preparedness tool that I know of.
[00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:57.920]   Thank you all so much for listening to today's show.
[00:55:57.920 --> 00:55:58.920]   I appreciate it.
[00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:01.800]   I'll be out of town the next couple of days running some interviews for you.
[00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:03.560]   I hope that you find those useful.
[00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:06.800]   When I do interviews, I try to keep them interesting and I hope you find them useful.
[00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:10.120]   If you'd like to support the show, I would greatly appreciate your support.
