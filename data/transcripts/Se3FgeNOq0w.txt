[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.020]   And the advice paradox is the idea that we all get and receive a whole lot of advice
[00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:07.500]   over the course of our lives.
[00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.200]   Most of it is complete garbage.
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.480]   And the more advice you take, the less well-informed you actually are.
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.760]   This is something that's counterintuitive.
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.220]   You think like, oh, I'm just starting out in my life, I need to go and get tons of advice
[00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.280]   from all these different people.
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.800]   And the reality is that for them, most of their maps that they're going to provide you
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.720]   with, the advice that they provide you being the map, are not going to match the terrain
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:30.720]   of your life.
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.040]   Your life is fundamentally very different than whatever it is you're going to encounter.
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.760]   Nassim Taleb talks about this idea of the noise bottleneck in some of his work, which
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.960]   basically says that you assume that by consuming more, you're going to get more signal as a
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:45.960]   result.
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.280]   But the reality is that by consuming more, and in this case, consuming more advice, the
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.200]   ratio of noise to signal actually increases over time.
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.200]   so what you're left with is a worse idea of what the overall answer is.
