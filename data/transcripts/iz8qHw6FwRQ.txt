[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.560]   We're back for another week of answering your tough pastoral and ethical and biblical questions.
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.840]   And today's question comes in to us from Eric in Joliet, Illinois.
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.320]   Pastor John, hello.
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.480]   First Timothy 6.16 says that no one can see God, and yet Matthew 5.8 tells us that the
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.000]   pure in heart will see God.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.040]   Is there a sense in which we will be able to see God in heaven, or is it talking about
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.400]   the incarnate and glorified Christ here?
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.800]   It's a powerful promise, and I want to understand it.
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.320]   Pastor John, what would you say to Eric?
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.000]   So let's put the texts, the ones that he refers to and a few others in front of us, and then
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.160]   see if we can answer the question.
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.960]   First Timothy 6, "He who is the blessed and only sovereign, King of kings and Lord of
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:02.320]   lords, who alone has immortality, who dwells in unapproachable light, whom no one has ever
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.160]   seen or can see, to him be honor and eternal dominion."
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:17.120]   First Timothy 1.17, "To the King of ages, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.120]   and glory."
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.960]   First John 4.12, "No one has ever seen God.
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.200]   If we love one another, God abides in us."
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:34.760]   Exodus 33.20, "He said, 'You cannot see my face, for man shall not see me and live.'"
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:40.880]   Deuteronomy 4.12, "Then the Lord spoke to you out of the midst of the fire.
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.920]   You heard the sound of words, but saw no form."
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.240]   There was only a voice.
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.240]   That's one side.
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.240]   You can't see him.
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:57.240]   And here's the other side, Matthew 5.8, "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.200]   God."
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:06.320]   Genesis 32.20, "Jacob called the name of the place Peniel, saying, 'I have seen God face
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.040]   to face, and yet my life has been spared.'"
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:19.320]   Job 19.26, "And after my skin has been thus destroyed, yet in my flesh I shall see God,
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:25.840]   whom I shall see for myself, and my eyes shall behold and not another," et cetera.
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.480]   So there you have both sides of the issue.
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:36.680]   And the solution to this seeming inconsistency lies in the fact that the word see, as we
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.880]   all know, has several different uses.
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:49.120]   And if you look at all the texts, you see that there are two different senses in which
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:56.360]   his people can see God, and two senses in which they cannot see God.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.680]   So let me break these out and see if people can follow me, see if they can see.
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.800]   First, the ways we cannot see God.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:14.720]   One, we can't see him with our physical eyes for the simple reason he's a spirit, and he
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.720]   doesn't have a body.
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:22.680]   That's probably at least part of what Paul means when he says that Christ is the image
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.260]   of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation.
[00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.400]   Second meaning of what we mean by see, we can't see God.
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:41.580]   We can't see him even spiritually with unmediated directness.
[00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:49.400]   This is partly owing to our sinfulness and partly owing perhaps to our creaturely weakness.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:57.320]   He's too great, too bright, too glorious, and we could not live if we saw him with unmediated
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.320]   directness.
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:04.320]   We must always have Christ our mediator as a go-between.
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:11.960]   And I think that's what Jesus meant when he says in John 6, 45, "It is written in the
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.280]   prophets and they will all be taught by God.
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:23.280]   Everyone who has heard and learned from the father comes to me, not that anyone has seen
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.200]   the father except he who is from God."
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.800]   He has seen the father.
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:38.920]   Now when it says, "Except he who has come from God, he has seen the father," he means
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:44.360]   not with physical eyes, because Jesus, I mean, the son of God didn't have physical eyes before
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.360]   the incarnation.
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.420]   And that's what he's contrasting our seeing with.
[00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:58.660]   Only the son can see the father with non-physical, unmediated, direct seeing.
[00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:08.200]   We cannot see God spiritually the way the son of God in unmediated directness can see
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.280]   him.
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:15.960]   So those are the two ways we can't see God when we use the word "see" in different ways.
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.320]   And here's the two ways we can see God.
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:28.440]   One, we use the word "see" to mean that we finally understand and discern the beauty
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.520]   and glory of God after being blind to it.
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.840]   Like when we say, "Oh, now I see."
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:46.020]   Our soul is tuned in, tuned in to the glory so that the glory of God that shines through
[00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:53.660]   the gospel is seen as glorious and we're no longer spiritually blind to it.
[00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.240]   That's the first way we see him.
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:03.520]   And the second way is that in the narrative of the Bible, we see the glory of God, and
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:11.560]   finally we will see him face to face through Christ by seeing Christ.
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:20.200]   So John 1.14, "And the word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory,
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.080]   glory as of the only son from the father.
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:29.040]   No one has seen God, only the only God who is from the father's side.
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.160]   He has made him known."
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.660]   So we see God by seeing Jesus.
[00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:41.300]   And 1 John 3.2, "We know that when he appears, we will be like him because we will see him
[00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.980]   as he is."
[00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:53.720]   So the implication is pursue purity of heart, purity of faith, purity of life so that our
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:07:00.780]   heart, your heart is able to see God's beauty as what it really is in the scripture.
[00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:09.220]   And so that when he comes or when he calls us in death, we will see him face to face
[00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.800]   and be glorified with him.
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.360]   I have not seen what that will be like.
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:20.980]   Such a glorious promise and a promise with a lot of ramifications for the media that
[00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.480]   we consume in our lives.
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.160]   Thank you, Pastor John.

[00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:46.140]   Well speaking of seeing Christ, how soon is his appearing?
[00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:51.980]   Is Christ's return imminent or is it far off like another thousand years away?
[00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:54.980]   We'll ask Pastor John that question on Wednesday.
