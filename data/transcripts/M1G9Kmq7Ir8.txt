[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480]   If you want to learn about diving down rabbit holes on the internet,
[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.040]   Steph Smith's course that we talked about in my episode with her,
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.520]   there's still a $200 discount for her course called Internet Pipes.
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.360]   If you want to learn really anything huge fan of masterclass,
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.020]   we've partnered with them for a long time.
[00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.360]   I've given it as multiple gifts.
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.000]   There's going to be a holiday promo on the gift guide.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.660]   So I just think it's a really excellent gift,
[00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.040]   especially if you need a last minute idea because you can buy it online.
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.200]   But even if you don't,
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.440]   I think there's so many different things that anyone can learn from there.
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.000]   And then last one that we've given to,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.640]   I think every family member is story worth,
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.780]   which is basically a book that gets built over the year.
[00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.120]   So you send all of these prompts to someone in your family,
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.160]   you know, a parent, a grandparent.
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.960]   They answer these emails and you start to build these amazing stories
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.560]   from your family that you can pass down from generation to generation.
