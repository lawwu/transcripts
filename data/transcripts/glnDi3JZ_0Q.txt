[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160]   Let's learn how to get started with WNB using PyTorch in less than a minute.
[00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.040]   I'm Chris Van Pelt, co-founder of Weights & Biases.
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:14.160]   First, install WNB. Now, let's import our Python client, WANDB, and PyTorch.
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.840]   Next up, we'll initialize a new Weights & Biases run,
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.960]   along with some hyperparameters for this specific experiment.
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.080]   After that, let's set up our PyTorch model and reference WNB.config
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.960]   so that we can reproduce this sweet experiment in the future.
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.880]   We can also pass our model to WNB.watch to automatically log and visualize gradients.
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.480]   Lastly, let's define our training loop and use WNB.log
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.360]   to track our training and validation loss for each epoch.
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.600]   That's it! Seriously!
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.000]   Now you can see the metrics and gradients flowing into your interactive dashboard
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.840]   and your hyperparameters in the runs table.
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.640]   You can also compare different training runs in terms of accuracy in the project dashboard.
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.000]   Try out the code yourself by following the link on screen.
