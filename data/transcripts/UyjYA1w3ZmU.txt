[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.960]   - Welcome to a new week on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.440]   Today's question comes to us from Rasmus,
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.240]   a listener from Denmark.
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.120]   Hello, Pastor John, I love the truth
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.640]   that the fullest joy possible is to be found in God,
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.880]   but there's one angle to it
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.620]   that I don't quite understand yet.
[00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.040]   My question is, when is this true?
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.060]   If I choose not to deny myself and follow Jesus,
[00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.560]   would I have more joy in this life?
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.000]   Or in other words, can we say that the Christian life
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.760]   is the most joyful life here and now?
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.360]   Or do we as Christians deny ourselves
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.840]   the greatest possible joy in this life
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.200]   for greater joy in the life to come?
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.440]   There are verses pointing in this direction,
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.880]   such as 1 Corinthians 15, 19,
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.880]   if in Christ we have hope in this life only,
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.360]   we are of all people most to be pitied.
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.960]   But there are also verses talking about the joy of God,
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.960]   being greater than the riches on earth,
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.520]   such as Psalm 4, verse 7.
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.320]   You have put more joy in my heart
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.320]   than they have when their grain and wine abound.
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.280]   Pastor John, what would you say?
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.160]   - There are two things that we need to grasp
[00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.640]   about Christian joy in this fallen world
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.160]   that I think are going to help resolve
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.200]   his paradox that he sees.
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.200]   First, Paul calls our joy in Galatians 5.22,
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.120]   the fruit of the Holy Spirit.
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.360]   Fruit of the Holy Spirit is love, joy.
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.240]   Christian joy is qualitatively different
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.920]   from the joy and happiness of the world.
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.920]   The joy of the Christian is rooted in our spiritual taste
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.680]   and spiritual sight, worked by the Holy Spirit,
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.200]   of the all-satisfying beauty of God in Christ,
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.240]   especially in the great work of the gospel.
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.040]   And you can see that in 2 Corinthians 3.18
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.900]   and chapter 4, verse 4 and 4, verse 6,
[00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.240]   where Paul says that we behold the glory of the Lord.
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.360]   And he says that the Lord shines into our heart
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.980]   to give the light of the gospel, of the glory,
[00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.560]   the good news of the glory of Christ.
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.320]   So that's what we see spiritually.
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.160]   By the work of the Spirit,
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.120]   this is the deepest root of our joy as a Christian.
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.400]   God frees us from being blinded by the glitzy,
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.680]   fleeting, deceptive pleasures of this world.
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.620]   He frees us from being deceived into thinking
[00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.480]   that the God-ignoring, cotton candy pleasures
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.240]   of the body and the mind are the most satisfying food
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.320]   of the human soul.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.600]   They're not.
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.880]   God gives us eyes, Ephesians 1.17,
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.880]   God gives us eyes, the enlightening of the eyes of our heart
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.760]   to see what is really substantial and rich and deep
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.900]   and beautiful and satisfying and eternal,
[00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.900]   namely the beauty and worth of all that God is for us
[00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.360]   in Christ.
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.360]   So in the new birth, the Holy Spirit gives us new taste buds
[00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.860]   on the tongue of our soul so that 1 Peter 2 says,
[00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.660]   we taste the goodness of the Lord.
[00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.140]   We taste the sweetness of forgiveness of sins.
[00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.660]   We taste the removal of our guilt.
[00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.280]   We taste the removal of God's wrath and our condemnation,
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.620]   the precious experience of being loved by God
[00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.740]   and God being for us and not against us.
[00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.740]   We taste the friendship of the Lord
[00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.740]   and we feel a hundred spiritual pleasures day after day
[00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:00.580]   as God's promises, His sweet promises satisfy our days,
[00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.500]   promises to help us and protect us and comfort us
[00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.540]   and keep us until we're finally home.
[00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.580]   The world doesn't know anything of that.
[00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:13.920]   They don't, they don't know anything.
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.060]   All of that is a miracle.
[00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.820]   All of that is made spiritually tasted
[00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.860]   by the work of the Spirit in our hearts.
[00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.860]   So the joy of the Christian is qualitatively unique
[00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.700]   and distinct from the joy and pleasures
[00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.420]   and happiness of the world,
[00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:38.180]   none of which are based on any spiritual sight
[00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.700]   or taste of God's glory.
[00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:45.460]   The joys of the world do not have God at the bottom
[00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.040]   and therefore they're not able to satisfy the human soul.
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.780]   They're not able to last beyond this world
[00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.760]   and therefore they are going to be profoundly disappointing.
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.420]   But Christian joy has God at the bottom
[00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:04.640]   and therefore is utterly unique and cannot be shaken,
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.800]   can't be taken away at death and is utterly satisfying.
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.540]   Like Jesus said in John 6:35,
[00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:16.100]   "Whoever comes to me will not hunger.
[00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.380]   Whoever believes me will never thirst."
[00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.340]   Our hearts were made for God.
[00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:28.340]   God created us to find our deepest, longest, eternal joy
[00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.740]   in knowing and treasuring Him.
[00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.140]   And therefore Christian joy is better
[00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:37.860]   than the joy of the world.
[00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.300]   And I think that's what is meant by Psalm 4:7.
[00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:48.100]   You have put more joy in my heart than they have
[00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.220]   when their grain and wine abound.
[00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:55.700]   More in the sense of something better and deeper and longer.
[00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.980]   And Psalm 16, 11 says it's in God's presence
[00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:02.900]   is this fullness of joy, pleasures forevermore.
[00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:07.900]   This is a pleasure that the world has never tasted.
[00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.420]   So it's not a matter of quantitative comparison.
[00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.060]   It's a matter of qualitative,
[00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:14.740]   infinite qualitative difference.
[00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.420]   This is supernatural.
[00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.520]   This is given by the Holy Spirit.
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.500]   It's a fruit of the Spirit in our lives,
[00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.500]   enabling us to taste and see the beauty
[00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.500]   and worth of the Son of God.
[00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.900]   We have seen His glory.
[00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:31.500]   Glory as of the only Son from the Father,
[00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:32.940]   full of grace and truth.
[00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:36.100]   So that's the first thing that we need to grasp
[00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:37.100]   about Christian joy.
[00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.180]   It is a fruit of the Spirit
[00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.940]   and therefore it is qualitatively different
[00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.540]   from the joy of those who do not know God,
[00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.300]   don't believe the gospel, don't have the Holy Spirit.
[00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.700]   Now here's the second thing we need to grasp
[00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.500]   about Christian joy.
[00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:59.500]   And that is it regularly brings with it
[00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:04.740]   affliction and trouble and sorrow, more sorrow
[00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:08.380]   than we would have had in this life
[00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:12.340]   if we had chosen not to follow Jesus.
[00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:15.340]   So Paul says in Acts 14.22,
[00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:17.180]   "Through many tribulations,
[00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.940]   we must enter the kingdom of God."
[00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.980]   He doesn't say that about unbelievers.
[00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:24.260]   He says that about believers.
[00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:25.520]   And you can avoid these.
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:29.580]   You can avoid these afflictions by avoiding the kingdom.
[00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:33.740]   So Jesus does not promise His followers
[00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:37.260]   that life gets easier in this world.
[00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.860]   In fact, He defines discipleship
[00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:45.780]   as taking up a cross and denying ourselves.
[00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:50.780]   This means that there are many kinds of earthly pleasures
[00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:55.500]   that Christians will forego by choice
[00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:58.980]   and many sorrows that will come to us,
[00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:03.340]   some by choice, but many not by choice.
[00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:05.980]   And the reason for that is this.
[00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:08.740]   Christians are called to love our neighbors
[00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:11.100]   as we love ourselves.
[00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:15.380]   And this inevitably means a life of sorrow
[00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:20.060]   because we care far more as Christians
[00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:22.860]   for the outcome of other people's lives
[00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:26.100]   than we would have if we were not Christians.
[00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:27.580]   'Cause that's what Jesus had to do.
[00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:29.740]   He said, "Love them as you love yourself."
[00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:34.180]   And when we see these lives ruined by sin,
[00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:36.740]   some close to us, some not so close to us,
[00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:40.620]   it touches us more deeply than it would
[00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:44.180]   if we had chosen not to follow Christ.
[00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:48.980]   Therefore, Christians will inevitably have more sorrow
[00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:51.800]   than if we had not followed Christ.
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.620]   Now, those are the two things we need to see.
[00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:58.060]   And now let's put those together
[00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:02.580]   and ask about these two texts that Rasmus has asked about.
[00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.700]   1 Corinthians 15, 19 says,
[00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:08.780]   "If in Christ we have hope in this life only,
[00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:11.140]   we are of all people most to be pitied."
[00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:13.540]   Now, why would that be true?
[00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:19.800]   Well, it will be true because if Christ is not raised,
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.540]   then the first fact that I mentioned about Christian joy,
[00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:27.420]   namely that it is qualitatively distinct and better,
[00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:28.580]   it's just false.
[00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:33.580]   I mean, we've lived a life of utter delusion as Christians
[00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:36.220]   if Christ is not raised from the dead.
[00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:39.140]   The whole message of the New Testament collapses,
[00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:41.660]   including all of its teachings about joy,
[00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:43.500]   all of its teachings about the Holy Spirit.
[00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:46.260]   It's all bogus and everything I just said
[00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:47.420]   was chatter, chatter, chatter.
[00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:48.580]   It doesn't mean anything.
[00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:51.940]   It's just lips flapping in the wind
[00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:53.840]   if Christ is not raised from the dead.
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:57.380]   We've based our life on a fraud.
[00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:01.140]   And second, if Christ is not raised from the dead,
[00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:04.540]   then we Christians have taken on ourselves
[00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:07.220]   a lot of sorrow and affliction
[00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:12.220]   that we could have avoided if we had just avoided Christ.
[00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:16.080]   So 1 Corinthians 15, 19 is true.
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:19.980]   If in Christ we have hoped only in this life,
[00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:21.580]   in other words, if there's no future life,
[00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:23.060]   if Christ isn't raised from the dead,
[00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:24.780]   if the whole thing is a sham,
[00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:29.260]   then we are of all people most to be pitied.
[00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:33.360]   But Christ has been raised from the dead.
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.840]   The gospel is true.
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:36.780]   The Holy Spirit has been poured out.
[00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:39.260]   Our eyes have been opened to see the truth
[00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.980]   and worth and beauty of Christ in the gospel.
[00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:45.620]   All the joy that we know as Christians
[00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:49.660]   is supernatural and distinct from the joy of the world
[00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:52.620]   because it's the fruit of the Holy Spirit
[00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:55.220]   and has the glory of God at the bottom of it all.
[00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:58.940]   And the sorrows that we take on
[00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:02.700]   because we are Christians are indeed more sorrows
[00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:06.380]   than the world embraces, but they are temporary.
[00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:09.700]   And with Christ's help, the yoke is easy
[00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:11.740]   and the burden is light.
[00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:16.740]   These sorrows will pass away at the end of our lives here.
[00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:21.940]   Our joy will be perfected and it will be plain
[00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:26.940]   that our joy was better and deeper and longer
[00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:30.160]   than the joys of unbelievers.
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.660]   - Really good primer on the precious value
[00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:34.840]   of Christian joy here.
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:36.540]   Pastor John, thank you.
[00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:38.260]   And not to mention an assault
[00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.500]   on the prosperity teaching as well.
[00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:41.340]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:42.620]   Thank you, Erasmus, for the question.

[00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:02.340]   Wednesday, we return to hear from a single mother
[00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:05.700]   and she thinks she has the gift of singleness.
[00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:09.000]   Are single parents obligated to marry?
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.820]   That is an interesting question and that is on Wednesday.
[00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:14.140]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:15.060]   We'll see you then.
[00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:17.640]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:20.220]   (upbeat music)
[00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:30.220]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
