[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.640]   A female listener who wishes to remain anonymous writes in to say this, "Pastor John and Tony,
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:16.160]   thank you for the blessings you provide through Desiring God and APJ.
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.420]   My husband and I have been happily married for 10 years.
[00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.000]   When we were married, I knew he did not desire children, but for the past couple of years,
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.840]   my desire for children has grown significantly.
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.960]   Many friends have prayed for us, and we have prayed together, but we continue to strongly
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.480]   disagree.
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.560]   His lack of desire, my growing desire for the blessing of children."
[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.960]   He's a strong spiritual leader of our home and seeks joy in Jesus daily.
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.480]   Pastor John, do you have any biblical or experiential advice for us in resolving this difficult
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.480]   situation?
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.480]   Yeah.
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:57.880]   Well, go get your husband, or just email him the app or the program, because I'm going
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.400]   to talk to him, and I know his heart can change, because my heart changed.
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.400]   We had four kids.
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.400]   I wanted four kids.
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.120]   I loved them, and we were done, I thought.
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:14.160]   Then along comes the adoption possibility of Talitha at age 50, and I thought, "Oh,
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.160]   my goodness.
[00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.160]   I'm too old.
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.800]   This will never work," and God did a great work in my heart.
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:28.360]   Here are 10 reasons—I'll try to go quick—10 reasons that a man, a husband, should want
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.800]   to be a father.
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.820]   Number one, God created man with this mandate, Genesis 128.
[00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.400]   God blessed them.
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.560]   God said to them, "Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth, subdue it."
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.280]   Now, I'm not saying every man must marry or every man must have children.
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:56.720]   I am saying that God planned that this would be the norm, and God is wise, and God is good.
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.960]   And if we're going to opt out of the norm of filling the earth by having children, we
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:08.280]   should be really sure that we can give a good account to the Lord and not just say, "It
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.160]   wasn't my preference," or something like that.
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:21.120]   God's plan is to fill the earth with image-bearers of his glory, and it is a glorious thing to
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.600]   participate in that.
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.720]   That's number one.
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:31.680]   Number two, not surprisingly, therefore, God says in Psalm 127, verse 3, "Behold, children
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.440]   are a heritage or an inheritance from the Lord.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.240]   The fruit of the womb is a reward."
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:48.120]   Now, the fact that the immediate application of that truth in Psalm 127 is the fact that
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.800]   lots of sons will keep you safe when your enemies are against you—the fact that that's
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.280]   the immediate application does not limit the truth of the statement.
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:06.240]   And I would say that this is true even if every one of your children breaks your heart.
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.800]   It's still true.
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.080]   God does not promise us easy fatherhood.
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:18.080]   He promises us good reward, and that may be through much sorrow.
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:25.580]   There are rewards that can only come through fatherly sorrow.
[00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:34.500]   Number three, there is a glory in having children and grandchildren, and there is a glory in
[00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.520]   having a father.
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.600]   There's glory both ways—having children, having a father.
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.200]   Listen to this from Proverbs 17.6.
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:54.640]   "Grandchildren are a crown of the aged, and the glory of children is their fathers."
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.360]   That's a very, very provocative proverb.
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:07.120]   Grandfathers have a crown in their grandchildren, and the children, this middle generation,
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.060]   have a crown in their fathers.
[00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:17.240]   And the point is, fathering children is a glorious affair in both directions.
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:24.640]   Number four, have you ever considered how amazing it is and how full of significance
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:33.800]   it is that God, the Creator of the universe, has revealed himself as a heavenly Father?
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.240]   This is astonishing.
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.960]   It could have been another way.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:44.800]   It can mean nothing less than—it can mean more, but nothing less than—the glory and
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.920]   the wonder and God-like role of fatherhood.
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:57.840]   God didn't look around the world to find some analogy like fatherhood.
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:58.840]   "Oh, there's a father.
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.160]   I'll call myself a father because then they can relate to that."
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.960]   It's just the other way around.
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:14.760]   He created the world with fatherhood in it so that we would experience what he is like
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.600]   in his fatherhoodness.
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:23.640]   Number five, one of the most compelling reasons for a man to become a father is that in doing
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.600]   so he makes a woman a mother.
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.820]   Of course, you could put it the other way around, that in becoming a mother she makes
[00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.880]   him a father, but that's not the angle right now.
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.680]   We're talking about the glories of fatherhood.
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.500]   There are glories of motherhood.
[00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.500]   Another time.
[00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:48.640]   In having children, a man discovers he's married to a mother, which he wasn't before.
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.240]   This is a glorious thing to be married to a mother.
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:59.520]   You now get to be married not only to a wife, but to a life-bearer, a mother, with all her
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.440]   years of motherhood in front of her.
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:09.600]   If motherhood is a beautiful thing, and it is, how beautiful it is to participate in
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.520]   the making of a mother.
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:19.480]   Six, this man that we're talking to right now, don't know his name, is married to a
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:28.520]   woman who deeply longs to have children, a God-blessed, natural, beautiful longing in
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.200]   her heart.
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:33.080]   What does love mean for this man?
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.280]   Well, here's Ephesians 5, 28.
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:42.680]   Husbands love their wives as their own bodies.
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:49.120]   He who loves his wife loves himself, for no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:54.880]   and cherishes it, just as Christ does the church, because we're members of his body.
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:01.320]   Now, that text is an application of the golden rule to marriage.
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:07.360]   The golden rule says, "Love your neighbor as you love yourself," only it's stronger
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.360]   here.
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:14.960]   This says, "When you love this neighbor who sleeps with you every night, you're loving
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:16.480]   yourself.
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:21.720]   In loving her, you're loving yourself, for she is your own flesh.
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.200]   You are one flesh."
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:28.800]   Therefore, not only does love say, "Treat her as you would like to be treated," if you
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:36.600]   were in her place, longing for children as she does, but love also says, "When she becomes
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:47.520]   joyful in motherhood, this joy will be your joy, because she is you.
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:50.200]   Her joy is your joy."
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:57.120]   What a fatherly pleasure it is to see a woman become a mother.
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:06.280]   If you want overflowing joy, then make your body, that is your wife, a joyful mother of
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.080]   children.
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:15.040]   Seven, in giving his wife children, he loves her in another way as well.
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:19.680]   Proverbs 31, 28, "Her children rise up and call her blessed.
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.200]   Her husband also, and he praises her."
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:29.760]   There is a great blessing in being a woman with children who grow up and finally realize,
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:35.640]   because adolescents aren't all that thankful all the time, they finally realize the preciousness
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:41.680]   of motherhood and call her, they write home from college, having awakened to the reality
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:44.800]   of all those years of sacrifice and gifting.
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.600]   They wake up and they write home and they bless her.
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.060]   They bless her.
[00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:55.840]   This is a gift that every husband should be happily willing to give his wife.
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:06.320]   Eight, as I watched my wife's womb grow with four sons conceived in our home, I was stunned
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:15.360]   repeatedly at the thought, a human life has come into being that never existed before
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.960]   and now will live forever.
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:26.240]   And we, this woman and I, we were God's instruments of creation.
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:33.520]   God just created an everlasting human being by our seed.
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:38.000]   What a wonder, what a calling, what an honor.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:48.160]   Nine, I remember back in the 70s, just before we were having kids, people were discouraging
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:53.240]   larger families because of overpopulation.
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:59.840]   I never bought it, not only because of the math, I didn't buy it because of the math.
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:04.280]   There was another reason, way more basics, and I didn't know about the math, but rather
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:12.160]   I reasoned like this, no, God's calling is not about numbers, but about kinds of people.
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:20.080]   And I said to myself, I aim, God will decide whether I succeed, but I aim to raise children
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:24.640]   who will not burden the world, but bless the world.
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:32.520]   They will not eat the portion of another, they will create portions for others.
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:36.800]   They will be part of world solutions, not world problems.
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:43.120]   So my challenge to husbands is think of having children as a way not of burdening the world,
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.600]   but shaping the world.
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:54.360]   And finally, number 10, in having children, expect to know God as you never knew him before,
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:11:02.840]   and expect to be made more humble, more holy, more mature, more loving, more alive, more
[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:10.120]   far-seeing, more seriously joyful than you could be any other way.
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.120]   Yes, amen.
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:16.840]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thanks for listening to another week of episodes on the podcast.

[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:41.000]   On Monday, Pastor John will field a very interesting question from a young man who wants to know,
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.400]   "If I'm unsure of my salvation, should I be pursuing marriage?
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:49.720]   What are the pros and cons of wrestling with marriage and assurance?"
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:50.720]   That's on Monday.
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:53.280]   I am your host, Tony Reinke.
