[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.320]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and this is a special episode because I just want to thank everyone all
[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:13.360]   200 plus of you for coming out and encouraging me to continue Financial Samurai on the post up next for Financial Samurai less
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.440]   retirement more
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:23.120]   Entrepreneurship, it's been a really really interesting summer because I've been gearing up for figuring out what to do on Financial Samurai
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.460]   After hitting the 10-year anniversary mark on July
[00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.000]   2019
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.080]   Basically, the decision was to keep on going or sell over the years
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.360]   I've had many many offers to buy Financial Samurai and I've
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:43.320]   Said no because I wanted to hit that 10-year mark because that was my promise and I don't break my promises
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.880]   And so now after the 10-year mark, I was thinking well now that I'm a dad
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:53.400]   I'm in a different stage in my life in my finances. Maybe I can let my baby go
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.640]   But I always feel bad. I always feel guilty about
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.780]   Selling your baby because who does that who sells their own children?
[00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.960]   Not me. I don't plan to do that. But I think there's always a price for everything
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.760]   No matter how much you think you want to hold on
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.960]   So it's been tough for me
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:13.580]   and
[00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.860]   one of the things I want to do is help other people get to that 10-year mark because I truly believe if you can get
[00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.400]   To that 10-year mark no matter what you're doing. You're gonna be successful
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:29.000]   You're gonna surprise yourself on the upside too many of us quit way before that mark way before our efforts
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.720]   give us some feedback and give us some results and I think that's a really darn shame and
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:41.120]   so when I spent about triple triple the amount of time trying to put together that post on achieving a
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.120]   10-year goal. I was surprised to be frank
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.920]   I was really surprised how there were only about 15 comments in over the first 24 hours
[00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.680]   Versus 30 comments on average and I started to think to myself
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.660]   And what's the point? What's the point of trying so hard when nobody really cares?
[00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:05.380]   And I think this is the reason why a lot of people don't try their best because they're afraid of rejection
[00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.600]   They're afraid that just people don't give a damn. Everybody's so busy with their lives. I understand it
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.100]   You know as a dad, I feel I'm suffocating for time and energy, which is why I wish I had my son
[00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:23.020]   Seven eight years earlier when I was in my early 30s. We're all trying to climb up the corporate ladder or
[00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:31.340]   Stop neglecting our spouses or thinking about ways to keep in touch with our parents more because life always gets in the way
[00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.480]   So what are you gonna do?
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.720]   You can spend time commenting on financial samurai instead of doing all those other important things
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.720]   Of course not and I understand it
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.200]   But still I cannot defy the way I felt and I know I'm being a little bit melodramatic
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.680]   Wondering is there anybody out there?
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:53.220]   But that's how I felt and you can't deny how people feel and this is why I encourage all of you guys to give more
[00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.480]   Love more encouragement to your friends and the people you really care about
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.000]   I remember when I was in my 20s trying to survive the banking world in New York City
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.800]   I'd get in at 5 30 a.m. I leave at 8 30 p.m. Gain a lot of weight got plantar fasciitis
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.960]   I got tremendous amount of allergies my
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.160]   Heart my body was just breaking down
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:21.320]   But whenever I got that email that one sentence email of encouragement from just a colleague or some boss
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.240]   In a different department just thanking me for something something small
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:33.020]   It just gave me tremendous amount of motivation and I think it'll give all of us tremendous amount of motivation if we just recognize effort
[00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.760]   But regardless of what happened
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.880]   I always try to see the positives of every bad situation or every less than ideal situation
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.940]   I'm a super optimist and I hope you guys look at things in an optimistic light as well
[00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:52.240]   and so the upside for not caring or not having that much feedback is that
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:58.600]   Simply I can start focusing on monetizing financial samurai guilt-free and with joy
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:05.640]   So for 10 years, I've been operating financial samurai under the formula of 90% fun
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.520]   10% business I started the site right in 2009 when I still had a job
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.200]   So I didn't really need any money
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:18.280]   And I just wanted to find a cathartic way to get over the financial crisis because I was losing so much money
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:25.400]   I didn't really think about monetizing financial samurai because I just wanted to write right from the heart write stories
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.000]   Connect with other people who might be going through the same thing
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.280]   I was going through and it felt so good to build this little community
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:39.360]   And so over the years I kept to that formula and I think that's the formula that has worked to get me here
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.880]   But it probably won't work to get me where I want to go and over the 10 years
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.360]   It's been awesome hearing from many of you
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:54.480]   from those of you who started reading when you were in college to now being in your early 30s with a family with a home and
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.880]   Getting your finances, right?
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:01.560]   and to those of you who are in your 70s who've been reading since your 60s and how
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.720]   You know your children have grown up to become independent adults and have their own children
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:13.640]   It's been wonderful wonderful to read all your feedback and all your encouragement and it's what keeps me going
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:18.840]   but something changed in 2017 it was the birth of my son and
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.680]   that formula of 90% fun and
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.120]   10% business
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:31.160]   Started to change a little bit. Why because I really believe that no matter how much money you have
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:37.400]   As soon as you see your son or your daughter and you hold him or her in your hands
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:44.720]   Things will change. I think every new parent feels a visceral need to make more money to provide for their family
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.520]   It's just part of our DNA to ensure the survival of our species
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.640]   and there's a great great quote called have children and the money will come and
[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:59.120]   The reason is is because you just get motivated to be provider unless you're some
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:05.600]   Abnormal person who doesn't care about your offspring. You're probably gonna work harder
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:11.640]   You're probably gonna eat better and you're probably gonna be a little bit more attentive and caring because you need to make it work
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:19.320]   So for 10 years, I've been feeling a little bit guilty trying to monetize financial samurai. I don't want to read boring stuff
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:20.760]   I don't want to listen to boring stuff
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:26.840]   I just want to write and speak about things that I'd be interested in and that I think you guys would be interested in
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:35.040]   But what I realized after the lack of feedback from the 10-year anniversary post is that I shouldn't really think
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.280]   so
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.480]   deeply about what you guys all think of me and
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:48.240]   This is the problem that I think we all face. We worry about what other people will think about us and what we do
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:53.840]   Instead we need to understand what our own principles are what our own goals are
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:07:01.240]   be aware of the feedback of others, but then follow our path because we are all individuals and
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:05.280]   My number one goal now is to provide for my family
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:10.600]   So that at least my son can grow up to be a happy independent adult again
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:11.440]   My wife doesn't work
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:17.720]   So I have all the pressure to manage our finances and manage any type of passive or active income
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:21.840]   We generate so we can live the life that we want and this is one of the main
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:26.320]   Problems of living in one of the most expensive cities in the country if not
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:32.980]   The most expensive city in the country San Francisco is that it just takes so much to get ahead
[00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:39.160]   There's a latest economic report from one of the big brokerage houses that you need
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:43.280]   $343,000 and change as a
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:50.180]   Minimum household income to afford the median priced home in San Francisco about 1.6 to 1.7 million
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:55.320]   Think about it. You need a minimum of three hundred forty three thousand. That's nuts
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:59.840]   I thought that okay with a family of three, maybe 250 would be enough
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:06.720]   But I'm clearly very very short and I like challenges. I like goals, but I thought that was kind of nuts
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:12.520]   But you know what instead of hating on the data and saying that's crazy. That's ridiculous and object
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:16.720]   You know objecting to the data. I'm just gonna embrace it and I'm gonna say you know what I
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:21.200]   Need to make more to provide for my family because that's what the data says
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:28.080]   Regardless of our lifestyle regardless of our budget. Let's give it a go. So in order for us to close that
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:31.440]   $100,000 retirement income gap
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:38.000]   We need to generate an additional two and a half million in after-tax capital up to
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.720]   6.7 million in after-tax capital based on a withdrawal rate or return rate of
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:52.880]   1.5% to 4% so the decline in the 10-year bond yield which is the risk-free rate down to 1.5% is really a bummer for
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.920]   retirees or those who want to retire and
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:03.200]   Just thinking about trying to accumulate an extra 6.7 million in capital sounds nuts. That's crazy
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:09.200]   So at this pace, we're never gonna be able to be comfortable retiree, right if we think about needing
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:13.120]   $350,000 of investment income, but hey
[00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:20.200]   Why not dream big because it takes the same effort to dream big as it does to dream small and if the bigger you dream
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:25.140]   The more you'll try to figure out ways to get there. You might not get there. You might not get there ever
[00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:32.760]   But you'll probably get farther than the person who doesn't dream big and that was one of my main takeaways from my 10-year
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:38.860]   To success post so I thought about it in the hot tub and I was thinking how am I gonna get to that number?
[00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:45.480]   how am I gonna make up for this huge gap that these economists and real estate folks are now telling me and
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:48.880]   That is to simply try to monetize financial samurai more
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:56.980]   So instead of going the 90/10 split of fun and business, I'm gonna try to do the 70/30 split
[00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:02.400]   Maybe 60/40, but I'm gonna start 70/30 for the first year and see how it goes after one year
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:10.300]   I'm not gonna make a 10-year operating goal anymore because that is just too much at my stage in my life with what I've got
[00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:16.360]   Going on, but I think 70/30 is a great balance because something else there's something else that I realized that I wanted to share with
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:23.380]   You guys all the largest sites in the world or at least in America the personal finance sites
[00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:29.740]   Have a formula of more like 10% fun and 90% business
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:33.640]   I'm talking about the most boring stuff you could ever read
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:40.360]   But the reality is that the most boring stuff you could ever read is the stuff that does the best
[00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.820]   It's quite a conundrum
[00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:48.120]   But you know, that's not entirely true after I talked to several other folks in in the industry
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:51.320]   There's a little bit of an optical illusion going on
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:56.680]   So I'm comparing apples to oranges. So financial samurai is an organically driven
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:02.880]   Website so all the traffic is not paid. It's organically driven through search or word-of-mouth or
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:08.800]   Just me doing a guest post on a larger site and that's how I gain traffic and that's pretty cool
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:14.280]   I don't have to spend tons and tons of money what someone told me and it's quite a light bulb moment
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:16.880]   Is that look the most boring?
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:22.640]   article you read might be very popular, but it has a lot a lot of
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:29.920]   Marketing dollars behind it to make it popular and that's what I was thinking. Oh, yeah, that's right. I did some consulting at some
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:36.240]   FinTech startups in their marketing department. They spent like fifty thousand hundred thousand five hundred thousand dollars to boost their
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:41.700]   Their articles and their products. So why am I trying to compete with them?
[00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:49.440]   But the thing is, you know what they're they're successful and if I want to grow I need to take some of that success and
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.080]   Formulate it into my own
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:58.720]   So I think 70/30 is a good start and that means a little bit more sponsored posts a little bit more guest posts a little bit
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:04.260]   More review posts on products that I think will help the listeners in the community in essence
[00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:10.240]   I want to try to create a financial supermarket where I highlight things that could be useful
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:17.480]   to different folks and different stages of their financial journey instead of just me as a father of one maybe to
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:21.560]   Try to live an expensive lifestyle in expensive, San Francisco
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:24.080]   So boom, there it is
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:29.200]   This was the awesome takeaway from the silence of that post
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:37.600]   To be able to shift shift gears change the formula do something that I've been guilty about trying to do for so long
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:42.800]   But now that I need to do because I'm a father so you see there's always a positive
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:48.880]   There's always a positive to something you think is negative, but really there's some great things that could happen
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:50.560]   And I think with this new formula
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:56.560]   It's gonna be synergistic because it's not like the two thousand plus articles that I've written over the past ten years goes away
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:01.960]   This new type of content with new writers and new perspectives is going to provide
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:09.920]   Synergistic benefits for all readers. So I hope you welcome me on this journey and encourage me and let me know
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:13.840]   Are there any products out there you want me to talk about are there any?
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:18.880]   Industries or things that maybe I just haven't focused on that
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:25.760]   I should address because I'm always interested in learning because learning is something that just is just part of me and that's something that I
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:29.400]   Want to do and help other people learn because the more we know I think the more we can make
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:37.360]   Educated decisions on our financial journey. The reality is I'm gonna still write and share with you guys what I think
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:42.380]   No holds barred. Okay, I'm gonna try to be a little bit more PC and less offensive
[00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:45.820]   I do realize that sometimes I can be a little bit too opinionated
[00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:51.340]   But I'm gonna have my voice and I'm gonna have different types of voices and styles as well
[00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:52.240]   I think it's gonna be fun
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:58.960]   So hopefully you guys can come along on the journey and help make it happen for all of us. Thanks so much
