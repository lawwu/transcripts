[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.840]   We are back one more time with Eric Mason, a church planner who lives and ministers in
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.600]   the heart of Philadelphia.
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.160]   He's the co-founder and lead pastor of Epiphany Fellowship, and he's a husband, father, and
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.600]   the author of the book, Manhood Restored, How the Gospel Makes Men Whole.
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:25.400]   Eric, yesterday you talked about how and why you explain manhood to the men in your neighborhood
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.000]   who don't have these fundamental categories to work from.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.520]   How is godly manhood different from cultural macho-ness?
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:39.000]   Well, we would look at cultural macho-ness, we would connect that more to Genesis 3, the
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   fall.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.040]   We would say that cultural macho-ness is just man emphasizing the fact that he's responding
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.520]   rightly to the curse.
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.120]   You know, the whole he will try to, he will dominate.
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.560]   It's a reflection of domination, and it's a reflection of more of external persona versus
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.960]   internal reality.
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:10.240]   And so the whole cultural macho thing is just really a caricature and an attempt for man
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.440]   to put on paraphernalia of manhood versus being a man.
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.160]   That's a powerful way to put it.
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.720]   I want to talk about the local church now.
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.320]   A remarkable point in your book is how you tie the gospel's mission to strong biblical
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.320]   manhood.
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:32.200]   On page 165, you talk about the risk-less environment of a lot of churches not on mission
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.800]   and how that actually creates a boredom among the men.
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.400]   Explain how manhood and mission are connected in local churches.
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.760]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.840]   One of the big things that I'm learning, from being a church planter, I've seen the impact
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.320]   of vision casting and what it has on men and people giving their lives to a cause.
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.320]   I mean, and this is true of women too, but it's even more true of men because I do believe
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:03.520]   that God has given man sort of this conquering desire that's redeemed, that can be redeemed
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.520]   through Jesus Christ.
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:11.000]   And when you present men who, and Carl Ellis talks a lot about this in his dissertation
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.160]   that's going to get published on the difference between social concerns and core cultural
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:24.720]   concerns and how men are very, he talks about how men are very much drawn to cultural concerns,
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.040]   not just relational concerns, social concerns.
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:33.240]   And so one of the things that I think vision casting does, and global vision casting, not
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.320]   just community, even though I'm in the inner city, so I believe in doing community ministry.
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.320]   We do it.
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:45.200]   But we're also building a school and helping empower pastors in Malawi to do church planting
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.720]   movements and to engage their own people in Malawi and Uganda with the gospel.
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:56.520]   And so with that in mind, as men are drawn basically to a broader vision than just the
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:02.680]   pastor's personal vision or a local church's personal vision in their neighborhood, I think
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.520]   that it's phenomenal, phenomenal, phenomenal for pastors to think through a lot of the
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.320]   reasons why some men aren't at the church because we have very small God-sized visions.
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.880]   Yeah, that's a fascinating connection that you make, and you do a great job explaining
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.440]   this in the book.
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.200]   Fatherlessness is, of course, a major problem faced in our culture, but fatherlessness,
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.600]   you write, can also be manifested with a dad who's in the house who simply neglects the
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.440]   needs of his family.
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.960]   And I think this is my biggest fear as a husband and a father of three.
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.800]   I never feel like I've done enough.
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.760]   What are some warning signs that signal that a father is maybe physically there, but he's
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.160]   not engaged like he should be?
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.880]   What would you be looking for?
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:48.880]   You know, it's interesting.
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.680]   I read this book, Fatherless America, and it has different categories of fatherlessness
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.400]   in it, which is mind-boggling.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:03.280]   And I was watching The Incredibles with my kids one day, and I'll never forget, and
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.760]   this thing sounds weird, but it's going somewhere.
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.720]   One day, Mr. Incredible came home, and he was living a mediocre life or whatever.
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.200]   He wasn't Mr. Incredible anymore.
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:20.000]   And his mom was at the table, and she's like, "It's interesting they made her an elastic
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   girl or whatever."
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.920]   And she's trying to manage all of these different things, but even with her being so elastic
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.480]   and being able to break the kids up from fighting at the table and all of this, and he had walked
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.360]   away and was doing something else, and she asked him to engage.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:41.440]   I never forgot that because I looked at that as an example of how a father—and you saw
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.920]   the impact on the children and especially his daughter, the impact of him not engaging
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:47.920]   in his family.
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:53.480]   And I think that men need to recognize it because one of the things that especially
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:05:00.840]   suburban men of different ethnicities can fall into the trap of is because they provide—or
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:07.160]   blue-collar men as well—because we provide and we work hard, that's enough for the family.
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.960]   And the issue is it's not enough to just work, then come home and sit because you're
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.560]   drained from being able to engage your family.
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:22.040]   Now one of the things that men have to do is they have to have moments in time regularly
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.960]   during the week in which they're specifically engaging and knowing where their kids are.
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.640]   Sometimes we'll eat in front of the TV, but other times we'll eat at the table.
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.360]   I know people got different views on that, but eating at the table is not just eating
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.480]   at the table because you can still be present.
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:41.440]   Asking them about their day, specifically engaging them and having a trajectory for
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.600]   their spiritual formation and development.
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:49.680]   That is so—that's why I spent a chapter on vision, just really—actually it's within
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.400]   the family chapter, working on that idea of vision because most men can't communicate
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.120]   a vision that they have for their household.
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.160]   They just say, "I want my kids to be good kids and I want my wife.
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.560]   I want to—even good Christian men will say, 'Man, I just want my wife.
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.560]   I want to have a great marriage.'"
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:04.560]   What's the plan?
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.560]   That doesn't just happen.
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.600]   The Bible says the plans of a man are established by the Lord.
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.640]   That means God is sovereign, but He sovereignly works with plans.
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:19.840]   So plans are put—that's why I said the plans belong to man, but the answer from the
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.560]   tongue belongs to the Lord because man has been given the responsibility under the sovereignty
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.520]   of God to plan.
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:34.120]   For me, that's something that men have to practically work on because most men are being
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.440]   hit at by their wife, "Baby, can you leave?
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:40.840]   Baby, can you—" and it's like, man—and they see it as a nag, but the reason why they're
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.560]   getting nagged is because they don't have a plan.
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.480]   That was Eric Mason, a church planner who lives and ministers in the heart of Philadelphia
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.080]   with a good closing exhortation for us dads.
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:54.640]   Eric is the co-founder and lead pastor of Epiphany Fellowship, and he's a husband and
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:59.400]   a father and the author of the book titled "Manhood Restored, How the Gospel Makes Men
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:00.400]   Whole."
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:04.680]   Well, we are now going to break for the weekend, and to all of the fathers out there who are
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:08.760]   listening, have a wonderful Father's Day weekend, and we will see you on Monday on
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.480]   the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:11.480]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.080]   We'll see you then.
