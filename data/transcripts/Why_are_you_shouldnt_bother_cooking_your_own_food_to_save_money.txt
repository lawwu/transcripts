[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.220]   Hello everybody it's Sam from Financial Samurai and in this episode I want to
[00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.420]   talk about why you shouldn't bother cooking your own food to save money. And
[00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:15.180]   wow I got a lot of interesting feedback after I published my post because Google
[00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.700]   on its Android operating system, so the mobile phone system, picked up the post
[00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.820]   and started blasting it out to like 50,000 readers for some reason. I don't
[00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.140]   know why but it did. And so I got a lot of non-regular listeners and readers
[00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.300]   commenting some nasty things on the website and I thought this was fun. It
[00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.940]   was interesting and I enjoy this type of criticism and different points of view.
[00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.180]   I'll save the quotes, the nasty quotes, for some other time or for those of you
[00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.900]   who want to read it in the comment section. But the basic feedback is
[00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:54.100]   spending $500 per person a month is ridiculous. And here are some fun quotes.
[00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.260]   Who pays $2,100 a month for food? That's so ridiculous maybe they're buying all
[00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.820]   the avocado toast. This is for a family of four. How much are they spending a
[00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.900]   month on food? Oh just as much as some families entire income. Cool. $70 a day
[00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.780]   for food for four people? Four question marks. They're spending $500 a week on
[00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.940]   food? I spend $60 a week for one person. Another quote. I'm literally upset if I
[00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:29.660]   spend more than 10 bucks a day on food. Spending around 30 is a legit luxury. And
[00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:34.780]   it just goes on and on and on and it's actually quite entertaining. But the
[00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.420]   greatest irony is that over 70% of Americans are considered overweight
[00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:45.300]   today. Meanwhile 40% of Americans are considered obese. Yet today 82% of the
[00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.780]   meals Americans eat are prepared at home according to research from NPD Group
[00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:57.740]   Incorporated. It's a strategy research group. So like yo, if 70% of Americans are
[00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.180]   overweight and will likely die earlier than they should as a result, perhaps
[00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.100]   these food budget complaints don't have much merit. Add on the fact that the
[00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.140]   typical American has less than a hundred thousand saved for retirement and maybe
[00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.420]   we definitely shouldn't care what other people think when it comes to how much
[00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:22.700]   we spend on food. So I just wanted to share why maybe you should reconsider
[00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:29.020]   the way you prepare food, eat food, spend time making food and so forth if you so
[00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.020]   happen to be one of the 70% of people who are not too healthy and if you so
[00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.060]   happen to not have too much in your retirement savings account. I really
[00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:44.460]   don't want to judge or care how you eat or how you save and invest. We all have
[00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.740]   the freedom to do whatever the hell we want. I'm just providing a different
[00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.700]   perspective and I think if we can offer different perspectives we tend to learn
[00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.500]   more and improve our lives. So I'm gonna argue why cooking your own food more
[00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.420]   than 50% of the time to save money is a suboptimal financial decision. Look this
[00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.580]   is Financial Samurai. We're here to try to build our wealth and ultimately our
[00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:15.220]   happiness and our lifestyles. So keep in mind these goals before I continue. So
[00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.940]   one, your time is valuable. It doesn't make much sense to come home from a long
[00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.940]   day's work and spend an hour cooking a rubber chicken dinner. Yuck! You should be
[00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.700]   using this time to unwind, play with your kids, develop a better relationship with
[00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.260]   your spouse or work on your side hustle. Calculate how much you make an hour. Now
[00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.420]   multiply that hourly rate by how long it takes you to cook a meal. This may be the
[00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:46.380]   true cost of your meal. Two, your marriage is valuable. We know the percentages
[00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:52.940]   right? 50% of marriages end in divorce in America and it's probably because one
[00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.860]   person neglects the other person, takes the other person for granted. You know
[00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.860]   unless you make cooking together a fun activity, spending time cooking while
[00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.580]   your partner is doing something else like sitting on the sofa watching TV may
[00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.340]   be harmful to your relationship. In fact the person slaving over the stove might
[00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.620]   start resenting the partner who is doing something else more relaxing. So don't
[00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.940]   underestimate the level of resentment the person doing most of the household
[00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.500]   activities may have for the one who isn't. Resentment is definitely one of
[00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:31.780]   the key reasons for divorce. Three, your toddlers grow up quickly. It is true you
[00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.420]   turn around and whoa they're an adult. Let's say you come back from work at 6
[00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.300]   p.m. after leaving the house at 7 a.m. Your young children leave for school at
[00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.780]   let's say 745 a.m. because your partner drives and then they go to bed at 830
[00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.620]   p.m. After not seeing your little one all day do you really want to then spend
[00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.580]   more time away from them by cooking once you get home? Of course not. A loving
[00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.940]   parent would muster up his or her remaining energy to spend time with
[00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.900]   their children. Besides you're not going to willingly invite toddlers into the
[00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:08.820]   kitchen while cooking over a hot stove due to the risk of injury. Four, you're not a
[00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:14.300]   professional cook. Sorry to say I don't care how well you think you cook and how
[00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:20.620]   awesome your spaghetti meatballs are. It's probably okay and your family and
[00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.340]   partner are like "it's pretty good, better not say anything negative or else
[00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.920]   that's really really gonna piss off mom or dad whoever's cooking." The reason why
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:33.020]   you go to see a doctor when something is wrong is that the doctor has had years
[00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.580]   of specialized training. You may be able to self-diagnose by googling but it's
[00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:42.420]   probably better to see someone who treats big boils all day long. Not only
[00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:46.800]   are you losing an hour of your time preparing a meal but your meal probably
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.340]   look it probably won't taste as good. I know so many people say I cook the best
[00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.260]   food ever but it's probably not as good as a professional cook who does it for a
[00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:01.140]   living. Five, you're too generous with the ingredients. If most people eat at home
[00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:05.100]   to save money and also believe that cooking at home is healthier, there has
[00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:09.540]   to be a problem with the way we cook given most Americans are overweight. Home
[00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:13.660]   cooks are likely adding too many unhealthy ingredients to their food
[00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:18.500]   preparations or they're just cooking way too much and then they don't know how to
[00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:24.780]   portion control. So there has to be something going on here and it's one of
[00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:28.940]   these reasons folks. You can't deny at least with food delivery and restaurants
[00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:34.260]   they portion out their meals so you don't eat too much. After all they've got
[00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:38.340]   profit margins to protect. You've seen those funny restaurant pictures where it
[00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:42.380]   looks like you know you're gonna starve to death after you eat that that little
[00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:47.900]   scallop but it cost $25 but it's for the presentation and the show and the wow.
[00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:52.780]   Restaurants and food delivery companies have profit margins so they're not gonna
[00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:57.260]   give you all the food you can eat. Six, you might injure yourself. This is a
[00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:02.460]   really big one. Think about all the times you sliced a finger, felt your eyes
[00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:06.980]   burning, chopping onions, or splattered boiling water on your hand when you
[00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:12.580]   dumped ravioli into the pot too enthusiastically. Ouch! Some injuries take
[00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:19.380]   weeks to heal and if you said hey I'll give you a hundred bucks if I chop your
[00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:25.540]   finger I'll say no thank you. So on the same lines, seven, you need your hands to
[00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:30.180]   play and earn. If you slice your index finger you probably won't be able to
[00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:33.820]   effectively swing a racket or a bat for at least a couple of weeks and that
[00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:37.700]   would really stink for me because I love playing tennis and softball three times
[00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:42.340]   a week. It's my joy, it's my physical outlet, it makes me happy. If you
[00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:45.980]   accidentally pound your thumb while you're pounding your meat, any type of
[00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:51.540]   work that requires typing will probably be at risk and guess what all desk jobs
[00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:55.980]   require typing. Even if you injure yourself only once out of every let's
[00:07:55.980 --> 00:08:02.020]   say 20 times you cook, that's 5%, it's not worth the risk. Besides being out of
[00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:08.860]   commission for a while, injuries hurt. Ouch, ouch, ouch. Eight, food delivery apps are in
[00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:13.900]   abundance. Hey guess what we live in the internet age since 2009 there have been
[00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:18.860]   a plethora of new food delivery apps to use. They are battling each other like
[00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:25.140]   crazy and they have tremendous amount of venture capital funding. I think DoorDash
[00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:29.060]   just raised another like billion dollars or something and they're now worth 13
[00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:34.060]   billion. There's like Grubhub, E24 which was bought and sold, there's Uber Eats,
[00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:38.980]   it's just non-stop. These apps have effectively infiltrated your city's best
[00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:43.300]   restaurants and now offer every type of food you can think of. You don't have to
[00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:47.740]   get an artery-clogging artisan double cheeseburger, you can get you know
[00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:52.660]   celery with some lettuce and some tomatoes at your doorstep in 45 minutes.
[00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:59.180]   You can order as healthy as you want so don't use food delivery as an excuse and
[00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:02.620]   say that it's just unhealthy, it's just not true. It's only unhealthy if you
[00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:08.460]   choose unhealthy foods to order to bring to your house. So to not take advantage
[00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:12.940]   of technology would be a shame. It's just like not taking advantage of
[00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:16.780]   technology by not starting your own website in the internet day and age. I
[00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:21.260]   mean why not brand yourself online, showcase your talents and get rich off
[00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:26.460]   yourself? Why let Facebook and Twitter get rich off you? No, get rich off
[00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:32.660]   yourself. Okay, nine, going out to eat spices things up. Yes it does. Food is one
[00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:37.300]   of the main best ways to bring people together. Not only can you take your
[00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:42.300]   partner out for a romantic date, but you can also invite your family and friends
[00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:46.300]   out to bond and if you pay for the meal the other side will greatly appreciate
[00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:50.460]   it and may potentially provide a much greater reward in the future. I love
[00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:54.440]   going out to eat with friends. It's just fun, it's a new adventure, it makes me
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:58.940]   happy, it's good social gathering and I think you'll enjoy it too. Alright number
[00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:03.020]   ten, no need for a cleanup. Not only do you not have to spend time preparing
[00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:07.420]   your food by ordering delivery or going out to eat, but you also don't have to
[00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:11.740]   spend time cleaning up after yourself either. Less cleanup means less money
[00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:17.860]   spent on sponges, more room for trash and a longer life for your furniture and
[00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:24.180]   utensils. Eleven, no need to spend as much time grocery shopping. I don't know if
[00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:28.420]   anybody likes grocery shopping. I think that's why there's like grocery shoppers
[00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:32.860]   who do it for you. It's all about coming up with a list and getting in and out as
[00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:37.260]   quickly as possible. I like to spend like 10 minutes and that's it.
[00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.820]   Grocery shopping is like doing a chore because you've got to drive to the
[00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:45.460]   grocery store, look for the items, wait in line at cash register and then drive
[00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:49.380]   home. Every time I go I always text my wife, "Hey do you need anything?" hoping
[00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:53.180]   she'll say, "Nope I don't need anything." But she always says, "Oh I've got a great
[00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:57.700]   list. It's like 10 things." I'm like, "No and I don't know where to get that organic
[00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:01.340]   bread. Are you kidding me? Why does everything have to be organic? Organic
[00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:06.100]   blueberries, raspberries, come on." But I got to do it as a good husband should. Oh
[00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:11.860]   and hopefully you don't get any annoying door dings in the parking lot or a
[00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:17.620]   ticket either. I've got door dings left and right and man, that's just part of
[00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:22.980]   life. Okay number 12. You're not out there winning business. If you are in a
[00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:26.640]   marketing or sales role then it should be your mission to go out to eat with as
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:31.300]   many clients and prospective clients as possible. Your firm should pay for all
[00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:35.340]   your meals and entertainment outings and if you want to save money order extra
[00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:40.060]   and bring leftovers home. I did this constantly when I was working in
[00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:45.420]   finance and I made it a mission to take out a client at least once a week and I
[00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:48.580]   knew that I'd also get a free meal and I'd bring some back. It was awesome.
[00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:52.140]   Everybody won. Even if you have to pay for the food yourself with a dining
[00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:55.980]   rewards card. You should actively take interesting people out each week who
[00:11:55.980 --> 00:12:00.060]   can boost your network. And the final reason why you shouldn't spend so much
[00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:05.820]   time cooking at home is that you fall into a scarcity mindset. One of the most
[00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:10.140]   important ways to get wealthy is by adopting the abundance mindset. You want
[00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:15.500]   to go build your wealth by making more money not by saving more money. Look we
[00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:19.340]   should all save but there's only so much you can save right? You should be out
[00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:23.020]   there trying to figure out how to get a promotion, doing more for your boss,
[00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:27.820]   working on a side business, figuring out how to invest better and so forth. It's
[00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:32.740]   much easier to get wealthy making more money folks. You can only save so much
[00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:39.860]   and it's just that's it. 50%, 60%, 70% okay put that on autopilot. You got to
[00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:45.700]   really focus on investing and making other engines of income. As you get older
[00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:49.740]   your number one goal should be to win back as much time as possible to do
[00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:55.020]   things that bring you the most happiness. If that thing is cooking then cook all
[00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:59.300]   day if you want but I think for most people they have other things that bring
[00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:03.780]   them more happiness. If you want to cook at home do so during the holidays. The
[00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:09.460]   holidays are the best. No homemade meal feels better than during Thanksgiving or
[00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:13.460]   Christmas. Now those are special times where cooking at home is absolutely
