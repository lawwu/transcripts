[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.200]   I am going to talk to you about asset allocation.
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.620]   So we've been through what I called primordial asset allocation, where you're thinking about
[00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.980]   things like an emergency fund and so on.
[00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:25.520]   Alan covered the basics of investing, Rick covered investment selection, Mike talked
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.680]   about tax-advantaged investing.
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:34.400]   I'll talk about apportioning your assets across different investment types and the key considerations
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.900]   to bear in mind when you do.
[00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.840]   So there are really two key jobs that you need to bear in mind when you're setting an
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.520]   asset allocation.
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.760]   And I think they can be helpful because asset allocation, the way it's often discussed to
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.680]   me seems terribly black boxy, but it really requires you to do two key things to find
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.880]   yourself in the right asset allocation ballpark.
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:03.000]   The first would be to take a step back and think about why you are investing, so being
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.240]   clear on what your goals are.
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:11.480]   And the second is to kind of take a look inside and think about how you have behaved in previous
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.680]   market environments.
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:20.320]   If you've had investments, how you felt in sort of that March 2020 period that Alan alluded
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:27.200]   to earlier, where we saw our worlds turned upside down very quickly, the markets plummeted,
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.920]   it didn't feel like a great time to invest.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.120]   In hindsight, it was a great time, but many people were retreating to safe investments
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.000]   during that period.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.360]   So thinking a little bit about what's called your risk tolerance is also a job here.
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.200]   So both of these things are important.
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.060]   I would argue the first thing, kind of clarifying your goals and your time horizon and your
[00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.980]   proximity to needing your money, I would argue that's kind of the top of the heap.
[00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.240]   But risk tolerance should also be part of the discussion too, in my opinion.
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.840]   So knowing your goals determines your risk capacity.
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.680]   And when you're thinking about your goals, you want to think about your proximity to
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.560]   that goal as sort of a key point to think through.
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.840]   When will you need these funds?
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.840]   So if you are 35 and it's retirement, when you think you'll be 60 or 65 or maybe even
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.680]   longer, well, you have a very long time horizon for that goal.
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.080]   You have a high risk capacity.
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:38.040]   You can absorb the changes in your portfolio's value because you don't need the funds imminently.
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:45.340]   So thinking about proximity to goal and also using what we know about asset class returns
[00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:52.000]   over various time horizons to inform how you would think about how to invest given your
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.400]   proximity to the goal.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:00.800]   So when we look at stocks, stocks have historically had a higher return than safer investment
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.060]   types like cash, like bonds.
[00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.280]   And if you have at least a 10-year time horizon, stocks have actually been extraordinarily
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.440]   reliable.
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:18.280]   So in more than 90% of rolling 10-year periods, whenever the periods might be, you are most
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.000]   likely going to gain money over that 10-year time horizon.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.880]   But once you start shrinking that time horizon, taking it to like 5 years or 3 years or certainly
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.580]   even shorter than that, well, you start to see the odds for stocks go down quite a bit.
[00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:42.180]   So the odds are well less than 90% if you have a 5-year time horizon for stocks.
[00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:48.580]   You'd want to be in something that has a much better shot at making you whole over that
[00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.700]   fairly short time horizon.
[00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.380]   So that would be cash or bonds, for example.
[00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:00.940]   So I would say 10 years is a good guidepost when deciding whether you are going to be
[00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.140]   in stocks or not.
[00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.540]   If your time horizon is shorter than that, you need to be in safer assets that are most
[00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.900]   likely to be in positive territory over that shorter time horizon.
[00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.220]   So you're thinking about your proximity to needing your money to spend.
[00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.500]   You're also thinking about the duration of that goal.
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.640]   So if you're thinking about retirement and you're someone who's embarking on retirement
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:28.880]   in your 60s and you're in good health, well, that's sort of a long-duration goal.
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:37.640]   So you'd want to think about having probably 25 years or 30 years overall that you'll have
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.440]   where you'll be spending your money.
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:46.320]   On the other hand, college is a good example of a shorter-duration goal, where if you're
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:52.320]   lucky, your child will make it through college in four years, maybe five on the 5-year plan.
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.080]   And so that's a fairly rapid spend-down pace.
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:02.040]   That means that when that goal date arrives, you'd want to have the money in very safe
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.040]   investments.
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:08.380]   Even though maybe stocks helped you grow that 529 plan or grow whatever portfolio you're
[00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:13.360]   using for college nicely, by the time you get to college, you pretty much just want
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.520]   to hold the assets steady.
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.120]   You don't want to risk losses in your investment at that time.
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.600]   So you're thinking about the proximity to goal.
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.200]   You're thinking about the duration of goal.
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.920]   And of course there are other goals that we might have where it's kind of one and done.
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:36.840]   So the home down payment, for example, where it's a one-time purchase.
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:43.240]   And so you don't want to risk having the funds move around when you need the money.
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:48.640]   And then another thing to bear in mind when thinking about your risk capacity is thinking
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.120]   about your flexibility with respect to that goal.
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.440]   So here again, I think college funding is a great example.
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:00.320]   If you have, say, a 17-year-old, you don't want to be-- you don't want to have any wiggle
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.000]   room and say, your investments are down.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.680]   I think you might need to wait until you're 21.
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.500]   Your child probably would not love that as an answer.
[00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:15.760]   So there's an investment goal where there's not a lot of wiggle room in terms of timing.
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:16.760]   Same with retirement.
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:22.600]   You may have actually some wiggle room to delay retirement if the market's really bad
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.080]   and it's not a good time to tap your investments.
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:29.760]   You might say, well, I think I'll continue working a couple more years.
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:34.720]   But you may not want to have to work eight more years until your investments start looking
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:35.720]   better.
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:40.160]   So think about the flexibility of whatever goal you have in mind.
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.800]   A lake house purchase or something that's totally discretionary, well, there you have
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:51.680]   more flexibility about your goal date and so forth.
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.020]   So I mentioned human capital earlier on.
[00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:59.560]   We talked about the importance of really thinking about human capital, especially for young
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:06.120]   accumulators, thinking about trying to find ways to grow your earnings power over your
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.360]   lifetime.
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:11.160]   There's kind of an intersection with asset allocation.
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.240]   So this slide comes from some of my colleagues in Morningstar Investment Management.
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:20.920]   But the basic idea is when you're young and just starting out, most of us don't have much
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.240]   in the way of financial capital.
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.960]   We have small portfolios most of the time.
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:31.040]   We may even have negative portfolios if we have a lot of student loan debt.
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:37.120]   But we're long on another tremendous asset, which is that we're long on human capital.
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:43.720]   If we're well educated, we have a really powerful source of income that will take us through
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.040]   our working years.
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:52.960]   By contrast, when we are older, one would hope that our financial capital would have
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.520]   grown over that period.
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:08:00.120]   But as we're getting close to retirement, our human capital may not be as rich as it
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.520]   was when we were younger.
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.600]   In fact, it's not as rich.
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:12.160]   We can't expect as many years of earnings during those remaining years as we could have
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.280]   when we were younger.
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:18.040]   So even though our salary may be at its highest point in our lifetimes, the number of years
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:22.520]   that we expect to continue working would not be.
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:28.320]   So there's an interplay here where if you are very long on human capital, like the new
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:33.720]   worker who's just graduated with a degree in something worthwhile, that new worker doesn't
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:40.160]   have much in financial capital, doesn't have any imminent need for retirement funds, those
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.400]   funds should be invested really aggressively.
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:48.960]   On the other hand, as we get close to retirement, as we get close to needing to tap our funds,
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:51.960]   we want to make those investments more conservative.
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:57.040]   We want to have them kind of on standby, or at least a portion of that portfolio.
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:01.720]   So if we happen to retire in a bad market for stocks, well, we're not having to sell
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.960]   stocks into a trough.
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:10.000]   So thinking back to 2008, for example, during the global financial crisis, stocks dropped
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.480]   about 50% during that period.
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.520]   You wouldn't want to be the all-equity investor.
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:21.600]   So thinking about your own life stage, thinking about the status of your own human capital,
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:28.360]   your own proximity to retirement, can be really helpful in terms of determining how to position
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.800]   your portfolio.
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.380]   So that's risk capacity.
[00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:37.880]   All that stuff, thinking about your proximity to spending, thinking about your duration
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:45.200]   of spending, thinking about your flexibility with respect to the goals, those are all risk
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.440]   capacity questions.
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:51.440]   The second part of the equation is risk tolerance.
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:55.480]   And many of you have probably done these questionnaires and surveys online.
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:10:00.600]   If you work with a financial advisor, many of them use what are called risk tolerance
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.480]   questionnaires.
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:07.840]   The bottom line is that people tend not to be great judges of their own risk tolerance.
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:14.240]   They might think themselves really risk tolerant, and then when push comes to shove and it's
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:19.560]   March 2020 again, that investor might have fear in his or her heart.
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:25.120]   So that's a key thing to know, and one reason why I think risk tolerance questionnaires
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:30.640]   have been downplayed a little bit in the financial advice space, probably rightly so, that people
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.200]   aren't great judges.
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.680]   But still, I think it's a component.
[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:41.600]   And the reason why risk tolerance is such an important concept is that people do bad
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:47.000]   things when they have a portfolio that's not aligned with their risk tolerance.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:53.400]   So they might be inclined to sell themselves out in that really risky, bad market environment
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:59.800]   where they're inclined to move into cash and safer investments at the worst possible time.
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.200]   And we see this again and again.
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:07.080]   I believe Rick alluded to it, and Alan alluded to it in his presentation.
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:11.640]   We have a study that we run at Morningstar called Mind the Gap, and we see that investors
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:17.640]   systematically undermine their own results due to these poor timing decisions.
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:21.440]   And a lot of them come up in these fear and greed cycles.
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:29.200]   So when the market is really frothy, like it was in 2021, early 2022, we see that investors
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:34.400]   oftentimes glom on to the things that have performed really well in the recent past,
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:39.120]   and they retreat to safer stuff in bad market environments.
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:44.280]   So risk tolerance is something that should sit side by side with risk capacity.
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:49.280]   I would say put risk capacity in the front seat, put risk tolerance in the back seat,
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:53.820]   but both are important concepts that work together.
[00:11:53.820 --> 00:12:00.060]   So this is just an example of how at Morningstar we've got different glide paths, different
[00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:05.840]   asset allocations for people at different life stages, and we have a conservative, moderate,
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:07.260]   and aggressive version.
[00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:13.600]   The reason is that they're all sort of trending in the same direction, but the more conservative
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:19.720]   versions are a little bit more heavy on the fixed income and cash investments.
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:26.640]   So I just want to run through a few case studies here to illustrate how these two things work
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:27.860]   together.
[00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:34.180]   So we're assuming 68-year-old Mary has been investing for a while, and she was a person
[00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:42.300]   who felt terrible during the global financial crisis, where she saw, she was watching CNN,
[00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:48.860]   she was watching a lot of news, and her investment portfolio seemed to be going from bad to worse.
[00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:53.900]   She was checking it day by day, and she did what I said a lot of investors do at those
[00:12:53.900 --> 00:13:01.900]   market inflection points, where she just said, I can't stand it, I am getting close to retirement.
[00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:07.980]   By then she would have been in her early 50s, and she retreated to safe investments and
[00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:09.940]   never got back in.
[00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:13.500]   And I will say that this is not an uncommon profile.
[00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:20.660]   I still sometimes encounter people who are older adults who did this very thing, where
[00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:27.980]   they retreated to safe investments and never got themselves back into stocks, and unfortunately
[00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:31.700]   have missed the whole subsequent market rally.
[00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:34.540]   So this is not an unusual phenomenon.
[00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:37.220]   It's something that we see again and again.
[00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:41.980]   So her risk capacity is what I would say medium.
[00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:47.660]   So at age 68, she is embarking on retirement, but assuming she's in good health, well, she
[00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:53.060]   probably wants to plan for 25 or 30 years of retirement.
[00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:57.980]   So she can't afford to be hunkered down in very safe investments, even though we've seen
[00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:03.580]   yields on those investments tick up quite a bit over the past couple of years.
[00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:08.660]   Inflation still is what it is, and it takes a bite out of the purchasing power of those
[00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:10.580]   very safe investments.
[00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:14.780]   So it's not prudent for her to be just in safe investments.
[00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:19.900]   She needs to take some risk with the hope of actually growing her portfolio a little
[00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:24.540]   bit and hopefully outpacing inflation over her time horizon.
[00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:31.660]   So I would rate her risk capacity, her ability to take risk, as kind of medium, because she
[00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:33.780]   has that long time horizon.
[00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:39.340]   Even if she incurs some losses from the stocks in her portfolio, she has time to recover,
[00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:40.340]   right?
[00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:45.380]   So she might not want to be spending from that fall in equity portfolio, but assuming
[00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:51.700]   she has some sort of a balanced portfolio, that gives her time for her portfolio to recover.
[00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:54.980]   So I would say that her risk capacity is kind of medium.
[00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:58.660]   Her risk tolerance, well, we know it's low, right?
[00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:03.460]   She is really uncomfortable in equity markets' wounds.
[00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:07.180]   So she would want to have kind of a balanced exposure.
[00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:13.860]   She'd certainly want to have some safer assets that she could call upon in an equity market
[00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:19.740]   downdraft, but she needs stocks for their long-run appreciation potential and for their
[00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:22.900]   ability to outpace inflation.
[00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:25.780]   So we'll take a look at another extreme.
[00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:30.380]   We'll assume that we've got Abby and Zach here, and I will also say that some of these
[00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:33.460]   people are ripped from my own life.
[00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:39.460]   Their names have been changed, but they resemble some people in my life.
[00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:44.940]   So Abby and Zach live in a big urban center, which they love, but they now have a baby.
[00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:48.820]   And they live in a one-bedroom apartment in this very costly urban center.
[00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:54.140]   And they have their sights set on buying a place to live, probably some sort of a townhouse
[00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:56.580]   or something like that.
[00:15:56.580 --> 00:16:03.000]   And when you talk to them, these two, they're both 32, they rate their risk tolerance as
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.180]   very high, because they've been doing this for a while, they feel.
[00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:11.080]   And they have gotten comfortable with equity market volatility.
[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:14.700]   Their retirement accounts are parked in long-term investments.
[00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:18.140]   They don't bother with them when the market's down.
[00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:23.000]   So they rate their risk tolerance as really high.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.140]   But their risk capacity is low.
[00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:28.180]   So they're expecting a second baby.
[00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:33.400]   They're in this too small place, so they need to get into a larger home.
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:37.240]   They know that they want to buy, and they have the down payment fund set aside.
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:43.480]   Well, their risk capacity with that portion of the portfolio, not their retirement portfolio,
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:48.000]   but that portion of their portfolio, their risk capacity is really low.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.400]   They are not in a position to absorb losses with that down payment fund, right?
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:56.080]   They don't want to have to change their goal.
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:17:00.500]   They don't want to be stuck in this too small place with two children.
[00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:03.260]   So their risk capacity is really low.
[00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:08.740]   So there can be these disconnects, where you've got what you feel is high risk tolerance,
[00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:12.380]   where actually your risk capacity is low.
[00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:17.820]   I would argue that this is the case for a lot of pre-retirees and retirees who I talk
[00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:23.580]   to, who have had a great experience with stocks over their holding periods.
[00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:28.700]   They've been comfortable holding stocks through periodic down drafts, and they rate their
[00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:30.580]   risk tolerance as high.
[00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:35.640]   But the fact is, their risk capacity has changed a little bit over their lifetimes.
[00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:41.160]   And as they get close to retirement, they want to start putting in place safer assets
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:48.120]   that they could draw upon while they let their equity portfolio recover and repair itself.
[00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:55.640]   So Zach and Abby, I would say, are a great example of high risk tolerance, they think,
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:58.560]   and low risk capacity.
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:03.320]   Now we'll take a look at Jack and Ellen, who are already retired.
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:11.520]   This couple is-- Jack was a retired college professor, and he has a good pension, as college
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.640]   professors often do.
[00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:19.520]   But they're in the luxurious position of having everything that they need coming from the
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:24.400]   combination of Jack's pension and Ellen's social security.
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:29.860]   So they're not really needing to touch their portfolio on an ongoing basis, except maybe
[00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:35.240]   they want to do so for special trips or sort of extras.
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:41.080]   So this portfolio is not getting touched on a regular basis.
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:44.600]   It's not getting subtracted from on a regular basis.
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:52.000]   So their risk capacity, despite their ages, is actually kind of on the high side.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:58.940]   They can afford to build and hold a fairly aggressively positioned portfolio with lots
[00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:04.440]   of stocks because there's not an imminent need of them turning around tomorrow and saying,
[00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:12.760]   I need $100,000 for this thing because our other income sources aren't doing the job.
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:20.600]   So this is a good example of high risk capacity, high ability to absorb portfolio withdrawals,
[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:27.040]   or absorb spending shocks, I should say, and also fairly high risk tolerance.
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:31.920]   Because this couple has invested through a lot of market cycles, and they know that they're
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:36.160]   not going to upend their plan at the worst possible time.
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:38.320]   So it's important to kind of customize this.
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:44.440]   I do think that off-the-shelf sources of asset allocation guidance can be a help in terms
[00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:47.080]   of getting yourself in the right ballpark.
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:52.040]   So you can look at say a target date fund or even use a target date fund if you're someone
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:58.560]   who's in your 20s and 30s or even your 40s to kind of guide your portfolio's asset allocation.
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:04.720]   But if you have shorter-term goals or intermediate-term goals, or as you're getting close to retirement,
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:10.160]   I think it's terribly helpful to customize your portfolio's asset allocation based on
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:14.600]   these two inputs, risk capacity and risk tolerance.
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:16.800]   So I am going to leave it at that.
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:22.640]   We have time for a five-minute break, and then we'll be right back here at 3 o'clock.
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:22.960]   Thank you.
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:24.960]   [END]
