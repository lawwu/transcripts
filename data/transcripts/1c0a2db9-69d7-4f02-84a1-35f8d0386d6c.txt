[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.620]   I am James Hong and welcome to the Surpassing Value Podcast.
[00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.740]   The fuel and desire for this podcast was born out of a compulsion to flesh out what's
[00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.600]   been going on in the midst of an ocean of megaphones that may not actually withstand
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.620]   the test of scrutiny.
[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:32.320]   As a signpost theologian, I will do my best to filter out the impurities and point people
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:39.740]   in the right direction.
[00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:45.960]   In this episode, we continue on with the Magodeo series and once again Dr. Chang and I discuss
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.000]   issues related to the conception of life, this time something a bit more practical and
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.780]   close to home.
[00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.980]   In this episode, we dig into the particulars of IVF.
[00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.420]   So before you listen, let me say that we both understand that this is an incredibly sensitive
[00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.420]   subject.
[00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.820]   Not only is it sensitive, it's heartbreaking, it's deeply personal.
[00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:16.580]   Nobody is here to kick anyone while they're down or judge people for being in circumstances
[00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.540]   they never thought that they would be in.
[00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.700]   At the same time, you could understand to not dive into this subject when so much is
[00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.680]   at stake would only be to compound tragedy upon tragedy.
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.980]   So my hope, my prayer for this episode and for this series is that it serves to edify
[00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.260]   and not tear down the body.
[00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:52.460]   Alright, as stated, I am joined by Dr. Jeremiah Chang and we are going to do this.
[00:01:52.460 --> 00:02:01.000]   We're going to talk about a subject that is rightfully deeply personal and intimate.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:09.900]   A subject that has caused a lot of heartache and rightly so, infertility is not an easy
[00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:20.500]   issue to talk about and yet we in a sense must because life is just that precious and
[00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:29.420]   a lot of people have utilized IVF and are considering using IVF or have questions about
[00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:38.060]   it and I think that with respect to the technology that is out there, we do need to have just
[00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:44.620]   a firmer grasp of how that technology relates with our biblical principles.
[00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:51.820]   And Jeremiah and I, I asked him to call in this episode because we've had many talks
[00:02:51.820 --> 00:03:00.380]   about this issue especially after Bible study and him having his medical degree but also
[00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.980]   not just his medical degree but just the amount of research that has gone into this.
[00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.500]   I think it would help shed light on this.
[00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:16.940]   So Jeremiah, with that said, let's start off by, I want to ask you this question, what
[00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:17.940]   is IVF?
[00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:18.940]   What is it?
[00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.380]   Yeah, so IVF is a procedure in vitro fertilization.
[00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:31.940]   So normally fertilization, as most probably know, is when egg and sperm meet, usually
[00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:38.380]   in the fallopian tube, and that's the point of conception, the point when life begins.
[00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:45.420]   So in vitro, in vitro in glass, that's what it means, just really is referred to as outside
[00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:51.160]   of the uterus, the fallopian tube environment, that's when fertilization takes place.
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:04:00.180]   So usually that happens in a lab and the process involves many steps but you would harvest
[00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:08.620]   eggs from the woman and then collect sperm from the male and then you would fertilize
[00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:09.620]   them.
[00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:18.340]   There are different methods of fertilization but the end result is the production of children
[00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:25.180]   and that's in a short what IVF is, it's simply the creation of children outside the
[00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.180]   womb.
[00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:35.340]   And you and I would agree that scripture is clear on this issue, that before an egg
[00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.500]   and a sperm meet, because I think you used the word fertilized egg, a fertilized egg
[00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.500]   is just when a sperm meets with the egg, right?
[00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:52.840]   And so life begins when that happens, when the sperm actually goes into the egg.
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:05:00.820]   Before that sperm by itself is not life, an egg by itself is not life, but when they meet
[00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:07.900]   and when an egg is fertilized by that sperm, you have a human being at that point.
[00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.300]   Exactly, yes.
[00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:15.900]   So in the medical world we call a sperm and egg haploid cells, meaning they contain one
[00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:23.240]   set of DNA and then when they combine, we call that cell, a fertilized egg is essentially
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.240]   a zygote.
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.920]   It's the combination of DNA, it's a diploid cell.
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:35.600]   So at that point when a zygote has its unique DNA, it's separate from the sperm and the
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:36.600]   egg.
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.560]   It's the combination of it that creates the zygote which is the child.
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:49.600]   So at that point when that happens, everything that is needed for that child to grow, all
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.400]   the genetic information is already there, is that correct?
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.540]   That's correct, yes.
[00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:57.240]   And this is a person that has never existed before.
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.880]   Yes, exactly.
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:04.960]   And we were all there, every single live person started just like that diploid cell way.
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:05.960]   Exactly, yes.
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.880]   There's no other way that life can begin, that is the way that God has created it to
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:11.880]   be.
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:12.880]   Yes.
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:25.920]   So when we talk about IVF, it's different from just traditional child production in
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:31.160]   the sense that, like you mentioned, it happens outside the womb.
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:38.520]   A lot of people will typically seek in vitro fertilization because there's something that
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.520]   is not working.
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:47.520]   I don't want to say the word working, but something has gone wrong where the couple
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.160]   cannot conceive naturally.
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.560]   And so it could be the male, it could be the female.
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:07:00.120]   And so in that sense, they'll go to an IVF clinic to seek assistance.
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:07.920]   The issue is, and you can correct me if I'm wrong, Jeremiah, I don't know of an IVF clinic
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:12.200]   that believes life begins at conception.
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:19.480]   Yes, I would say nearly always, almost always, yes.
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.480]   That's correct.
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:24.760]   I mean, the only exception, of course, are maybe the few that are involved in embryo
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:32.560]   adoption specifically, and they are fertility doctors that are involved in IVF in the sense
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:42.020]   of helping families with embryo adoption.
[00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:48.440]   So I would say, like you said, nearly all of them do not hold the same worldview that
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:49.880]   life begins at conception.
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:54.840]   And that, of course, plays out in the way that they discuss the procedure, in the way
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:08:01.280]   they encourage certain procedures to happen, in all the decisions that a couple has to
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.280]   make through the IVF process.
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:09.880]   All of that gets shaped in a specific way by the doctor because of their worldview.
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:16.240]   Yeah, and so I think it's a fair summation to say, unless you're going to go through
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:23.000]   embryonic adoption, which we talked about in the previous episode, any IVF clinic that
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:29.440]   you just Google, that clinic is not going to share a biblical worldview.
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:39.080]   And we share that because you kind of investigated what goes on in IVF clinics.
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:43.600]   You know the questions they ask you and the procedures they kind of push.
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:50.500]   And so they push these procedures and they push these recommendations because to them,
[00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:54.980]   they're not thinking life begins at conception.
[00:08:54.980 --> 00:09:02.040]   And so if something were to happen to, let's say, one out of 10 embryos, it's not a life
[00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:03.040]   that is lost.
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:04.040]   It's an embryo.
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:08.040]   It's something less than life that is lost.
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:17.200]   That's going to really affect what they say to the patron, to the person who's undergoing
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.200]   the procedure.
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:25.960]   But that also means that if you do decide to go to an IVF clinic to undergo IVF, particularly
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:30.440]   as Christians, that there are some things that we need to kind of be aware of.
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.000]   Is that fair to say?
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:42.080]   And I think probably the most obvious way that gets manifested is the encouragement
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:52.520]   of fertility doctors to basically encourage the maximal creation of children, numerically,
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:53.520]   in quantity.
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:59.480]   I mean, and there's a lot of reasons for that because again, their end goal is to provide
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:08.520]   what they believe most of their patrons want, which is a "healthy, genetically normal child".
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:15.080]   And so if that's the end goal, then to maximize the chances of that happening, they want to
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:20.760]   create as many children so that they can select for the ones that have the greatest probability
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:26.520]   of eventually manifesting into a born, genetically normal child.
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:27.520]   Yeah.
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:33.680]   So let's kind of put this, I want to circle back a little bit because this is a good point.
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:39.540]   So a person goes into the IVF clinic and they speak to the doctor and the doctor says, "We're
[00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:42.840]   going to pull out 10 eggs from the female."
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:50.040]   And then 10 eggs are pulled and then they'll ask for the sperm from the male and then they'll
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.040]   fertilize.
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:59.600]   So typically, if you don't put a stop to it, typically they just fertilize all 10 eggs.
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:05.680]   And for those who do not know, you can't implant 10 fertilized eggs at one time.
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.220]   It's not something you can do.
[00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:10.120]   Typically it may be somewhere between one and three.
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.120]   Is that correct?
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:12.120]   Yeah.
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.960]   So you can go more than three, of course.
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:15.520]   But it's not recommended?
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:16.520]   It's not recommended.
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:22.040]   There used to be something called selective reduction, which I don't believe they practice
[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:29.560]   now, but that practice involves implanting a large amount of children, typically more
[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:31.560]   than three, maybe four, five, six.
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:37.000]   And then what they would do is they would see which later on, they would see which child
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:45.440]   is acting "normal," acting like a genetically normal child would throughout the pregnancy.
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:51.400]   And then they would selectively reduce them, meaning basically abort the ones that aren't.
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:59.040]   Or if a couple wanted to have twins and then decided they do no longer want to have twins,
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:03.120]   they wanted just one child, selective reduction would involve aborting a child.
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:06.760]   So that practice has since, I think, gone to the wayside.
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:11.400]   I don't think it's practiced as much now, but yes, like typically, yes, you would only
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:19.200]   implant one to two, even three is sort of not conventional.
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:23.000]   And there's been a huge push within the IVF industry, especially since the advent of genetic
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.960]   testing, to only implant one.
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:33.240]   I remember when Carrie went to see a fertility doctor because we have to get some monitoring
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:38.720]   here in California and send it over to NEDC in Knoxville, Tennessee.
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:41.000]   So we did meet an IVF doctor.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.880]   And NEDC is the Embryo Donation Center.
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:47.680]   Yes, yes, that's the agency that we adopted our children from.
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:52.520]   So this fertility doctor, of course, does not share the same worldview, and so he assumed
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:56.840]   the whole time he was doing the ultrasound that we had only implanted one.
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:01.520]   And then he was like, "Okay, so let's look at this child and see how this child's doing."
[00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:07.360]   And when Carrie had told him that we implanted three, he jumped out of his chair and he was
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:10.160]   so shocked and he couldn't believe it.
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:16.440]   And so that just kind of shows that the culture of IVF is generally to implant one.
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:23.400]   Yeah, and so the next logical question is, if you let's say implant one, because that's
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:27.680]   a suggestion to implant one or two, but let's say one, right?
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:32.080]   You implant one, and then let's say that child goes to term.
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:35.600]   You have nine left, if there are 10.
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:39.440]   And let's say you implant one or two more, right?
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:43.440]   Let's just give the benefit of doubt and say you plant two initially, implant two.
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:47.800]   And let's say you have one child, and then you have eight left.
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:51.480]   You plant another two, let's say you have one child.
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:54.960]   Well, now you have six left.
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:58.480]   So the question then becomes, what are you going to do with the six?
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:13:59.480]   But let's say the numbers are different.
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:05.320]   Let's say you start with 10, and then you implant one doesn't survive, one doesn't survive.
[00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:09.040]   And you do it again, I mean, you might end up with three, right?
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:11.400]   But there's still three human beings.
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:12.400]   Exactly.
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.160]   That's the point.
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:24.340]   And typically, when you're left with three human beings, because it's pretty common that
[00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:29.120]   people have leftover embryos, that's a very common occurrence.
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:30.720]   Same thing happens to these embryos.
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.320]   Exactly, yeah.
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:38.480]   So there are essentially four options for embryos that the genetic parents no longer
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:39.600]   want to transfer.
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:47.040]   So you can, again, what the community calls discarding embryos, you can discard them,
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:51.840]   which we as Christians, I think, would affirm that that's killing the child.
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:58.560]   You can, again, what they call donate to science, again, that's probably more accurately described
[00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:04.400]   as just human experimentation, and almost inevitably results in the death of the child.
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:07.400]   You can keep them frozen, which is what a lot of families do now.
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:12.560]   They can freeze them for all sorts of reasons, you know, to save the children for a later
[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:15.560]   date when they may want to transfer them.
[00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:16.960]   And so that's an option.
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:21.840]   And then the last option would be to place them for adoption, which is unfortunately
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:27.840]   not the majority of children, the majority by number is discarding or the killing of
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:30.560]   unborn children.
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:33.840]   But adoption is a possibility.
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:34.920]   Yeah.
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:37.360]   And that's exactly how you adopt your children.
[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:38.360]   Exactly.
[00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:39.360]   Yeah.
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:45.840]   So some family, you know, we don't, we have no relationship with the genetic parents of
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:46.840]   our children.
[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:51.560]   So we don't know what caused them to choose this route.
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:54.360]   But certainly we're thankful that they did.
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:16:00.480]   And, you know, there's a lot of reasons why they might choose adoption.
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:01.480]   But it is available.
[00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:08.160]   And I think, again, going back to worldview is not every IVF doctor will even present
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:15.600]   adoption as a possibility, as a viable option for the remaining children.
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.400]   Some don't even offer.
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:22.040]   In fact, if I recall correctly, Carrie had mentioned, I mean, this doctor that she saw
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:27.680]   for her checkups here, he didn't really know anything about embryo adoption.
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:32.160]   And I don't think that's that's not an uncommon response from IVF doctors.
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.880]   Many are not aware of embryo adoption.
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:35.880]   Yeah.
[00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:38.040]   And, you know, it's a consequence of your worldview.
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:46.720]   If, if there, if embryos are not people, then then why would you even, you know, take the
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:50.280]   steps to to to investigate embryonic adoption?
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:55.600]   Or why would you even see if there's anything for these embryos, because they're not people
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:56.600]   anyway.
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:57.600]   Exactly.
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:58.600]   Why not just discard them?
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:16:59.600]   Right.
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:04.840]   And that's, again, it's a consequence of your your starting point of what you believe about
[00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:06.680]   where life begins.
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:12.740]   If you believe life begins at conception, then there's going to be consequences to how
[00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:15.880]   you react to these embryos.
[00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:16.880]   Right.
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.280]   So that's a that's a great point.
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:19.760]   Thanks for thanks for adding that.
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:27.840]   You know, one thing I also wanted to ask you was, we mentioned, Jeremiah, that these IVF
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:30.640]   clinics do not share a biblical worldview.
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:38.040]   One of the consequences being that they'll push you to create more embryos to have to
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:44.440]   create more people than might be, I don't use the word necessary, but they'll just push
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:47.000]   you to make as many as possible.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:53.320]   Not really thinking about the consequences of any leftover embryos slash people.
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:54.320]   Right.
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:18:01.360]   So what are some other consequences that naturally occur because of their worldview?
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:15.280]   Yes, well, the the other issue would be freezing, you know, when they when they freeze embryos,
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:23.240]   they typically will, they'll typically grade them before and grading is not an objective
[00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:24.240]   standard.
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:29.080]   They look at how the child looks under a microscope, and they sort of give a letter scoring to
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.080]   them.
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:35.160]   And, you know, there's debate whether that predicts anything about the chance of survival,
[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:37.320]   the chance of implantation.
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:44.720]   But typically, it's it's known that if if a child is poorly graded, they typically don't
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:47.080]   do well with the freezing.
[00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:48.280]   And interesting.
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:52.280]   So again, the consequence of the worldview is that because again, the end goal of the
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:58.800]   doctor is to hopefully have a born child for the couple.
[00:18:58.800 --> 00:18:59.800]   That's it.
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:00.800]   That's it.
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:07.320]   They just want a couple to have a child that's born in that, you know, you genetically normal.
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:12.960]   So the consequence of that would be that when they look at an embryo, and they see this
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:15.960]   child, they grade it and it's poorly graded.
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:19.380]   That doesn't incentivize them to implant that child.
[00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:25.040]   So inevitably, they would always suggest, okay, let's implant higher grade children,
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:29.560]   because they have a higher, the theoretical higher chance of surviving and successfully
[00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:30.560]   implanting.
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:35.840]   The problem is that these children that are poorly graded, they don't have a good chance
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:40.520]   of surviving the freezing process and the thawing process.
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:45.880]   So every time a child is frozen, you know, if you want that child to be transferred to
[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:51.000]   a mother again, they have to be thawed, otherwise, you know, that that's the only way, otherwise
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.040]   they left, they are essentially frozen indefinitely.
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:20:01.480]   So these children that are poorly graded, it's well known that they do not do well as
[00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:06.440]   well, at least with the thawing process, and a lot of them don't survive.
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:11.840]   So you can kind of see how it plays out, you know, so it would seem more reasonable if
[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:16.480]   you believe that life begins at conception, every child is precious, that the ones that
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:21.000]   may not survive the freezing thawing process should really be transferred to the mother
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.400]   first, they should be given the priority.
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:27.520]   Because otherwise, then you subject them to the freezing and thawing and they tend not
[00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:29.020]   to survive as well.
[00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:31.640]   But that's certainly not the culture, right?
[00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:38.880]   That culture is to, again, just implant the highest grade to give the couple the best
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:43.920]   chance of having a born genetically normal child.
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:51.040]   Yeah, and you know, it touches on this idea of the commodifying of children, we can't
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:54.040]   get it get too deep into in this episode.
[00:20:54.040 --> 00:21:01.280]   But there's this tension where it's not ungodly to desire children, God has built that in
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:02.280]   us.
[00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:11.000]   How could that desire for wanting children lead to the dehumanization of the children
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.080]   itself by commodifying yet, right?
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:19.160]   And that's that, I know, we've talked about this subject before, which is why I bring
[00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:20.160]   it up.
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:23.840]   But I know, that's heavy on your heart, this idea of the commodification of children, kind
[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:25.160]   of kind of breaks you.
[00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:26.160]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:30.120]   I mean, you see it all over the IVF process.
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:35.940]   These clinics, they do not see embryos as children, they do not.
[00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:40.060]   They see embryos as a means to an end.
[00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:48.140]   And the way the whole process is played out, you can tell, they treat children as just
[00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:50.860]   medical objects or medical waste, right?
[00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:55.940]   I mean, you look at the way we even have the way terms are used and euphemisms, right?
[00:21:55.940 --> 00:22:00.580]   I mean, we talked about discarding, donating, right?
[00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:03.580]   You don't discard people, we would never use that term, right?
[00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:07.980]   And we would never say you donate people, right?
[00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:13.300]   I mean, I say, and many others as well with me say, place for adoption, right?
[00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:15.620]   You place your frozen children for adoption.
[00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:20.540]   But the more generally accepted terminology within the IVF is you donate your children
[00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:21.540]   for adoption, right?
[00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:25.700]   And again, it goes to show you how they commodify these children.
[00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:30.100]   These children are simply goods for service.
[00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:31.100]   They're not people.
[00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:34.620]   Otherwise, we wouldn't use the same terms as we're using now.
[00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:36.660]   Yeah, no, that's really good.
[00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:42.740]   I mean, if you think about how powerful languages, how powerful these terms are, you know, and
[00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:45.740]   I'm certainly guilty of framing it that way.
[00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:50.980]   And so I'm really glad that you brought it up, that we want to be deliberate with the
[00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:56.140]   way, with our wording, because that communicates something as well.
[00:22:56.140 --> 00:23:01.940]   I want to circle back real quick to something you mentioned, but we go back to the scenario
[00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:07.020]   where a couple has 10 eggs, and all 10 are fertilized.
[00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:12.660]   And let's say, you know, six or seven are used, let's just say, I know, a lot of times
[00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:16.060]   it won't even get to six or seven, but let's just say six or seven are used.
[00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:20.460]   Well, we got to do something with the three to four, right, we have to do something with
[00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:23.300]   the three to four fertilized eggs.
[00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:28.940]   And let's say you freeze them, you know, you want to maybe have children in a year or two.
[00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:32.580]   But this is the thing, is that you can freeze them.
[00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:38.780]   But it is not guaranteed that once you freeze them, and when you thaw them, that they're
[00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:39.780]   going to survive.
[00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:44.820]   It is somewhere between, you tell me 60 to 75%.
[00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:52.700]   Yeah, so the problem is there really aren't, there isn't good data to give a good number
[00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:53.700]   for that.
[00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:57.020]   It certainly is not 100%, everyone knows that.
[00:23:57.020 --> 00:24:05.420]   A lot of clinics will self-report upwards of 90% survival, but that is likely an overestimation,
[00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:12.060]   because many probably do not include the poorly grade embryos, because oftentimes they just
[00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:16.820]   get killed even before the freezing process, because, you know, they're just not even considered,
[00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:19.340]   right, so they'll just be killed.
[00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:25.780]   And so that, and no clinic will ever give a detailed analysis of how they came up with
[00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:26.780]   their numbers.
[00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:29.980]   So it's just, you go on their website, and they'll just tell you 97%.
[00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:32.180]   Because they don't need to, am I right?
[00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:33.180]   Exactly, yes.
[00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:34.180]   There's no regulatory agency.
[00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:36.380]   Exactly, there is no regulation on this at all.
[00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:37.380]   There's no accountability.
[00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:38.380]   Exactly.
[00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:41.420]   Because we don't view embryos as life.
[00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:42.420]   Exactly.
[00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:43.420]   Yeah.
[00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:49.100]   And then, you know, and so 90 plus percent is what most clinics would report.
[00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:54.900]   So, but if you look at the National Embryo Adoption Donation Center, they report about
[00:24:54.900 --> 00:25:00.180]   a 75% chance, which is likely an underestimation.
[00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:06.900]   And the reason why is because they are receiving all of the children created that's left over
[00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:08.220]   from the genetic family.
[00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:13.580]   So typically, those tend to be lower grade, generally speaking.
[00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:17.740]   So, you know, the way I thought about it was just, well, if you take, you know, if you
[00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:25.660]   assume slight overestimation of IVF self-reported data, you assume slight underestimation from
[00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:31.100]   the National Embryo Donation Center, you get about 75, 95% range.
[00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:34.340]   And it's, the reality is it's probably somewhere between there.
[00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:35.340]   Sure.
[00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:36.340]   The problem is no one knows.
[00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:41.020]   But I think we can all accept that those aren't the greatest numbers when we consider what's
[00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:42.020]   at stake.
[00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:43.020]   Right.
[00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:53.420]   So what you're saying is essentially, I mean, the embryo, the child has an 80%, 85% chance
[00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:57.780]   of living, but conversely, a 15% chance of dying.
[00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:08.920]   So I mean, I can't imagine like, would anyone allow their child to go outside and walk across
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:16.180]   the street at night, knowing that there's a 15% chance that they're going to die?
[00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:17.180]   Nobody would do that.
[00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:23.300]   Nobody, I mean, you know, we're not talking about I have a 15% chance of losing the candy
[00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:24.300]   bar.
[00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:33.260]   I have a 15% chance of a child not surviving that I mean, 15% chance might seem small,
[00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:35.660]   but it really depends on what's at stake.
[00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:36.660]   Exactly.
[00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:37.660]   Yeah.
[00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:44.820]   I mean, if I had a 15% chance of, you know, losing my right arm, that 15% chance looks
[00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:47.620]   awfully big, right?
[00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:54.820]   And an embryo is worth much more than my right arm because an embryo is a person.
[00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:58.980]   So that, that's the other thing is that I think, you know, when we, when we go through
[00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:04.500]   this, when someone goes through this process, the doctor is not telling them about these
[00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:07.420]   things or not warning them about these things.
[00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:12.860]   They're just like you stated earlier, they, their goal is to just get a genetically normal
[00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:14.980]   child to pop out.
[00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:15.980]   Exactly.
[00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:16.980]   Yeah.
[00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:22.860]   And a lot of times the unfortunate reality is that these couples deal with the ramifications
[00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:26.100]   of the decisions alone, apart from the doctor, right?
[00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:33.300]   Even though the doctor is somewhat culpable in the way they, they shape, you know, the
[00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:34.300]   information.
[00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:39.700]   And so a lot of Christian families where convictions might change, they have to deal with it.
[00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:44.780]   So, you know, the best thing is to be prepared before you even enter the process about what
[00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:50.860]   are some of the things to think about, if you were so to decide on IVF, right?
[00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:56.580]   And one of them is the freezing and the thawing process that it does pose a significant risk
[00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:57.580]   to every child.
[00:27:57.580 --> 00:27:58.580]   Yeah.
[00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:03.300]   And that's certainly something to consider before, you know, you engage, engage in IVF.
[00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:04.300]   Yeah.
[00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:09.460]   You know, and there are other like issues related to IVF that are, that are more nuanced
[00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:10.460]   and specific.
[00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:15.900]   I know, Jeremiah, again, you've, you've written about this, you've blogged about this.
[00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:19.460]   And a lot of it is, you know, dealing with minutiae.
[00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:20.460]   We could get into it.
[00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:26.540]   I might, I might circle back around in a different episode, but kind of want to segue here, kind
[00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:28.600]   of make a right turn at this point.
[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:35.620]   Now what I want to talk about, Jeremiah, is given everything we know about IVF, the question
[00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:43.540]   then becomes, is it from, from a Christian biblical standpoint, is it morally permissible
[00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:48.900]   for Christians to utilize IVF?
[00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:49.900]   That's the question.
[00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:53.460]   That's a, and that's a big, that's a big question, you know, and that is a big one.
[00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:54.460]   Yeah.
[00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:55.460]   Yeah.
[00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:56.460]   That's a, that's a big question.
[00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:58.900]   And I know already, you know, we're at the 26 minute mark, I believe, in this episode
[00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:04.260]   or maybe a little further, but I want to tackle that with Jeremiah.
[00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:14.900]   And before we kind of get into that part, I want to say that this is changing as, as,
[00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:22.380]   as the years go on, this is changing as, as, and as we learn more and more, not only about
[00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:26.580]   the science, but what the science actually does.
[00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:32.340]   And I think people will have strong opinions one way or the other.
[00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:40.980]   I think dialogue is important and I think it is important to respect one another's opinions,
[00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:44.620]   but they are going to be strong opinions because life is at stake.
[00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:52.100]   So yeah, with that said, let's, let's, let's jump into this, Jeremiah.
[00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:58.440]   Would you say as Christians, well, not, not you personally, some Christians have said
[00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:04.420]   that there is a morally permissible way, and some notable Christian theologians have said
[00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:11.020]   there is a morally permissible way, but in this morally permissible way, even in that
[00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:17.900]   permissible way, you cannot engage in the willful destruction of embryos.
[00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:19.700]   Would you agree with that?
[00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:20.700]   Yes.
[00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:27.020]   That's probably the most common evangelical stance, I would, I would say, is that IVF
[00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:29.020]   is morally permissible.
[00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:35.540]   Some would even encourage it as a treatment to overcome infertility, as sort of just viewing
[00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:40.420]   it as like another medical intervention one would do when they're sick.
[00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:45.340]   And so, but I think we would all affirm that the Bible is clear about life when life begins.
[00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:51.740]   And so if destroying embryos is murder, it's killing children, and that definitely is prohibited.
[00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:56.140]   So that I think that would probably be the most common stance we see within the evangelical
[00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:57.140]   circle.
[00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:58.140]   Yeah.
[00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:04.980]   And you know, there's a dearth of, there hasn't been a lot written on this subject, so I'm
[00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:12.860]   glad that Jeremiah and I are having this conversation because I know personally, just the scouring
[00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:18.740]   that that Jeremiah had to do to find information on this issue, I know how much he's just all
[00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:24.460]   the rocks he's looked under to, to find something that someone has written that's of value and
[00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:31.780]   so that's, you know, there's not a lot there, but, but we can say with full conviction that
[00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:41.020]   if you do decide to undergo IVF, you have to keep in mind the destruction of embryos.
[00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:49.580]   If you willfully engage in conduct that leads to the slaughter of children, I know that's
[00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:55.820]   harsh, but that's, that's also what it is, the discarding of embryos, aka also known
[00:31:55.820 --> 00:32:05.900]   as the slaughter of children, that is not something that is okay, in the biblical worldview.
[00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:06.900]   Would you agree with that?
[00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:07.900]   Absolutely, yes.
[00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:12.100]   I think it's very clear, you know, and I would agree with what you say, I would just add
[00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:18.060]   on something else as well, for specifically for those who are thinking about doing IVF,
[00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:20.740]   it's not necessary for those who have already done it, have already created children and
[00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:25.260]   maybe their convictions have changed, that's a little different, but for those who are
[00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:32.020]   going through it and have an opportunity to choose the number of children to create, I
[00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:42.180]   would just say that the idea of placing your own child for adoption also is maybe not universally
[00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:47.500]   in all circumstances, but generally not the expressed will of God.
[00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:52.500]   Generally the pattern of scripture is that if you are the genetic parents, you should
[00:32:52.500 --> 00:33:00.700]   parent your own child, and I don't think that, I think that there are certainly some that
[00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:05.100]   might disagree, and again I'm not speaking for those who have already created children
[00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:09.660]   and their convictions might have changed, you know, I'm speaking more towards those
[00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:18.220]   who can choose how many children to create, I would just advise to be thoughtful about
[00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:23.540]   the number of children you create, not in the sense that you wouldn't, even if you choose
[00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:29.660]   not to kill those children because you don't want to transfer them, but even the idea of
[00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:35.620]   placing those children for adoption, that generally speaking is sort of against the
[00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:36.860]   expressed will of God.
[00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:42.020]   Yeah, I mean, to put it in other words, don't just think, well I'm going to create, I'm
[00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:45.100]   going to just create the maximum amount and I'll just give up the rest for adoption, so
[00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:49.460]   then it's all gravy, because I can just give up the rest for adoption and my Christian
[00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:50.460]   conscience is clear.
[00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:54.940]   Well, there's about a million embryos, so even if you give them up for adoption, they
[00:33:54.940 --> 00:34:02.380]   might not ever be adopted, and they're not going to remain in cryopreservation forever,
[00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:07.500]   I mean, something's got to happen at some point, right, and again, there's no guarantee
[00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:13.460]   that there's not going to be a power outage or whatever else, so it's not like some locked
[00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:15.540]   vault somewhere, right?
[00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:20.100]   So I think, thank you for sharing that, that's good that, you know, someone doesn't just
[00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:26.980]   hear this podcast and just go, well, okay, I'll just do IVF and I'll just give up the
[00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:31.140]   rest and I followed God's standards.
[00:34:31.140 --> 00:34:40.140]   That is not what, that is not the line of thinking we should be engaging in as Christians.
[00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:46.220]   There's also a whole host of Christians that believe that Christians should never engage
[00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:53.380]   in IVF, and Jeremiah and I have talked about this worldview, this argument, and we both
[00:34:53.380 --> 00:35:02.420]   agree that for Christians who state that Christians should never use IVF, they are on solid biblical
[00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:03.420]   ground.
[00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:08.940]   So I want to just take some time to kind of unpack this, and Jeremiah, you can correct
[00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:12.900]   me if I'm wrong, but you know, we've had conversations about this.
[00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:19.380]   Christians who believe that there is a morally permissible way to do IVF, they might be on
[00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:23.980]   to something, they might not be, but they might be on to something, and Wayne Grudem
[00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:26.620]   is a proponent of that.
[00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:31.620]   But Christians who say Christians should never engage in IVF, they might be on to something
[00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:32.620]   as well.
[00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:34.240]   They might be on to something as well.
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:39.660]   Can you kind of elaborate on some of the arguments about Christians never utilizing IVF?
[00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:41.620]   Yeah, so that's a good point.
[00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:45.340]   To be honest, when I first researched and came across their arguments, and there are
[00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:52.620]   a lot, I honestly thought I was convinced of their position and their interpretation
[00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:54.940]   of scripture.
[00:35:54.940 --> 00:36:01.260]   I would say the way they interpret scripture is mainly in Genesis 1-2 where they get their
[00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:11.500]   stance and seeing how God has created the means of having children, how procreation
[00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:12.780]   ought to happen.
[00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:20.000]   And they would argue that procreation ought to happen within the consummate act of a monogamous
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.200]   heterosexual union.
[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:29.760]   So anything, there cannot and should not be, there should not be procreation or the creation
[00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:33.360]   of children outside of the consummate act.
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:44.780]   They would view the example we have in Genesis 1-2 as sort of prescriptive.
[00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:51.200]   That children have to be created through that manner.
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:53.080]   That is an interesting point of view.
[00:36:53.080 --> 00:37:02.960]   I think it's one to struggle through because there is some merit to it.
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:05.640]   It's not obviously wrong.
[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:11.600]   It seems like a reasonable position that some Christians could believe in.
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:16.640]   And of course, we ought to take the whole totality of scripture in mind, but I think
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:19.120]   there's something there that's worth considering.
[00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:26.640]   And that would be the most common argument for why IVF is morally unpermissible for the
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:27.640]   Christian.
[00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:37.160]   Yeah, you know, I did my own research and we've talked about this at length.
[00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:45.640]   And it's one of those things where it's so difficult because we're talking about life
[00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:49.800]   and just the value that life has.
[00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:53.480]   We're not talking about merely healing someone.
[00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:56.040]   That would be a lot easier.
[00:37:56.040 --> 00:38:05.240]   But when we inject the beginning of life into the equation, to see it as having a different
[00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:07.360]   calculus, I completely understand.
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:13.080]   And I'm saying this because as I sit here today, and I've talked to Jeremiah about this,
[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:22.080]   as I sit here today, I am still personally convinced that there is a morally permissible
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:25.640]   way to use IVF.
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:34.720]   I'm still at that position, but I have to tell you that that position could easily change
[00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:36.640]   six months to a year as I learn more.
[00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:38.280]   Maybe it will never change.
[00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:40.120]   Maybe it will never change.
[00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:47.080]   And so even as I hold to that position, I in no way look at my brother who thinks, "You
[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:50.440]   know what, Christians should never engage in this."
[00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:53.920]   I don't look at that position as irrational, biblically speaking.
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:58.200]   I think, again, I think they are on solid ground.
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:05.640]   And that's difficult because normally when we adopt a doctrinal position, it becomes
[00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:14.080]   difficult to see why someone would hold to a different view, not in the sense that there
[00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:19.360]   isn't any rational ground, but you typically come to a doctrinal position because you're
[00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:20.360]   convinced of it.
[00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:25.800]   At least for myself, I find myself not in that same position when I come to these other
[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:28.360]   doctrinal positions of Scripture.
[00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:36.560]   When I think about this issue, although I am still convinced that a couple may somehow
[00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:47.280]   use the IVF procedure in a biblically permissible way, I easily see myself changing.
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:48.280]   I could.
[00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:49.280]   I could.
[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:50.280]   And again, I could not.
[00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:56.560]   So I want you to kind of speak plainly too because we spoke about, and I'm going to in
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:40:04.160]   the information portion, I'm going to tag Wayne Grudem's argument for IVF, and Jeremiah
[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:09.640]   has also shared that on his blog, and I'm going to tag the counter-argument that is
[00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:10.640]   given as well.
[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:13.800]   But can you kind of share your thoughts on this as well?
[00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:19.200]   Yeah, so I mean, I think after discussions with you, you know, we sort of align on the
[00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:32.480]   same page where certainly I do view IVF as an opportunity for couples to have children.
[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:40.160]   I do believe there is a morally permissible way, but there is certainly so much wrapped
[00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:41.920]   within the IVF process.
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:48.440]   So it's not simply, okay, yes, there is a morally permissible way.
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:52.160]   That seems too simplistic of an answer.
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:58.400]   There's so much wrapped within the process, and like you were sharing, as time goes on
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:03.920]   and as technology changes and as the reality based on statistics changes, that certainly
[00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:07.720]   can shift how we view the technology.
[00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:11.960]   But is there a morally permissible way?
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:19.480]   Of course, that would be my view, but the way it is practiced currently with the sort
[00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:26.920]   of lack of discretion over the number of children created, the just automatic default of freezing
[00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:34.320]   all these children, the genetic testing that goes on, the commodification attitude, everything
[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:42.080]   that's wrapped in IVF is so fraught for the Christian.
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:49.160]   It's such a difficult place to be as a Christian to enter into that realm, to partake of that
[00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:52.880]   and to come out unscathed in any way.
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:42:01.280]   There's so many, in that process, there's much temptation to think unbiblically and
[00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:04.820]   to view children in an unbiblical way.
[00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:11.520]   So while there is a permissible way for the Christian, or at least there seems to be.
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:12.520]   Seems to be, yes, yes.
[00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:13.520]   Maybe there isn't.
[00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:14.520]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:15.520]   Maybe there isn't, who knows.
[00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:17.040]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:20.440]   I think one should enter into it very cautiously.
[00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:25.600]   Yeah, you bring up this point, and again, I want to kind of circle back to this point
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:33.080]   of they do not share, these IVF clinics, again, unless you're going to NEDC or some other
[00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:38.880]   clinic like that, no IVF clinic shares our biblical worldview.
[00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:42.960]   Their worldview is, we're going to get you a genetic child, a normal genetic child.
[00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:48.560]   We'll make sure that it's not one with, you know, God forbid, Down syndrome, God forbid
[00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:50.800]   you don't want to have a child with Down syndrome.
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:56.000]   So that's why you mentioned genetically normal, because that is their goal.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:02.920]   And to achieve that goal, they are not thinking about embryos as children, they're thinking
[00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:05.600]   about embryos as property.
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:07.760]   That's how they're thinking of these embryos.
[00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:12.900]   And so you go into that clinic, and they're going to just start pushing all these things
[00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:13.900]   on you.
[00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:16.840]   You know, genetic testing, do this, freeze them, do this.
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:22.440]   And if you say, you really have to be sober and be like, stop, stop, stop, timeout, timeout,
[00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:24.800]   we're not doing this, we're not doing this, we're not doing this.
[00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:31.040]   Problem is, a lot of people don't even know much of the science to even say, stop, stop,
[00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:33.640]   stop, I don't want to do this, I don't want to do that.
[00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:34.640]   Would you agree, Jermaine?
[00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:35.840]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:44.040]   I think that the understanding that most people go through IVF is simplistic.
[00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:47.900]   It's viewed as just a technology, a means to an end.
[00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:54.240]   And as they engage with the technology, and since the process takes months, they begin
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:57.880]   to get exposed to different parts of the process.
[00:43:57.880 --> 00:44:03.320]   And that's when difficulty comes, because they realize, they face the consequences of
[00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:04.320]   entering in.
[00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:10.440]   And again, I don't want to make it sound like you cannot practice IVF, like there's no way,
[00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:11.440]   there is a way.
[00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:12.440]   Perhaps.
[00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:13.440]   Perhaps.
[00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:22.640]   But you would have to wrestle with a lot of issues prior, because like you're sharing,
[00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:27.480]   when you enter in and the doctor who you view as the one who's going to help you with the
[00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:34.120]   goal of having children paints a picture, are you able to discern that he might not
[00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:43.200]   be painting you all the options, he might not be giving you the reality of what's happening.
[00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:50.160]   There's so many ways to word things, that the idea of even discarding children can seem
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:51.160]   like nothing.
[00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:53.320]   It can even escape your mind.
[00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:58.800]   They can emphasize and focus on the things they know you want, such that you don't even
[00:44:58.800 --> 00:44:59.800]   think about it.
[00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:03.760]   So, I mean, I don't want to paint this really bad picture of these people, but the point
[00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:06.480]   is that they don't share the same worldview.
[00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:12.920]   And so everything they share will be from a sinful perspective, a fallen perspective.
[00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:18.320]   And it's just so important to have that discernment going in and having wrestled through all these
[00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:23.520]   issues and doing your due diligence with regards to the facts and the reality before going
[00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:29.680]   in, because they're not going to, they may not give you all the information that you
[00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:33.240]   need to make an informed decision as a Christian.
[00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:40.040]   Yeah, and I know we've talked about this before, but I want to just put this out there.
[00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:45.600]   I know you're willing, if a couple does want to undergo IVF and they want to undergo it
[00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:51.640]   in a biblically permissible way, I know you're available to speak to and you keep things
[00:45:51.640 --> 00:46:00.560]   confidential and whatever the doctor tells them, they could run it by you to pretty much
[00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:03.320]   interpret what they're saying, right?
[00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:07.000]   I mean, so I know, I don't know if you've done, I feel like you've done that.
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.520]   Have you done that before?
[00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:10.200]   I don't know if I've done that.
[00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:15.920]   Like, I don't know if I don't think, a couple has not necessarily come to me on their own,
[00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:19.280]   you know, having gone through parts of IVF and asked about certain questions, but we've
[00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:23.040]   certainly had dialogues with other couples who are thinking about it or are in the middle
[00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:29.480]   of the process or have done it and so, but yes, you know.
[00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:34.020]   I'm certainly open to discussing it, you know, and like I said, the science changes, so it's
[00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:38.280]   incredibly hard to stay up to date and like you mentioned, it's very nuanced, like we
[00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:43.120]   didn't touch on there's certain circumstances where it's better to freeze than not freeze,
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:44.120]   right?
[00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:48.600]   I mean, that's incredibly nuanced, you know, because it depends on the patient population
[00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:53.280]   and the studies and even how you interpret the studies because as, you know, anyone in
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:58.400]   the healthcare field knows that research, you know, is not always correct, you know,
[00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:02.040]   and just because it's published doesn't mean it's right, it doesn't mean it reflects reality.
[00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:08.920]   So it's incredibly difficult to come to a knowledge of what the reality is, but like
[00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:13.120]   you mentioned, discussion is important, you know, and you know, I'm always willing to
[00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:17.320]   discuss, you know, with couples or people who have come across literature that, you
[00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:19.280]   know, I may not know.
[00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:25.400]   I think we're all on this journey to uncover what is the reality of IVF and as a Christian,
[00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:28.800]   how we ought to think about it, yeah.
[00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:39.160]   You know, I want to leave the listener with a possible scenario, not an, I don't want
[00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:44.480]   to say uncommon, but very possible one, and a possible one is this, they listen to this
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:50.800]   podcast and they decide, okay, we're going to fertilize four eggs, because no matter
[00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:53.280]   what, I'm okay with having four children.
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:57.280]   So no matter what, we will fertilize four eggs.
[00:47:57.280 --> 00:48:01.800]   So let's say you implant one or two, right, and let's say one or two survive.
[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:07.120]   So you end up having one or two kids, and then you have two embryos left.
[00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:13.400]   But suppose after you give birth, the doctor tells you, you have another kid, your wife
[00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:18.160]   might not live, for whatever reason, and there's some kind of medical complication.
[00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:22.320]   You have another kid, your wife might not live, then what do you do?
[00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:25.520]   What do you do with these other two embryos?
[00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:34.160]   You know, I mean, yeah, I mean, that's an incredibly difficult situation, and the beauty
[00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:40.280]   of the gospel is that we have the Holy Spirit, you know, that Christ has given us a helper,
[00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:46.640]   and I think it's a discussion that the couple should have with, you know, the advice of
[00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:55.320]   those they trust, you know, and I would, you know, I would certainly say that you could
[00:48:55.320 --> 00:49:02.560]   see in terms of morality, in terms of what is right and wrong, you can see certainly
[00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:11.960]   the placement of a child for adoption as, you know, a biblically sound decision.
[00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:16.920]   You can also see the woman and, you know, the mother and the father deciding, you know
[00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:20.600]   what, we're going to take the risk, right?
[00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:28.560]   That could be also, you know, a biblically sound decision, as one views it in light of
[00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:34.520]   all the scripture, you know, and trust that the Spirit will convict and guide, you know,
[00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:38.840]   I don't think there's one right answer in this situation.
[00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:45.360]   Yeah, it's tough, and the reason I bring it up is because, you know, we plan one way,
[00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:48.880]   and something like that could easily happen, and that's why when we're talking about life,
[00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:54.440]   I mean, you have to understand what we're talking about, right?
[00:49:54.440 --> 00:49:57.200]   This is life.
[00:49:57.200 --> 00:50:00.160]   This is life.
[00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:07.120]   Yeah, you mentioned there are so many other things that we could talk about.
[00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:12.440]   Let me see here, yeah, we're getting close to the end here, so I didn't want to end here.
[00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:21.240]   My plan is to perhaps circle back around to some of these topics as we learn more, but
[00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:27.000]   again, either one of us, but in particular Jeremiah is more than willing to talk to anyone
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.560]   who is thinking about this decision.
[00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:41.720]   I want to just affirm, Jeremiah and I both know that there are many people who have already
[00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:43.600]   undergone this procedure.
[00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:48.160]   We are not condemning in any way.
[00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:50.080]   We are not trying to do that.
[00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:56.380]   There have been children born through this procedure.
[00:50:56.380 --> 00:50:59.720]   They are a gift from God.
[00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:06.320]   A child that is born, regardless of how they're born, the children are a gift from God.
[00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:14.120]   They are precious, they're human beings in the fullest way.
[00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:22.760]   This has nothing to do with that, and maybe there are some of you listening, maybe perhaps
[00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:28.800]   after listening to this, are convicted.
[00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:35.040]   With any other sin, our Lord is ready to forgive.
[00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:36.800]   He has abundant mercy.
[00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:42.600]   He is waiting for His children to come to Him so that He can eagerly forgive.
[00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:51.680]   I want to make that clear that we are trying to give guidance and disseminate information.
[00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:58.640]   We are not trying to implicitly create some second-class citizen scenario where amongst
[00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:02.120]   the people who are infertile, we're going to judge you this way.
[00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:08.840]   The people who are able to have children naturally, you just got lucky and will never have to
[00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:10.680]   undergo this scrutiny.
[00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:15.880]   That is not what we're trying to do by any means.
[00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:27.500]   Ultimately, talking to couples who faced infertility, it is an incredibly intimate, deep, profound
[00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:34.000]   trial that God allows some couples to go through.
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:35.720]   He does it for His glory.
[00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:40.240]   We know that all things work out for that purpose.
[00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:51.120]   When I uncover IVF and all the concerns I had, there certainly was a fear that I would
[00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:57.600]   just be a discouragement to families that couldn't have children through the normal
[00:52:57.600 --> 00:53:00.360]   biological means.
[00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:08.240]   But again, my desire would be that I would walk in the truth and that as a church, we
[00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:10.520]   would all walk in the truth.
[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:15.280]   We would learn to love everyone.
[00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:21.120]   I think the beauty of IVF, at least as it stands now, is people can have differences
[00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:25.800]   with regards to how they understand IVF.
[00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:33.960]   I certainly don't want to judge a couple simply because they've gone through IVF.
[00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:39.600]   I think the body can be built up as we wrestle and struggle through these issues, learning
[00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:49.200]   to love one another through discussing about these issues.
[00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:56.160]   I just really hope that no one would listen to this and be discouraged, but rather just
[00:53:56.160 --> 00:54:03.360]   be, in a sense, provoked in their heart to dig deeper into God's word and come to a conviction
[00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:13.280]   where they can go about whatever means of family building based upon the conviction
[00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:19.200]   of the Spirit through His word, not being influenced by worldly ideology.
[00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:20.920]   So that's really the desire.
[00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:27.240]   It certainly is not to just close off an avenue for families that are looking to do IVF, but
[00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:34.360]   just really want to inform, because we know of couples who regret their decisions of IVF.
[00:54:34.360 --> 00:54:39.560]   We know of couples who regret creating too many children.
[00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:47.180]   That's incredibly sad to witness because when you see a couple go through that and they
[00:54:47.180 --> 00:54:53.800]   realize that these are their children, but yet they're of an age or in a context where
[00:54:53.800 --> 00:55:00.920]   they can't bring them outside the womb, that's a really difficult place to be in.
[00:55:00.920 --> 00:55:08.880]   Or we know of families where they create a lot of children and for one reason or another
[00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:17.560]   those children got killed, whether intentionally or unintentionally, because some clinics don't
[00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:21.200]   really have much discretion with regards to the discard process and mistakes are made
[00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:23.760]   at times.
[00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:30.760]   That's just a difficult consequence for someone to have to deal with.
[00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:38.240]   We hope that by informing about some of these things that we can spare people of those heartaches
[00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:43.720]   and ultimately just build up the body to think critically about these issues.
[00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:47.720]   Yeah, well, that's good.
[00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:50.280]   I'm glad you got to...
[00:55:50.280 --> 00:56:02.440]   Thanks for sharing your heart because that brings the sense of why you're so passionate
[00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:07.200]   about this subject and you've seen the hurt.
[00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:14.120]   All right, that brings us to the end.
[00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:19.360]   Thanks for listening so far and we will end here.
[00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:26.120]   As you probably picked up on, there are many facets and many consequences when considering
[00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:28.520]   undergoing IVF.
[00:56:28.520 --> 00:56:32.920]   So in future episodes in this series, my hope is to break down some of the more finer points
[00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:36.640]   of IVF with Dr. Jeremiah Chang.
[00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:38.880]   Obviously, he'll be doing the breaking down.
[00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:42.760]   I'll just be asking the questions, but we want to do something a little bit more finer
[00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:45.440]   than even what we went into here.
[00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:49.680]   And as long as this episode was, it was about an hour, Jeremiah and I both agreed at the
[00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:58.320]   end of this episode that this was a flyover rather than a robust discussion that we want
[00:56:58.320 --> 00:56:59.920]   to have.
[00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:07.380]   So in future episodes, we'll take one of these points and break it down even further
[00:57:07.380 --> 00:57:14.200]   so that we can bring the listener along to the thinking and the rationale behind various
[00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:17.160]   positions.
[00:57:17.160 --> 00:57:19.200]   Thanks for making it to the end.
[00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:23.040]   I'll continue to try to make the journey worth it.
[00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:39.240]   To Him be honor, glory, and eternal dominion.
[00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:57.640]   Amen.
[00:57:57.640 --> 00:58:00.220]   (upbeat music)
[00:58:00.220 --> 00:58:02.800]   (upbeat music)
