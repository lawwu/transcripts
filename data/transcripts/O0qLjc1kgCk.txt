[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Okay, let's talk about mouthwash or mouthwashes plural.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.680]   At the beginning of today's episode, I said,
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.240]   let's determine what category of oral health you are in.
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.240]   Are you somebody who pays a lot of attention to oral health?
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.400]   You brush and floss at least twice a day.
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.920]   You're using mouthwashes, tooth whiteners, perhaps as well.
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.160]   Or are you in category two or three?
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.900]   Well, here's the deal.
[00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.040]   Most all, most all, not all, but most all mouthwashes,
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.880]   especially those containing alcohol
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.440]   are terrible for oral health.
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.720]   Simply put, they deplete certain components
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.440]   of the mucosal lining of the mouth,
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.820]   and they disrupt the healthy components
[00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.760]   of the oral microbiome.
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.900]   So for those of you that rely on such mouthwashes,
[00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.840]   I would really encourage you to learn more about them.
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:54.880]   You're about to do that now.
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.080]   You're already doing that now.
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.020]   And to really consider whether or not they are helping
[00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.880]   or harming your oral health.
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.080]   Now, I'm not suggesting that you create a scenario
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.120]   where your breath is causing other people to dissolve
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.120]   into a puddle of tears or back away from you quickly.
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.960]   That's not what you want.
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:10.800]   That's not what I want.
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.160]   That's not what anyone wants.
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.200]   But I think it's important to realize
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.580]   that these alcohol-based mouthwashes are not good for us.
[00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.920]   In addition, there are antiseptic mouthwashes,
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.600]   some of which contain alcohol, some of which don't,
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.440]   which sometimes are prescribed
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.720]   for very serious bacterial overgrowth
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.800]   and infections of the oral cavity.
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.600]   If your dentist or physician or periodontist
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.880]   prescribes those, I certainly am not going to try
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.720]   and get in the way of that prescription.
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.460]   That's between you and your healthcare professional.
[00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.600]   But you would be wise to ask them whether or not
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.720]   these chlorhexidine-type mouthwashes, et cetera,
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.600]   are potentially bad for other components of oral health
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.840]   or microbiota in the gut generally.
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.640]   Because in some cases, they have been shown
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.160]   to be not good for us.
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.680]   At the same time, we don't want overproliferation
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.520]   of really bad bacteria in the mouth,
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.160]   so we don't want infections to run wild either.
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.280]   Most people, however, are using mouthwashes
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.000]   to freshen their breath and to kill off additional bacteria
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.880]   in the mouth that they might believe they couldn't get
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.600]   with brushing or flossing.
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.360]   If you are somebody who really wants to use a mouthwash
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.400]   for that reason, I encourage you to try
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.680]   and find a mouthwash that is not alcohol-based
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.840]   and that is not a strong antiseptic,
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.600]   or that if it is an antiseptic,
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.480]   that it's not alcohol-based, okay?
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.060]   And such mouthwashes exist out there.
[00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.320]   They're a little bit hard to find.
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.640]   I'll provide a link to at least a couple of them
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.160]   in the "Show Note" captions.
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.100]   Here, I have to say I have not tried those mouthwashes yet.
[00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.480]   They do come from sources in which they were developed
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.060]   by licensed dental healthcare professionals,
[00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.600]   but this is always the case
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.320]   when somebody's selling something,
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.800]   it's worthwhile to do diligence.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.640]   Now, as we talk about toothpaste and mints and gums
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.040]   and mouthwashes, I think it's worth taking a step back
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.840]   and also asking the question,
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.440]   are there any zero or very, very low cost
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.000]   or even cost-saving alternatives to any of this?
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.100]   And the great answer is yes.
[00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.080]   There are actually a number of things that you can do
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.720]   with basic over-the-counter stuff from the grocery store
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.120]   that all the dentists I spoke to said,
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.560]   yeah, that's a pretty good option.
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.680]   It's not the best option available perhaps,
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.920]   but it's a pretty good option.
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.540]   And in many cases, it's better
[00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.240]   than the typical commercially available toothpaste
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.080]   or mouthwash.
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.440]   For instance, I would imagine,
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.940]   based on everything I now know about the structure of teeth,
[00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.960]   that using something like baking soda to brush the teeth
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.280]   would indeed scrape off the biofilm,
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.840]   perhaps even whiten the teeth a little bit,
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:36.960]   although as we talked about earlier,
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.120]   you're not really whitening the teeth,
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.800]   you're actually just changing the reflectiveness
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.160]   and some of the composition of that enamel,
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.900]   which is translucent so that you can see
[00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.480]   the underlying components better.
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.760]   Well, I talked to several dentists
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.320]   and they told me that baking soda actually is fairly low
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.320]   on the abrasiveness rating scale.
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.840]   They have a specific rating scale for this
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.040]   that we don't have to go into,
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.800]   but it's actually considered quite safe
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:01.820]   for the enamel of the teeth,
[00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.960]   especially if you're brushing with a soft toothbrush
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.720]   and you're not like really grinding the stuff
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.000]   against your teeth at maximum intensity
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.900]   or even near maximum intensity.
[00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.560]   So it turns out that baking soda and water
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.740]   is actually a pretty good toothpaste
[00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.160]   if you're not going to go buy a toothpaste.
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.220]   So that's good news.
[00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.800]   Now, you may have heard that you can make
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.560]   a sort of mouthwash or mouth rinse with baking soda,
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.640]   water, and a little bit of hydrogen peroxide.
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.480]   I want to emphasize a little bit,
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.920]   but I'm also going to emphasize,
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.020]   I don't think this is a good idea at all.
[00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.600]   Why is it not a good idea at all?
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.040]   Well, first of all, when we were kids,
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.160]   we used to take baking soda and hydrogen peroxide
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.160]   and put them together to simulate volcanoes.
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.960]   So that tells you right there,
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.620]   the kind of chemical reaction that you're going to get.
[00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.040]   But in addition to that,
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.320]   it's pretty clear that hydrogen peroxide,
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.240]   unless there's a specific medical recommendation to do so,
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.880]   is not something you want to introduce to the oral cavity.
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.160]   Now, this is something that I'm very familiar with
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.560]   because when I was a postdoc,
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.520]   so this is in the 2005 to 2010 stretch,
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.480]   I started to get some pretty bad canker sores.
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.240]   I don't know about you, but canker sores feel awful to me.
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.120]   I hate them.
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.520]   When you eat, they hurt.
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.480]   When you swallow, they hurt.
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.200]   When you do anything, they pretty much hurt.
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.780]   And someone gave me the recommendation
[00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.920]   to use a little bit of baking soda dissolved in some water
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.400]   and a little bit of hydrogen peroxide
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.900]   and to use that as a oral rinse.
[00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.260]   And of course, then to spit it out.
[00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:25.180]   And I did that.
[00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.500]   And actually what happened to me
[00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.820]   is I got almost quarter-sized ulcers
[00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.460]   on the roof of my mouth and on the sides of my mouth.
[00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.100]   It took those little canker sores,
[00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.760]   which were annoying and kind of painful,
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.500]   and turned them into full-blown ulcers.
[00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.540]   I know this because when I stopped using it,
[00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.320]   those healed up almost immediately.
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.700]   And then when I spoke to some dentists and periodontists,
[00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:44.540]   they said, "Oh yeah, yeah.
[00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.760]   "Hydrogen peroxide is just far too abrasive
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:47.740]   "for the mouth cavity."
[00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.580]   And the reason I raise this is because
[00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.680]   I don't think I'm alone in that if you kind of venture
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.500]   into some of the, let's call it,
[00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.900]   alternative recommendation space for oral health,
[00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.700]   you may hear that things like hydrogen peroxide
[00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.680]   can be useful for gargling with or swishing with
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.780]   if you are starting to get a little bit of a throat tickle,
[00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:07.820]   maybe an infection.
[00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.220]   It turns out it's a really bad idea.
[00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.440]   Now, if there are physicians or oral health experts
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.580]   out there that strongly believe in the use
[00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.420]   of hydrogen peroxide rinses or gargling with it
[00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:20.380]   to promote oral health for any reason,
[00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.800]   let me know in the show note captions.
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.700]   I don't wanna go against any of those recommendations,
[00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:27.560]   but this now considered kind of old school recommendation
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.940]   of creating one's own mouthwash
[00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:31.080]   with a little bit of baking soda,
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.260]   some hydrogen peroxide and water,
[00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:34.800]   does not seem like a good idea,
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.080]   not just based on my experience,
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.880]   but every one of the dental professionals that I spoke to.
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:43.880]   That said, it does seem that creating a high salt solution,
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.720]   so taking some salt, putting it in water, dissolving it,
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.600]   and then finding the point at which it won't quite dissolve
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.520]   because the concentration of sodium is just high enough,
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.880]   and using that as, of course, not something to swallow,
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.240]   but rather as a dental rinse,
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.080]   so putting your mouth and swishing it around,
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.440]   and then spitting it out,
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:01.800]   and it's gonna taste very salty,
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.980]   and then taking a swig of water, just plain water,
[00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.560]   and then swishing it around and then spitting it out,
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.740]   that actually provides a really nice milieu
[00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:14.900]   for the production of healthy mouth bacteria.
[00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.920]   It's near zero cost.
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:17.960]   I suppose you need a little bit of salt,
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.760]   a little water, and a glass to put it in,
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:22.560]   but it's basically zero cost.
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.160]   And if you think about it,
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.480]   that high saline or high salinity solution
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.000]   is a lot like the sort of brines
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.040]   and the liquid that comes from these low sugar
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:36.660]   probiotic foods that earlier I was suggesting,
[00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:38.160]   and in other episodes I've suggested
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.200]   could be really healthy
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.200]   for swallowing for the gut microbiota.
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:42.320]   But again, I wanna be very clear.
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:47.320]   Do not, do not swallow high salt concentration fluid.
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:50.840]   We're talking about a swish and then a spitting it out
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:54.940]   as a way to improve the overall milieu of the mouth,
[00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:56.280]   to get their pH right,
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.400]   to promote the proliferation
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:00.320]   of healthy microbiota components.
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.560]   Okay, so we've talked about some commercially available
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:05.000]   gums and mints containing xylitol.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.500]   We've talked about some commercially available toothpaste,
[00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.140]   indeed some toothpaste that, you know,
[00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:12.320]   almost fall into the very boutique category
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.700]   because they have all these things that are known by dentists
[00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:17.480]   and periodontists to be great for oral health,
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:20.020]   but those can run some cost, right?
[00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:23.100]   And so I do think it's important that we also talked about
[00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:25.540]   the use of just baking soda with a soft toothbrush
[00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:27.780]   and some water and gently brushing the teeth
[00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:30.940]   as a great way to disrupt the biofilm and clean your teeth,
[00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:33.780]   and a high salt solution as a swish and spit,
[00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:37.900]   followed by, you know, swish and spit with clear water,
[00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:39.960]   clean water, no salt in it,
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:44.940]   as a essentially very low cost or zero cost mouthwash,
[00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:48.560]   far in a way different from the heavily scented
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:50.760]   alcohol-based antiseptic mouthwashes
[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:51.880]   that are commercially available
[00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.520]   and that we know are basically not good
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.200]   for our oral microbiome.
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.560]   In addition, I'd like to point out
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:59.600]   that those alcohol-based mouthwashes
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.600]   that many people in the world use
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.640]   are also known to reduce the amount of nitric oxide
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.560]   that's produced in the oral cavity,
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.880]   and that's very important
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:12.360]   for the production of nitric oxide elsewhere in the body.
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.240]   Why is that important?
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:16.120]   Well, nitric oxide promotes vasodilation,
[00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:19.060]   not just within the blood vessels
[00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:21.080]   that line and feed the oral cavity,
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.400]   but also the throat, also in the nose,
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:25.280]   also in the brain, also in the heart.
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:27.320]   So what we're talking about here is a substance
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:31.080]   that is indeed increased when we, for instance,
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.520]   nasal breathe, we know that,
[00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.440]   dramatically increases nitric oxide.
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:36.520]   We're talking about a substance
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.920]   that when the oral microbiome is preserved
[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:43.040]   in its healthy state, tends to increase in production.
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.280]   And we're talking about a substance
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.840]   that's really good for small capillary,
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.680]   vein, and arterial health,
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:51.400]   because it allows for the passage of blood,
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.000]   both for the delivery of oxygen
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.540]   and other nutrients to tissues,
[00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:57.080]   but also the removal of waste products from tissues.
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:00.680]   So we don't want to do anything that reduces nitric oxide
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:02.880]   unless there's some specific medical condition
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.880]   that leads us to want to do that.
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.200]   So for most people, increasing nitric oxide
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.560]   or keeping nitric oxide levels stable
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:12.320]   is the state that we want to seek.
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.480]   And these alcohol-based mouthwashes
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:17.180]   are known to deplete the production of nitric oxide.
[00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:19.240]   So there's yet another reason to avoid the use
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.640]   of these alcohol-based,
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:23.400]   more typical over-the-counter mouthwashes.
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:27.180]   By the way, this is not a scare tactic against mouthwashes.
[00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:29.100]   I'm sure that if you use mouthwashes,
[00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.220]   you're still producing some nitric oxide.
[00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:35.120]   But I think nowadays, many, hopefully all of you,
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:36.920]   are interested in doing whatever you can
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.460]   to improve your mental health,
[00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:39.880]   physical health, and performance.
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.200]   And if there are things that you are doing
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.020]   that are inhibiting those in any way,
[00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:45.720]   that you'd potentially want to at least think about those,
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.360]   maybe remove them from your protocols,
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.840]   especially if there's a cost to them that you can remove.
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:52.400]   In other words, you can save on costs.
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.320]   So again, lots of reasons to move away
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:57.560]   from the alcohol-based standard antiseptic mouthwashes.
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:00.060]   Aside from the improvement in your breath,
[00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:01.920]   that by the way, can be better achieved
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:03.420]   by supporting the oral microbiome
[00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:05.160]   other ways that we've discussed,
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:06.960]   there's really no clear advantage
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.580]   as to why one would use one.
[00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:11.620]   And there apparently are a number of disadvantages.
[00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:14.200]   [upbeat music]
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:17.620]   [upbeat music]
[00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:19.420]   (upbeat music)
