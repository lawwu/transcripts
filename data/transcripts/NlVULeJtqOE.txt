[00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.300]   So there's a shortification.
[00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.900]   And contrary to what most people say,
[00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.720]   they're like, we don't have the attention span.
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.000]   It's like if you took TikTok to someone in the 1800s,
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.020]   they would still watch it, right?
[00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.060]   It's not the human attention span that got shorter.
[00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.360]   It's just that we are better at telling stories quicker.
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.220]   I don't need 400 pages to explain to you how to cook an egg.
[00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:18.920]   I could probably do it in 20 seconds with a YouTube short.
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.100]   Similarly, I think some people take way too long
[00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.300]   to get to the damn point.
[00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.620]   Even like an Instagram post,
[00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.940]   it's like a picture and like a paragraph of text
[00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.440]   is about as much as you need
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.520]   to explain a lot of different concepts.
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.240]   I use what I call like a caveman voice.
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.160]   That's my little hack.
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.940]   We're like in my head, I'm like this dumb caveman.
[00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.520]   I barely pay attention to what I'm reading,
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.380]   which is how most people are reading your stuff.
[00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.020]   I try to think with that person just scrolling by,
[00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.440]   find this interesting or not.
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.600]   And if it's too long,
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.020]   if it looks like a big block of text,
[00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.720]   that's kind of boring.
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.300]   And even I'm having trouble staying awake and reading it,
[00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.820]   that I just absolutely ax it, just ruthless.
[00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.460]   So the shortification of everything,
[00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.260]   can you say all of this stuff in one page
[00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.440]   or even one paragraph rather than 10?
