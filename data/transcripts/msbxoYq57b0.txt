[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.560]   I would call your attention once more to this great argument of the Apostle Paul in the
[00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:12.520]   ninth chapter of the Epistle to the Romans, running from verse 19 to the end of verse
[00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:13.520]   24.
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:23.840]   Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault for who hath resisted his will?
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:30.680]   Nay, but, O men, who art thou that replyest against God, shall the thing formed say to
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.760]   him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:42.080]   Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour,
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.480]   and another unto dishonour?
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:51.920]   What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.280]   longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction?
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.520]   And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:10.880]   had aforeprepared unto glory, even us, whom he hath called not of the Jews only, but also
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:11.880]   of the Gentiles?
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.120]   Now, we have reached the end of this great argument.
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:23.760]   The apostle is replying to that suggestion that he puts before us in the 19th verse.
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.760]   People have argued, 'Why does God find fault if it's a question of his choice, if salvation
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.520]   is entirely and only and solely his action?
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.000]   Why does he find fault with anybody, therefore?'
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.640]   And the apostle proceeds to answer that question, and we've been following him through the argument.
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.400]   Now, we are dealing with the latter part of the argument now, the part that he develops
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.400]   in verses 22, 23, and 24.
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.760]   In 22, he says, 'What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known,
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.960]   endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction?
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:02.960]   Why shouldn't he?'
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.400]   That's what it really amounts to.
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:13.240]   God in the display of his wrath upon sin is manifesting his power and his wrath and his
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:20.440]   whole hatred of sin, and he has chosen to do so in this longsuffering manner.
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.440]   Why shouldn't he?
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.440]   That's the question.
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:30.040]   But then we've gone on to start considering the extraordinary statement in verse 23, 'And
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.720]   that he might make known the riches of his glory and the vessels of mercy, which he had
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:41.240]   aforeprepared unto glory, even us, whom he hath called not of the Jews only, but also
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.240]   of the Gentiles.'
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.240]   The apostle's argument, in other words, is this.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.880]   Everything that God does is a manifestation of himself.
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.040]   In all his actions, God reveals something of himself.
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:04.120]   Now, way back in the first chapter, the apostle had told us, in verse 19 and following, how
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.640]   God in creation had made something of himself known, because he says, 'That which may be
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.280]   known of God is manifest in them, for God hath showed it unto them.
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:21.600]   For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:29.120]   by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.440]   excuse.'
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:38.600]   In other words, the creation does reveal and manifest to us God's eternal power and Godhead.
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:45.280]   You look at creation, and if you have eyes to see, you will see God the Creator, and
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.680]   all the wisdom and the power that he displays in that way.
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:58.360]   I say that everything that God does is a manifestation of some aspect or other of his character and
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.360]   of his being.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.160]   And what the apostle is saying here is this, that in the manifestation of his wrath, God
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.040]   is making something known about himself.
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:15.040]   And in exactly the same way, in the manifestation of mercy, he is making known another aspect
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.800]   of his great and his glorious being.
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:24.640]   And here the apostle puts it in this most wonderful phrase that we began to consider
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:30.800]   last Friday night, 'the riches of his glory.'
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:38.940]   And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy which he
[00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.000]   had aforeprepared unto glory, even us.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.640]   Now this is a very wonderful thing.
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.760]   I don't know what you have been feeling about all this as you have thought about it and
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.080]   meditated about it during this past week.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:02.560]   This term, 'the riches of his glory,' hasn't it come to you as a bit of a surprise to find
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.760]   such a statement, such a phrase, in such a context?
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.280]   How foolish we are as we read the Scriptures.
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.040]   So many people say, 'Oh, I don't read the ninth of Romans.
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.520]   That's that difficult passage there.
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.760]   Nothing there but the predestination and the sovereignty of God and so on.
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.760]   Hard and dry doctrine.'
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.000]   So many people regard this chapter as a kind of wilderness.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.400]   And yet here you see suddenly we come across one of the brightest nuggets in the whole
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:36.120]   of the Bible, 'the riches of his glory.'
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.280]   Have you ever heard anybody, when they are talking about Romans 9, referring to this
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.280]   phrase?
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.400]   Isn't it rather odd?
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.120]   Isn't there something wrong with us?
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.360]   That we can never refer to Romans 9 without saying, 'Ah, that's the chapter in which
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:55.800]   we read about the riches of his glory.'
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.880]   I wonder how many of us, if we were quite honest, would have to admit that we never
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:05.460]   knew that that phrase was in Romans 9 at all, and that we thought there was nothing there
[00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:10.920]   but this argumentation and this tremendous statement about the sovereignty of God.
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:11.920]   Here it is.
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.800]   Well, I say all that in passing.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.640]   Never read the Scriptures casually.
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:23.800]   Always be surprised for something unexpected and surprising, something glorious, something
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:24.800]   wonderful.
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:30.960]   In the middle of a great argument, suddenly you find, I say, this priceless gem, 'the
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.680]   riches of his glory.'
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.920]   Well, what the apostle is saying is this, that God has chosen to make known the riches
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:47.280]   of his glory in his kindness, his mercy, his compassion toward those of us who are Christians.
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:53.320]   And what we are now doing is we are trying to look at different aspects of this riches.
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:59.760]   You see, we are like people who, having been in some sort of desert, if you like, burrowing
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:07.040]   our way along, following a track, suddenly find ourselves suddenly discovering some great
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.200]   palace with golden doors.
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:14.640]   And we've gone in and we are going from chamber to chamber and room to room looking at this
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:22.320]   amazing wealth, the unsearchable riches of Christ, the exceeding riches of God's grace.
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:23.800]   That's what we are doing.
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:24.800]   Well, now, we've started.
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.240]   We've been through some of the rules.
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:32.200]   We've seen that the riches of God's glory are shown in the fact that he has anything
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.280]   to do with us at all.
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:38.880]   If God had exercised only his justice and his righteousness, we would all have been
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:39.880]   damned.
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.760]   There would never have been such a thing as a Christian.
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:45.960]   For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.
[00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:49.040]   The whole world lieth guilty before God.
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:55.160]   And if he were merely a God of justice, he could rightly, and with absolute justice,
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:59.640]   have consigned the whole human race to everlasting perdition.
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:03.200]   And nobody would have any right to complain at all.
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:10.440]   For mere fact that he's ever looked upon us, any of us, even one of us, is indicative
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:15.520]   in and of itself of the riches of his glory.
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:21.200]   And then we looked at the glory of the plan itself, that God troubled about us before
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:27.920]   the foundation of the world and worked out this extraordinary scheme, the three persons
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.840]   in the Trinity involved and what it meant for them.
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:33.240]   We've looked at that.
[00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:40.480]   And then we looked at the working out of this in the Old Testament, this confession, how
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:45.520]   God kept it going, the way he handled those children of Israel.
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:46.880]   It's marvelous.
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:53.200]   The wisdom and the power and the love of God, the irresistibility of the grace of God.
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:58.280]   It's all there staring us in the face in the Old Testament, if we but take the trouble
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:59.280]   to look for it.
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:05.240]   This line that runs right away through God's increasing and developing purpose, the riches
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.680]   of his glory.
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:17.480]   But now we come to what is in many ways the central chamber of all in this palace of riches,
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:26.280]   the riches of God's glory and grace, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:30.640]   Let me remind you again of the words of Isaac Watts.
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:36.400]   I think he's put this perfectly.
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:45.040]   See where it shines in Jesus' face, the brightest image of his grace.
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:52.480]   God in the person of his Son has all his mightiest works outdone.
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:10:00.320]   The spacious earth, the spreading flood, proclaim the wise and powerful God.
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:08.080]   And thy rich glories from afar sparkle in every rolling star.
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:18.520]   But in his looks a glory stands, the noblest labor of thy hands, the radiant luster of
[00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:25.400]   his eyes outshines the wonders of the skies.
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.480]   And so it does.
[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:35.080]   God who commended the light to shine out of darkness has shined in our hearts to give
[00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:43.920]   the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:52.560]   The riches of his glory are to be seen ultimately all concentrated together in the face of Jesus
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:53.560]   Christ.
[00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:58.920]   Well, of course, this is something that no man can describe.
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.520]   It's indescribable.
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:05.400]   We can but look at it and glimpse at it.
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:12.040]   You see something of this glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ even in the Old Testament.
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:18.640]   Every time the angel of the covenant appears, that's who he is, the special servant of
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:19.640]   the Lord.
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:22.080]   That's who he is.
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:28.360]   He is the Lord Jesus Christ coming down in that particular form as a theophany in order
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:32.960]   to prepare for his eventual coming as he came in Bethlehem.
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:36.760]   You can find it then in the Old Testament.
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:44.320]   But of course, it's when you come to the New Testament you really begin to see it.
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.720]   This is how the apostle himself puts it elsewhere.
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.920]   He's never tired of putting this.
[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:54.360]   He never comes across this, but that he goes off into some sort of apostrophe, can't
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:55.360]   contain himself.
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:12:01.280]   Here's one of them, and without controversy.
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:04.240]   Great is the mystery of godliness.
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:10.720]   God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the spirit, seen of angels, preached unto
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:17.560]   the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.840]   The riches of his glory.
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:23.000]   Yes, says John, we beheld him.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.120]   That was 1 Timothy 3.16, of course.
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:32.760]   There it is again in John 1.14, "And we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:39.120]   begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth."
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:44.000]   Or if you like, in the first verses of the first epistle of John.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.320]   It's the same thing everywhere.
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:51.160]   John begins his epistle like this, "That which was from the beginning, which we have
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:56.280]   heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:58.040]   of the word of life.
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:03.600]   For the life was manifested, and we have seen it and bear witness, and show unto you that
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:09.560]   eternal life, which was with the Father and was manifested unto us."
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:15.200]   And then there are those wonderful pictures of it in the book of Revelation.
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:18.120]   Well now, this is what we are talking about.
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:26.080]   The riches of God's glory are to be seen supremely in the person of his Son.
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:29.720]   Think of the incarnation.
[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:39.840]   How God sent forth his Son from heaven to be made of a woman, made under the law.
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.740]   This is the riches of God's glory.
[00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:43.920]   Why did he ever come?
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:48.720]   He came for us, to save us, that mercy might be shown to us.
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.960]   The very thing the apostle is talking about.
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:59.160]   God, he says, is making known the riches of his glory in and through us, the vessels of
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:00.160]   mercy.
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:09.120]   So you see, there it is in the incarnation, the whole coming, the virgin birth.
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:15.760]   How the eternal Son of God, the Word, the eternal Word, was indeed made flesh and dwelt
[00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:21.600]   among us, was born as a helpless babe in that stable and put into the manger.
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:25.360]   This is the riches of God's glory.
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:30.320]   And it's all, you see, for us, that we might receive this mercy.
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:35.120]   Oh, I mustn't keep you, but work through it all for yourselves.
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.920]   That's how you see the riches of God's glory.
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.780]   Look at his life.
[00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:42.280]   Look at the poverty that he knew.
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.820]   Look at the suffering that he endured.
[00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:47.640]   Look at the temptations to which he was subjected.
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:52.920]   God neither tempteth any men nor can be tempted, but he was tempted in all points, like as
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:55.600]   we are, yet without sin.
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:56.600]   Why?
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:03.000]   Well, the answer given is this, in order that he might be a faithful and a sympathetic high
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.040]   priest for us.
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:07.760]   He went through all that.
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:10.800]   His Father sent him through all that for our sakes.
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:18.520]   You see the riches of God's glory in that he has done this for us.
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:24.040]   And then, of course, supremely, you see it in his death upon the cross on Calvary's
[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.040]   hill.
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:36.460]   "When I surveyed the wondrous cross on which the Prince of Glory died, my riches gained
[00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:41.920]   I count but loss and poor contempt on all my pride.
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:47.740]   See from his head, his hands, his feet, sorrow and love flow mingling down.
[00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:55.060]   Did e'er such love and sorrow meet, or thorns compose so rich a crown?"
[00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:58.180]   There it is.
[00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:01.060]   Look at the cross.
[00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:02.060]   What is it?
[00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:09.340]   Oh, this is the most wonderful of all the wonderful manifestations of the riches of
[00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:10.340]   God's glory.
[00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:18.500]   That is where you see the love of God, in that he has made his only begotten, dearly
[00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:26.860]   beloved Son to be sin for us, and is smiting his own beloved.
[00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:27.860]   What for?
[00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:36.340]   For us, the vessels of mercy, that we might not share the fate of the vessels of wrath.
[00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:42.240]   It was all done for us, and it is there, you see, the riches of God's glory and grace
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:44.440]   that he should ever have done such a thing.
[00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:49.540]   But he has done it, and he has done it for us.
[00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:52.540]   He has tasted death for us.
[00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:59.940]   He was made a little lower than the angels, says Hebrews 2, 9, for the suffering of death.
[00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:03.340]   Well, there it is, I say.
[00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:08.820]   And then you go on, you see him dying, and you see them taking down his body and burying
[00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:11.820]   him in a grave.
[00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:14.740]   Buried.
[00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:17.660]   Literally buried in a grave.
[00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:24.300]   The one through whom and by whom all things were made, and without whom was nothing made
[00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:26.420]   that is made.
[00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:28.980]   Buried in a grave.
[00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:30.980]   And then the mighty resurrection.
[00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:38.060]   Here is the glory of God, the master over everything.
[00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:43.620]   The devil and hell and death, everything, everything is under his power.
[00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:44.620]   And he raised him again.
[00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:45.620]   Why?
[00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:51.140]   Because we have already had the answer at the end of the fourth chapter of this great
[00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:52.140]   epistle.
[00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:57.860]   "Who was delivered for our offenses and was raised again for our justification."
[00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:00.780]   And it is God who has done it all.
[00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:05.580]   God in all this is displaying the riches of his glory.
[00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:06.580]   And then the ascension.
[00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:10.220]   Oh, the apostle is repeating what he has already said.
[00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:15.220]   He is summing up what he has been saying so gloriously at the end of the eighth chapter
[00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:17.220]   in this one phrase.
[00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:20.580]   You remember how we looked at it together.
[00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:24.020]   Who is, "Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect?
[00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:26.720]   It is God that justifieth, who is he that condemneth.
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:30.780]   It is Christ that died here, rather that is risen again, who is even at the right hand
[00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:34.540]   of God, who also maketh intercession for us."
[00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:39.780]   And there he is waiting until his enemies shall be made his footstool.
[00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:40.780]   And that is not the end.
[00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:46.420]   He will come again and receive us unto himself and wind up the whole process.
[00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:55.460]   The glory of God, the riches of his glory, seen supremely, I say, in the face of Jesus
[00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:58.680]   Christ.
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:02.420]   But the thing, of course, that the apostle is emphasizing and that I must therefore emphasize
[00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:10.220]   is this, that the object and the purpose of all this was to make known the riches of his
[00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:16.660]   glory on the vessels of mercy, even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but
[00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:21.420]   also of the Gentiles.
[00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:28.700]   And if we are not thrilled to the very depth of our being at the contemplation of that,
[00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:33.340]   I wonder whether we are Christians.
[00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:38.740]   The riches of his glory is seen in and through us.
[00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:41.780]   All this has happened for us.
[00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:44.780]   But wait, we must go on.
[00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:49.300]   We now turn and look at the riches of God's glory as seen in the work and the person,
[00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:54.060]   the person and the work of the Holy Spirit in this connection.
[00:19:54.060 --> 00:20:00.460]   And here, of course, there is that great crucial event of his coming on the day of Pentecost
[00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:04.260]   and the dispensation which has followed ever since then.
[00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:09.380]   Again, something of the glory of God through the Holy Spirit is seen in the Old Testament,
[00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:14.060]   how he came upon certain men and gave them certain abilities, architectural and other
[00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:19.660]   abilities, how he gave the ability to the prophets to prophesy, to reveal truth to them
[00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:22.340]   and enable them to record it and to write it.
[00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:28.260]   This is something of the riches of God's glory because it was all done for us.
[00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:30.340]   It is all a part of this process.
[00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:35.140]   We would never have had anything of this at all if God had not decided to show his mercy
[00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:37.700]   upon these vessels of mercy.
[00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:42.020]   None of this would have ever come into being or into existence at all.
[00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:48.060]   So there it is, even in the preparation we see something of the glory of God in the person
[00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:49.900]   and the work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:54.660]   You see it even before that in his work of creation and so on.
[00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:59.380]   But it is again only as you come to the New Testament that you begin to see this at all
[00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:02.740]   plainly and clearly.
[00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:10.420]   In John's Gospel, chapters 14 to 16, all this is revealed in a peculiar manner.
[00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:15.340]   Our Lord says he is going to send this other comforter and says what he is going to do,
[00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:18.220]   what he will be like and what he will do and so on.
[00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:24.780]   And it is all a part of this great purpose, this plan, this scheme of God for our salvation,
[00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:31.460]   seen then in the person and the work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:38.460]   But come let us look at that in particular by putting it under our next heading.
[00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:45.180]   The riches of God's glory as they are to be seen in us.
[00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:48.940]   We are the vessels of mercy.
[00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:54.260]   And as I reminded you last week, the apostles' argument in writing to the Ephesians is that
[00:21:54.260 --> 00:22:00.260]   it is in and through us and what he does with us that God shows this aspect of his glory
[00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:04.500]   even to the principalities and powers in the heavenly places.
[00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:10.580]   And the ages to come likewise are going to see it in his kindness toward us through Jesus
[00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:15.140]   Christ.
[00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:19.300]   Very well then, we must concentrate on this, and the apostle helps us to do so.
[00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:22.580]   Listen to the way he puts it.
[00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:30.340]   And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy which he
[00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:35.180]   had aforeprepared unto glory, even us.
[00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:44.060]   Now then, here is the phrase, aforeprepared, which means prepared before heaven.
[00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:45.380]   And this is a wonderful phrase.
[00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:53.180]   You remember that in dealing with the phrase, fitted to destruction, in verse 22, I told
[00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:59.860]   you that we would have to emphasize the difference between that and this phrase in verse 23.
[00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:03.980]   With regard to the vessels of wrath, all we are told about them is that they are fitted
[00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:05.340]   to destruction.
[00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:08.180]   We are not told that God has fitted them, but they are fitted.
[00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:09.420]   They are fitted themselves.
[00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:14.180]   They are partly fitted by the fall of Adam, but they are equally fitted themselves.
[00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:22.180]   And here they are ripe for the wrath of God and destruction, fitted, but not by God.
[00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:28.540]   But when it comes to us, the vessels of mercy, what we are told is which he, God himself,
[00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:33.900]   had prepared before him unto glory.
[00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:34.900]   What does it mean?
[00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:40.180]   Well, once more, of course, it is nothing but a kind of recapitulation.
[00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:42.780]   It is the apostle summing up.
[00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:48.020]   What he has already told us in great detail and in a most wonderful manner in chapter
[00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:52.780]   8, and especially in verses 28 to 30.
[00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:56.500]   What does he mean by saying that God has prepared us beforehand for glory?
[00:23:56.500 --> 00:24:00.860]   Well, partly what he means is this.
[00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:04.540]   We know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are
[00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:11.380]   the called according to his purpose, for whom he did foreknow.
[00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:17.340]   You see, what the apostle is saying is this, that you and I who are Christians have been
[00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:23.460]   prepared beforehand by God himself for that ultimate glory.
[00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:24.680]   How has he done it?
[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:25.680]   What is this preparation?
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:32.300]   Well, the first thing is this foreknowing, knowing us beforehand, knowing us before we
[00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:38.020]   were ever born, knowing us before he had ever even created the world.
[00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:41.160]   You remember we worked that out together.
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:47.780]   That is always the first step, that God sets his heart, his affection upon these vessels
[00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:51.180]   of mercy who are to be delivered and who are to be saved.
[00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:54.420]   And he does that, I say, way back in eternity.
[00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:59.180]   We quoted ample scriptures to prove that at the time.
[00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:08.100]   Then of course, having thus known us in this special manner, he predestinates us.
[00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:11.940]   This involves choosing and deciding what he is going to do with us.
[00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:18.500]   Now this to me is, as I have often said, the most wonderful thing in the whole of scripture,
[00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:24.900]   the thing that moves one to the depth of one's being, that the almighty and everlasting God,
[00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:30.500]   who might very well have consigned us all to eternal destruction, thought about us individually,
[00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:36.220]   who were Christians before the foundation of the world, and decided what he was going
[00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:39.780]   to make of us.
[00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:46.300]   Can you take in that thought that the eternal God has known you in that way?
[00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:52.180]   And then he has worked out this great purpose, this predestinating.
[00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:58.620]   But I must again emphasize what we had caused to emphasize in the earlier part of this chapter,
[00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:03.980]   because it seems to me to be a very wonderful part of this whole process of preparation.
[00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:10.020]   You remember the point we made about Isaac and about Jacob.
[00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:14.340]   Let me go back again to verses 6 and following.
[00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:17.580]   Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect, for they are not all Israel, which
[00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:23.540]   are of Israel; neither because they are the seed of Abram are they all children.
[00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:26.140]   But in Isaac thy seed shall be called.
[00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:31.340]   That is, they which are the children of the flesh are not the children of God, but the
[00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:36.780]   children of the promise accounted for the seed, for this is the word of the promise.
[00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:45.780]   And you remember, "At this time will I come, and Sarah shall have a son."
[00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:49.100]   Now that was God's action.
[00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:56.700]   God brought Isaac into being because it was a part of his plan and purpose that the seed
[00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:59.340]   should be continued through Isaac.
[00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:02.740]   So the birth of Isaac is the direct intervention of God.
[00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:05.780]   It is a miracle.
[00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:10.300]   Then we get exactly the same thing about Jacob.
[00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:15.620]   And not only this, but when Rebekah also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac,
[00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:19.900]   for the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose
[00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:24.460]   of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth, it
[00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:28.700]   was said unto her, "The elder shall serve the younger," as it is written, "Jacob
[00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:31.380]   have I loved, but Esau have I hated."
[00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:33.740]   Same thing again.
[00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:39.100]   And you remember, for me just to remind you, we put it like this.
[00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:44.540]   God doesn't do away with the natural process in the production of his people.
[00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:49.660]   He uses it, but he works his miracle through it.
[00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:56.380]   So Jacob and Esau are both in a physical sense, from the standpoint of the flesh, the children
[00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:59.140]   of Isaac and Rebekah.
[00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:03.660]   But there was this uniqueness about Jacob.
[00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:09.180]   God intervened in his production, in his birth, as he had done in the case of Isaac.
[00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:14.880]   And my argument is that he does precisely the same with every one of us who is a Christian.
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:20.100]   We are separated from our mother's womb, as the Apostle Paul himself was, as Jeremiah
[00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:22.380]   was.
[00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:27.620]   All this is something that God planned before time, and he has brought it into being.
[00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:29.740]   Now don't get confused about this.
[00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:34.260]   Our becoming Christians in an experimental sense happens in time.
[00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:40.740]   But the whole teaching of this entire epistle is, and particularly this particular chapter,
[00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:47.540]   is that God is bringing it to pass, and has always known what he is bringing to pass.
[00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:48.540]   Very well.
[00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:52.380]   This is a part of the preparation.
[00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:56.740]   We were prepared even before we were born.
[00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:57.740]   It's a great mystery.
[00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:01.740]   Yes, but we are dealing with the riches of God's glory.
[00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:03.740]   Who can understand his mind?
[00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:05.940]   Who can understand his workings?
[00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:10.420]   We have again been reminding of that in one of our hymns this evening.
[00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:12.140]   Did you notice those words?
[00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:14.140]   Let me repeat them to you.
[00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:24.980]   "Earth from afar has heard thy fame, And babes have learned to lisp thy name;
[00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:35.020]   But all the glories of thy mind Leave all our soaring thoughts behind.
[00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:41.940]   So entirely and utterly and absolutely Beyond us and our highest comprehension and
[00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:42.940]   imagination."
[00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:47.820]   But that is what we are taught, that God has been preparing us.
[00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:52.860]   He is preparing a people, this new humanity in Christ.
[00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:55.740]   And these are steps in this great process.
[00:29:55.740 --> 00:30:00.980]   The time came that you and I should be born, and God saw to it that we were born, and in
[00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:01.980]   that particular way.
[00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:02.980]   There it is.
[00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:06.300]   But then we come to the actual calling in time.
[00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:11.940]   We've been called in eternity, but in particular we are called in time.
[00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:15.900]   You are born and you seem to be like everybody else, and you live a life of sin, and you
[00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:20.100]   may argue against the gospel, and you may reject it, and you may utter your blasphemous
[00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:21.100]   thoughts.
[00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:22.100]   It doesn't matter.
[00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:32.700]   A time comes when you are convicted by the Holy Spirit, and you don't know why it happened,
[00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:35.540]   and you don't understand how it happened.
[00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:39.780]   You realize that what our Lord said to Nicodemus is the truth, "The wind bloweth where it
[00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:40.780]   listeth.
[00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:44.820]   Thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, nor whither it
[00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:45.820]   goeth."
[00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:47.500]   So is everyone that is born of the Spirit.
[00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:51.700]   At a given point in time, and it was known to God before the foundation of the world,
[00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:54.820]   you are convicted of sin.
[00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:56.620]   And it can happen in many ways.
[00:30:56.620 --> 00:31:00.100]   May happen in a meeting, may happen when you're on your own, may happen when you're reading
[00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:01.100]   the Bible.
[00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:04.300]   It can happen in endless manners, but it's God who does it.
[00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:05.540]   He planned to do it.
[00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:08.180]   He brought you into this world in order that it might happen.
[00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:11.300]   That's the teaching of this chapter.
[00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:14.420]   And so you are convicted of sin.
[00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:17.420]   And so you are brought to repentance.
[00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:20.900]   And so you are converted and turned round.
[00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:26.020]   And so you are aware that you are a new man in Christ Jesus, that you've got a new nature
[00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:27.020]   inside you.
[00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:31.340]   And you're amazed at yourself, of course, because you haven't done it.
[00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:34.500]   If you're not amazed at yourself, you're not a Christian, my friend.
[00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:36.220]   Every Christian's a miracle.
[00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:38.540]   And he should be amazed at himself.
[00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:42.700]   He's got this new life within him, this life from God.
[00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:45.580]   He's a partaker of the divine nature.
[00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:46.580]   What am I talking about?
[00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:49.940]   Oh, I'm talking about the riches of God's glory.
[00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:53.460]   This is what God does to us, the vessels of mercy.
[00:31:53.460 --> 00:32:01.620]   And in this way he shows this thought of his, this mind of his, this power of his, this
[00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:03.300]   love, grace, compassion.
[00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:07.620]   Oh, here it shines in and through us.
[00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:08.620]   And then it goes on.
[00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:12.340]   He puts his Spirit within us.
[00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:16.580]   And the Spirit incorporates us into Christ.
[00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:19.260]   We are in Christ.
[00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:20.260]   He is the head.
[00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:23.900]   He is the members of the body.
[00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:28.940]   And we have participated in him, crucified with him, dead with him, buried with him,
[00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:32.580]   risen with him, seated in the heavenly places in him.
[00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:34.060]   It's true of you.
[00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:35.060]   I'm talking about you.
[00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:36.060]   This isn't some theory.
[00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:38.820]   I'm telling you what's true of you as a Christian.
[00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:41.340]   You're one of God's vessels of mercy.
[00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:47.340]   And he's showing what he is in doing all this to you.
[00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:50.940]   And then, of course, he goes on working in us.
[00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:56.940]   The Spirit brings us into an increasing conformity to the image of God's Son.
[00:32:56.940 --> 00:32:59.740]   It was all there in the eighth chapter, you remember?
[00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:05.480]   Whom he did foreknow, he also did predestine it to be conformed to the image of his Son,
[00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:08.780]   that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.
[00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:12.440]   And the brethren are going to be like him, conformed to his image.
[00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:17.940]   He goes on in this world, that sanctification.
[00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:22.220]   Then you go on and consider how he puts us all into the Church, which is the body of
[00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:23.220]   Christ.
[00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:28.820]   And this extraordinary New Testament doctrine about the Church, the Church as the body of
[00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:33.620]   Christ, it's the most marvellous thing in the whole universe.
[00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:40.440]   The universe as such creation pales into insignificance by the sight of this new creation.
[00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:45.700]   He is his new creation by water and the blood, the Church, the body of Christ.
[00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:47.060]   What a conception!
[00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:51.800]   Read these mighty epistles as they unfold the doctrine concerning the Church, and you
[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:58.140]   and I are parts of the Church.
[00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:04.580]   How he breaks down middle walls of partition, bringing Jew and Gentile together.
[00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:06.600]   What a work!
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:11.300]   Is anything more difficult than to reconcile irreconcilables?
[00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:15.500]   Was anything harder than to bring together a Jew and a Gentile?
[00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:19.060]   Not only to reconcile men unto God, but to reconcile them to one another.
[00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:20.380]   But he's done it.
[00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:26.700]   He's broken down the middle walls of partition, and he's made of twain one new man, so making
[00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:27.700]   peace.
[00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:29.380]   Here it is.
[00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:35.860]   And all that the Apostle tells us about the Church in particular in the first four chapters
[00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:40.860]   of the epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:44.700]   But there is no end to this, and I mustn't keep you.
[00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:47.720]   I'm just trying to give you some headings.
[00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:51.580]   You know you see something of the riches of God's glory even in the way in which he just
[00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:54.140]   chastises us.
[00:34:54.140 --> 00:34:57.980]   All things, remember, work together for good to them that love God.
[00:34:57.980 --> 00:35:02.660]   Even when you're having a hard and a difficult time, it may be a part of this glory, because
[00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:08.940]   God is going to bring you to that perfection, to that conformity to the image of his Son.
[00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:12.260]   And he seems to be working against his own purpose, but he isn't.
[00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:14.940]   He knows us, and he reveals his love to us.
[00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:17.260]   Whom the Lord loveth, he chasteneth.
[00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:20.660]   Have you ever seen the glory of God in your chastisement?
[00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:23.260]   We must learn to look for these things, my friend.
[00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:24.620]   That's what the Scriptures are here for.
[00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:25.620]   They're to make us look.
[00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:29.380]   They're to give us these openings, and you follow the openings.
[00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:35.300]   And the next time you are chastised because of your sin, you stand back in amazement and
[00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:37.780]   marvel at the glory of God.
[00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:43.820]   That though he is so great and so almighty, he knows you, and he's chastising you in particular
[00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:45.980]   because you're his child.
[00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:50.780]   And there he gives you a glimpse into something of his Father heart that you'd never seen
[00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:51.780]   before.
[00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:58.660]   Well, all this, you see, is a part of the way in which God shows the riches of his glory
[00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:00.660]   in what he does in us.
[00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:03.500]   That's the argument.
[00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:06.780]   In us, the vessels of mercy.
[00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:15.780]   And then the final word about this, of course, is this, which he had aforeprepared, "Unto
[00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:18.740]   glory."
[00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:25.180]   And this is the thing that leaves us speechless, as it were.
[00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:34.380]   That we who deserve nothing but the punishment of hell and everlasting destruction, we who
[00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:42.460]   are sinful, we who can say truthfully about ourselves in the words of Charles Wesley,
[00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:48.980]   "Vile and full of sin I am, for we all are."
[00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:53.620]   We who can say with the Apostle Paul, "In me," that is to say, "in my flesh dwelleth
[00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:56.700]   no good thing."
[00:36:56.700 --> 00:37:00.780]   We who can say with him again in that epistle to Titus, a portion of which we read just
[00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:05.260]   now, "We were hateful and hating one another."
[00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:10.940]   What miserable, wretched creatures we all were in sin.
[00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:15.540]   Yes, but you see, this is the way he puts it there.
[00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:22.360]   And it's just another way of putting what he puts in this verse that is before us.
[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:28.660]   We ourselves were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving diverse lusts and pleasures,
[00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:33.220]   living in malice and envy, hateful and hating one another.
[00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:42.460]   But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward men appeared, not by works
[00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:48.300]   of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us by the washing of
[00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:54.500]   regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Ghost, which he shed on us abundantly through
[00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:57.300]   Jesus Christ our Saviour.
[00:37:57.300 --> 00:38:02.860]   That being justified by his grace we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal
[00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:03.860]   life.
[00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:07.460]   And that's what he's preparing us for, I say.
[00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:14.300]   He takes us from that position and he's going to raise us to the glory.
[00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:21.380]   This extraordinary way in which he does it justifies us by faith alone, without our works,
[00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:23.940]   without even our desire, with nothing.
[00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:28.740]   Gives us the very faith itself, gives us everything.
[00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:34.260]   And thus in a manner entirely opposite to what men would ever have imagined, we are
[00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:39.540]   saved not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he
[00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:42.260]   saved us.
[00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:47.580]   By the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Ghost.
[00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:53.800]   And his purpose for us is to bring us unto this glory of which he speaks here.
[00:38:53.800 --> 00:39:00.100]   We are the vessels of wrath which he has prepared aforehand unto glory.
[00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:01.980]   Oh, we've been over this.
[00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:02.980]   I mustn't keep you.
[00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:06.100]   But, you know, I can't just say we've done this and leave it.
[00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:07.940]   I like repeating this.
[00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:11.980]   I like to talk about this glory to which we are going, don't you?
[00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:14.580]   Can you ever hear of this too frequently?
[00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:19.560]   That you and I, my friends, are going to be glorified in our very bodies.
[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:22.100]   We shall see Christ and be like him.
[00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:23.680]   And we shall reign with him.
[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:25.300]   We shall reign over angels.
[00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:26.960]   We shall reign over the world.
[00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:30.020]   We shall be partakers of the inheritance with him.
[00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:31.860]   We are joint heirs with him now.
[00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:35.700]   And we are going to be joint sharers in the inheritance with him.
[00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:38.660]   That's the glory.
[00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:45.460]   We shall be redeemed, body, mind, and spirit, with not a trace of evil or of sin anywhere
[00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:55.540]   near us, but without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, whole, entire, glorified, even
[00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:59.220]   as he is glorified.
[00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:04.940]   Very well, says the apostle.
[00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:06.580]   And here is his argument, you see.
[00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:09.260]   Let me draw it out now.
[00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:18.780]   What would we really know of God and his glory were it not for all this?
[00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:28.300]   In other words, it is in his mercy to us that the riches of his glory have become known.
[00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:30.660]   So I summarize his argument like this.
[00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:41.060]   God in his righteous, holy character hates sin and is filled with wrath against it.
[00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:43.940]   Is there anything wrong in that?
[00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:47.300]   Is there any injustice in that?
[00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:51.420]   Have you any objection to the fact that God who is holy, who is light and in whom is no
[00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:56.860]   darkness at all, hates sin with the whole intensity of his divine, holy nature?
[00:40:56.860 --> 00:41:04.100]   Is there any objection?
[00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:09.620]   Is there, I say, any injustice in that or anything wrong?
[00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:17.740]   Is there anyone in the whole universe who has ever lived amongst men who does not deserve
[00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:21.940]   to be punished and to be punished eternally?
[00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:24.660]   Not one.
[00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:30.020]   Is there any ground of complaint against the manifestation, the making known of the
[00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:33.500]   wrath and the justice of God?
[00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:38.380]   There is none.
[00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:43.300]   God is free to punish all if he so chooses.
[00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:52.180]   And if all were punished, no one would be able to lift a finger or to open a mouth.
[00:41:52.180 --> 00:42:02.700]   But what if on the other hand he chooses and wills to spare some and to save some?
[00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:06.860]   Do you object to the riches of God's glory?
[00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:10.060]   Do you feel that that is unjust?
[00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:14.380]   Has not the God who has the right to damn us all an equal right to save some if he so
[00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:16.300]   chooses?
[00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:17.300]   Why not?
[00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:19.300]   Where is the injustice?
[00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:23.020]   Who has been wronged?
[00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:28.940]   No one, because no one has any claim whatsoever.
[00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:33.420]   Do you want to ask, "But why are some only saved?"
[00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:36.180]   The answer to that is that none deserve it.
[00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:41.140]   All should be damned.
[00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:48.100]   And therefore God is free to show and manifest his mercy when he wills, when he chooses,
[00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:53.700]   and where and when and in whom he pleases and he chooses.
[00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:56.200]   But I can't leave it at this.
[00:42:56.200 --> 00:43:00.900]   Why do we always look at one side only of this matter?
[00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:06.220]   Why is it that anybody, I ask again as I did at the beginning, can never read the ninth
[00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:12.380]   of Romans and not be lost in wonder, love, and praise when he comes to this phrase, "the
[00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:17.620]   riches of his glory"?
[00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:21.100]   Because that is the effect that this chapter should have upon us.
[00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:27.140]   The surprising thing, the astounding thing, is not that anybody is damned, but that anybody
[00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:30.140]   is saved.
[00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:34.620]   Nothing but the riches of God's glory could ever have done that.
[00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:37.100]   But we are so blind that we only say, "Is it right?
[00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:39.340]   Is it just that anybody is damned?"
[00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:41.940]   It is right and just that everybody should be damned.
[00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:46.540]   This is the astounding thing that any single individual has ever been saved.
[00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:50.820]   Nothing but this eternal character of God that we have been looking at could ever have
[00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:59.980]   brought it to being.
[00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:00.980]   What is the difficulty?
[00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:05.700]   Well, the difficulty seems to be this, doesn't it?
[00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:11.740]   Man in sin has always had a desire to know what he is not meant to know.
[00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:16.860]   So people ask the question, "Why are only some saved, and on what principle are some
[00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:18.700]   saved?
[00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:21.020]   On what grounds does God do this?"
[00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:25.580]   Now then, let's be clear about this.
[00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:29.220]   I don't know.
[00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:30.220]   I'll go further.
[00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:32.460]   I am not meant to know.
[00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:33.620]   I'll go further.
[00:44:33.620 --> 00:44:37.500]   I should not even desire to know.
[00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:43.700]   It is sufficient for me that any one individual is ever saved.
[00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:49.340]   It is the riches of God's glory alone, I say, that can ever do that.
[00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:54.660]   And having seen that, I have seen more than enough.
[00:44:54.660 --> 00:45:00.380]   What fills me with amazement is that I am in this, and that God has ever had mercy upon
[00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:07.220]   me, and that God in his grace has ever made me a vessel of mercy and brought me to the
[00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:10.940]   position in which I am.
[00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:18.780]   I don't want to know any more, for the desire to know any more is a desire to comprehend
[00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:25.820]   the incomprehensible, to understand that which is God himself and which one never can.
[00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:33.420]   I imagine that in eternity we shall have the full explanation.
[00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:38.220]   But here on earth it is not God's will that we should have it.
[00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:47.180]   All we are told is this, that God has a right to condemn all, and therefore he has a right
[00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:51.300]   to do as he wills with all.
[00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:59.420]   And we are told that it is his will that some should receive mercy and be prepared for that
[00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:07.700]   everlasting and eternal glory which he has made possible for us because of the riches
[00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:11.380]   of his glory.
[00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:15.380]   If you still want to ask questions, my friend, well, I am just telling you that they cannot
[00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:21.260]   be answered, and that I am amazed that you still want to ask them.
[00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:25.740]   If you are not overwhelmed, I say, by this thought of the riches of his glory and that
[00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:30.580]   he has done all this for you, that he sent his only Son from heaven into this evil, sinful
[00:46:30.580 --> 00:46:35.740]   world and even to the death of the cross and the grave for you, if that doesn't overwhelm
[00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:43.180]   you and make you just fall before him in worship and adoration.
[00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:46.860]   Well then, I think you'd better go back to the beginning and ask him to have mercy upon
[00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:53.340]   you and to open the eyes of your understanding by his Holy Spirit.
[00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:57.540]   If you are still anxious to cavil and to ask your questions and bring your objections,
[00:46:57.540 --> 00:47:01.500]   I say it is because you don't know about the riches of his glory, and that is what
[00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:02.500]   you need to know.
[00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:07.700]   Once you have seen that, you won't ask any questions, you will just praise and thank
[00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:10.740]   and express your amazement and astonishment.
[00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:15.660]   You will say, "And can it be that I should gain an interest in the Saviour's blood?
[00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:18.180]   Died he for me who caused his pain?
[00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:20.940]   For me who him to death pursued?
[00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:21.940]   Amazing love!
[00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:28.780]   And can it be that thou, my God, shouldst die for me?"
[00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:36.060]   That's the attitude of the man who has seen this blessed, glorious truth and seen himself
[00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:37.860]   as a vessel of mercy.
[00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:43.780]   And so, you see, in verse 24 the apostle finishes the whole argument, "Even us whom he hath
[00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:47.780]   called not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles," which just means this.
[00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:53.020]   Now then, he says, "In the light of what I have been telling you, are you still in
[00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:55.500]   trouble over this question of Jew and Gentile?
[00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:59.820]   Well, you shouldn't be.
[00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:03.400]   The whole of humanity was lost.
[00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:09.460]   It was God's will to take hold of a man amongst those in that mass of perdition called Abram,
[00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:16.420]   and to pull him out and turn him into a nation and call him Abraham.
[00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:18.280]   It was God who did that.
[00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:22.300]   But that doesn't mean that everybody born of him is now automatically saved and going
[00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:23.300]   to be a Christian.
[00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:24.300]   Not at all.
[00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:29.260]   The God who chose him is at equal liberty to choose anybody he likes, and he does, sometimes
[00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:31.740]   Jew, sometimes Gentile.
[00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:32.740]   Why not?
[00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:37.140]   That's his answer, finally, you see, to the Jew.
[00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:42.060]   "Don't imagine," he says, "that there's anything special about you as such, or anything
[00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:46.780]   to recommend you to God, or any claim that you have upon God and his mercy."
[00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:47.780]   Not at all.
[00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:51.780]   A man is never saved by heredity, never.
[00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:56.300]   You're not saved because your parents were children, or because you belong to the Jewish
[00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:58.660]   nation or any other nation.
[00:48:58.660 --> 00:49:00.340]   Heredity doesn't come in at all.
[00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:03.580]   That's been demolished by this chapter.
[00:49:03.580 --> 00:49:08.740]   God saves every one of us, every one of us.
[00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:12.100]   That's where you see the riches of his glory.
[00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:17.340]   That he who made the stars and the constellations and the whole of creation, and who handles
[00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:24.340]   history and providence and everything else, he knows us one by one, every one of us.
[00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:30.820]   And it is he and he alone and nothing else, not ancestry, not upbringing, not good works,
[00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:33.220]   not righteousness, nothing in us at all.
[00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:37.060]   It is all together the action of God.
[00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:40.380]   And he can do it to a Jew, he can do it to a Gentile.
[00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:42.160]   He has made the whole world.
[00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:49.580]   He made man at the beginning, and these distinctions are to him meaningless and irrelevant.
[00:49:49.580 --> 00:49:53.240]   And so he does it to us.
[00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:59.140]   Some of us are Jews, some of us are Gentiles.
[00:49:59.140 --> 00:50:01.900]   But that isn't the thing that matters.
[00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:13.180]   It is the God who always does it to each individual, and who is free in his sovereign lordship
[00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:22.660]   to show mercy to whom he will show mercy, and to show wrath upon whom he will show wrath.
[00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:35.660]   Blessed be the name of God, O the riches of the glory of God, revealed and manifested
[00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:47.260]   unto us, even us, in this glorious plan and purpose of salvation and supremely in the
[00:50:47.260 --> 00:50:50.660]   face of Jesus Christ.
[00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:51.660]   Amen.
[00:50:51.660 --> 00:51:07.060]   O Lord, our God, we come before thee, and we feel that words are poor and poor expression.
[00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:11.180]   Thou knowest our hearts.
[00:51:11.180 --> 00:51:19.980]   Lord, our desire is that our eyes may be opened by thy spirit more and more to the riches
[00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:22.100]   of thy glory.
[00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:31.460]   O God, grant us such a knowledge of this that we shall indeed be lost in wonder, love, and
[00:51:31.460 --> 00:51:34.620]   praise.
[00:51:34.620 --> 00:51:42.060]   And now may the grace of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the
[00:51:42.060 --> 00:51:48.380]   fellowship and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night
[00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:55.380]   throughout the remainder of this hour's short and certain earthly life and pilgrimage, and
[00:51:55.380 --> 00:52:02.380]   until we shall be in the glory everlasting.
[00:52:02.380 --> 00:52:05.780]   Amen.
