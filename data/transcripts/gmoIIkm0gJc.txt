[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.140]   So where I live in Washington, D.C., remote work is a hot topic at the moment because
[00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.800]   one of President Trump's new executive orders is demanding that federal workers return to
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:12.800]   the office.
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.960]   So this is causing a lot of chaos here for federal workers for any number of specific
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.760]   logistical and practical reasons.
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:26.120]   But I thought this timing might be good to talk to those of you who still have some sort
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:32.200]   of remote work set up in your job about the very general topic of how do you make the
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.760]   most of that?
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.240]   You see the trouble your government worker brethren are having with their remote work
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.240]   jobs.
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.680]   If you still have one now, this is a great time to say, "Hey, let me make sure that I
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.160]   am making the most of what I actually have."
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.160]   So here's my plan.
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.760]   I've written a lot about remote work, what makes it function well, what makes it function
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.760]   poorly.
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.280]   I've covered this extensively for The New Yorker.
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.680]   I've written about this in other publications like The Atlantic.
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.240]   I've written about this in my book, Slow Productivity.
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:04.840]   And what I want to do today is bridge the gap between big ideas and practical advice
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.400]   for remote workers.
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.640]   So I have three foundational ideas I'm going to review about remote work that come from
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.800]   my reporting from the last five years or so.
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.640]   For each of those foundational ideas, after I explain it, I have concrete things to suggest
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.820]   for how you can leverage that idea to make your own life as someone who does some virtual
[00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:25.960]   work better.
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.960]   And my goal here really is not just how do I make you as a remote worker more productive
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.400]   in some sort of vague sense.
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.840]   I really care about not only that, but how do you make your job awesome?
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.920]   How do you take full advantage of the possibilities that at first got everyone excited about this
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:43.920]   prospect?
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.160]   How to make remote work not just a grind, but something that could be even cooler, or
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.800]   more interesting, or more sustainable, or more varied than the old-fashioned way of
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:52.800]   working.
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.160]   So I have three foundational ideas, and I'm going to draw, spin off some concrete advice
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.160]   for each.
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.640]   All right, foundational idea number one.
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.680]   Successful remote work requires two things.
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.560]   Clear workload systems and structured communication.
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.280]   Let me unpack both of those things.
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.680]   Clear workload system means there is some clarity about what you're working on and what
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.480]   it means for something that you're working on to be done, and the load of what you're
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.600]   actively working on now that you're tracking it is kept manageable.
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.760]   That is what's meant by clear workload systems.
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.720]   And by structured communication, this involves how information flows, questions are asked,
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.340]   and status is checked on the work that is happening.
[00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.580]   If communication is structured, these type of interactions are consolidated into a smaller
[00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:51.840]   number of predictable periods or moved asynchronous, but unscheduled communication is minimized.
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.960]   That means something that comes in you weren't expecting that you need to reply to, like
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.040]   an email or a chat.
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.680]   Calendar clutter is also minimized in a structured communication regime, so you don't have a
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.320]   calendar that fills ever fuller with meetings to talk about work.
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.720]   So if your work is structured around clear workloads and structured communication, remote
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.820]   work can work really well.
[00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.960]   If it's not, remote work can be frustrating for all involved.
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:25.280]   I'll give you two examples, one broad, one specific, about workplaces that have these
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:31.040]   properties and therefore have found successful transitions to remote work.
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.560]   The first is in software dev, right?
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.680]   Software developers had many examples of large teams or organizations that were fully remote,
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.680]   even pre-pandemic.
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.120]   It was one of the only sectors of knowledge work that sort of consistently had success
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.300]   with remote work.
[00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.300]   Why is it?
[00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:54.180]   It's because these firms were using agile methodologies to organize their developers'
[00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.180]   efforts.
[00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.900]   So some of the core features of agile methodologies is clear workload management.
[00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.700]   You have a shared board.
[00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.500]   Everything that needs to be added, the features that need to be added, the bugs that need
[00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.980]   to be checked for the particular software product in question, those are all specified
[00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:10.980]   on a shared board.
[00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.620]   They don't exist on individuals' plates.
[00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.740]   And then what happens is individuals are assigned specific things to work on.
[00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:22.500]   So it's very clear who is working on what, and you have very clear workload limits, right?
[00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.980]   It might be you should be working on one thing at a time, and when you're done, we'll give
[00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:25.980]   you the new thing.
[00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.740]   Or you could be working on two things at a time, and when you're done with one of those,
[00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:29.740]   we'll bring you on a new thing.
[00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.940]   But it's very clear who's working on what.
[00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:33.940]   Workloads are managed.
[00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.700]   You don't work on too many things at the same time, and it is very clear when you're done.
[00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.380]   You say, okay, I have finished this feature.
[00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:41.820]   It's committed into the repository.
[00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:47.100]   We can move this card on the virtual board from me working on it to the done column.
[00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.100]   So it's very structured workload management.
[00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.500]   Agile methodologies also have very structured communication.
[00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.680]   They have a daily standup meeting, it's very quick.
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.780]   They call them standups because when these would be done in person, you would do them
[00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.700]   standing up, the discourage, loviation.
[00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.700]   And in these standup meetings, you go person, person, person.
[00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:04.860]   Here's the board.
[00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.020]   Here's the things you're working on.
[00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.260]   There's two.
[00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:08.260]   What's your progress?
[00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.260]   What have you done since yesterday?
[00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:10.260]   Why is this not done yet?
[00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.420]   What do you need from other people to get this done?
[00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.700]   Or, okay, you finished this yesterday.
[00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.280]   Let's decide as a group what you should work on next.
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.820]   Let us know right away what you need for it.
[00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.620]   So you're consolidating communication about how things are going and what you need to
[00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:27.460]   a 20-minute block in the same time every day, as opposed to allowing this to just unfold
[00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.460]   through unstructured emails and text messages throughout the day.
[00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.900]   So software dev already had workload management and structured communication.
[00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.380]   It was easy to move remote.
[00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:37.420]   That works well remote.
[00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.780]   The board can be virtual.
[00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.040]   Those status meetings can be virtual.
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:46.060]   Most of what you're doing then is just working solo anyway, so the fact that you are not
[00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.660]   in an office around other people or not didn't matter.
[00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.100]   It was easier to move that remote.
[00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:56.140]   Here's another example, more specific, of a workplace in which they had these properties
[00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:57.140]   and they've done well remote.
[00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:02.820]   I was talking to someone recently who had a position in the Veterans Affairs office,
[00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:09.020]   and he was saying the big team that he was working with, they actually measured productivity.
[00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:15.480]   They did a study, and it was clear that on all the metrics you might care about for their
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:19.020]   particular type of work, they all went up with remote work.
[00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.740]   So I said, "Well, what type of work is this team doing?"
[00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:28.700]   And he told me, "Oh, it's claims processing, processing claims from veterans largely for
[00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:29.700]   benefits or health care."
[00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:35.140]   I was like, "That is an example of work in which you can have a very clearly defined
[00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:36.260]   workload.
[00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.820]   Here is our queues of claims to be processed.
[00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:43.200]   Here are the ones that have currently been assigned to you.
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.620]   We can check in a system without even really having to have unscheduled communication at
[00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:50.420]   all, what have you processed today?
[00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.220]   What have you processed this week, right?
[00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:56.580]   We can have a system to flag issues or you need help or to move it up to someone else.
[00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.220]   It's a very structured workload without the need.
[00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:03.500]   It doesn't really rely on ad hoc communication or meetings that clutter your calendar.
[00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.220]   So yeah, that could move remote very well.
[00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:08.260]   I want to be where I want to be.
[00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:09.260]   I'm working on my claims.
[00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.340]   It doesn't really matter if I'm in the office.
[00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:14.700]   Where remote work struggles is where you're missing one or both of those.
[00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:21.180]   It's like an average, modern, generic, Scott Adams, Dilbert style office.
[00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:23.500]   It doesn't have either of these things.
[00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:28.340]   Work is assigned haphazardly, usually through emails and requests at meetings like, hey,
[00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:29.340]   can you work on this?
[00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:30.340]   What about this?
[00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:31.340]   Can you look into this?
[00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:32.700]   So everyone has this sort of haphazard workload.
[00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:33.700]   It's not clearly defined.
[00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:36.120]   I don't know who's working on what.
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:40.380]   There's no clear way for me to see what's done when something is finished or what the
[00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:41.880]   status of things are.
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.940]   The only way to check in is through more communication.
[00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:47.980]   So we have a ton of unstructured communication that just try to keep various plates moving.
[00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:51.800]   I'm constantly emailing people, people are emailing me, we're jumping in and off in Slack.
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:55.460]   We begin using meetings as a proxy for productivity, standing meetings to try to make progress
[00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:56.460]   on things.
[00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:57.460]   Calendars are cluttered.
[00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:01.800]   The overhead of workloads collapses in on its own weight.
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:06.840]   That type of workplace doesn't move remote as well.
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:10.240]   Because it's just dependent on all this like ad hoc back and forth interaction.
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.200]   And when you move remote that all that just gets harder.
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.200]   It's all just higher friction.
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.640]   I can't grab you in the hallway.
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.960]   I have to schedule Zoom meetings for everything.
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.400]   Calendars get even more cluttered.
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:23.300]   I have to send many more emails because I'm missing all the in-person quick grabs and
[00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:25.700]   quick conversations in the hallways.
[00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:28.380]   When you don't have workload structure or structured communication, remote work can
[00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:30.680]   actually just increase the frustration and friction work.
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:34.720]   A lot of people saw this in the pandemic where they got no benefit out of remote work from
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:41.320]   a subjective well-being perspective because their work became even more interruptive.
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:46.160]   More Zoom, more like talking about work or feeling interrupted from talking about work
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.160]   and it made things worse.
[00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:51.160]   All right, so once we have that idea, what's some like concrete advice we can give to make
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:52.520]   your own situation better?
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:56.680]   Well, if you work in a team and you have some control over how your team operates, take
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:58.360]   a page out of Agile.
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:08:59.360]   Track those tasks centrally.
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:03.960]   It should be clear, what does our team need to accomplish?
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:08.560]   New tasks should show up on the team's list, not on an individual's plate.
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:11.280]   And then you should have a clear way of saying who's working on what.
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:12.840]   And it's fine for most stuff.
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:16.100]   The answer is no one is working on this yet.
[00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:18.760]   You don't want anyone working on more than two things at a time.
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:23.920]   So the 20 things we've identified that our team needs to do, maybe most of them are just
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.200]   in this waiting to do column that no one owns.
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:29.880]   It's not generating any overhead tax, no emails or no meetings for anyone because no one's
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:31.200]   working on it yet.
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.560]   Over here we see, okay, Cal's working on these two things.
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:35.920]   And now I actually have to do those things.
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:38.600]   Well, hey, you've had these on your thing for two days.
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:39.600]   What else are you doing?
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.160]   You should be making progress, right?
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:47.100]   But we are saving ourselves from being completely overloaded with work.
[00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:50.140]   Daily synchronization meetings of the same style they use in Agile can work really well
[00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:51.140]   for teams.
[00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:54.660]   20 minutes, we all look at the things that need to be done and the things you're working
[00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:56.660]   on.
[00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:00.100]   Batch all of your email conversations into a real-time conversation right here.
[00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:02.660]   Okay, everyone, here's what I'm working on today.
[00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:03.660]   See, let's look at the board.
[00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:05.340]   These are two things that have been assigned to me.
[00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:08.260]   I'm really working on this first thing today.
[00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.840]   Let me save you all the emails that would otherwise trickle out as this day unfolded.
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:15.440]   And I'll just tell you all now, I need this from you and this from you.
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.600]   Okay, when can you get that to me by?
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.600]   By noon?
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.600]   Let me write this down.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:20.600]   Okay, so you're getting that to me by noon.
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.080]   Let's type this up.
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.040]   And you will talk to those clients.
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.880]   Actually, don't even email me those responses when you're done.
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.360]   You'll just put them in this shared folder.
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.360]   Great.
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.880]   We're typing up a summary of what everyone committed to in this meeting, and boom, it'll
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:34.240]   be right there under the board in a saved document.
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.240]   We can all see our commitments.
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.240]   Great, everyone.
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.240]   We all agree.
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:40.620]   We've just saved ourselves ad hoc emails that might get ignored for days.
[00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:41.620]   We're all on the same page.
[00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:42.620]   Let's go do our work.
[00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:46.220]   So if you have some control over how your team functions, do that.
[00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:51.380]   If you're an individual, build a task board for your own task and make it transparent
[00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:52.500]   for the people you work with.
[00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:55.580]   I talk about this a lot in my book, Slow Productivity.
[00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:58.580]   Make a clear distinction between I'm working on this right now, and I'm waiting to work
[00:10:58.580 --> 00:10:59.580]   on these things.
[00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:03.580]   And make sure that all the people who want you to do things can see this list.
[00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:06.180]   They see where their thing falls, and they're like, hey, let's have a meeting.
[00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:07.180]   Let's check in.
[00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:08.180]   Here's the link to my list.
[00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:09.180]   You're in position three.
[00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:13.460]   You're marching steadily towards my actively working it on status, but you're not there
[00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:14.460]   yet.
[00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:16.600]   Once it's there, I'll let you know, and then we can get into it.
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:21.420]   So even if you do not have control over the activities or organization of your team, you
[00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:25.060]   can organize yourself in a similar way.
[00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:29.940]   Use office hours to deal with impromptu back and forth conversations.
[00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:33.100]   You email me something that I can't respond to with a single message, grab me at my daily
[00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:34.100]   office hours.
[00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:35.100]   Call me.
[00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:36.100]   Jump by my office.
[00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:37.100]   Jump on an open Zoom thing I have.
[00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:38.860]   We can figure it out in real time.
[00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:41.500]   Teams can have docket clearing meetings twice a week.
[00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:43.940]   There's things the team needs to address.
[00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:47.660]   Put it on a shared document called the docket twice a week, everyone gets together.
[00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:53.580]   You go through that docket one by one, either dismiss the task, assign it to one individual,
[00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:58.020]   make a plan for it, do all again, this batching your communication in advance.
[00:11:58.020 --> 00:11:59.460]   This is another place to do that.
[00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:02.540]   Hey, what will I need from who by when to actually do this thing?
[00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:04.820]   While you're all here, let's all commit to that and write that down.
[00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:07.040]   So we save ourselves emails.
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:11.620]   So there's a lot you can do to make your workload management clear and your communication structured.
[00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:15.260]   If you do, the fact that you're not in the same office doesn't matter nearly as much
[00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:16.260]   anymore.
[00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:17.260]   Hey, it's Cal.
[00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:21.780]   I wanted to interrupt briefly to say that if you're enjoying this video, then you need
[00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:29.260]   to check out my new book, Slow Productivity, The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout.
[00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:34.660]   This is like the Bible for most of the ideas we talk about here in these videos.
[00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:40.020]   You can get a free excerpt at calnewport.com/slow.
[00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:41.840]   I know you're going to like it.
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:42.840]   Check it out.
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:43.840]   Now let's get back to the video.
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:53.260]   All right, foundational idea number two, small scale seasonality is the ingredient that makes
[00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.680]   remote work awesome.
[00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:57.680]   Kind of mixing metaphors there.
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:58.680]   Should I say delicious?
[00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:03.000]   It's the ingredient that makes remote work delicious.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.800]   What do I mean by small scale seasonality?
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:09.440]   That's an idea from my book, Slow Productivity, where seasonality writ large is this idea
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:14.540]   of variations in your work intensity at different timescales.
[00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:21.040]   So at the big time scale, it might be this season is slower than these other two seasons.
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:28.280]   At the smallest time scale, it might be I'm starting slow, I'm going to have a slow morning
[00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.820]   to kind of recharge, and then I have a busier afternoon.
[00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:35.920]   So it can go from the scale of the year down to the scale of the hours of a given day.
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:40.360]   Small scale seasonality is looking at this sort of variation in intensity at these smaller
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:45.360]   scales like of the day, hours within your day, or days of your week.
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:50.320]   And something that really makes remote work much more sustainable and cool is if you're
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:56.440]   able to embrace more of this variation in the intensity of your work.
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:01.500]   Why do you need remote work to more easily get this type of small scale seasonality?
[00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:04.000]   It's because of what you face when you're in the office.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.720]   Again, this is sort of canon from my Slow Productivity book.
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:12.640]   But in the first part of that book, I talk about how in the second half of the 20th century,
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:17.440]   office work became gripped by this idea of pseudo productivity.
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:23.940]   The notion that visible effort is a useful proxy for valuable effort.
[00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:26.460]   The more stuff you're doing, the better.
[00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:30.080]   It became this rough heuristic we used to try to just manage knowledge workers because
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:34.440]   we didn't actually know what you were working on, and there was no pile of widgets or parking
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:38.440]   lot full of newly built Model Ts we could point to to say how productive you were.
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:43.960]   So we fell back as managers on this heuristic of, you're doing stuff is good.
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:46.440]   If you want to prove to me that you're even more productive, do more stuff.
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:49.880]   Like be here earlier, go home later.
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:55.220]   These seemed to be frantic moving papers around when I walked by your office.
[00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:59.860]   The side effect of pseudo productivity is it meant that you had to sort of constantly
[00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:00.860]   always be on.
[00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:03.300]   Now, in a pre-digital age, that was OK.
[00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:05.160]   We could sort of fake this.
[00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:12.680]   It really was a game of you're all talking football at the water cooler, and the boss
[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:16.380]   walks in, and you immediately change.
[00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:20.840]   You're in the middle of saying quarterback, and you're like, yeah, the quarterly results
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:25.320]   are going to be good this year because of our new reporting system, right?
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:28.580]   I mean, it was stuff like that, or like you're kind of reading a magazine at your desk, but
[00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:32.500]   when the boss walked by you, you know, I'm typing, you do like typing motions.
[00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:33.500]   That's how they know you're being busy.
[00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:37.920]   You do vampire typing motions.
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:44.620]   Digital screwed that all up because now you can demonstrate activity at a very small granularity.
[00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:49.980]   Each email, or even more finer, each response to an instant message is a demonstration of
[00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:53.060]   your productivity in a pseudo productivity regime.
[00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:59.380]   You can do this at all times—in a meeting, in your office, at lunch, but also at home,
[00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:03.740]   while commuting, while at the dinner, while at a sporting event with your kid on the weekend.
[00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:08.540]   You can at any time be doing this really fine-grained demonstration of productivity.
[00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:12.260]   What we got then was like, oh, I actually have to be doing stuff all the time now.
[00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.700]   It's not just I need to physically be moving when my boss walks by.
[00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:19.500]   I have to be responding to these emails, staying up on these instant messages, hopping in and
[00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:22.740]   off of calls or what have you, and you get no variation in your work.
[00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:23.860]   It is just like expected.
[00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:27.300]   You're on all day because if there's any time of the day where you're not responding to
[00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:30.460]   emails, then I'm going to worry that you're slacking off and this is going to be a problem.
[00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:35.580]   So pseudo productivity made seasonality impossible.
[00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:38.740]   Remote work makes it possible again.
[00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:43.420]   No one is there directly observing you, and in particular, if you have followed the ideas
[00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:49.180]   from foundational idea number one, and it's more structured communication, not ad hoc
[00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:53.820]   communication, and it's more clearly managed workloads—I'm working on like one thing
[00:16:53.820 --> 00:17:00.980]   right now—you gain back a lot more capability of I'm going hard today, but I'm going to
[00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:02.260]   take tomorrow slow.
[00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:07.020]   Friday is going to be an easier day because you're not being monitored so fine-grained.
[00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:11.740]   More structured work maybe holds you more accountable, but it's not so fine-grained
[00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:12.780]   how it unfolds.
[00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:16.740]   There's not—with structured communication, there's not emails all day for people to answer.
[00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:19.660]   There's not meetings people are trying to schedule that they're judging you by how many
[00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:22.460]   you accept and how many you say no to.
[00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:27.540]   So remote work, if done right, allows for more small-scale seasonality.
[00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:31.940]   All right, so here's some advice built on this idea.
[00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:38.060]   One, to help try to inject more of the small-scale seasonality into your remote work setup, consider
[00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:40.180]   trading accountability for accessibility.
[00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:41.940]   It's a big move.
[00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:43.660]   You've got to have your act together.
[00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:47.220]   But in a lot of positions, especially when you're remote, there's an option that can
[00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:51.700]   become available where you're saying, "Look, hold me accountable for what I'm doing.
[00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:55.140]   I will show you my proverbial widgets at the end of the week or the end of the month or
[00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:56.140]   the end of the quarter.
[00:17:56.140 --> 00:18:01.580]   This is what I did, and if it doesn't hold up, fire me."
[00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:04.860]   But the flip side is, "I'm going to do this my own way.
[00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:07.860]   I'm not going to be in all your meetings.
[00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:13.660]   I'm not involved in these ad hoc projects that require lots of back-and-forth ad hoc
[00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:14.780]   communication.
[00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:22.100]   I'm going to go do my work and finish these projects, whatever they are, the things you
[00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:25.020]   can count, and you're just going to have to let me do it my own way."
[00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:32.500]   It's dangerous because you actually have to deliver, but if you gain that type of freedom,
[00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:35.900]   you can now inject small-scale seasonality into your job, and that's a lot of what makes
[00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:38.860]   remote work jobs potentially really cool.
[00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:40.580]   Time-block your days.
[00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:45.900]   If you time-block how you work, you get more enjoyment out of how you relax.
[00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:49.620]   Time-blocking is needed to free yourself from the pseudo-productivity mindset because now
[00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:52.940]   you can actually look at your day and say, "Here's what I'm working, and here's what
[00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:55.620]   I'm working on, and here's what I'm not working."
[00:18:55.620 --> 00:19:00.780]   I can see the plan, and it's not just me deciding on a whim, "I'm going to go relax now," and
[00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:05.780]   you're going to be nervous the entire time, like, "Oh my God, what am I missing?
[00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:06.780]   Is there something I'm supposed to be doing?
[00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:08.780]   Am I falling behind?"
[00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:10.580]   Time-blocking gives you control over your time.
[00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:12.780]   It's control not just over your work, but over your non-work.
[00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:18.180]   I'm going to fit this all in here so I can take this 90 minutes here and go for a long
[00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:19.180]   walk.
[00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:24.340]   People get better relaxation into their workday, so a great tool if you want more small-scale
[00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:27.500]   seasonality inserted.
[00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:30.340]   Consider doing things where particular days are lighter than others.
[00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:34.060]   No meeting Mondays or no meeting Fridays are great.
[00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:35.740]   You don't announce it, you just do it.
[00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:37.140]   "Hey, when can you meet?
[00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:38.300]   What about blah, blah, blah, and blah?"
[00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:42.060]   You say yes to the options not on Monday and no to the options on Monday.
[00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:45.380]   Now your Mondays are free of meetings, and it allows you to come out of the weekend in
[00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:48.380]   a way that's maybe less stressful.
[00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:53.180]   I roll in what's going on, I get started back up on projects, I clear the plates, I just
[00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:56.680]   have time to get back up to speed again.
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:57.680]   People worry.
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:00.700]   "Oh, my God, people will be upset if I don't take meetings on Mondays," but no one's tracking
[00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:01.700]   you that way.
[00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:06.180]   Again, there's not a control center where people have bar charts of your average email
[00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:10.980]   response time, and they're plotting your yes and no's to meeting requests and seeing if
[00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:13.520]   there's any patterns in there.
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:17.080]   There's not a supercomputer somewhere crunching, looking for patterns of, "I think he has a
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:19.680]   rule about not taking meetings on Monday.
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:20.680]   We got him.
[00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:22.340]   We got him, guys."
[00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:24.980]   Just keep some days different than others.
[00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:28.740]   I like the idea of balancing hard days with light days.
[00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:33.540]   You produce better work in a way that's more interesting and sustainable if you get after
[00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:38.580]   it one day and then you recover the next day, as opposed to taking the same number of hours
[00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:42.540]   and splitting them between the two days and putting the work in between meetings and other
[00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:44.120]   types of things going on.
[00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:48.900]   It's much more sustainable and you can produce cooler stuff if you just focus on something
[00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:49.900]   and produce it.
[00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:55.740]   Then the next day, you're just answering emails, doing some meetings, going for a long walk.
[00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:59.380]   That's more sustainable, and the work you do is going to be better.
[00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:03.900]   Also consider, again, if you have some control over how an organization runs, an idea I pitched
[00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:09.820]   in The Atlantic last spring, which was the hybrid attention model for hybrid work.
[00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:15.640]   Here the idea is I think many more offices should have a setup in which if you have some
[00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:20.920]   days that are remote and some days in office, so a hybrid schedule, synchronize the days
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:27.440]   where people are remote and make the rule no meetings on those days and probably no
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:30.860]   email response expectations either.
[00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:35.600]   The days you're at home, they just work on the stuff that's most valuable and just do
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:36.600]   that work.
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:40.240]   When you're in the office, you can have meetings and communicate as well.
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:47.360]   That's actually a better place to do that because one meeting in person can maybe knock
[00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:53.480]   off 50 emails that might be generated if you had that same meeting on Zoom while you're
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:54.480]   at home.
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.560]   Because when you're in person, now you're all in the place and the meeting's kind of
[00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:57.560]   over.
[00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:59.040]   You're like, "Hold on a second.
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:00.040]   What about this?
[00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:01.040]   What about that?"
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:06.720]   I've noticed this at Georgetown where I'm a professor.
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:11.320]   Our faculty meetings got moved virtual during COVID and now they're back entirely in person,
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:12.720]   which I like.
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:22.640]   I can notice a major improvement in emails and Zoom because we're all just in this room
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:29.360]   and the meeting ends and everyone is like, "I can take care of seven or eight hanging
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:32.240]   issues by just talking to people right here."
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:37.760]   Where before, if we're all in Zoom and just all logging out, that's seven or eight email
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:41.760]   threads I would have to initiate, each of which would now have any number of unscheduled
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:44.920]   messages that I have to see and reply to and all the clutter that comes with that.
[00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:47.600]   I like the hybrid attention model.
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:55.240]   Third and last foundational idea, when working, spaces impact your mind.
[00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:57.200]   Spaces matter.
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:02.880]   This is something I think we underestimated when we were initially extolling the potential
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:08.000]   virtuals of remote work in the pre-pandemic or early pandemic period.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:14.240]   We underestimated the effect of which being at an office in an office building had a psychological
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:18.040]   benefit of our mind saying, "This is a place to work."
[00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:24.160]   I understand when I am at my building at the office, I'm not thinking about signing up
[00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:26.160]   for day camps in the summer for my kids.
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:31.440]   I'm not thinking about, "We need to repaint the house or there might be a roof issue."
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:36.160]   I'm not thinking about my fitness routine because my weights are over there.
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:40.360]   I'm like, "Oh, I'm at the office, so I'm just thinking about office stuff."
[00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:43.600]   That reduces cognitive drag.
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:47.860]   It takes these sort of metaphorical cognitive barnacles off of the boat hole here that are
[00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:52.400]   all adding up drag that slows down your progress through the waters.
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:53.400]   We underestimated that effect.
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:57.300]   When we're working at home with the laundry basket right there and the home gym right
[00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:01.240]   there and the forms on the table that we need to fill out for the kids and all of those
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:04.940]   reminders of all this stuff that's unrelated to work, our mind has a little bit of attention
[00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:08.840]   moving between those, and that's taken away from our work, and we feel more distracted
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:13.160]   and unease and uncomfortable, and we run out of energy quicker, so spaces matter.
[00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:16.680]   We underestimated the value of commutes.
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:20.680]   We complained about them because it's a pain, especially if you live somewhere like in D.C.
[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:27.320]   and there's a lot of traffic, but commutes had a psychological benefit in terms of moving
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:30.340]   through space transformed our mind from one mindset to the other.
[00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:35.040]   I need to leave this cognitive context of work, and I need to shift to a cognitive context
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:37.960]   of my kids and home and my friends and life outside of work.
[00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:41.240]   A 20-minute drive is not a bad way to do that.
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:46.320]   You're moving through space, literally from one space where the first context is housed
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:50.080]   to another space where the next context is housed, and in that movement, you're able
[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:55.520]   to start clearing out what's in your mind from work, loading up what's relevant to home,
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:57.560]   taking a breather in between to make that transition.
[00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:01.080]   We lost that when it was just, "I'm at my kitchen table working, and next thing you
[00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:05.640]   know, I'm also making dinner at the same kitchen table."
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:07.960]   We underestimated the value of the commute.
[00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:11.920]   If you're working from home, you can recognize that idea and make some changes that is going
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:14.920]   to build on it and make your work-from-home experience much better.
[00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:21.720]   One, I'm a big believer in the phrase I coined in a New Yorker piece back in 2021, or maybe
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:28.480]   it was 2020, "Work from near home should be much more prevalent than it is right now."
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:31.640]   Work from near home means you have a remote work setup, but instead of doing your remote
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:34.680]   work in your home, you're doing it in a space near your home.
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:39.400]   You're not commuting to your office, but you're not working at your kitchen table either.
[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:44.040]   The Deep Work HQ, where I am right now, this is work from near home.
[00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:45.760]   I can almost see my house from here.
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:46.760]   It's a few blocks.
[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:51.160]   It's like a four or five-minute walk, but it's not my house.
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:58.080]   I can come here, even when I'm working from home, to work on writing a problem set for
[00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:02.440]   my discrete mathematics course or to work on an essay I'm writing for The New Yorker.
[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:07.080]   I could do that at home if it's a day I happen to be at home, but coming here gives me a
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:11.600]   dedicated cognitive context that's different than the context that is my house.
[00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:12.600]   Working from near home matters.
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:15.560]   It is something you should consider investing in.
[00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:17.560]   Renting cheap office space.
[00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:21.000]   The HQ is inexpensive office space.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.920]   It's the office space that's above commercial buildings on our small town main street.
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:30.320]   A lot of small town main streets have a lot of the sort of class B commercial space on
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:31.920]   top of the shops and the stores.
[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:34.760]   We're on top of a restaurant.
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:39.680]   I don't work here as much at the evening because it's rock and rolling downstairs, but it's
[00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:40.680]   fine in the morning.
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:43.920]   It's not a fancy office building.
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:46.760]   There are shared workspaces that could work as well.
[00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:50.240]   My point is, if you can work from near home, it's a completely different experience than
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:51.280]   actually working from home.
[00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:52.560]   I've converted some people, Jesse.
[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:59.280]   I've gotten at least a couple neighbors in the general area to have offices in the various
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:00.280]   office spaces.
[00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:04.560]   I don't know if they're doing this anymore, but during the pandemic, I knew some people
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:05.560]   who did this.
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:10.200]   There's a church down the street from where I live, an old church building.
[00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:14.080]   They had just like some extra office offices, you know, like church offices or whatever,
[00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:17.560]   and they were like leasing those out cheap, just like, yeah, you can have like a go to
[00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:21.260]   the church and there's like some offices in the back and people were doing their remote
[00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:22.260]   jobs from there.
[00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:23.960]   There's a lot of options like that.
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:27.480]   So anyways, I think that type of, that matters.
[00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:29.680]   You know, I think at first we're like, hey, this is cool.
[00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:32.720]   I'm at my house, but your house isn't great necessarily when it comes to actually getting
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:33.720]   things done.
[00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:38.320]   If you are working at your house, spend money on spaces to the extent possible.
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:42.220]   Prioritize investing in your spaces to make them better for work.
[00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:43.220]   That is not a triviality.
[00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:45.040]   It shouldn't be an afterthought.
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:48.500]   It should be as important as making sure that like you have the right laptop to work at
[00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:52.040]   home or the right lighting camera to do the zoom you have to do all day.
[00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:58.520]   We should spend more money to the extent possible on making our workspaces better for working.
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:03.360]   If you have a shed, consider transforming that into a workspace in your backyard.
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:05.560]   Will transform your experience of work.
[00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:12.200]   If you have a home office, consider transforming it to be a space you really like to be in.
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:13.560]   These type of things matter.
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:18.120]   Inside, if you're working at home, separate deep workspace from logistical space.
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:21.200]   Have a cool space you use just for depth.
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.200]   You don't do email there.
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.200]   You don't have a printer there.
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:24.720]   You don't fill out forms there.
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:28.840]   You go there to think, to do the hard stuff, the code, to write that memo, to figure out
[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:29.840]   the strategy.
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:33.080]   And then you have a separate space where you do the logistical stuff.
[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:37.080]   So maybe like wherever like the home office is in your house where you pay your taxes
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:39.960]   and bills and you have your printer and your filing cabinet, use that for your logistical
[00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:43.560]   space but build a deep workspace somewhere else.
[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:46.440]   It could be, you know, a nice chair by your bookshelf somewhere.
[00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:51.200]   At my house, I have a library where I write and I read.
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:54.580]   And then upstairs in an alcove, we have the sort of home office where the filing cabinets
[00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:58.280]   and the printers and the scanners and I do my taxes and if I'm doing email or something,
[00:28:58.280 --> 00:28:59.280]   I'll do it up there.
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:01.240]   And if I'm writing at home, I'll do it in the other space.
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:04.240]   That can make a difference.
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:05.760]   Consider adventure work.
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:09.760]   It's an idea I first introduced when I was giving advice for students.
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:11.280]   We called it adventure studying.
[00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:14.320]   It is going to cool places to do work.
[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:15.320]   You're working from home.
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:21.040]   You might say, okay, I have to read this like complicated report, summarize it or figure
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:22.420]   out our recommendations.
[00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:24.720]   I'm going to go somewhere interesting to do that.
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:27.240]   Like, well, why don't I go to downtown DC?
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:28.960]   I used to do this.
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:33.560]   Go to like a museum and I'm going to like read it in like an interesting part in one
[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:34.560]   of the museums.
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:38.680]   I'm going to go like downstairs at the National Gallery near the waterfall where there's no
[00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:39.920]   cell phone reception at the cafeteria.
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:43.560]   I'm going to get a cup of coffee and read it there and then I'm going to walk through
[00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:45.440]   this gallery to see whatever it is.
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:48.880]   I want to look at Renaissance art to sort of get inspired and take a break and then
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:53.360]   I'm going to move over to the cafe in the other wing and there I'm going to sit down
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:54.360]   and make my recommendations.
[00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:56.680]   Like go to a cool place to do this type of work.
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:59.480]   It's more fun, it's less drag and you get more creativity.
[00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:01.960]   I'm a big fan of adventure working.
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:06.480]   And finally, simulate a commute even if you're at home and typically this will be a long
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:07.480]   walk.
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:10.880]   I am going to do a 20-minute walk to shut down my workday.
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:14.400]   So I'll do my shutdown routine and have a 20-minute walk to sort of get my headspace
[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:18.640]   out of work, to start reflecting on other things, to clear my head, get some blood flowing.
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:21.680]   And then when I get back from that walk, it's like my commute is over and now I'm ready
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:23.840]   for home life.
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:27.720]   I'm a big believer in doing a workout as your simulated commute.
[00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:33.160]   Maybe go around the block and do like a workout and it's a hard physical effort that can just
[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:35.680]   reset your body and your mind and then when you're done with that, you're like, "Oh, now
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:38.120]   I'm done with work."
[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:43.120]   Don't just be like type, type, type, type, type, type, type, type, turn, I'm now at home.
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:44.360]   Simulate the commute, it makes a big difference.
[00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:47.080]   All right, so those are my three ideas.
[00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:49.720]   One, workload management and structured communication.
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:52.320]   You need that for remote work to be successful.
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:31:00.480]   Two, was about seasonality, variations in intensity is what makes remote work's full
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:01.760]   potential unfold.
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:04.920]   So really fight to get that into your remote work setup and three spaces matter, where
[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:06.400]   you work, your commute.
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:11.360]   You need to care about that if you want remote work to be like a something you really like
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:14.560]   about your job and not something that you're like indifferent towards or maybe even makes
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:15.560]   it worse.
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:18.960]   So there you go.
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:20.840]   Remote work.
[00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:23.720]   The hardest thing writing about remote work, Jesse, is actually the different terminology
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:27.920]   because you can't just keep saying the word remote work and also you use work as a verb
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:29.900]   often and you get redundant works.
[00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:33.400]   So you have like virtual work and telework and remote work, but then you have to throw
[00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:36.680]   in telecommuting, even though that's an old term, because it allows you to reference the
[00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:38.600]   concept without repeating the word work.
[00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:40.980]   It's actually like a surprisingly tricky thing.
[00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:44.280]   It's hard to have the right references to write about this.
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:45.520]   Yeah, I've noticed that.
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:48.120]   You also use the word, did you use bloviation?
[00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:49.120]   Yes.
[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:50.120]   What does that mean?
[00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:51.120]   Bloviation.
[00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:55.840]   That's the talk in a sort of like loudmouth or brash manner.
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:59.640]   As made famous by Bill O'Reilly.
[00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:00.880]   Remember his show on Fox News?
[00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:01.880]   Yeah.
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:02.880]   He would always say something.
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:03.880]   I forgot the exact context.
[00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:04.880]   This is like 90s, I don't know.
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:05.880]   It's like childhood.
[00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:11.200]   But he always would say, I don't know if he was doing like reader, I don't know the show
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:12.200]   well.
[00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:18.040]   Maybe it was like reader mail or something, but he would always say something, no bloviation
[00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:20.360]   or don't bloviate, I don't know.
[00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:21.360]   He liked to use that word.
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:25.080]   And it was like funny and ironic because he was a bloviator.
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:26.080]   Brash and loudmouth.
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:27.080]   It was like this ironic thing.
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:28.840]   It's a good term, bloviate.
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:29.840]   All right.
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:31.960]   Well, we got some good questions coming up.
[00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:34.880]   But first, let's hear briefly from a sponsor.
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:38.160]   I want to talk about our friends at Notion.
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:39.160]   You heard me talk about Notion.
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:43.680]   It's a tool that helps you combine your notes, docs, and projects into one space.
[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:46.920]   That's simple and beautifully designed.
[00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:51.740]   What's cool is you can now leverage the power of AI right inside Notion across all of your
[00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:56.000]   notes and docs without having to jump between your work and some sort of separate AI power
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.440]   tool you have in a browser and app somewhere else.
[00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:01.600]   It's integrated right into Notion.
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:05.020]   The fully integrated Notion AI helps you work faster, write better, and think bigger doing
[00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:07.880]   tasks that normally take you hours.
[00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:10.040]   Now you can do them in just seconds.
[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:13.200]   So we had a bunch of people write in about Notion.
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:14.200]   What episode was this, Jesse?
[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:15.200]   335.
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:16.200]   So that's not long ago.
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:17.200]   Yeah.
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:21.520]   I was talking about an issue I was having with calendars and trying to sync my calendar
[00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:23.640]   with my wife's calendar and then another calendar.
[00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:28.720]   It was kind of a complicated setup I had about how I wanted to track various commitments.
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:32.420]   Multiple people unsolicited wrote in and said, "Oh, you could build a system to do that
[00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:35.160]   easy in Notion.
[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:36.160]   That would be your tool."
[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:38.160]   So it's an example of the type of places people use Notion.
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:41.640]   "Oh, I'm going to build a little custom information system here to keep track of different events
[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:44.600]   between various people with the relevant information."
[00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:48.840]   I mentioned our ad agency had this cool system they'd built before with Notion to keep track
[00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:49.840]   of our ads.
[00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:52.120]   "Show me what ads we need to read this week."
[00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:53.120]   "All right.
[00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:54.120]   Well, let me click on this ad.
[00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:57.760]   Now show me all of the reads we've done for this ad and how many reads are coming up.
[00:33:57.760 --> 00:33:59.520]   Show me the script for this ad.
[00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:02.200]   Now show me a calendar where I can see all the places where this shows up."
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:06.140]   These sort of complicated information systems, you can make them easy in Notion.
[00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:11.080]   But now that they have the AI support, all of this just becomes even better.
[00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:12.880]   The Notion AI will help you write.
[00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:17.160]   It can jumpstart a brainstorm and turn your messy notes into something polished.
[00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:21.200]   It can even automate tedious tasks like summarizing meeting notes or finding next steps, help
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:22.820]   you find information.
[00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:27.200]   It's no surprise that Notion is used by over half of Fortune 500 companies and teams that
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:32.800]   use Notion send less email, cancel more meetings, save time searching for their work, and reduce
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:36.460]   spending on tools, which helps keep everyone on the same page.
[00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:37.960]   I'm all about structured work.
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:39.680]   We just talked on the deep dive.
[00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:42.560]   Notion is a great tool for achieving that goal.
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:49.120]   So try Notion for free when you go to Notion.com/cal and you need to type that in all lowercase
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:55.720]   letters for this to work, but go to Notion.com/cal to try the powerful, easy to use Notion AI
[00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:56.720]   today.
[00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:59.600]   And when you use our link, you will be supporting our show.
[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:03.040]   That is Notion.com/cal.
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:08.960]   As long as we're on a technology theme, I also want to talk about our friends at Oracle.
[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:14.120]   Even if you think it's a bit overhyped, AI is suddenly everywhere, from self driving
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:17.840]   cars to molecular medicine to business efficiency.
[00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:22.840]   If it's not in your industry yet, it is coming, and it's coming fast.
[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:24.880]   But AI needs a lot of speed and computing power.
[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:28.220]   So how do you compete without costs spiraling out of control?
[00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:33.160]   Time to upgrade to the next generation of the cloud, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, or
[00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:34.160]   OCI.
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:38.840]   OCI is a blazing fast and secure platform for your infrastructure, database, application
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:42.800]   development, plus all your AI and machine learning workloads.
[00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:49.880]   OCI costs 50% less for compute and 80% less for networking, so you're saving a pile of
[00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:50.880]   money.
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:55.240]   Thousands of businesses have already upgraded to OCI, including Vodafone, Thomson Reuters,
[00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:57.240]   and Suno AI.
[00:35:57.240 --> 00:36:03.360]   Right now, Oracle is offering to cut your current bill in half if you move to OCI.
[00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:06.560]   This is for new U.S. customers with minimum financial commitment.
[00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:08.240]   Offer ends March 31st.
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:14.800]   See if your company qualifies for this special offer at oracle.com/deepquestions.
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:15.800]   That's oracle.com/deepquestions.
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:21.200]   All right, Jesse, let's move on to the questions.
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:25.280]   All right, first question is from Alex, and we have a video.
[00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:30.200]   Alex says, what are your views on focus and attention management compared to time management?
[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:34.200]   All right, so I'm glad we have a video for this one because I'm not exactly sure how
[00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:35.200]   he's using these terms.
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:38.920]   So for those who are watching, instead of just listening, we're going to bring this
[00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:43.980]   video up here on the screen now, but everyone will be able to hear it.
[00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:50.680]   Is that of focus and attention management instead of time management?
[00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:54.760]   Now a lot of people are drawn to time management because they recognize a problem that they
[00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:58.640]   find it difficult to get stuff done throughout the day.
[00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:02.920]   They feel a lack of time to do things.
[00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:06.960]   But it's important to realize that that's not actually what it is.
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:11.680]   You see, we as humans don't have a great sense of time to begin with.
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:15.040]   So how is it that we can notice a lack of time?
[00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:17.200]   The thing is that what we're noticing isn't a lack of time.
[00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:23.640]   What we're noticing is a lack of result or a lack of the ability to do certain activities
[00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:26.360]   or get certain tasks done.
[00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:32.560]   So the question is, if I could extend out time infinitely, would that solve the problem?
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:34.400]   Naturally the answer seems to be yes.
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:39.080]   But actually no, because during that time we would end up just scheduling and wanting
[00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:40.580]   to do more things.
[00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:41.920]   So take this for example.
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:45.480]   Let's say that a day was only one hour long.
[00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:50.920]   Would we even try to do as much as we want to do in a normal day or a normal week?
[00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:53.480]   The answer is naturally no.
[00:37:53.480 --> 00:38:01.760]   So what we're noticing actually is a failure of our own behavior or action at fulfilling
[00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:06.360]   a certain set of tasks or activities that we wanted to do.
[00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:07.360]   All right.
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:09.520]   I think I get what he's saying.
[00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:10.880]   I was a little distracted.
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:16.080]   I don't know if you noticed this, Jesse, which is a new YouTube format I haven't seen before.
[00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:21.480]   Do you notice while he's talking, he's sort of drawing pictures.
[00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:22.840]   Actually the video is four years old.
[00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:23.840]   I notice it too.
[00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:24.840]   Yeah.
[00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:25.840]   He must be doing it.
[00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:26.840]   Yeah.
[00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:27.840]   But he's not doing it live.
[00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:29.360]   So he must be going back afterwards.
[00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:31.160]   And he's just as bad of an artist as I am.
[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:32.160]   So that's interesting.
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:34.920]   But man, that's an interesting format.
[00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:37.800]   So imagine if you just had my bad drawings next to me this whole time.
[00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:39.200]   I think I get what he's saying.
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:40.200]   All right.
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:43.560]   Tell me if this seems like a fair summary, Jesse, because you listen to it as well.
[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:50.340]   The point I'm trying to pull out of this from him is that he's saying it's not just about
[00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:56.200]   how much time you have to do things, which is what time management cares about.
[00:38:56.200 --> 00:39:02.240]   Your ability to focus or pay attention matters as well, because if that runs out, who cares
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:04.320]   if you have 10 more hours for you?
[00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:05.320]   Right.
[00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:06.320]   You're not going to do anything.
[00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:07.320]   Mm-hmm (affirmative).
[00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:10.400]   And it's like you need to care about your focus and attention management as much or
[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:11.680]   maybe even more than time management.
[00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:12.680]   Does that seem fair?
[00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:13.680]   Yeah.
[00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:19.000]   There was a book back in the early days of my writing, Tony Schwartz wrote a book called
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:23.880]   The Power of Full Engagement, and it was about energy management.
[00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:26.320]   This was a big deal in the business space.
[00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:28.560]   This probably would have been an early 2000s-era style book.
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:29.560]   I actually met him once.
[00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:33.160]   We spoke at the same conference.
[00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:36.560]   I'm trying to remember.
[00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:39.620]   Back in the day when I did more of this stuff, so this would have been like the 2000s.
[00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:42.280]   His argument, I'll add it to the list, was like your energy is what matters.
[00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:44.940]   If your energy runs out, you can't do any work.
[00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:49.140]   So if you're a business person, his argument was, you should care a lot about how much
[00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:52.760]   energy can I maintain throughout the day, and that has to do with diet and sleep and
[00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:53.860]   variability, et cetera.
[00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:59.260]   So I'll throw that into this same sort of focus and attention management category.
[00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:01.380]   Here's how I think about these things.
[00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:04.940]   Time management is about making a reasonable plan for the time you have available, typically
[00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:06.020]   like on the scale of a day.
[00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:09.060]   I want to make a good plan for the time I have available today.
[00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:16.060]   I'm managing my time as opposed to just sort of reactively trying to execute tasks as I
[00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:17.780]   feel like I have time to do it.
[00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:20.660]   So time block planning is a classic time management move.
[00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:25.240]   You're saying, I want to manage the time I have available today to accomplish, I want
[00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:29.780]   a reasonable plan, whatever that is, to get a lot done or to get certain key things done
[00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:30.780]   or to relax.
[00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:36.740]   But you're managing your time towards a goal to accomplish a reasonable plan.
[00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:41.820]   I think of energy management, focus management, attention management, all of these sort of
[00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:43.740]   things.
[00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:49.660]   They all control what reasonable means.
[00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:55.540]   What are you capable of accomplishing with your time-managed plan?
[00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:57.660]   So let me make this a little bit more concrete.
[00:40:57.660 --> 00:41:01.980]   Let's say you have bad energy management.
[00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:03.820]   You're sleeping poorly.
[00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:05.620]   You're out of shape.
[00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:06.980]   You're eating poorly.
[00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:12.500]   Your morning is like doughnuts and energy drinks, and you just crash, right?
[00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:17.220]   You really crash by mid-morning, and then you have a terrible lunch, and you have an
[00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:20.220]   hour-long carb high, and then you crash again.
[00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:22.340]   It's hard for you to focus.
[00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:26.960]   What is reasonably possible for you to do when you're making your plan for the day is
[00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:30.220]   really limited by that, because you only have a certain number of windows where you can
[00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:32.100]   really be doing good work.
[00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:37.220]   So your space of reasonable plans when you're doing your time management is somewhat constrained
[00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:38.220]   here.
[00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:44.480]   You don't have a reasonable plan available, for example, where you get after something
[00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:46.900]   hard all afternoon because your energy is not there.
[00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:48.260]   Here's another concrete example.
[00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:50.140]   Let's say your attention management is very poor.
[00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:52.480]   You're like a typical young person.
[00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:54.520]   You are on your phone a lot.
[00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:57.780]   Even when you're working, you're constantly contact-shifting and quick-checking your phone
[00:41:57.780 --> 00:42:01.220]   and seeing what's going on on TikTok or seeing what's going on with text messages with your
[00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:03.780]   friends or et cetera.
[00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:08.780]   This also reduces the possibility of reasonable plans you can succeed with when you're managing
[00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:13.000]   your time for the day, because your attention is so divided that it's very high friction
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.100]   to focus on anything, and you're probably better suited.
[00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:18.660]   The plans that are reasonable are going to be those that are built around lots of small
[00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:21.980]   tasks that already have you divide your attention or assume a division of your attention.
[00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:26.460]   You can't really have long, deep sessions.
[00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:32.380]   So energy management, focus management, attention management, that type of stuff gives you your
[00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:35.700]   set of options for what is possible for a given day.
[00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:39.420]   And then time management is how you, once you've chosen one of those options, how you
[00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:42.540]   actually plan your time to execute it.
[00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:46.780]   The time management part of your brain is like, "Hey, let me know what's on the plate.
[00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:50.700]   You give me something we can actually do and I'll arrange the time to make sure it happens.
[00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:55.520]   But if you're really distracted or your energy is really low or what have you, all I do is
[00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:56.740]   move the time around.
[00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:59.140]   I can't control what you're actually able to do with it.
[00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:03.460]   So you can tell me to schedule a day where we're going to focus deeply on a book chapter
[00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:07.420]   for six hours, but that's not going to happen because of these other things.
[00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:09.860]   So you need both of these.
[00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:13.420]   Time management, you need some notion of how you control your time in the day so that you're
[00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:15.380]   in control and your time doesn't control you.
[00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:18.500]   Otherwise you're just going to get pushed around by the incoming and reactive.
[00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:21.780]   Managing your time critically does not mean optimizing your time.
[00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:25.140]   Managing your time critically does not mean trying to maximize the number of things you
[00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:26.500]   do.
[00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:28.300]   We talked about this in the deep dive.
[00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:31.740]   Time blocking is a fantastic tool for people who want to work less because you can have
[00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:36.620]   super clarity about, "This time I'm not working and I feel good about it because I know what
[00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:40.180]   I'm doing before and the key things are getting done."
[00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:44.260]   You also need to be working on long-term things like your energy, your focus, and your attention
[00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:46.940]   because that gives you more options when you manage your time.
[00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:50.220]   And so you have to work on reclaiming your brain and getting away from distractions.
[00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:52.300]   You got to get comfort with focusing on hard things.
[00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:56.140]   That's a skill you have to train with just like you might train to play the guitar.
[00:43:56.140 --> 00:43:59.700]   You be careful about energy and how you eat and how you sleep and how you exercise.
[00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:02.580]   All of this gives you more options.
[00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:06.300]   And then time management is just how you play with whatever of these options you choose.
[00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:07.300]   All right.
[00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:08.300]   So I don't know.
[00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:09.300]   That's my distinction.
[00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:10.300]   You need both.
[00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:12.260]   I think it's a good question because sometimes people have one but not the other.
[00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:16.020]   I know people who are really focused on, "I don't want to be distracted.
[00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:20.900]   I read hard books, I don't use my phone as a default source of distraction, I have hobbies
[00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:21.900]   that force me to focus.
[00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:23.220]   My mind is like a tool."
[00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:26.980]   I know some academics like this, but they have bad time management.
[00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:32.140]   So they don't actually apply that tool in a way that would really help them achieve
[00:44:32.140 --> 00:44:33.140]   their goals.
[00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:37.060]   And I have another people who are just so locked in on time management and I'm all time
[00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:41.020]   blocked and it's all multi-scaled and I really control my time.
[00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:45.260]   But their attention is just shot and nothing gets done.
[00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:46.300]   You really do have to have both.
[00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:49.580]   I think about that a lot.
[00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:51.660]   This is the big issue I have with the anti-productivity crowd.
[00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:56.620]   They think if you just don't do time management, somehow the work that you're expected to do
[00:44:56.620 --> 00:44:57.620]   goes away.
[00:44:57.620 --> 00:44:59.300]   It doesn't go away.
[00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:01.300]   You can be disorganized.
[00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:07.860]   The work you have to do is not generated as a side effect of managing your time.
[00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:09.180]   It just exists.
[00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:11.900]   This is the expectations for your job.
[00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:14.740]   You can manage your time or not.
[00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:17.060]   It's not what makes this happen.
[00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:23.140]   Tasks do not, like we used to think about eels, just sort of materialize out of the
[00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:24.140]   ether.
[00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:27.140]   They show up in the mud at some point.
[00:45:27.140 --> 00:45:31.560]   The tasks are here because your boss wants you to do these things.
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:35.980]   You can manage your time or not, but the management is not making those tasks less.
[00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:39.340]   The management of your time is not making the tasks appear.
[00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:42.300]   So, anyways, what do we got next?
[00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:43.460]   Next question is from Max.
[00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:47.060]   "I work as a technical journalist for F1 website.
[00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:51.260]   How can I self-study technical concepts to improve my articles so that they can be so
[00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:53.180]   good they can't be ignored?"
[00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:56.940]   I think when it comes to technical knowledge, you basically have to take yourself back to
[00:45:56.940 --> 00:46:03.580]   school, which means you need to be in some way simulated or otherwise tested on the new
[00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:05.340]   things you're trying to learn.
[00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:09.700]   All right, I'm trying to understand this complicated topic.
[00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:14.620]   I need some way of being tested on my understanding of that, that I'm studying for, and in studying
[00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:16.460]   for that test, I learn it.
[00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:19.500]   What you can't do is just read a bunch of stuff and hope it sticks.
[00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:23.500]   Some stuff will stick, but this is a very inefficient way of doing it.
[00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:24.820]   So you need to test.
[00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:26.820]   Now, there might not be an actual test.
[00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:28.980]   You have to sort of find some way of simulating that.
[00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:34.500]   I am going to write a full explanatory summary of this particular game theory topic that
[00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:40.060]   the F1 teams are now using, and I'm going to give it to one of our game theoreticians
[00:46:40.060 --> 00:46:41.060]   who works on the team.
[00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:42.060]   They're like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:43.060]   I'll take a look at it, mate."
[00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:44.060]   You're like, "Okay."
[00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:45.420]   They're going to look at this and see if I really understand this or not.
[00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:50.060]   So now I have a test that I'm working towards that's forcing me to actually integrate the
[00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:54.500]   information and study it like I would study material if I was still a student.
[00:46:54.500 --> 00:47:00.700]   So when it comes to that type of technical stuff, it's just like I say for college kids.
[00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:05.580]   Active recall, producing information from scratch, being tested on your knowledge.
[00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:07.000]   That's how you learn it.
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   And it's quick.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   It's actually a very...
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:12.500]   If you have a test coming up and you're doing active recall for that test, you'll learn
[00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:13.500]   the material quick.
[00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:16.460]   It's very hard, but you'll learn the material quick as compared to just reading it again
[00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:19.760]   and again and hoping that you understand it.
[00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:25.100]   So test yourself, even if that's just creating the test on your own.
[00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:26.940]   I'm assuming he means racing, right?
[00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:27.940]   Yeah.
[00:47:27.940 --> 00:47:28.940]   F1?
[00:47:28.940 --> 00:47:29.940]   Yeah.
[00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:30.940]   Yeah.
[00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:31.940]   I think it's a good combination for, you know...
[00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:32.940]   He's recently out of school too.
[00:47:32.940 --> 00:47:34.300]   So it's like his first job.
[00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:40.660]   I met some F1 people years back when I went to more computer science conferences.
[00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:45.340]   I went to a conference in Brazil, and at the computer science conference, they had someone
[00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:48.820]   from an F1 team and he was telling me all about the...
[00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:51.780]   I used this example in the question, he was a game theory expert.
[00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:57.140]   So like his whole thing with the mathematics of trying to figure out optimal pitting.
[00:47:57.140 --> 00:48:01.460]   And with game theory, you figure out like the equilibrium.
[00:48:01.460 --> 00:48:06.180]   So the mixed strategy for all the racers to do in terms of how often they're going to
[00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:11.860]   do pit stops, that gets you to a place where no one person can now improve their position
[00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:13.060]   anymore.
[00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:18.180]   And because they're so hyper-rational, these teams, the pit stop strategies would evolve
[00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:22.220]   towards these like Nash equilibriums because they would figure out like what is the absolute
[00:48:22.220 --> 00:48:23.220]   optimal...
[00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:26.780]   Like if we do this, but if you're pitting this way and we pit this way, it'll be an
[00:48:26.780 --> 00:48:27.780]   advantage.
[00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:29.940]   But if you know we're going to pit that way, you're going to pit a different way, and that's
[00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:30.940]   going to make this a disadvantage.
[00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:34.580]   And you eventually find this sort of true style, they call them a Nash equilibrium,
[00:48:34.580 --> 00:48:39.540]   but it's like a point in the fitness landscape where you can't unilaterally improve your
[00:48:39.540 --> 00:48:40.540]   position.
[00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:45.300]   So you figure out these strategies eventually where, okay, this is kind of the best we can
[00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:46.300]   do.
[00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:47.300]   And that's what they would do.
[00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:51.740]   It's just like straight up math guy hanging out with all these cool like F1 people.
[00:48:51.740 --> 00:48:54.580]   They spend so much money on those teams.
[00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:55.580]   It's crazy.
[00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:56.580]   How much do they spend?
[00:48:56.580 --> 00:48:58.340]   Have you seen the show on Netflix?
[00:48:58.340 --> 00:48:59.460]   I saw some of it.
[00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:00.460]   You see those centers?
[00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:06.900]   It'll be for like one race car will have like what looks to be essentially like the headquarters
[00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:10.700]   for Stark Industries, like one race car and like whole team.
[00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:13.780]   I do not understand how that spawns.
[00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:17.740]   There must be so much money in that because they spend so much money, just billions.
[00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:20.460]   I don't know if it's billions, but like hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:23.060]   It must be worth it because it's such an international sport.
[00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:24.060]   Yeah.
[00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:25.060]   And it's marketing.
[00:49:25.060 --> 00:49:26.060]   Yeah, I guess.
[00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:32.420]   It's marketing and brand recognition, but man, they spend and like I'm not afraid to
[00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:33.420]   say it.
[00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:37.300]   They spend more than we spend on our show here at Team Questions.
[00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:40.460]   I don't want to shock people.
[00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:41.460]   They spend more.
[00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:42.460]   All right.
[00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:43.460]   What do we got next?
[00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:44.460]   Next question is from Jacob.
[00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:49.380]   I'm a PhD student in aerospace engineering at UCLA and I'm considering dropping out after
[00:49:49.380 --> 00:49:51.020]   three and a half years.
[00:49:51.020 --> 00:49:53.180]   My goal was to be an astronaut.
[00:49:53.180 --> 00:49:55.140]   My PhD topic is okay.
[00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:57.540]   I'm overwhelmed and I have financial troubles.
[00:49:57.540 --> 00:50:01.220]   It'll probably take me another three years to finish it if I stick with the program.
[00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:04.820]   Should I enter the space industry now, which is a master's?
[00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:11.860]   Look, Jacob, I think this is a situation where evidence-based career planning is probably
[00:50:11.860 --> 00:50:17.420]   lacking and is now needed to be pretty aggressively inserted.
[00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:23.500]   So evidence-based career planning is, think of it as the complement to my concept of lifestyle
[00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:26.620]   centric planning, which also I don't know that you're doing.
[00:50:26.620 --> 00:50:33.180]   I think I want to be an astronaut is often the epitome of grand goal planning, right?
[00:50:33.180 --> 00:50:36.460]   This one goal is going to make my life better as opposed to lifestyle centric planning,
[00:50:36.460 --> 00:50:41.380]   but I'll put my lifestyle centric planning tirade to the side here and focus on, again,
[00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:46.180]   its complement is evidence-based career planning because once you're actually going towards
[00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:50.740]   a plan, be it a lifestyle centric plan or a grand goal plan, you need to figure out
[00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:54.840]   the right way to make progress and here you have to ground your decisions and evidence
[00:50:54.840 --> 00:51:00.040]   from real people who understand how that part of the world works, who are telling you clearly
[00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:04.540]   what you're doing makes sense and it's the right way to get there.
[00:51:04.540 --> 00:51:05.540]   People skip this.
[00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:10.380]   It sounds obvious, like of course you would do that, but people don't.
[00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:16.780]   They write themselves stories where the moral of the story is whatever move that is sort
[00:51:16.780 --> 00:51:21.700]   of available or feels emotionally interesting is like the right thing to do.
[00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:26.380]   You go off to get your doctorate, not because you sat down and we're like talking to people
[00:51:26.380 --> 00:51:31.340]   from the NASA program and like this is how this works and if you go here and get this
[00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:35.180]   degree plus this type of training, you've got this pretty good chance of actually making
[00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:38.700]   it to the program and here's how you can part of evidence career planning, by the way, is
[00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:41.900]   learning what the milestones are along the way you can use to assess that you're making
[00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:42.900]   progress.
[00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:46.340]   Like look, if you're here by your third year, then you are still on track, but if you're
[00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:48.660]   not then this is probably not going to be for you.
[00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:52.420]   That's evidence-based career planning, but what people do instead is like I don't know,
[00:51:52.420 --> 00:51:53.420]   I want to be an astronaut.
[00:51:53.420 --> 00:51:56.860]   I also kind of grad school, this seems I can apply to this now, there's something kind
[00:51:56.860 --> 00:51:58.500]   of romantic about being at UCLA.
[00:51:58.500 --> 00:51:59.500]   Let's just do that.
[00:51:59.500 --> 00:52:04.340]   Like I know astronauts have these degrees often and you kind of go off and after a while
[00:52:04.340 --> 00:52:06.880]   you're like I don't know, I don't have any money and I don't know if this really matters
[00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:08.460]   and maybe I should stop it.
[00:52:08.460 --> 00:52:12.260]   Those answers, if you did evidence-based career planning, should be crystal clear.
[00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:17.140]   So what you need to do now is once you identify what you're looking for, and I do think you
[00:52:17.140 --> 00:52:20.420]   need the lifestyle plan here, right?
[00:52:20.420 --> 00:52:23.180]   You got to talk to people who are going to sanity check your plan and you got to hear
[00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:24.740]   things you don't want to hear necessarily.
[00:52:24.740 --> 00:52:27.140]   They might say this doesn't matter.
[00:52:27.140 --> 00:52:32.500]   I don't care about that degree or this degree does matter, this other thing doesn't, right?
[00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:36.460]   But you want, if you're especially if you're making a move like getting various types of
[00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:41.060]   graduate degrees, you need crystal clear evidence from people who know this degree will get
[00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:42.580]   you this opportunity.
[00:52:42.580 --> 00:52:43.780]   Without this degree you can't.
[00:52:43.780 --> 00:52:45.500]   It has to be crystal clear.
[00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:48.380]   This is exactly why I'm doing this.
[00:52:48.380 --> 00:52:56.100]   You cannot get job X at space industry company Y without master's degree Z.
[00:52:56.100 --> 00:52:57.660]   So go get that degree from this place.
[00:52:57.660 --> 00:53:00.940]   This is a sufficiently good place that if you get the degree here, it will open up this
[00:53:00.940 --> 00:53:01.940]   pool of jobs.
[00:53:01.940 --> 00:53:04.580]   You'll probably get one of those jobs and here's what this job is really like.
[00:53:04.580 --> 00:53:06.300]   You need that type of information.
[00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:10.320]   Otherwise you're sort of just wandering through the landscape of possibilities, accruing credentials
[00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:13.660]   you think are interesting and hoping it leads to interesting things.
[00:53:13.660 --> 00:53:16.300]   So this is a time to do serious evidence-based planning.
[00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:19.940]   Now you could stick with your grand goal of being an astronaut, sure.
[00:53:19.940 --> 00:53:22.020]   Get a sanity check.
[00:53:22.020 --> 00:53:23.980]   Is this possible for me?
[00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:28.620]   If so, exactly what would I need to do from here and what would be my milestones along
[00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:32.140]   the way I would have to hit on this path so I know if I'm failing on one of these milestones
[00:53:32.140 --> 00:53:37.120]   I can eject off that path before I go too much farther?
[00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:38.120]   Or you could do lifestyle-centric planning.
[00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:41.900]   I'm probably not going to be an astronaut, but what do I want to do?
[00:53:41.900 --> 00:53:42.900]   What do I want my life to be like?
[00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:44.740]   Where do I want to live in the country?
[00:53:44.740 --> 00:53:47.940]   What do I want my daily work to be like?
[00:53:47.940 --> 00:53:48.940]   What's resonating?
[00:53:48.940 --> 00:53:54.660]   Is seeing early videos of Mark Rober when he still worked at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory
[00:53:54.660 --> 00:53:58.660]   on the Mars Rover, is that like, hey, this lifestyle looks cool.
[00:53:58.660 --> 00:54:02.380]   He's working with cool people in a clean suit and you're building things and it's complicated
[00:54:02.380 --> 00:54:05.900]   engineering and you get to see your work actually up there and it's challenging, but the hours
[00:54:05.900 --> 00:54:08.940]   are usually reasonable and you can live in this cool place and mountain bike all the
[00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:09.940]   time.
[00:54:09.940 --> 00:54:14.980]   Actually, if I work at Jet Propulsion Laboratory, I can live in Alameda and you build this whole
[00:54:14.980 --> 00:54:17.700]   picture out of this would be a great lifestyle.
[00:54:17.700 --> 00:54:18.700]   That's the other way to do this here.
[00:54:18.700 --> 00:54:22.820]   You build out this vision of a lifestyle that takes advantage of capital you have and say,
[00:54:22.820 --> 00:54:25.340]   okay, how do I get there as closely as possible?
[00:54:25.340 --> 00:54:28.380]   And then you're getting your evidence from, if I want this job at this place, what degree
[00:54:28.380 --> 00:54:29.380]   do I need?
[00:54:29.380 --> 00:54:32.540]   What milestones can I look at to see if my degree or grades or program is sufficient
[00:54:32.540 --> 00:54:33.540]   to get it?
[00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:34.540]   What else are they looking for?
[00:54:34.660 --> 00:54:38.700]   So you got to choose what you're looking for and then you got to get the evidence.
[00:54:38.700 --> 00:54:41.800]   Pretend like you're writing a book about whatever you decide you're trying to do, like you're
[00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:46.140]   writing a short book called "How to Do X."
[00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:50.720]   Like I'm doing research to write a how-to book about how to succeed in this thing.
[00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:55.020]   Gather that evidence, gird your loins because you might not like what you hear.
[00:54:55.020 --> 00:54:59.340]   And in fact, you might hear for your plan, no, you're off the path.
[00:54:59.340 --> 00:55:00.340]   That's just not possible.
[00:55:00.340 --> 00:55:01.340]   You got to change.
[00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:02.340]   Like, okay, great.
[00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:05.580]   Let me change now before it's too late.
[00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:08.900]   So clarity about what you're looking for, whether that's grand goal or lifestyle centric,
[00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:10.220]   and then you got to do evidence-based planning.
[00:55:10.220 --> 00:55:13.900]   You got to talk to real people and get real evidence about these specific steps I'm doing
[00:55:13.900 --> 00:55:17.820]   specifically will help me and get those milestones figured out.
[00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:22.460]   Here's how I will know before I get to the very end of this plan, if things are not going
[00:55:22.460 --> 00:55:23.460]   well.
[00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:27.180]   So those would be the things I would put in there.
[00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:28.500]   People leave out the milestones are good.
[00:55:28.500 --> 00:55:31.700]   I think it's important.
[00:55:31.700 --> 00:55:36.540]   Technical programs in particular, you can milestone this very clearly.
[00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:41.820]   If you want to be a professor, for example, which honestly is outside of some exceptions,
[00:55:41.820 --> 00:55:49.140]   some fields, that is the primary reason to get a PhD is to be in academia.
[00:55:49.140 --> 00:55:51.780]   There are really clear milestones you can get.
[00:55:51.780 --> 00:55:55.940]   Am I really going to like, so let's say you have a dream of you want a job like mine.
[00:55:55.940 --> 00:56:02.660]   Like I want to be a tenured professor at a top 20 university with, you know, grad students
[00:56:02.660 --> 00:56:07.420]   and working on like have a relatively limited teaching load and great kids that I'm teaching
[00:56:07.420 --> 00:56:08.820]   and like work in cool research and travel.
[00:56:08.820 --> 00:56:12.660]   Like, you know, I want to be like a, what we think about when we think about professors.
[00:56:12.660 --> 00:56:17.740]   There are crystal clear milestones you can have in your graduate program for if I have
[00:56:17.740 --> 00:56:23.740]   not hit this milestone at this point, maybe I want to report, right?
[00:56:23.740 --> 00:56:28.440]   Like because you need milestone number one for a job like that.
[00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:31.460]   Are you at an absolute top program?
[00:56:31.460 --> 00:56:32.460]   For undergrad, right?
[00:56:32.460 --> 00:56:35.700]   Well, yeah, but yes, for undergrad and then for grad school.
[00:56:35.700 --> 00:56:38.780]   So like if we're going to look at the grad school milestones, it's like, okay, are you
[00:56:38.780 --> 00:56:39.900]   at a top five program?
[00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:43.700]   If not, like, ooh, already you want to start questioning this, right?
[00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:50.700]   Two, you figure out along the way, are these courses pretty easy for me, right?
[00:56:50.700 --> 00:56:53.580]   You know, I aced all my courses at MIT.
[00:56:53.580 --> 00:56:56.140]   If you're not acing them, they're not, they're not trying to make them super hard.
[00:56:56.140 --> 00:56:59.460]   I mean, they're hard because it's at MIT, but they're not trying to trip you up.
[00:56:59.460 --> 00:57:02.460]   It's like, you should be able to, these should not be hard for you.
[00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:04.700]   If they are, you'll figure this out in your first two years.
[00:57:04.700 --> 00:57:10.500]   You're like, okay, maybe this is not for me because you have to just own this stuff, right?
[00:57:10.500 --> 00:57:16.500]   Next research, like once you're like three years in, am I publishing good stuff?
[00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:20.940]   And if you're not, right, you're being helped along by your advisor, they're putting you
[00:57:20.940 --> 00:57:27.260]   on things, you know, you got to ripcord it because you have to be a standout researcher
[00:57:27.260 --> 00:57:31.940]   in your graduate program to have a shot of getting, yeah, and publishing papers in hard
[00:57:31.940 --> 00:57:33.440]   places, unambiguously.
[00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:37.020]   This paper was published here, it's hard to publish a paper here, it's getting cited.
[00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:40.780]   You're not doing that by three years in, again, you should ripcord.
[00:57:40.780 --> 00:57:42.860]   Now, some places kind of do this for you.
[00:57:42.860 --> 00:57:47.860]   It's like MIT has a, at least they did, I don't know now.
[00:57:47.860 --> 00:57:54.100]   They had a very ambiguously defined qualification as part of your doctoral qualifications that
[00:57:54.100 --> 00:57:56.100]   was called the research qualifier.
[00:57:56.100 --> 00:57:59.380]   And it was basically ambiguous on purpose.
[00:57:59.380 --> 00:58:05.740]   It was a way for them to basically move you out if you couldn't deliver research.
[00:58:05.740 --> 00:58:09.460]   And you have to have done it at some point by the end of your third year, I think.
[00:58:09.460 --> 00:58:16.120]   And what it was was, like on paper, it was you have a panel of professors and you present
[00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:18.020]   some of your research.
[00:58:18.020 --> 00:58:22.260]   So what happened is, if you're not really doing good research, this is where you would
[00:58:22.260 --> 00:58:24.020]   have nothing to present.
[00:58:24.020 --> 00:58:26.220]   And then they would say you failed your research qualifier.
[00:58:26.220 --> 00:58:30.940]   Cornell, or maybe this was Carnegie Mellon, I think Carnegie Mellon, they had a day called
[00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:35.420]   Black Friday, where they would call, I don't know if a second or third year grad students,
[00:58:35.420 --> 00:58:40.180]   or it's just like, we're just going to make this easier for you.
[00:58:40.180 --> 00:58:42.540]   You're not going to be a very successful graduate out of here.
[00:58:42.540 --> 00:58:44.220]   So leave the program now.
[00:58:44.220 --> 00:58:46.040]   And it's not necessarily a bad thing.
[00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:50.520]   Like at MIT, you can't apply to get a master's in computer science.
[00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:54.720]   You can only get one along the way on the way to a PhD.
[00:58:54.720 --> 00:58:56.840]   Like I have a master's in computer science from MIT as well.
[00:58:56.840 --> 00:58:59.720]   You just get it along the way to your PhD.
[00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:01.400]   So they're nice about it.
[00:59:01.400 --> 00:59:05.600]   If it's not coming together, they're going to let you get that master's, so you'll leave
[00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:07.160]   with the master's degree.
[00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:10.120]   And you didn't pay for it, because you were in a doctoral program where you took these
[00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:11.120]   classes.
[00:59:11.120 --> 00:59:12.120]   So you're getting paid.
[00:59:12.120 --> 00:59:13.120]   You're not paying for it.
[00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:14.120]   So it's like you got a free master's.
[00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:20.080]   There's several of the people I know who have left at that stage have just made bank, because
[00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:22.040]   they're like, I've got my master's from MIT.
[00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:23.160]   Google, here I come.
[00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:30.120]   And 10 years later, you're at your whiteboard and the professor and they're in their yacht.
[00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:31.120]   But anyways.
[00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:33.720]   But those people weren't that top of students.
[00:59:33.720 --> 00:59:36.480]   They can still make all that money in the private sector?
[00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:42.840]   They are top students, because they're at the MIT doctoral program, which meant that
[00:59:42.840 --> 00:59:45.720]   they were like the top student in their undergrad class.
[00:59:45.720 --> 00:59:48.140]   It's just the stakes keep getting higher.
[00:59:48.140 --> 00:59:53.400]   Like if you're there, if you have a master's in computer science from MIT, meant you were
[00:59:53.400 --> 00:59:57.420]   top one or two in your undergrad program, and it was probably a top undergrad program.
[00:59:57.420 --> 01:00:00.960]   And then you have professors saying like, this is one of my best students.
[01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:04.760]   It's just so-- what it means if you leave there in a master's program, really what it
[01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:07.400]   means is like, I couldn't-- research didn't work for me.
[01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:08.800]   And it's not that you're not smart.
[01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:10.760]   It's just there's also like an entrepreneurship to it.
[01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:11.760]   And I don't know.
[01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:12.760]   Just like you're like, this isn't working for me.
[01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:15.320]   I'm not able to sort of write a bunch of papers.
[01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:18.560]   This is not coming together, which if you're at Google, you might not care.
[01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:19.560]   Yeah.
[01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:20.560]   Yeah.
[01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:23.720]   I mean, I remember being-- and I don't mean to go off too much of a tangent here.
[01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:28.000]   I remember someone from our field early on going off to Google.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.000]   They're a grad student.
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.440]   And they're like, I don't think it's going to come together as a-- I'm not killing it
[01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:33.440]   enough to be a professor.
[01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:34.440]   I'm going to go to Google.
[01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:37.760]   And they came back to one of our conferences to present research they had started before
[01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:38.760]   they went.
[01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:41.640]   And I remember how horrified me and my fellow theoreticians were when they talked about
[01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:45.000]   that he had the program now, he had to write computer code.
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.560]   We're like, oh, my god.
[01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:51.360]   Because for like a theoretician who's training to be a professor, to have to write computer
[01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:57.840]   code is like you are training for the MBA and you're running the locker room.
[01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:00.200]   It was just like-- I remember that.
[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:01.200]   Oh, you have to code?
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:04.040]   By the way, he's killing it, killed it.
[01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:07.840]   He's going to Google in the early 2000s like he's killing it.
[01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:11.240]   But anyway, it just gets so, so rarified.
[01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:16.880]   And then out of that class, only the top x percent go off to the tier one, R1 schools
[01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:18.080]   for professorships.
[01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:22.040]   So then in terms of the courses, when you were doing well, were a lot of people not
[01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:23.040]   doing well?
[01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:24.040]   I don't know.
[01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:27.640]   Because it seems to me that everybody would be doing well if they got a master's.
[01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:28.640]   Yeah.
[01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:32.240]   I think they made those courses-- Like, did anybody struggle?
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:33.240]   Yeah.
[01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:34.640]   They're just very quiet about it.
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:35.640]   Yeah.
[01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:36.640]   Well, you have to.
[01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:42.320]   At MIT-- and I'm just using them as an example because I know them well-- you had to get
[01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:44.240]   really good grades or you're out too.
[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:45.240]   Yeah.
[01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:48.560]   I think you had to get A's or A minuses and everything.
[01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:50.040]   So everybody's pretty much doing good?
[01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:51.960]   Everyone's doing good, but they're kicked out of the program.
[01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:53.320]   There is no like, oh, yeah.
[01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:54.880]   And they wouldn't get a master's.
[01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:56.440]   They would have got-- yeah, you have to.
[01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:57.440]   So right.
[01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:03.960]   So you would not-- you had to have gotten A's or A minuses in-- it was called a technical
[01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:04.960]   qualifying exam.
[01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:09.200]   And they split the courses into buckets, theory and systems or whatever.
[01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:11.920]   And you had to pick a course from each of the buckets and do really well in it.
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:15.360]   So if you didn't do that, you didn't pass your technical qualifier, you couldn't get
[01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:16.360]   your master's.
[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:17.360]   OK.
[01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:18.360]   So you're right.
[01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:19.360]   You're right.
[01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:20.880]   But you really didn't hear about those kids because they're--
[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:25.240]   So that particular kid wouldn't be going to Google and crushing it, most likely?
[01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:27.400]   They-- well, yeah.
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:28.800]   But they still got into MIT.
[01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:29.800]   That's good point.
[01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:32.440]   So they were still like, we're-- it might just be they just didn't have their act together.
[01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:34.920]   I mean, the classes, I guess, were hard.
[01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:37.400]   God, I don't remember.
[01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:40.120]   I remember-- all I remember is taking theory with Mike Sipser.
[01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:42.880]   Is it similar classes that you teach now for your grad students?
[01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:43.880]   I did.
[01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:44.880]   Yeah, it was interesting.
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:48.640]   Like, I took theory of computation, graduate theory of computation with Michael Sipser,
[01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:50.840]   who was the head of the math department at MIT at the time.
[01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:55.680]   But he wrote the definitive textbook on it, the Sipser textbook on complexity and computability
[01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:56.680]   theory.
[01:02:56.680 --> 01:03:01.720]   And then when I got to Georgetown, like, that's what I taught was doctoral student-- the doctoral
[01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:04.320]   level theory of computation using Mike Sipser's textbook.
[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:06.120]   Do you still talk to him?
[01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:07.120]   No, I didn't.
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:08.120]   These classes are huge.
[01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:09.120]   Oh.
[01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:10.120]   It's like Goodwill Hunting over there.
[01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:14.600]   You're in these old auditoriums where you have the little flip-over desk thing that
[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:15.600]   comes next to you.
[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:19.920]   And Sipser taught exactly out of that scene in Goodwill Hunting with the professor and
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:20.920]   the chalkboard.
[01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:24.480]   He has the three-level chalkboards where you pull them up and down, and he'd move them
[01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:25.480]   up and down.
[01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:26.480]   And he had teaching assistants.
[01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:28.680]   I mean, it was exactly out of Goodwill Hunting.
[01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:31.120]   And then when you would take your exams, it was in the gym.
[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:34.640]   And they would just have like 500 seats because it would be all these classes taking them
[01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:35.640]   at the same time.
[01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:37.960]   And there'd be flags that would have the course number.
[01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:40.480]   So you'd go sit by your flag for your course number.
[01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:45.720]   And there would just be TAs wandering this giant gym full of people taking their final
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:46.720]   exams.
[01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:47.720]   It was really old school.
[01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:48.720]   Yeah.
[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:49.720]   Yeah.
[01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:50.720]   I mean, it was really like, you just got to perform.
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:51.720]   Like, do well on this exam.
[01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:52.720]   Yeah, interesting times.
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:53.720]   There you go, Jacob.
[01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:56.720]   You got a good answer there.
[01:03:56.720 --> 01:03:58.320]   All right.
[01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:02.320]   You're now prepared to get your computer science degree at MIT.
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:03.320]   All right.
[01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:04.320]   We got to speed this up, Jesse.
[01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:05.320]   What do we got next?
[01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:06.320]   Next question is from Ahmed.
[01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:08.640]   I'm a college student in Tunisia.
[01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:11.280]   Can I use the principles of slow productivity for my coursework?
[01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:13.560]   Sorry, that was Slow Productivity Corner, too, so we have to play the music.
[01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:14.560]   Oh, let's hear some music, yeah.
[01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:24.520]   All right, Slow Productivity Corner, questions related to my book, Slow Productivity, which
[01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:25.520]   you should buy.
[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:26.520]   All right.
[01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:33.960]   So, Ahmed's question, "Slow productivity, does it relate to learning things?"
[01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:36.960]   That's a good question.
[01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:42.360]   Yes, but I wouldn't say it the way you said it, Ahmed.
[01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:43.360]   Right?
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:45.880]   So, you're saying, "Should I apply the principles of slow productivity?"
[01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:48.300]   I would say this another way.
[01:04:48.300 --> 01:04:54.680]   If you treat your studies as a college student, like a job, like you use best practices, like
[01:04:54.680 --> 01:05:01.080]   do it well, it will match the principles of slow productivity, right?
[01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:03.480]   It's not that hard of a job.
[01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:07.920]   And if you're doing it right, it should match the principles of slow productivity without
[01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:11.880]   you having to start with the principles and figure out how to apply them to your student
[01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:12.880]   job.
[01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:16.000]   Because, I mean, I think there's just some best practices for being a student which are
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.360]   congruent with the principles of slow productivity, right?
[01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:22.160]   So, like, here's the things I always talk about.
[01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:25.040]   Treat your studies like a job, right?
[01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:29.040]   Don't just, like, study in some sort of ambiguous way, like, "How do I actually do this as my
[01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:30.040]   job?"
[01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:32.160]   You should auto-pilot schedule the stuff that happens regularly.
[01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:35.480]   If you know you have a problem set due every week, pick the same time on the same days
[01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:36.920]   and the same place to work on that problem set.
[01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:40.640]   If you're going to have a lab report due every other week, have on your calendar exactly
[01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:45.240]   when and where you work on that lab report, same place, same time, same days, every week.
[01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:48.120]   So you automate all the stuff you know you have to do so you don't have to make those
[01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:50.800]   decisions on the fly.
[01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:54.520]   You need to use specific study strategies.
[01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:57.200]   How are you studying for this exam?
[01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:59.040]   How are you working on your problem set?
[01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:00.380]   How are you writing a paper?
[01:06:00.380 --> 01:06:06.240]   You need specific strategies that you think are going to be very effective.
[01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:08.060]   And then you need to evaluate those strategies.
[01:06:08.060 --> 01:06:09.060]   How did this go?
[01:06:09.060 --> 01:06:10.880]   Did I do well on the test?
[01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:12.760]   Did I do well, but there was a lot of wasted time?
[01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:15.040]   Like, you go back and you evolve your study.
[01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:16.120]   What's the better way to study?
[01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:17.280]   What's a better way to write papers?
[01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:20.920]   You've got to evolve it towards what works best.
[01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:26.160]   Because a tested study strategy that you've worked on can be 3x more time efficient than
[01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:28.160]   just quote-unquote studying at the library.
[01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:29.160]   Really makes a difference.
[01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:34.620]   You want to be very specific about how you study, and you want to evolve or improve those
[01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:35.960]   based on evidence.
[01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:39.360]   There's a lot of key principles for how to build these things.
[01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:42.360]   The most relevant book here would really be my book, How to Become a Straight-A Student,
[01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:47.240]   where I talk about how actual straight-A college students who are not grinds would study.
[01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:49.760]   And you'll see principles in there like active recall rules.
[01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:50.920]   Don't just read things quietly.
[01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:54.280]   Always generate things from scratch without looking at your notes to see if you can do
[01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:55.280]   it.
[01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:56.280]   That's how you learn things.
[01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:57.280]   I talk about math classes.
[01:06:57.280 --> 01:06:59.000]   It's all about sample problems.
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.760]   Finding sample problems everywhere.
[01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:02.480]   From your book.
[01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:03.480]   From the lectures.
[01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:04.480]   From the problem sets.
[01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:07.800]   You're just like a sponge for sample problems to see if you can actually solve them.
[01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:10.440]   I have methods in there, best practices for writing papers.
[01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:13.080]   I have a sort of three-phase method for writing papers.
[01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:16.080]   I have a very specific method that's pretty analog.
[01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:20.240]   For how you manage your research for working on a college paper.
[01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:22.040]   You have to have specificity.
[01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:26.480]   So use something like my book to jumpstart those strategies, but then evolve them based
[01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:27.480]   on your own experience.
[01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:32.160]   And then finally, you just want to be careful about your time in general outside of autopilot
[01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:33.400]   scheduling.
[01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:34.800]   Time block to some degree your days.
[01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:37.680]   You don't need to time block every minute of your days as a student, but figure out
[01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:42.040]   in advance, "Hey, what studying do I need to do today?
[01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:43.040]   When am I going to do it?"
[01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:48.000]   So you don't have to time block all eight hours of a work day, but you do need to time
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.680]   block the stuff you have to do that day or is on your plan.
[01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:54.400]   You want to time block when that actually happens instead of just waiting until you
[01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:56.800]   feel like you have a bunch of time.
[01:07:56.800 --> 01:08:00.480]   The only other hack I would throw your way is at the beginning of the semester, take
[01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:04.240]   the big things, exams and big papers.
[01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:09.440]   Put them on your calendar and then work backwards.
[01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:12.600]   Work backwards a certain number of weeks and put on your calendar.
[01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:14.920]   Make plan for upcoming exam or paper.
[01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:21.520]   Typically, three to four weeks is a good scale here, but you know you have a paper due at
[01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:22.520]   the end of December.
[01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:26.080]   You should have at the beginning of December, make plan for paper due at the end of December.
[01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:28.720]   And then when you get there on your calendar, you say, "Great, now I'm going to put aside
[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:34.120]   time for the next month for when and how I'm going to work on this paper."
[01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:36.240]   And in that way, you never have deadlines creep up.
[01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:39.440]   Anyways, do these type of things.
[01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:43.040]   Your life as a student should more or less correspond with slow productivity.
[01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:44.840]   Let's check it out.
[01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:45.840]   Do fewer things.
[01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:48.280]   I mean, okay, your workload is your workload in college.
[01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:52.000]   You just want to make sure that you're not too overloaded on any one given day.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.040]   Work at a natural pace.
[01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:55.480]   This really gives you control over your time.
[01:08:55.480 --> 01:08:59.600]   So it's not panic before deadline and then sloth.
[01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:03.920]   It allows you to have sort of a more smoothed-out variability.
[01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:08.400]   And you can plan, "I don't want to work on Friday, but I got started on my paper a month
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:13.640]   early, so I'm not stuck having to work on this thing all out for three days right before
[01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:14.640]   it's due."
[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:15.640]   That will help.
[01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:16.640]   And then obsess over quality.
[01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:18.880]   Well, that's what you're doing when you care about your study, actual study tactics.
[01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:23.120]   I care about doing well in terms of the grade I get.
[01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:26.920]   So in some sense, this book I published in 2006, How to Become a Straight-A Student,
[01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:32.400]   is like a handbook for a slow, productive lifestyle as a student.
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:38.040]   So maybe check that book out to help prime you, and you will see the principles of slow
[01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:40.280]   productivity will show up in your student life.
[01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:44.320]   The do fewer things you talk about a lot in that book, too, like not doing too many clubs
[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:45.320]   and stuff like that.
[01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:46.320]   That's true.
[01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:47.320]   That's a big deal.
[01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:48.320]   Yeah, that is a big deal.
[01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:51.960]   I don't know what the culture is like in Tunisia, but there's like an American culture of doing
[01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:52.960]   a lot of extracurriculars.
[01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:54.720]   I was like, "Don't do that."
[01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:57.800]   There's an American culture of, "If I have a really hard course load, I'm going to impress
[01:09:57.800 --> 01:09:58.800]   people."
[01:09:58.800 --> 01:09:59.800]   Don't do that.
[01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:03.880]   It's going to impress maybe like your cardiologist because of like the heart attack you're going
[01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:04.880]   to have.
[01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:06.480]   But no one else notices.
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:07.480]   Employers don't care.
[01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:11.320]   They don't have the time to look at your schedule and understand that it was really hard that
[01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:14.200]   you were taking three computer science courses in the spring of your junior year.
[01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:15.200]   They don't know.
[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:16.200]   Like, "What did you major in?
[01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:17.200]   Where'd you go?
[01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:18.200]   What grades did you get?"
[01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:19.200]   So make those things easier.
[01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:20.800]   Yeah, don't overload yourself.
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:23.680]   I was talking to a student the other day.
[01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:27.880]   I failed to convince him to change, but he had three different relatively significant
[01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:30.900]   extracurriculars going on at the same time.
[01:10:30.900 --> 01:10:32.680]   Is one of them a sport?
[01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:33.680]   No.
[01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:34.680]   Sports are killer, man.
[01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:35.960]   Man, that's what I remember.
[01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:39.840]   From my one-year experience as an NCAA athlete.
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:43.680]   It's time-consuming because you're traveling.
[01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:46.000]   It's not just that you're training all the time.
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:50.040]   But also, because I was going to school in New Hampshire, this meant even when you're
[01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:53.840]   training, you have to travel to train because the river is iced over.
[01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:55.800]   So we have to go down to Georgia.
[01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:59.880]   And then when it gets later in the season, let's go to Boston because the Charles has
[01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:01.040]   melted before the Connecticut.
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:02.400]   So you're traveling just to train.
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:06.600]   And then when you're in season, and a lot of sports, like rowing has a fall and a spring
[01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:08.960]   season, you're in hotels all the time.
[01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:15.320]   So now you're doing homework in the hotel lobbies.
[01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:16.320]   You got good at that.
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:18.800]   Like going down to the hotel lobby where they have a coffee and that's where you would work
[01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:19.800]   on your homework.
[01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:20.800]   It's like impossible.
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:24.280]   I remember that research, by the way, back when I was working on those study books 20
[01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:26.600]   years ago.
[01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:27.600]   This was clear research.
[01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:28.640]   I have no idea where this came from now.
[01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:35.000]   But I remember clearly the research was saying some things you can still get good grades
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.160]   with, right?
[01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:39.240]   Other commitments, not.
[01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:45.440]   The commitment that had like the clearest negative correlation with grades was athletics.
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:48.520]   It's just so time consuming.
[01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:52.380]   That's why they invent these fake majors and stuff like this.
[01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:57.760]   Problem is when you're majoring in computer science, I needed to be in like the LSU major
[01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:06.160]   for their star offensive line, you know, we're going to sort blocks by colors, whatever they
[01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:07.160]   could.
[01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:08.160]   We just don't want you worried about this.
[01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:11.180]   We need you to be focused on the game.
[01:12:11.180 --> 01:12:12.180]   So we hear the music again.
[01:12:12.180 --> 01:12:15.180]   Let's hear it one more time.
[01:12:15.180 --> 01:12:23.080]   All right, that put me back in a good mood.
[01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:24.900]   We have a call this week, Jesse.
[01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:25.900]   We do.
[01:12:25.900 --> 01:12:26.900]   All right, let's hear it.
[01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:27.900]   Hi, Cal.
[01:12:27.900 --> 01:12:33.480]   My name is Meg and I'm an academic librarian currently recovering from my stint as department
[01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:37.940]   chair, but blissfully embarking on a 10 month sabbatical.
[01:12:37.940 --> 01:12:41.860]   During this time, I'm committed to pursuing a creative project that I've long wished to
[01:12:41.860 --> 01:12:45.260]   complete a murder mystery set on a college campus.
[01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:50.780]   I've been a longtime fan of your work, especially your insights on deep work and time management
[01:12:50.780 --> 01:12:53.460]   that I've tried to use at work.
[01:12:53.460 --> 01:13:00.620]   But with 10 months of unstructured time laying ahead of me, I need some new process.
[01:13:00.620 --> 01:13:04.560]   I'm curious to know how you use your own time management practices to organize your writing
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:06.900]   sabbaticals in the past.
[01:13:06.900 --> 01:13:11.340]   As I navigate this creative process, I found myself grappling with how to break down such
[01:13:11.340 --> 01:13:16.140]   an expansive project across such an expansive period of time.
[01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:21.460]   I'm curious, when you're writing a book, do you rely on specific systems of projects and
[01:13:21.460 --> 01:13:28.820]   project lists, subprojects or some other structured framework to keep your writing momentum up?
[01:13:28.820 --> 01:13:33.860]   How do you balance staying flexible with ensuring consistent progress on your writing?
[01:13:33.860 --> 01:13:37.660]   And do you find that a weekly review is necessary when you're able to tackle just a single large
[01:13:37.660 --> 01:13:38.660]   project at a time?
[01:13:38.660 --> 01:13:43.860]   Thanks for your insights, Cal, and I promise to put your advice to good use solving fictional
[01:13:43.860 --> 01:13:44.860]   murders.
[01:13:44.860 --> 01:13:49.260]   All right, so I'm going to give two answers here.
[01:13:49.260 --> 01:13:52.100]   The first answer is going to be like what I think you should do during your 10-month
[01:13:52.100 --> 01:13:53.100]   writing sabbatical.
[01:13:53.100 --> 01:13:57.400]   And then I'll answer your second question about how I tackle unstructured book projects.
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:59.700]   These aren't necessarily going to be the same answer.
[01:13:59.700 --> 01:14:05.780]   In terms of what you should do, I would suggest in your 10-month sabbatical, having a five-day-a-week
[01:14:05.780 --> 01:14:07.380]   writing habit.
[01:14:07.380 --> 01:14:13.140]   It should be the first thing you do probably every day.
[01:14:13.140 --> 01:14:16.340]   Then be relatively uncommitted after that.
[01:14:16.340 --> 01:14:18.480]   You want to take advantage of the fact it's a sabbatical.
[01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:22.700]   You might want to do, like I do in the summers, is if there's still going to be some meetings
[01:14:22.700 --> 01:14:27.060]   and calls and work stuff in your life, make those Tuesday through Thursday in the afternoon
[01:14:27.060 --> 01:14:30.900]   so that Monday and Friday is after you're done writing, you're just done.
[01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:35.700]   So I'd write, quick email, only middle of the week do I have things that are scheduled,
[01:14:35.700 --> 01:14:39.060]   and really just lean into the rest of the time doing non-work-related stuff.
[01:14:39.060 --> 01:14:40.540]   So write five days a week.
[01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:43.900]   You need a community for this.
[01:14:43.900 --> 01:14:46.400]   You haven't written one of these mysteries before, I'm assuming, so you need to join
[01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:48.820]   a writers' group, a mystery writers' group.
[01:14:48.820 --> 01:14:49.820]   You can find these online.
[01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:51.340]   There's probably a convention you can go to as well.
[01:14:51.340 --> 01:14:55.660]   There'll probably be one that is held at some point, hopefully not too late into your sabbatical,
[01:14:55.660 --> 01:14:57.500]   but don't wait for that convention to get going.
[01:14:57.500 --> 01:15:04.340]   You need to join a writers' group and right away get feedback on the plot.
[01:15:04.340 --> 01:15:05.340]   Start writing chapters.
[01:15:05.340 --> 01:15:06.340]   We're going to read chapters.
[01:15:06.340 --> 01:15:07.340]   You got to just get going.
[01:15:07.340 --> 01:15:11.300]   This is your first book, and it's your first novel, potentially, so it might be what you're
[01:15:11.300 --> 01:15:16.380]   really going to end up with at the end of 10 months is a draft of a novel that's not
[01:15:16.380 --> 01:15:19.460]   there, but now you've broken the seal, and you've learned a lot of things.
[01:15:19.460 --> 01:15:23.940]   You've picked up a lot of skills by talking to the other writers, and now you're well-suited
[01:15:23.940 --> 01:15:27.380]   to sort of more systematically transform this thing even once you're back to work.
[01:15:27.380 --> 01:15:35.660]   So join a group, commit to producing things, work every day, two to four hours, and let
[01:15:35.660 --> 01:15:38.220]   that just start to add up.
[01:15:38.220 --> 01:15:39.420]   That's what I would do.
[01:15:39.420 --> 01:15:42.620]   The other thing I would add, find a way to make the writing fun.
[01:15:42.620 --> 01:15:50.140]   It doesn't have to be every day, but go to cool places to write, do adventure writing.
[01:15:50.140 --> 01:15:55.100]   I'm just always going to sit down dreary-like, punish myself in my basement next to the dripping
[01:15:55.100 --> 01:15:56.740]   pipe, and that's just where I'm going to write.
[01:15:56.740 --> 01:15:57.940]   Make the writing actually fun.
[01:15:57.940 --> 01:16:00.220]   If you're trying to crack a plot point, this is great.
[01:16:00.220 --> 01:16:03.220]   I'm going to go on an early morning hike through this trail I like, and I'm going to bring
[01:16:03.220 --> 01:16:04.220]   a notebook.
[01:16:04.220 --> 01:16:05.220]   What am I doing this morning?
[01:16:05.220 --> 01:16:08.340]   I'm cracking this plot point.
[01:16:08.340 --> 01:16:10.380]   Or I'm going to go to this museum, and I'm going to work there.
[01:16:10.380 --> 01:16:14.940]   I'm going to have a whole morning, a whole half day, where I'm going to have breakfast
[01:16:14.940 --> 01:16:18.060]   here and lunch here, and I'm going to bring a mystery book to read during lunch, and I'm
[01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:21.860]   going to work at this public library, and I'm going to go for this walk, and then go
[01:16:21.860 --> 01:16:23.760]   to the cafe at this museum.
[01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:24.760]   Make the writing fun.
[01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:25.760]   Not every day.
[01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:28.140]   Some days I can be just sitting there, but you have a sabbatical.
[01:16:28.140 --> 01:16:30.580]   You want to associate with your mind, "This is fun.
[01:16:30.580 --> 01:16:31.580]   I like working on this.
[01:16:31.580 --> 01:16:34.940]   This is better than being department chair.
[01:16:34.940 --> 01:16:36.220]   This is different."
[01:16:36.220 --> 01:16:38.180]   There is a tendency a lot of people have when they're writing.
[01:16:38.180 --> 01:16:41.780]   They feel bad about it, that this doesn't feel bad enough, so they try to make their
[01:16:41.780 --> 01:16:43.220]   experience be harder.
[01:16:43.220 --> 01:16:45.880]   Somehow that justifies it to themselves or the rest of the world.
[01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:47.900]   You earned a sabbatical.
[01:16:47.900 --> 01:16:49.060]   Make the writing fun.
[01:16:49.060 --> 01:16:50.780]   Make it restorative.
[01:16:50.780 --> 01:16:51.780]   You earned it.
[01:16:51.780 --> 01:16:53.980]   This is not you being lazy.
[01:16:53.980 --> 01:16:59.660]   It's six years worth of semesters, I'm sure you had to do to earn this 10 months off.
[01:16:59.660 --> 01:17:07.300]   In terms of my own writing projects, I have a long period of working on the idea and working
[01:17:07.300 --> 01:17:10.940]   on the annotated outline for the idea when I'm leading up to selling it.
[01:17:10.940 --> 01:17:13.780]   Since I write nonfiction, you sell it first.
[01:17:13.780 --> 01:17:15.580]   Once I'm happy with it, I sell it.
[01:17:15.580 --> 01:17:18.980]   Then I go through a long period where I change what I want it to be.
[01:17:18.980 --> 01:17:20.780]   I often do a lot of this work on foot.
[01:17:20.780 --> 01:17:24.740]   I'm working in single-purpose notebooks, trying to crack what I think the book should be.
[01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:26.980]   Then I just start writing chapter by chapter.
[01:17:26.980 --> 01:17:30.460]   I typically write books sequentially, starting with the first chapter, the introduction I
[01:17:30.460 --> 01:17:32.580]   come back and do at the end.
[01:17:32.580 --> 01:17:35.040]   That's how I start to get a feel for the book.
[01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:38.300]   Maybe at some point, three or four chapters in, it might lead to some relatively significant
[01:17:38.300 --> 01:17:41.660]   changes to the structure after I really feel like, "What do I have access to?
[01:17:41.660 --> 01:17:42.660]   How is this unfolding?
[01:17:42.660 --> 01:17:43.660]   How are the ideas unfolding?"
[01:17:43.660 --> 01:17:48.260]   I'll go back and radically change the structure again.
[01:17:48.260 --> 01:17:52.060]   Once I have thought a long time about what I want to write, I just start writing and
[01:17:52.060 --> 01:17:53.100]   just doing the work.
[01:17:53.100 --> 01:17:54.420]   I want to write this many days a week.
[01:17:54.420 --> 01:17:56.060]   I want to make progress on this chapter.
[01:17:56.060 --> 01:17:57.860]   Some days, that's a lot of typing.
[01:17:57.860 --> 01:18:00.140]   Some days, that's just a lot of tracking down sources.
[01:18:00.140 --> 01:18:04.660]   Some days, it's completely reworking things, but I want to just keep going.
[01:18:04.660 --> 01:18:10.020]   I stop and I rework as needed to integrate the lessons I'm obtaining as I actually try
[01:18:10.020 --> 01:18:11.020]   to make progress.
[01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:12.020]   It's just in my life.
[01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:13.020]   It's one of the things I do.
[01:18:13.020 --> 01:18:15.660]   I'm a professor, so it's what I do.
[01:18:15.660 --> 01:18:19.080]   If it's not working on a book, it's working on academic articles, it would be working
[01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:21.300]   on trade publication articles.
[01:18:21.300 --> 01:18:27.260]   My job is built around this idea that you are spending regular time writing.
[01:18:27.260 --> 01:18:28.580]   This just sort of fits.
[01:18:28.580 --> 01:18:31.900]   This is what I have done my entire life.
[01:18:31.900 --> 01:18:35.640]   I started writing regularly my senior year of college.
[01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:37.660]   That's when I was writing How to Win a College.
[01:18:37.660 --> 01:18:39.840]   Ever since then, I'm always just writing.
[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:43.660]   As a grad student, it's academic papers, and it was books, and as a professor, it's the
[01:18:43.660 --> 01:18:44.660]   same idea.
[01:18:44.660 --> 01:18:45.660]   That's how I go about it.
[01:18:45.660 --> 01:18:49.540]   I think a lot about the idea, and then I just get going, and I update as I needed.
[01:18:49.540 --> 01:18:52.380]   I'm jealous about your sabbatical.
[01:18:52.380 --> 01:18:53.500]   I think your plan is awesome.
[01:18:53.500 --> 01:18:54.500]   Have fun with it.
[01:18:54.500 --> 01:18:55.500]   Have fun with it, for sure.
[01:18:55.500 --> 01:18:56.500]   But you need a community.
[01:18:56.500 --> 01:18:58.620]   Don't just do this on your own.
[01:18:58.620 --> 01:18:59.860]   Two quick follow-up questions.
[01:18:59.860 --> 01:19:02.460]   I thought you started writing earlier than that, like your sophomore year.
[01:19:02.460 --> 01:19:08.420]   Yeah, but in terms of a daily practice, because I remember I woke up every morning, and I
[01:19:08.420 --> 01:19:09.860]   would write before my first class.
[01:19:09.860 --> 01:19:11.260]   That was the first time.
[01:19:11.260 --> 01:19:15.660]   I wrote for The Jack-o'-Lantern, the humor magazine, before that.
[01:19:15.660 --> 01:19:18.460]   But it would be like, oh, there's an issue coming out, and then I would write a bunch
[01:19:18.460 --> 01:19:19.460]   of pieces.
[01:19:19.460 --> 01:19:22.900]   But there might be other times where I wasn't writing, because it's a regular thing I'm
[01:19:22.900 --> 01:19:23.900]   always doing.
[01:19:23.900 --> 01:19:25.260]   That really got started my senior year.
[01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:26.900]   And that's when you started the book, or you started the book before that?
[01:19:26.900 --> 01:19:29.420]   That's when I started the first book, yeah.
[01:19:29.420 --> 01:19:33.340]   So I wrote the first book the fall of my senior year.
[01:19:33.340 --> 01:19:35.580]   And then one asks, so fiction books is different?
[01:19:35.580 --> 01:19:37.660]   You write the book first, and then you sell it?
[01:19:37.660 --> 01:19:38.660]   Yeah.
[01:19:38.660 --> 01:19:41.100]   So fiction, well, it's yes and, right?
[01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:47.120]   So your first, in general, in fiction books, if you're an unknown author, they're buying
[01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:48.180]   the manuscript.
[01:19:48.180 --> 01:19:49.180]   You write the whole book first.
[01:19:49.180 --> 01:19:50.180]   Yeah.
[01:19:50.180 --> 01:19:51.180]   Interesting.
[01:19:51.180 --> 01:19:52.420]   Nonfiction, you don't do that, and it's a problem if you do that.
[01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:54.780]   And everyone always ignores me when I say that, because they want to just get right
[01:19:54.780 --> 01:19:56.500]   to the writing.
[01:19:56.500 --> 01:20:00.180]   They're worried about rejection, and they think they can somehow get around rejection
[01:20:00.180 --> 01:20:01.380]   by writing the book first.
[01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:03.520]   But it's not the way it works.
[01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:04.700]   Why is it different?
[01:20:04.700 --> 01:20:09.540]   Because they want to be able to-- well, partially, they want to be able to help shape the book.
[01:20:09.540 --> 01:20:12.820]   But also, just like the idea in nonfiction is your advance is supposed to help pay for
[01:20:12.820 --> 01:20:14.860]   you to go do the research to write the book.
[01:20:14.860 --> 01:20:15.860]   I guess more the other way.
[01:20:15.860 --> 01:20:17.220]   Why is it different for fiction?
[01:20:17.220 --> 01:20:19.620]   Because they have no way of knowing if the book's going to be good.
[01:20:19.620 --> 01:20:24.180]   So for nonfiction, it's not going to be-- if you're a good writer, you know how to write.
[01:20:24.180 --> 01:20:25.180]   You're an expert on this.
[01:20:25.180 --> 01:20:26.180]   You're going to write a book on this.
[01:20:26.180 --> 01:20:27.220]   I'm going to help you shape it.
[01:20:27.220 --> 01:20:28.460]   It's going to be fine.
[01:20:28.460 --> 01:20:32.420]   But a novel-- like, I just come to you, like, I've got a great idea for a mystery novel
[01:20:32.420 --> 01:20:33.420]   set in academia.
[01:20:33.420 --> 01:20:34.420]   Like, it could be terrible.
[01:20:34.420 --> 01:20:35.420]   That's a good point.
[01:20:35.420 --> 01:20:36.420]   You know what I mean?
[01:20:36.420 --> 01:20:38.380]   Like, novel writing's harder, right?
[01:20:38.380 --> 01:20:39.740]   So it could just be terrible.
[01:20:39.740 --> 01:20:42.180]   The exception is multi-book deals, right?
[01:20:42.180 --> 01:20:46.780]   So typically, like, let's say you have a book that's successful, especially in genre writing.
[01:20:46.780 --> 01:20:50.260]   They'll then sign you to be like, OK, give us three more.
[01:20:50.260 --> 01:20:51.500]   And you haven't written those yet.
[01:20:51.500 --> 01:20:52.820]   Now you owe them those books.
[01:20:52.820 --> 01:20:56.220]   So like, in fiction, when you're new, you have to write the book first.
[01:20:56.220 --> 01:20:57.260]   And that's what you're selling.
[01:20:57.260 --> 01:21:03.260]   But if you're in a genre, they will probably sign you to a multi-book deal.
[01:21:03.260 --> 01:21:04.460]   And now they're paying you.
[01:21:04.460 --> 01:21:05.860]   But you've proven yourself already.
[01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:08.540]   Like, you've given them a book that's, like, done well already.
[01:21:08.540 --> 01:21:12.220]   All right, we've got a case study here.
[01:21:12.220 --> 01:21:15.620]   This is where people send in their accounts of using the type of advice we talk about
[01:21:15.620 --> 01:21:16.620]   on this show.
[01:21:16.620 --> 01:21:20.100]   Today's case study comes from Sean.
[01:21:20.100 --> 01:21:22.120]   I'm a 33-year-old software engineer.
[01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:24.380]   I've worked to remove social platforms from my life.
[01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:28.300]   I left all the big social media platforms since 2016.
[01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:30.860]   This helped me reduce digital clutter to the minimum.
[01:21:30.860 --> 01:21:34.660]   YouTube was more challenging, but I disabled the history collection setting.
[01:21:34.660 --> 01:21:37.580]   The benefit is there are no recommendation algorithms on the landing page.
[01:21:37.580 --> 01:21:39.220]   I've reduced my YouTube subscriptions.
[01:21:39.220 --> 01:21:42.660]   I also created a new account that only has tech content.
[01:21:42.660 --> 01:21:45.920]   For Reddit, an ad block plug-in has helped doom scrolling.
[01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:48.700]   For LinkedIn, I only follow folks in my field.
[01:21:48.700 --> 01:21:52.620]   Since I have made the lucrative platforms boring, I have more time for myself.
[01:21:52.620 --> 01:21:58.020]   I have time in the evening, which I can invest back into my career and learn new things.
[01:21:58.020 --> 01:22:01.980]   I have also found more time to exercise every other day.
[01:22:01.980 --> 01:22:05.940]   Since saving time, I have retrained my brain to not rely on a lot of platforms.
[01:22:05.940 --> 01:22:08.260]   And I'm hitting the gym for a couple hours every alternate day.
[01:22:08.260 --> 01:22:11.940]   In a nutshell, win-win in career, win-win in health, and win-win in fulfillment.
[01:22:11.940 --> 01:22:14.760]   All right, I like this case study.
[01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:17.580]   There is a particular thing I want to point out from it.
[01:22:17.580 --> 01:22:22.620]   So in my book, "Digital Minimalism," I talk about these type of de-interestifications
[01:22:22.620 --> 01:22:27.260]   you're doing to social media platforms as joining the attention resistance.
[01:22:27.260 --> 01:22:31.460]   And it's strategies where you have some valuable thing you need to get out of a social platform,
[01:22:31.460 --> 01:22:35.280]   but you don't want the social platform to extract hours of your time in return, so you
[01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:43.400]   use tools like blocking plug-ins or turning off history collection settings, et cetera,
[01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:45.060]   that makes the platform less interesting.
[01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:48.880]   You can still get the thing out of it you want to get out of it, but you pay less of
[01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:50.620]   that ancillary price.
[01:22:50.620 --> 01:22:52.740]   So we call that joining the attention resistance.
[01:22:52.740 --> 01:22:56.200]   It's an alternative to just quitting these platforms, and it's what you deploy when there
[01:22:56.200 --> 01:22:59.140]   are some legitimate reasons you need to use them.
[01:22:59.140 --> 01:23:03.980]   What's useful or enlightening about this case study is, look what happens.
[01:23:03.980 --> 01:23:07.560]   He's using a bunch of platforms, but he made them non-interesting.
[01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:11.460]   So he's just using them for the actual reasons people give when you say, "Hey, why are you
[01:23:11.460 --> 01:23:12.460]   still on YouTube?
[01:23:12.460 --> 01:23:13.460]   Why are you still on LinkedIn?"
[01:23:13.460 --> 01:23:14.860]   You know, those reasons people give?
[01:23:14.860 --> 01:23:18.980]   He's only using his platforms for those reasons and turning off the other things, the things
[01:23:18.980 --> 01:23:22.780]   we don't really care about, but it captures our attention, and their impact on him is
[01:23:22.780 --> 01:23:24.240]   minimal.
[01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:28.340]   His hours of time is free, he's going to the gym, like they don't really have a big footprint
[01:23:28.340 --> 01:23:30.420]   in his life.
[01:23:30.420 --> 01:23:35.640]   So it just goes to belie this idea that you can leap immediately from, "I need to be on
[01:23:35.640 --> 01:23:40.180]   Instagram to keep up with these artists who are in my field," that you have to jump from
[01:23:40.180 --> 01:23:43.740]   that to, "I need to be on Instagram for hours every day."
[01:23:43.740 --> 01:23:49.980]   Or, "I use YouTube because I like to watch the Deep Questions podcast, therefore, I need
[01:23:49.980 --> 01:23:52.740]   to be spending hours on YouTube every day."
[01:23:52.740 --> 01:23:54.340]   This belies that connection.
[01:23:54.340 --> 01:23:58.620]   It says, "No, no, no, you can, if you actually use these platforms just for the specific
[01:23:58.620 --> 01:24:03.340]   reasons you have to use them, they don't play a big role in your life."
[01:24:03.340 --> 01:24:06.300]   This idea that you have to be on your phone all the time, like looking at these things
[01:24:06.300 --> 01:24:08.500]   all the time, that is new.
[01:24:08.500 --> 01:24:09.980]   That is invented by these platforms.
[01:24:09.980 --> 01:24:13.180]   That is a business model that you are just a line item in a big spreadsheet for, and
[01:24:13.180 --> 01:24:15.540]   that is completely optional.
[01:24:15.540 --> 01:24:19.620]   You can engage with the internet without the internet capturing your full mind.
[01:24:19.620 --> 01:24:23.620]   So I think that's a great reminder of the power of joining the attention resistance.
[01:24:23.620 --> 01:24:28.140]   All right, so speaking of which, we've got a good final segment coming up where we'll
[01:24:28.140 --> 01:24:31.540]   talk about a tech corner on social media and legal standards for bands.
[01:24:31.540 --> 01:24:33.660]   But first, let's hear from a sponsor.
[01:24:33.660 --> 01:24:38.740]   So I want to talk about our friends at Indeed.
[01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:43.500]   Let's say you just realized that your business needed to hire someone yesterday.
[01:24:43.500 --> 01:24:47.940]   How can you find an amazing candidate fast, easy?
[01:24:47.940 --> 01:24:49.700]   Just use Indeed.
[01:24:49.700 --> 01:24:52.100]   When it comes to hiring, Indeed is all you need.
[01:24:52.100 --> 01:24:55.020]   Stop struggling to get your job seen on the other job sites.
[01:24:55.020 --> 01:24:59.160]   Indeed sponsored jobs help you stand out and hire fast.
[01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:02.940]   With sponsored jobs, your post jumps to the top of the page for your relevant candidate
[01:25:02.940 --> 01:25:06.260]   so you can reach the people you want faster.
[01:25:06.260 --> 01:25:07.260]   This makes a huge difference.
[01:25:07.260 --> 01:25:14.900]   According to Indeed data, sponsored jobs posted directly on Indeed have 45% more applications
[01:25:14.900 --> 01:25:23.420]   than non-sponsored requests.
[01:25:23.420 --> 01:25:27.260]   I was just thinking about this the other day, Jesse, why I wish it would have been useful
[01:25:27.260 --> 01:25:28.260]   to have Indeed.
[01:25:28.260 --> 01:25:30.540]   I'm thinking about how did I find you.
[01:25:30.540 --> 01:25:39.260]   My memory was I had to charter a blimp and I dropped leaflets and it said, "You want
[01:25:39.260 --> 01:25:41.420]   podcast help, question mark?
[01:25:41.420 --> 01:25:42.420]   Podcast good, time good."
[01:25:42.420 --> 01:25:45.220]   And then it was a picture of me giving a thumbs up.
[01:25:45.220 --> 01:25:46.460]   That was a hard way to hire.
[01:25:46.460 --> 01:25:51.260]   If I had had Indeed, I could have just had a sponsored job listing and that would have
[01:25:51.260 --> 01:25:52.260]   gone much better.
[01:25:52.260 --> 01:25:56.620]   Plus, with Indeed sponsored jobs, there are no monthly subscriptions, no long-term contracts,
[01:25:56.620 --> 01:25:58.680]   and you only pay for results.
[01:25:58.680 --> 01:25:59.740]   How fast is Indeed?
[01:25:59.740 --> 01:26:04.740]   In the minute I've been talking to you, 23 hires were made on Indeed, according to Indeed
[01:26:04.740 --> 01:26:08.740]   data, and those were all hires by me.
[01:26:08.740 --> 01:26:09.940]   I'm building out this team.
[01:26:09.940 --> 01:26:10.940]   Let's roll.
[01:26:10.940 --> 01:26:13.220]   100 people here working at Deep Work HQ.
[01:26:13.220 --> 01:26:14.220]   Let's see.
[01:26:14.220 --> 01:26:16.220]   So there's no need to wait any longer.
[01:26:16.220 --> 01:26:20.820]   Speed up your hiring right now with Indeed and listeners of this show will get a $75
[01:26:20.820 --> 01:26:26.900]   sponsored job credit to get your jobs more visibility if you go to indeed.com/deep.
[01:26:26.900 --> 01:26:32.100]   Just go to indeed.com/deep right now and support our show by saying you heard about Indeed
[01:26:32.100 --> 01:26:34.100]   on this podcast.
[01:26:34.100 --> 01:26:35.660]   Indeed.com/deep.
[01:26:35.660 --> 01:26:37.300]   Terms and conditions apply.
[01:26:37.300 --> 01:26:38.300]   Hiring.
[01:26:38.300 --> 01:26:39.540]   Indeed is all you need.
[01:26:39.540 --> 01:26:43.140]   I also want to talk about our friends at the sponsor whose name we most like to pronounce
[01:26:43.140 --> 01:26:45.540]   and that is ZocDoc.
[01:26:45.540 --> 01:26:49.020]   Let's say you wake up and you have some sort of symptom.
[01:26:49.020 --> 01:26:50.060]   It's catching your attention.
[01:26:50.060 --> 01:26:51.180]   You don't know what this is.
[01:26:51.180 --> 01:26:52.820]   What can you do?
[01:26:52.820 --> 01:26:56.880]   Your instinct might be to jump on TikTok and see what the influencers there say, but maybe
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:26:58.660]   TikTok is banned right now.
[01:26:58.660 --> 01:27:03.380]   And you realize what I really need to do is get actual medical help.
[01:27:03.380 --> 01:27:08.640]   What stops us is that it is a pain logistically to find a doctor who is in our area and takes
[01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:12.700]   the right insurance and is taking new patients and has an appointment available.
[01:27:12.700 --> 01:27:14.240]   How do you figure that all out?
[01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:18.460]   This is where ZocDoc enters the scene.
[01:27:18.460 --> 01:27:22.500]   ZocDoc is a free app and website where you can search and compare high quality in-network
[01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:25.940]   doctors and click to instantly book an appointment.
[01:27:25.940 --> 01:27:31.220]   We're talking about booking in-network appointments with more than 100,000 doctors across every
[01:27:31.220 --> 01:27:35.880]   specialty from mental health to dental health, primary care to urgent care and more, though
[01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:40.300]   we don't recommend that you book the appointment with all 100,000 at once.
[01:27:40.300 --> 01:27:41.300]   You should.
[01:27:41.300 --> 01:27:42.720]   A little bit of ambiguous wording here.
[01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:47.540]   You could do that, but you can instead pull from that vast collection to find the ones
[01:27:47.540 --> 01:27:48.540]   you need.
[01:27:48.540 --> 01:27:52.440]   Filter for doctors who take your insurance, are located nearby, are a good fit for any
[01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:55.880]   medical needs you may have and are highly rated by verified patients.
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:27:56.880]   I like the ratings.
[01:27:56.880 --> 01:28:00.920]   You get a sense of like, what's it actually like going to this doctor's office.
[01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:04.140]   Once you find the right doctor, you can see their actual appointment openings, choose
[01:28:04.140 --> 01:28:08.540]   a time slot that works for you, click and boom, you booked your visit.
[01:28:08.540 --> 01:28:12.560]   Appointments made through ZocDoc also happen fast, typically within just 24 to 72 hours
[01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:13.560]   of booking.
[01:28:13.560 --> 01:28:19.900]   You can even sometimes score same day appointments.
[01:28:19.900 --> 01:28:24.840]   Stop putting off those doctor's appointments and go to ZocDoc.com/deep to find and instantly
[01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:28.240]   book a top rated doctor today.
[01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:33.120]   That's Z-O-C-D-O-C.com/deep, ZocDoc.com/deep.
[01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:40.400]   All right, Jesse, move on to our final segment.
[01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:42.520]   So we're going to do another tech corner here.
[01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:47.100]   Because I have been writing a series of columns for the New Yorker this month, we have a lot
[01:28:47.100 --> 01:28:49.260]   of my own material to draw from.
[01:28:49.260 --> 01:28:53.880]   We have yet again, another New Yorker column of mine that was just published.
[01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:57.840]   The title, and I'll have this on the screen here for people who are watching instead of
[01:28:57.840 --> 01:28:58.840]   listening.
[01:28:58.840 --> 01:29:03.640]   The title is, "Is Social Media More Like Cigarettes or Junk Food?"
[01:29:03.640 --> 01:29:07.360]   The deck here is, "Lawmakers Attempting to Regulate Children's Access to Social Media
[01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:13.420]   Must Decide Whether Bans or Warning Labels Are the Optimal Route for Keeping Kids Safe."
[01:29:13.420 --> 01:29:15.600]   And here there's a picture of a cop.
[01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:18.720]   This is so much more friendly than the article, was it last week?
[01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:23.480]   Oh, man, where it was a picture of a phone melting someone's face.
[01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:25.640]   We've gone from that to like a fun cartoon kid.
[01:29:25.640 --> 01:29:28.720]   This is better, makes you less stressed.
[01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:29.720]   Here's the premise.
[01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:32.760]   Here's the question in this article.
[01:29:32.760 --> 01:29:33.960]   We worry about social media.
[01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:34.960]   It has some harms.
[01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:35.960]   How much?
[01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:36.960]   We're debating.
[01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:37.960]   Right?
[01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:38.960]   We want to take action.
[01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:39.960]   We all kind of agree we should do something.
[01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:41.680]   There's lots of laws, et cetera.
[01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:43.200]   But what should they be?
[01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:48.800]   To help make sense of all this, I said, "Okay, let's look at two past examples historically
[01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:56.720]   where there have been a product that presented harm for kids, and we had to react to."
[01:29:56.720 --> 01:29:59.120]   The first product was cigarette smoking.
[01:29:59.120 --> 01:30:01.800]   We worried about kids smoking, and we reacted.
[01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:02.800]   How did we react?
[01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:04.720]   We passed laws that said you can't buy cigarettes if you're a kid.
[01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:08.080]   We passed a cigarette ban based on age.
[01:30:08.080 --> 01:30:09.920]   The other example was junk food.
[01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:14.400]   We worried about kids and junk food as junk food became more prevalent after the mid-century
[01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:15.400]   point.
[01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:19.960]   We were especially worried about all of the kid-targeted advertising that was happening
[01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:23.080]   during kids' programming, which really pushed kids to eat a huge amount of this food, and
[01:30:23.080 --> 01:30:24.280]   it was bad for them.
[01:30:24.280 --> 01:30:26.040]   We worried about kids' junk food as well.
[01:30:26.040 --> 01:30:28.640]   What do we do in response to that?
[01:30:28.640 --> 01:30:31.040]   We didn't ban junk food from kids.
[01:30:31.040 --> 01:30:36.500]   We didn't even ban advertising to kids, but we took more of a, "Let's give parents tools
[01:30:36.500 --> 01:30:38.800]   to help them manage this for their kids on their own."
[01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:42.720]   So here is nutritional labeling, here's the food pyramid.
[01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:47.560]   We're going to give you information, but then you're going to manage this risk on your kids
[01:30:47.560 --> 01:30:48.640]   on your own.
[01:30:48.640 --> 01:30:52.600]   So the question of the article then is, when it comes to social media, if we're thinking
[01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:59.760]   about this as a potentially harmful-to-kids product, is it more like cigarettes or is
[01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:01.000]   it more like junk food?
[01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:05.000]   Then once we had that clear question, because the answer will give us some sense of how
[01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:10.720]   we should react, I looked at the historical context of both of those past reactions and
[01:31:10.720 --> 01:31:14.720]   the legal standards for both of those past reactions.
[01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:18.200]   They were historically contingent.
[01:31:18.200 --> 01:31:20.720]   Cigarettes were actually banned from kids in the 19th century.
[01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:24.840]   It was a more moralistic time, so the context matters, whereas junk food became a big deal
[01:31:24.840 --> 01:31:27.080]   in the 1970s.
[01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:28.080]   This is Vietnam.
[01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:29.080]   This is Watergate.
[01:31:29.080 --> 01:31:31.980]   We weren't really looking as Americans for a lot of government intervention in our lives
[01:31:31.980 --> 01:31:34.240]   at that point, so the context does matter.
[01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:36.480]   But there are also legal standards.
[01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:41.280]   So let me quote here what I learned from Meg Jones, a colleague of mine at Georgetown who
[01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:43.880]   specializes in technology and law.
[01:31:43.880 --> 01:31:48.040]   She said, "We imposed outright bans for kids when activities involved permanent or hard
[01:31:48.040 --> 01:31:55.160]   to reverse consequences, like tattoos or contracts; addiction, like tobacco and gambling; activities
[01:31:55.160 --> 01:31:59.720]   with high potential for exploitation, such as hazardous entertainment jobs; and parents
[01:31:59.720 --> 01:32:02.500]   unable to assess or manage risks."
[01:32:02.500 --> 01:32:10.040]   So by those standards, cigarettes, we had a fear of addiction and hard to reverse consequences,
[01:32:10.040 --> 01:32:11.560]   whereas for junk food, we don't.
[01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:15.760]   We figure, like, parents can sort of manage the junk food that's in their house, and with
[01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:18.720]   the right information, it's okay to have birthday cake on birthdays.
[01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:23.160]   We wouldn't want to ban it, and it's not going to have impossible to reverse or addictive
[01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:26.840]   consequences if you're having some junk food, and so we shouldn't ban it.
[01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:29.120]   We'll do something like information.
[01:32:29.120 --> 01:32:30.880]   How does social media fare by both these standards?
[01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:35.540]   Well, by the legal standards, Jones told me it's not doing well.
[01:32:35.540 --> 01:32:39.640]   It really is leaning more towards the Marlboros than the Big Macs right now.
[01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:44.440]   There is a real fear of addictive use that is addictive once it's in your life, and there's
[01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:47.820]   also a clear signal, an increasingly strong signal from parents saying, "We are having
[01:32:47.820 --> 01:32:50.080]   a hard time managing this on our own.
[01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:52.960]   This is as much a social problem as it is a technological problem.
[01:32:52.960 --> 01:32:56.240]   It's hard for an individual parent to make these choices.
[01:32:56.240 --> 01:32:59.200]   We can't control what our kids are doing on here."
[01:32:59.200 --> 01:33:04.760]   So increasingly, from the legal standard perspective, social media for kids is looking a little
[01:33:04.760 --> 01:33:07.480]   bit more like the case that we applied to cigarettes.
[01:33:07.480 --> 01:33:12.320]   From a contextual perspective, there is also an argument to be made that the vibes are
[01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:17.580]   shifting more pro-ban right now than say they were during the junk food era.
[01:33:17.580 --> 01:33:22.000]   We're going through actively right now the TikTok fallout.
[01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:25.140]   They had to shut down or divest, and they didn't, and they turned off, and they turned
[01:33:25.140 --> 01:33:29.520]   back on, but the app is back on, but Google and Apple are still not letting you buy the
[01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:34.280]   app in the app store because the law says they shouldn't, and Trump is saying you can,
[01:33:34.280 --> 01:33:38.840]   but they said you can't overwrite the law in the Supreme Court with an executive order.
[01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:41.600]   What matters about all of that, because that has nothing to do with kids, that's about
[01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:45.680]   national security, is that it expanded our civic imagination potentially.
[01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:50.800]   We can imagine now passing laws or banning some of this technology, and life still goes
[01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:51.800]   on, right?
[01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:54.040]   So that's like, it's an option that we might be more comfortable with.
[01:33:54.040 --> 01:33:59.240]   We see more of this going on right now anyways, the FDA just banned red food dye number three,
[01:33:59.240 --> 01:34:01.440]   in part thinking about health concerns for kids.
[01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:05.240]   So we're kind of in a mood right now, we're like, okay, maybe we're a little bit open.
[01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:10.260]   Pass some laws, take some things off the table, it's okay, we can do this type of thing.
[01:34:10.260 --> 01:34:15.040]   So you put these two things together, and maybe we see a future in which something like
[01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:20.000]   Australia's response to social media, where they just simply said last fall, "Under 16
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:21.440]   you can't use it."
[01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:24.700]   Maybe something like that is going to become more ubiquitous, maybe that will even make
[01:34:24.700 --> 01:34:26.440]   it here to the US.
[01:34:26.440 --> 01:34:30.120]   Here's Jones, I'm quoting her in my article, "I think age verification is going to pass
[01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:33.680]   constitutional scrutiny this year, and we're going to see a wave of state laws restricting
[01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:35.680]   social media for kids."
[01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:38.120]   Then she adds, "Or maybe that's just my wishful thinking."
[01:34:38.120 --> 01:34:39.120]   Well, we'll see.
[01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:42.540]   But I think it's more of a possibility than it has been at any point in the past 10 year
[01:34:42.540 --> 01:34:45.720]   history of ubiquitous social media use.
[01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:50.240]   We care about kids and harm, we have very specific ways we figure out how to react to
[01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:55.860]   it, and when we apply those specific ways, we realize the answer we accepted a few years
[01:34:55.860 --> 01:34:59.760]   ago of just, "Kids these days use their phones, what you're going to do," is actually no longer
[01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:01.560]   sufficient.
[01:35:01.560 --> 01:35:06.140]   There's a real debate to be had here, and once we start having those debates, a lot
[01:35:06.140 --> 01:35:07.680]   of interesting options come on the table.
[01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:08.680]   There we go.
[01:35:08.680 --> 01:35:10.500]   I have one column left, Jesse.
[01:35:10.500 --> 01:35:12.840]   It's my third of four that I'm writing in a four-week period.
[01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:13.840]   Beast mode.
[01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:17.560]   All I'm going to say about the last one is that it will involve Michael Crichton.
[01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:18.560]   Nice.
[01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:24.240]   And it is not just a long review of "Eruption," though I might try to find a way to work in
[01:35:24.240 --> 01:35:27.480]   a reference to "Eruption."
[01:35:27.480 --> 01:35:32.400]   It's just 2,000 words in "The New Yorker" picking apart how I don't know who the characters
[01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:34.160]   are, even after reading 300 pages.
[01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:35.840]   I don't know their names.
[01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:36.840]   That's a sign of bad writing.
[01:35:36.840 --> 01:35:37.840]   That's not Crichton, though.
[01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:38.840]   Crichton, that's James Harrison's fault.
[01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:39.840]   All right.
[01:35:39.840 --> 01:35:40.840]   That's all the time we have for today.
[01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:41.840]   Thanks for listening.
[01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:48.400]   We'll be back next week with another episode, and until then, as always, stay deep.
[01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:53.480]   If you like today's discussion of remote work, you might also like episode 320, which was
[01:35:53.480 --> 01:35:56.380]   about jobs and the deep life.
[01:35:56.380 --> 01:35:57.380]   Check it out.
[01:35:57.380 --> 01:35:58.380]   You'll enjoy it.
[01:35:58.380 --> 01:36:03.440]   I'll start by sharing four common traps that people fall into when it comes to thinking
[01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:04.440]   about their jobs.
[01:36:04.440 --> 01:36:10.520]   Then I'll offer an alternative model that will help you put your work to work on making
[01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:12.520]   in your own life deeper.
