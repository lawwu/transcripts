[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.800]   So I'll hit go live and I'll wait to hear an echo because I need to make sure we're live on YouTube.
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.560]   It always takes a second as I rotate my head around the screen, trying to figure things out.
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.600]   I'll give it a second.
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.240]   Awesome.
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.040]   I hear an echo.
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.060]   So that means we live.
[00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.440]   Let me move things out of the way and quickly get to it.
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:39.520]   I need to copy a bunch of links and paste them in the chart.
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:46.760]   The first one.
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.120]   Second one.
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:57.360]   I'll just take one quick minute before making sure all of the links are there in the chart.
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:11.680]   Please ask questions.
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:22.800]   So to the people already watching, I'm just making sure everything is there in place,
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.440]   both on YouTube and zoom.
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:32.200]   I have shared a link to the discourse thread where we'll be taking questions from and I've pinned the message this time so that no one gets confused.
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.960]   That was one of my mistakes earlier.
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:34.840]   Sorry about that.
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.520]   All right.
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.400]   I'll take off my headphones because I've realized that I don't speak loud enough.
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.280]   I can hear myself in my headphones.
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:53.000]   So for that reason, I don't speak loud enough because it feels like I'm speaking quite loudly, but that isn't the case.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.320]   I'll stop talking about general things and get to work now.
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.040]   Welcome back, everyone.
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.520]   It's always exciting.
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.680]   Sundays have become so exciting now for me because we're learning PyTorch together.
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:19.160]   To all of the people joining us regularly, you know that it's a framework that I really like, quite a few people like, and as a community, we're just learning stuff together.
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.440]   And that brings me to the next announcement from Bateson Biosys.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.080]   We've been working on all of these things together.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.320]   Aman Arora, my colleague, has been hosting a very nice study group around FastAI.
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.600]   We've been reading papers together as a team.
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.360]   All of us.
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:43.160]   And we're excited to share that we'll be hosting our first community hangout next Saturday.
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:50.640]   So if you'd like to join and hang out with just the people from the community, get to know each other, you're most welcome to.
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.640]   We aren't going to be studying anything.
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.360]   Honestly, it's just a way of us getting to know each other.
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:04.160]   Let me make sure I see a few messages.
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.160]   I'm just trying to see if anyone is complaining about the audio.
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.040]   Doesn't look like it.
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.000]   Awesome.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.400]   I have one request as well.
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.240]   It's this is a community that we're building.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.080]   So if you haven't shared your journey or introduced yourself, please do so in this thread.
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.520]   It's linked out here.
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.440]   We're trying to award people with interesting backgrounds.
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.760]   So we'll be sending some swag their way.
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.360]   We'll announce this during the hangout.
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.320]   So people with the most interesting journey or story will send some swag your way.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.560]   We're also this is a project where you all, especially from this study group can contribute.
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:47.240]   So the link I've shared to the announcement has these linked off there.
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.320]   If you click on this, it will take you to PyTorch Bricks Practices.
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.520]   We're creating a wiki.
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.000]   By this, I mean we're creating a collection of resources.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.840]   If you like, if you'd like to contribute to this, you can simply edit this.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:07.320]   It's a post or you can reply with your favorite resources based on the topic of PyTorch based practices,
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.120]   model deploying, all those things in PyTorch.
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.480]   So we're trying to go beyond the book and you're welcome to contribute.
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.160]   There's no obligation whatsoever.
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:23.040]   If you do, we'll be sending swag to the people who contribute as a way to encourage that.
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:33.480]   So if you'd like, please feel free to jump on that.
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.800]   Awesome. Secondly, I want to point this link out.
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.920]   I've already shared it across the charts.
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:55.360]   And if you head over to this, you can ask your questions here.
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.600]   And you can reply to the thread directly.
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.080]   I'll be keeping an eye out on here.
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.000]   I have again caught a bad fever, which means that I'll be taking a few more water breaks.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.040]   So I'll be sipping a bit extra, extra bit of water.
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.400]   So you all will get a lot of opportunities to ask questions.
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.520]   Yeah, but apart from that, I'm quite excited to again iterate through all of these things.
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.600]   So this is what we had started last week.
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:25.240]   It was PyTorch Tensors, AutoGrad and Neural Networks.
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:31.080]   What I am trying to achieve through this study group, as a reminder, is I'm trying to recap everything from the book.
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:37.880]   So it's not about adding stuff necessarily, but it's about highlighting the things that I really like the most in all of the chapters.
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:43.120]   As a way of, you know, giving you a heads up if you're going to read the chapter later on,
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.120]   or as a way of recapping everything, if you've read it.
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.200]   Again, there's no structure to it.
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.320]   We'll be glancing through chapter 5 to 7 today.
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.240]   And I'll try to weave between the theory and the code.
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:00.720]   As a reminder, all questions will be taken from this link, which should take you to our forums.
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.800]   Now, I want to mention one thing.
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.840]   Last week, I rushed a bit through the concepts.
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.080]   And that's because I'm trying to copy this approach.
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.120]   This is a slide from one of the best courses in the world called Fast.ai.
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.120]   I'm sure you all know of it.
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:25.000]   But it talks about explaining concepts first in code and having this bigger picture.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:34.480]   So as I was trying to rush through different concepts in our previous meetup, I was trying to tell you about what do models mean?
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.600]   How do you train them?
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.720]   What does training a model mean?
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.080]   What does a neural network mean?
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.320]   This thing is called an optimizer.
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.680]   This thing is a loss function.
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.880]   Here's how you use it in code.
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:51.080]   Today, I'll be going through them again and reintroducing them in a bit more depth.
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:07:00.320]   Again, this is not how it's done in the book, but I'm just trying to follow a different approach, as I really like this top-down approach, as the creators of Fast.ai call it.
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:06.400]   So the idea is to give you a bigger picture first by rushing through the concepts and then going through them again.
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.560]   I believe that this approach has worked quite well for me.
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:13.600]   So that's what I'm trying to do here.
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.040]   So here's the highlight from chapter five.
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.920]   And just to recap, we had also covered this last week.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:22.600]   The idea is we start with the linear model.
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.680]   We take the derivatives manually at first.
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:31.560]   And this is to understand how to optimize the parameters of our model.
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:36.200]   Then we introduced AutoGrad and then we introduced optimizers.
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:42.720]   So let's go back to the code and try to understand this in a bit more depth.
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:47.720]   Yes, we're looking at our first model today.
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:53.760]   And let me also go back to the book because I think it covers this thing quite nicely.
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:59.280]   So inside of the chapter, and I absolutely love the humor in every single chapter,
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:03.280]   there are a few takes on, let's say theoretical physicists.
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:06.520]   I don't want to piss anyone off, but they make joke of that.
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:09.560]   There are also quite interesting comments in the sub notes.
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:13.400]   And this is rare for a technical book from what I understand.
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.880]   So Kepler was really a Kaggler.
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:25.200]   The authors introduced his approach of understanding how did planets go around in their orbits.
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:26.560]   So what did Kepler do?
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:31.200]   He observed planets for a really, really long time.
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:38.680]   He noted those observations down and then he tried to visualize it.
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:44.520]   I can't understand how he did it without computers or anything, but so far, please stay with me.
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:49.240]   After that, with all of the data, he tried to fit a model to it.
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:56.240]   So he tried to fit a function that would approximate these values.
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:02.000]   And he started with the simplest model, iterated upon it and got to an ellipse.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.720]   That's how Kepler knew that planets go around in ellipses.
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:13.560]   And this is actually quite, quite similar to how Kagglers or how data scientists or how machine learning
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.600]   engineers approach problems.
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:20.440]   So to summarize, you have collected data.
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.400]   You visualize the heck out of it.
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.040]   The author's words, not mine.
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:27.480]   You do a lot of EDA after collecting your data.
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.440]   You start with the simplest possible model.
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.840]   So you start with, let's say, a linear model.
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:38.400]   I know we've just learned about linear models so far, but that is the simplest possible model, at least in today's world of deep learning,
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:42.000]   especially since this book talks about deep learning so much.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:48.600]   After that, and I'm not sure if Kepler did this or not, you keep an independent set for validation.
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:54.960]   So you take a subset of your data set, you leave it aside and you work with the remaining.
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:10:04.160]   And you keep fitting different models until you get a nice thing that converges on it.
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:10.040]   All of these steps can be independently matched to what we do in data science or we do in deep learning.
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:15.040]   So this is how the authors introduce the problem.
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:20.480]   The three steps are take data, choose a model and estimate in very simple words.
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:30.200]   So here's a recap for a mental model of the learning process.
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:34.560]   You have a model and we've not defined what the model is.
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:38.000]   So again, we're trying to see what goes in and what comes out.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.400]   We pass a few inputs through it and it has these weights.
[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:42.480]   We don't know what the weights are.
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:52.640]   We don't know what they represent, but we're trying to change them in a way that we get an output that corresponds with whatever output is expected.
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:57.640]   So let's say we're trying to predict temperatures, which is what we literally do in this chapter.
[00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:04.520]   We want the predicted temperature to be the closest to the value that we actually have.
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:08.960]   So if you're trying to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit, that's a straightforward answer.
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:19.240]   But if you're creating a model to do that, we measure the error function, which means how off are we from the value that needs to be projected.
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:22.040]   And using that, we optimize the weights.
[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:23.400]   So we change the weights.
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:26.000]   We need we haven't discussed how we do that.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:34.480]   We just get this value and somehow magically we update the weights and we repeat this process until we're satisfied that the outputs are actually quite realistic.
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:40.520]   So as the authors call it a hot problem, that's what we look at in this chapter.
[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:43.000]   And now I'll switch over to Jupiter to explain things.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:55.520]   Again, as a reminder, thanks for pointing this out, Girijesh.
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:56.960]   Many people have asked this question.
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:01.720]   All of these notebooks are from the repository directly.
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:05.840]   So this is the course repository and the link I had shared earlier.
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:07.920]   This has links to it.
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:13.280]   So please find the links to the repository and everything else that I'll be covering in this thread.
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:20.800]   So we've created the authors have created these tensors, which have some values.
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.480]   So this is temperature in Celsius.
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:25.040]   This is temperature unknown.
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.120]   We're trying to predict temperature unknown.
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:30.040]   Last time I went through this, but I rushed through it.
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:33.400]   Now we're paying attention to everything closely.
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:38.280]   We define a model which takes these in and our model is a linear model.
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.400]   So we're starting simple here.
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:44.200]   This is a function that defines a straight line.
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:50.360]   And as we visualize the data later on, our data is actually linear.
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:51.960]   So it follows a linear relationship.
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.440]   That's why this model works.
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.640]   But we're starting simple here.
[00:12:55.640 --> 00:13:01.640]   We define a loss function where we take the squared difference of the losses.
[00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:04.560]   Inside of the book, there's a plot that we had discussed last week.
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:10.440]   The reason for using squared differences is it penalizes large losses.
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:16.840]   Large loss values are quite significantly shown compared to smaller loss values.
[00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:25.600]   So if we're slightly off from our prediction, it's not as heavily visible when compared to larger loss
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:26.920]   values.
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:30.240]   We create weights and biases.
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:36.480]   I have absolutely enjoyed reading weights and biases in every single paragraph of these few chapters.
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:42.880]   But we create a model by first creating these parameters called weights and biases.
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:46.440]   We pass these to the model and we get the prediction.
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:48.040]   So this is the first prediction.
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.600]   Nothing has been trained.
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:54.320]   We have just defined these and gotten these values out.
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:57.440]   The values are like so.
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:05.440]   Now we call the loss function and we get quite a high value, which means that we're quite, quite off in these values that we have predicted.
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:10.880]   So T_E represents the predicted value.
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:16.240]   Now I want to cover this in a bit depth because this section actually discusses broadcasting.
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:26.000]   And let me go back to the book and scroll to that page.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:32.840]   So again, I try to cover these things independently because I introduced this concept a little while ago of broadcasting.
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:34.320]   Now I'm again trying to come back to it.
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:40.960]   I'm just trying to copy Jeremy Howard's approach of introducing concepts first and then revisiting them in greater depth.
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:47.920]   That's why I introduced this a little while ago, even though it wasn't there in the chapter.
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:50.080]   Let me grab my pen.
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:50.720]   All right.
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:55.760]   So as you can see, we're creating a bunch of tensors here, X, Y, Z, and A.
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:58.280]   And we're performing different actions on them.
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:14.360]   So what happens if you have a tensor 1, that's your matrix, and you multiply or do any form of arithmetic operation with this matrix using one simple scalar?
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:24.840]   So if you add this in the definition of mathematics, or if you show this to a mathematician, he will be quite annoyed to see this, he or she.
[00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:27.880]   But in PyTorch or in NumPy, this is quite easy to do.
[00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:30.720]   So what happens internally, we don't have to worry about this.
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.880]   And this is the easiest way of writing it.
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.800]   Why do we do this in the first place?
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:40.040]   The reason for doing that is computer scientists are quite lazy.
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:46.840]   So if I write A plus 1, that should work, even if it's a matrix or if it's simply a number.
[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:49.560]   So 2 plus 1 should give me 3.
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:56.520]   And if I write A plus 1 when it's the matrix like so, we should get 3, 2, 3, 3.
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:59.160]   So that is broadcasting for you.
[00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:08.760]   Now, whenever we have such a mismatch or we're performing an operation, the internals of PyTorch and NumPy automatically take care of it.
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:14.360]   And these are quite optimized, which means that if you write for loops, they will definitely perform worse.
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:21.480]   This is one of the reasons why we really need to use PyTorch because it's quite fast at all of these things, or NumPy for that matter.
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:25.240]   So I would advise you all to write these down on paper.
[00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:28.000]   I won't run through all these three or four examples.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.320]   I'll mention the last one.
[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:34.600]   So here we're multiplying these three tensors and we're checking the shape of it.
[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:39.680]   So let's see, we have a matrix Y, which is 3, 1 in size.
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:41.560]   Z is 1, 3.
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:45.080]   And we have a 2, 1, 1 matrix.
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.640]   So what happens first, we multiply these two.
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:50.240]   Simple matrix multiplication happens.
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:17:01.640]   And if you've done matrix multiplication enough number of times, the output will be row by column 2.
[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:04.200]   So we'll get 3, 3 as an output.
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:08.080]   And now this will be multiplied with this particular tensor.
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:12.880]   But that's not possible because the dimensions don't match.
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:13.360]   Right.
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:16.480]   So what's happening right here is we have two batches.
[00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:18.400]   You can think of it like so.
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.880]   So we have two batches of 1, 1.
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:23.160]   So let's say there are just two numbers.
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:27.040]   I'll say they're both 1.
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:29.040]   For some reason, I triggered my Siri.
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:30.760]   Sorry.
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:32.760]   So let's say both of these numbers are 1.
[00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:36.880]   And we're now trying to multiply these with a 3, 3 matrix.
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:43.320]   So what will happen is we'll create two batches of 3 by 3 tensors.
[00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:49.800]   So the output we get from this will be of this size.
[00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:54.560]   I'll take a pause to see if this was clear for everyone.
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:57.040]   I'm sure it would be, but I'm just trying to make sure.
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:07.360]   If this is the first time you're looking at broadcasting, I hope it's clear for you.
[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:09.680]   OK, I don't see any questions.
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:12.640]   I know all of the people in the call are quite seasoned.
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:17.840]   So I apologize if I'm making sure these basic things are clear to you or not.
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:21.160]   I'm just trying to make sure the beginners have a good grasp.
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:22.440]   All right, moving on.
[00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:27.760]   We define the first way of updating the weights.
[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:30.120]   Weights are a learned parameter.
[00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:34.280]   And we're trying to update those so that we can predict the right temperature.
[00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:36.240]   So we take the simple approach.
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:38.200]   And you can go through it and understand it.
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:53.880]   But what we're trying to do here is if you move your weights left a little in the graph and the value goes up, or if you move it right and it comes down, just move it in whichever direction where the weight value goes down and update them like so.
[00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:57.920]   So you update them with the rate of change of weight.
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:59.720]   And this is how we calculate it.
[00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:04.000]   So inside of the book, what we're trying to do is we first do this manually.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.160]   We tell you why this is a bad approach.
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.720]   I'm sorry, I'm saying we, but the authors.
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:10.000]   So this is from the authors.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.720]   I'm just reading it out loud.
[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:16.080]   I didn't have any contribution to it.
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:20.640]   We show you the simplest approach and tell you why it is in the best.
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.520]   Then we go to a smarter approach.
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:26.760]   And at the end, we show you the nicest approach, which is just importing everything from Python.
[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:32.320]   So we incrementally build on top of these things as we understand these concepts.
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:40.080]   So going back to the concept, this is how we update our weight and we do the same thing for the biases.
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:50.240]   We differentiate every single thing and towards the end, we just update all of them.
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:54.120]   And this is followed by that.
[00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:55.960]   We talk about differentiation.
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:20:01.160]   I'll skip this over because it's quite mathematical and you can understand it if you want.
[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:05.040]   But again, it's a way, it's a better way of approximating things.
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:15.880]   The reason why we do these steps is because this particular method, it works okay if we have two parameters right now.
[00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:20.000]   But realistically, when you look at different models, there are quite a few number of layers.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.880]   There are quite a few number of matrices.
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:32.720]   So even weights right now has a few number of parameters.
[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:38.720]   If I managed to spell it correctly.
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:42.760]   So it has a single value right now and same is for B.
[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:49.840]   But as we scale this and add these to our input, it becomes a lengthier tensor.
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:55.960]   Now you can imagine for a particular neural network, there would be many, many layers and there would be a lot of functions.
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:21:00.880]   So this approach of defining it like so doesn't scale well for that.
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:02.760]   So that's why we use differentiation.
[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:04.080]   That's one of the ways of doing it.
[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:08.600]   I won't explain it because this is the only time we look at it in the book.
[00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:13.360]   You can go through the mathematical definition, but I'll skip over it.
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:18.000]   And you can update the parameters using that.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:24.760]   When you do so for the first time, you get to a loss of infinity.
[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:28.440]   So what we were trying to do here is we were trying to minimize the loss.
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:33.400]   But as you see, it increases with every single epoch and it just goes out of control.
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:38.000]   So what do we do? We do the most obvious thing that every deep learning practitioner would do.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.920]   We would just start by changing the learning rate.
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:43.040]   So the model definition is right.
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:47.720]   That's what we assume. And we simply change the learning rate.
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:52.640]   As a good rule of thumb, it's always nicer to divide or multiply it by factors of 10.
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:59.800]   Since the gradients exploded, so this is known as gradient explosion.
[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:01.120]   We would divide them.
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:06.320]   So in our case, we divide them by 100.
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.920]   Which is why we get to this value.
[00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:15.120]   And this time a loss values come down to a nice value of 29.
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:16.680]   And again, this value means nothing.
[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:20.120]   So if you've seen or if you're asking yourself, why is it not 100%?
[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:22.360]   Why is it not a 99%?
[00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:23.280]   That doesn't matter here.
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:25.200]   We're just trying to minimize the value right now.
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:39.640]   I'm just scrolling to see if there's anything else that needs to be covered here,
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:42.440]   but I believe I got the crux of it.
[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:49.960]   So we revisited the model and we managed to predict the straight line that fits like so to our data.
[00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:55.720]   If we were to use a neural network, you could imagine it could be a zigzag-like line if we overfit.
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:58.120]   But I would say this is quite moderately fit.
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:04.360]   And right now we can't do anything else because by definition, our model is going to be a straight line.
[00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:09.400]   And we managed to get it quite close to our data points.
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:11.760]   So let me quickly take a peek at the questions.
[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:13.160]   No questions so far.
[00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:17.600]   Alright, I'll continue.
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:23.000]   So now we get our first introduction to Autograd.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:36.240]   The most exciting thing that happened in machine learning in 2015 was we got introduced to TensorFlow.
[00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:39.520]   And TensorFlow has this concept of creating static graphs.
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:46.920]   The best thing that happened afterwards in a way, we got introduced to dynamic graphs.
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:51.600]   So when I say static graphs, let me show that with a quick illustration.
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:52.600]   What do I mean by that?
[00:23:52.600 --> 00:24:00.600]   As I stop sharing and try to start sharing again.
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:04.120]   I'm sorry, this always takes a minute and that's because I could leave everything open,
[00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:09.840]   but then it's not the most optimized size for you to, even though it works well for me.
[00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:20.400]   So static graphs have this defined way of having, let's say, input one, input two.
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:27.280]   You do something with it, you pass them to a particular layer where, let's say,
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:32.440]   you just add them followed by which you have an activation function.
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:34.280]   We covered activation function last week.
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:37.320]   We looked at them in depth and you get an output.
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:43.280]   So originally TensorFlow forced us to define all of this first of all.
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:44.520]   So it was a static graph.
[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:50.040]   But the nice thing that happened later on and now it's common to both PyTorch and TensorFlow.
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:55.920]   Both of them allow you to have a dynamic graph, which means that you can define anything.
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:25:02.920]   And you don't need to know the exact sizes of tensors that go in and come out.
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:06.120]   You don't need to know exact values every single time.
[00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:12.120]   And PyTorch accounts for it or TensorFlow Keras account for all of the options.
[00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:14.920]   And these get computed in runtime.
[00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:20.720]   So what does AutoGrad do here?
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:24.120]   I'm sorry, let me quick slack a second.
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:26.720]   I was getting a few notifications.
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:34.320]   AutoGrad, whatever we did here manually in code right before this, we computed the gradient.
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:39.520]   We tried to estimate how do we arrive at smaller loss values.
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:42.720]   AutoGrad does this magically, automatically for us.
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:44.520]   We don't need to worry about anything.
[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:46.120]   So what do we do in practice?
[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:54.520]   We define a tensor called X and we simply pass one argument, which is requires grad equals true.
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:58.120]   So here's false, but you ideally want to have it as true.
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:05.320]   And now anything that involves X will be kept track of.
[00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:14.320]   And if we do a loss.backward, so we do a bunch of operations on X and to a new get a loss value from it.
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:17.520]   The loss value involves certain operations on X.
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:18.320]   Right?
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:27.920]   So when you do loss.backward, it performs all of these derivative functions for you, which you don't need to understand.
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:37.520]   What's going on here in a summary, we get the gradient of loss and we get the value by which we should be updating it.
[00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:41.520]   So in essence, that is called the backward pass.
[00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:44.120]   When we are training models right now, it's not a neural network.
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:52.420]   So I didn't say it's a backward pass for neural networks, but it's the backward pass for any model.
[00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:58.220]   So looking at this in code, we again define the same functions.
[00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:02.220]   We define the unknown value like so.
[00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:07.320]   We define this exact same model, exact same loss function.
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:16.520]   And this time we create parameters and parameters take require grad equals true.
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:21.820]   Sorry.
[00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:25.720]   So we're constructing a tensor and I'm again reminding you how to look at the dog string.
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:33.720]   You press shift twice and somewhere here it will tell you what does passing require grad equals to true do.
[00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:40.120]   So if auto grad should be should record operations on the return tensor by default, it's false.
[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:46.220]   This time we tell PyTorch, please PyTorch keep a track of all of the operations that happen on our parameters,
[00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:49.820]   because later on we'll compute a loss function using that.
[00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:54.620]   So this time and this is known as argument unpacking.
[00:27:54.620 --> 00:28:01.820]   If you pass a list in Python and you put a star against it, it gets unpacked automatically.
[00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:04.020]   So you don't need to do anything else to account for it.
[00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:11.820]   Or if you have a bunch of arguments that you are going to pass to a model and you don't know the exact number, you put a star against them.
[00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:14.420]   You're good. You don't need to worry about anything.
[00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:23.020]   So this was the author's subtle way of reminding us of that.
[00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:25.620]   Someone's asking if they can set the values.
[00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:32.120]   So yes, for the first values of the parameters, specifically for this lecture, we define the values.
[00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:36.220]   Usually we instantiate them randomly or using a certain method.
[00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:39.520]   We'll learn about those later. Ideally, you need some values here.
[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:42.220]   They could be random. They could be pre-trained weights.
[00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:46.920]   So if they were pre-trained, someone would have figured these values out and we'd start from there.
[00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:50.520]   So for now, we define them manually.
[00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:54.220]   And our loss involves the parameters, so that's the thing to note here.
[00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:59.720]   Now this involves the auto-grad function.
[00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:10.720]   So whenever we call loss.backcode, the gradients for parameters get calculated and we get them in params.grad.
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:13.020]   Now I want to point something out here.
[00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:16.920]   We're storing, we're accumulating these.
[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:18.820]   We're not just storing them.
[00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:27.720]   So if you don't set these to zero, that's always one of the most common mistakes for any practitioner using PyTorch.
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:31.420]   We forget to set them to zero and we always end up accumulating the gradient.
[00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:38.420]   So gradients get accumulated by default and you want to make sure that they're set to zero.
[00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:44.320]   So what we've learned so far, if we set requires grad equals true, that'll allow us to calculate the gradient,
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:47.720]   which will allow us to update our parameters or weights.
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:50.020]   Here they refer to the same thing.
[00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:53.020]   And what we're doing in the bigger picture, we're iteratively adding things.
[00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:58.020]   So we just learned how to add auto-grad to the function we had just built.
[00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:03.520]   So we look at the training loop again, and this time we calculate the loss.
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:11.820]   Sorry, we calculate the gradients and we update them like so, as we did earlier.
[00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:14.020]   But this time we're doing a caveat.
[00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:16.020]   I'd like to mention this caveat here.
[00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:23.020]   We use this context manager here because again, the authors will introduce a nicer way of making this go away.
[00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:29.720]   So when we are updating the parameters for that particular operation,
[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:37.620]   and the reason for this is when we are updating the parameters, we don't want this to be accounted by auto-grad.
[00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:46.620]   So whenever we create any function, any damn function at all from a tensor that keeps track of the gradients,
[00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:52.620]   PyTorch will add it to the gradient calculation method.
[00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:55.620]   We don't want that to happen when we are updating it.
[00:30:55.620 --> 00:31:03.620]   So we tell PyTorch here, please don't calculate the gradient for this particular step because we're literally updating them here.
[00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:06.620]   That's what we do and we return them.
[00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:08.620]   So that's our training loop.
[00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:15.620]   Now we pass the same values to it, and if I remember correctly, you can verify these values are quite similar to what we did earlier.
[00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:22.120]   They might not be the exact same values because there's some randomness to it or they might fluctuate a bit.
[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:28.620]   But this is to showcase we've reduced our number of lines of code, we made it simpler for us,
[00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:35.620]   our life as a developer is better and we can simply use lost or backward to calculate gradients.
[00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:38.620]   Let me take a pause for any questions.
[00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:52.620]   Vinayak, you're right, but I think what Ritubrata, I think this is Ritubrata, right?
[00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:56.120]   Always great to see you, Ritubrata.
[00:31:56.120 --> 00:32:00.120]   We were talking about argument and packing here. I believe that's what he was referring to.
[00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:15.620]   All right, I'll continue further.
[00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:25.620]   I'm sorry, I'm seeing the Zoom chat pop up, but please could you ask these questions here
[00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:29.620]   because it's quite difficult to monitor all of these things in Pali.
[00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:38.620]   As you can see, it takes me a second to switch windows as well from the code to the book.
[00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:41.620]   So I'd appreciate it if you could ask the questions here.
[00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:50.120]   Okay, now coming back to our way of getting rid of code and making things easier for us as developers.
[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:53.120]   Let me now go back to sharing the book again.
[00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:57.620]   Now we look at optimizers.
[00:32:57.620 --> 00:33:03.120]   The name gives it away. Optimizers help us optimize different values.
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:08.120]   In our case, we're trying to optimize the loss value, so they help us take care of that.
[00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:17.120]   And once I find them, I'll tell you what they do by using the image the authors have created.
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:29.620]   So this is a conceptual representation of optimizers.
[00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:35.620]   So we have the model, we have the parameters, and the optimizer also keeps track of the parameters.
[00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:39.620]   And they hold a reference of it.
[00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:45.120]   After the loss is computed using the input, we call it backwards.
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:52.120]   And this leads to the gradients being calculated in the optimizer.
[00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:57.120]   And now the optimizer can send these when we want to update them.
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:03.120]   So we call the optimizer now instead of simply doing it ourselves.
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:07.120]   And the optimizer updates the weights accordingly.
[00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:13.120]   I think I should switch back to the notebook for this part.
[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:19.120]   But for the first bit, we use stochastic gradient descent, also known as SGD.
[00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:28.120]   As expected, it's simply a module called Optim.
[00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:36.120]   Now whenever you do DIR in Python, it just lists every single thing in this.
[00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:39.120]   So what we've done here, or what the authors have done here,
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:42.120]   I'm sorry, it's not me, it's the authors who are doing this.
[00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:45.120]   We list every single optimizer function in PyTorch.
[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:47.120]   And as you can see, there are a few.
[00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:50.120]   You can also define more if you need.
[00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:54.120]   And there are a few that aren't here, not the most common ones.
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:56.120]   This is one of the homeworks I have for you.
[00:34:56.120 --> 00:35:01.120]   And this time I've noted down the homework for everyone because we're at the point where we can do a few experiments.
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:05.120]   We'll be looking at SGD and Adam in this particular code example.
[00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:08.120]   I would encourage you all to at least try the other options.
[00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:16.120]   So in our approach of getting rid of as much of code possible as we can,
[00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:19.120]   this time we define the parameters as we did earlier.
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:22.120]   We define a learning rate. It's slightly different this time.
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:27.120]   We define an optimizer and its stochastic gradient descent.
[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:29.120]   Let's see what does it tell us.
[00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:33.120]   It implements stochastic gradient descent, optionally with momentum.
[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:36.120]   What is that? You don't need to know right now.
[00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:39.120]   If you want to know, don't look at the theory.
[00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:42.120]   Try passing momentum as a value. See what does that do.
[00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:45.120]   Theory is an interesting loop.
[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:47.120]   I always try to mention this.
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:52.120]   Please don't look at as much theory. Try to look at twice as much code as you look at theory.
[00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:58.120]   So try all of these different values, not just for SGD, but also for different optimizers.
[00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:05.120]   We pass the parameters and we pass the learning rate because that is what our optimizer expects here.
[00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:09.120]   Everything else has the default parameters.
[00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:13.120]   So these are the two things we absolutely need to pass to our optimizer.
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:21.120]   And now our training loop has become just a few lines of code.
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:25.120]   So this time we set the optimizer to 0 grad.
[00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:29.120]   We don't want our gradients to accumulate.
[00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:33.120]   We call loss.backward so we calculate the gradients.
[00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:38.120]   And we call a step on the optimizer.
[00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:43.120]   So this performs a single optimization step.
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:47.120]   Which means this updates our gradients.
[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:49.120]   That's all.
[00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:55.120]   So as you can see, we again get to a similar value as earlier.
[00:36:55.120 --> 00:37:03.120]   And when we try the same thing with Adam, the same value comes out of it.
[00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:12.120]   The authors were trying to show that these are slightly different because Adam is quite less sensitive to values not being normalized.
[00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:17.120]   Again, the point made by authors and I want to highlight this as well.
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:21.120]   Why do we normalize things when we send them into models?
[00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:29.120]   That's because as we are updating all of these different millions, possibly sometimes even billions if you're a large organization.
[00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:31.120]   Billions of parameters.
[00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:36.120]   You would want them to be updated on a similar scale.
[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:43.120]   So let's say some value is on the scale of tens of thousands and some values in decimals.
[00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:47.120]   And you update all of these, it's not going to reflect as nicely.
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:50.120]   And it's quite difficult to keep track of that.
[00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:55.120]   So that's why we normalize all of our values before passing them into a model.
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:38:00.120]   I'm not sure where this was covered in the code exactly, but I wanted to highlight that.
[00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:07.120]   Now we go back to the Kepler's way and Kepler had set aside a validation set.
[00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:13.120]   He didn't call it validation set, but for the sake of deep learning, we'll call it like so.
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:14.120]   So what do we do?
[00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:23.120]   We take a small subset of our data, it being 20% and we called torch.randperm.
[00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:24.120]   What does that do?
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:25.120]   Let's see.
[00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:26.120]   I have forgotten as well.
[00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:32.120]   It returns a random permutation of integers from zero to N minus one.
[00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:35.120]   So we get a bunch of shuffled indices.
[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:42.120]   We get a bunch of random indices and we create a validation set out of it.
[00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:43.120]   And we set these aside.
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:46.120]   We don't look at it for the longest time possible.
[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:51.120]   And we'll use our model to check if you're performing nicely on these values.
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:57.120]   Only once we've, uh, sorry, I was, I was mixing the two concepts.
[00:38:57.120 --> 00:39:01.120]   Uh, we keep looking at this, but we don't train our model on this.
[00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:05.120]   Sometimes you also have a test set, which we only look at after we are
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:07.120]   drunk, uh, after we are done training the model.
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:16.120]   So this time, all we do, we account for the validation loss and we don't call backwards on it.
[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:17.120]   Uh, we're good.
[00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:18.120]   We don't need to do that.
[00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:20.120]   We're just accounting for it.
[00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:27.120]   I believe later the authors showcase.
[00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:31.120]   How can you also account for, uh, validation loss updates?
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:34.120]   Uh, usually that never happens in practice.
[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:36.120]   Okay.
[00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:40.120]   I think, uh, that marks the end of chapter five.
[00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:42.120]   I'll again, take a pause for any questions.
[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:49.120]   The question asks, um, how much do you balance both of these?
[00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:52.120]   So I started my journey with fast day.
[00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:54.120]   I read the fast book before this.
[00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:58.120]   Honestly, the reason I'm, uh, also running the study group at bits and
[00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:02.120]   biases broadly, we want to encourage people to do this, to do this.
[00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:04.120]   So I'm going to start with the first question.
[00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:07.120]   How much do you balance the two concepts?
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:12.120]   So the reason I'm, uh, also running the study group at bits and biases broadly,
[00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:14.120]   we want to encourage everyone to learn.
[00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:17.120]   I think this compliments fast book quite nicely.
[00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:21.120]   So to the people who've gone through that course, and I recognize names who
[00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:27.120]   have been writing incredible blog posts for those study groups, I think what,
[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:31.120]   and I'm speaking on their behalf, this covers and compliments things from a
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:33.120]   very easy standpoint.
[00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:34.120]   We start with small concepts.
[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:35.120]   We build on top of them.

[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:29.120]   And not just focus on reading papers.
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:31.120]   And not just focus on reading papers.
[00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:33.120]   I'm sure you wouldn't be doing that.
[00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:35.120]   I'm sure you wouldn't be doing that.
[00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:37.120]   Just.
[00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:39.120]   But also try to not just read through code.
[00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:41.120]   When you get to the stage of just reading code.
[00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:43.120]   Also try to replicate it yourself.
[00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:45.120]   Without looking at the implementation by the authors.
[00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:47.120]   Without looking at the implementation by the authors.
[00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:49.120]   Or any alternate one.
[00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:51.120]   Since you mentioned papers with code.
[00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:53.120]   Since you mentioned papers with code.
[00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:55.120]   So, how to deal with that?
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:57.120]   Deep learner 007, you can be the bridge.
[00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:59.120]   Deep learner 007, you can be the bridge.
[00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:01.120]   So Prabhav, you can be the bridge for us.
[00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:03.120]   You can port them over to PyTorch.
[00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:05.120]   And that is not a light task.
[00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:07.120]   That becomes an intensive task.
[00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:09.120]   So intense that you can mention that on your resume.
[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:11.120]   So intense that you can mention that on your resume.
[00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:13.120]   And I know incredible companies that can.
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:15.120]   And I know incredible companies that can.
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:17.120]   That give value to that.
