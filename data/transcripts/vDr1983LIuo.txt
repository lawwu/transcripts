[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.800]   don't know if that's a movie background, or it's just his
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.040]   favorite vegetables. What's going on there? What's the crop?
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.720]   That's AI generated. AI generated crop. Okay, I'm trying
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.840]   AI backgrounds. I'm going to try it out for a while with different
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.240]   crops. Your fans are going to be crushed that you're not doing
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.320]   deep movie polls. With us, of course, man about town DC. New
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.160]   products being launched. David Sachs, the rain man. Yeah. How
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.240]   you doing, buddy? Good. Good. Yeah. Good week. What's going
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:50.120]   on? Yeah, definitely. Tremont poly hoppity. German dictator. He
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.800]   puts the chairman dictator, I would like to take this
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:02.600]   opportunity to wish my child a happy birthday. I absolutely
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.240]   love you.
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.440]   Well, now the rest of us look like Yeah, great. I've never
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.200]   done that before.
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.400]   Sacks in your desk. In your desk is a piece of paper with your
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.520]   children's names and their birthdays. You want to pull it
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.560]   out and see birthdays a year and I've never done
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.840]   rain, man.
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:37.760]   No, no, no. But I'm saying it rarely lands on the same day.
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.480]   Today is the day. Today's the day. Today's the day. Okay. Is
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.800]   it a
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.200]   congratulations child? Oh, congratulations. Yeah. How old
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.120]   you are? No gender name or any other specifications, folks. We
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.800]   can't we can't tip anybody off. No pronouns. No
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.360]   pronouns. Yes. So how are they experiencing their birthday?
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.680]   This child has experienced a wonderful life and this child
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.760]   is an incredible person for whom I have tremendous admiration and
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.000]   love and compassion and hope for the future.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.200]   All right. And did you order them some chicken fingers?
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.080]   I cannot comment on who this person is.
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.720]   Are you talking of course about Phil Helmuth?
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.360]   Can we please talk about last weekend's festivities? What a
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.360]   disaster he is. Oh my god. You guys just see you guys know. So
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.080]   we missed you last weekend. We missed you. So much fun. Come
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.000]   on. We missed you on Saturday night. Saturday night was really
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.240]   fun. Hmm. I had such a lovely time coming home to be totally
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.680]   honest with you. We had a cabana set up on Saturday played
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.240]   blackjack. I missed you guys too. I had a FOMO. I saw the
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.160]   videos. It was so fun. Well, you don't have to have too much FOMO
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.040]   because Phil sent the entire group chat to poker news.com.
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:58.000]   They didn't run it twice. The flop.org poker dash update. Oh
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.040]   my god. Yeah. It was like five stories and he leaked every
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.560]   single person who's there and the jets and the jet numbers.
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.720]   He's like, look, here's me and Elon. Elon came by for my dinner.
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.840]   No, no, no. It was worse than that. No, it's worth that. He
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.160]   said, I got to hang out with our guy Elon for 10 minutes and 14
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:25.920]   seconds. He intercepted him at the valet. Wait, what? 10
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.640]   minutes and 14 seconds. He had the exact time down to the
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.040]   second. Oh my god. Well, listen, I want to wish Phil Helmuth a
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.880]   happy birthday because I didn't miss his 60th party. Yeah, it's
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.720]   coming up. Actually, his birthday is not so good. It
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.120]   wasn't actually his birthday. It was Bill Gurley. So we just
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.880]   hijacked Bill Gurley's birthday. I also got to enjoy for my first
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.320]   time ever the experience of Baccarat, which I've decided is
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.960]   the most DGN game on earth. It's literally the most, you just
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.280]   flip a coin. It's flipping coins. You make betting
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.720]   decisions. All you do in Baccarat is you say bank or
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.200]   player, and then you freak yourself out about how you flip
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.600]   the cards. And the smartest people I know on earth are all
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.560]   sitting around this table at two or three in the morning saying,
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.760]   turn this corner this way. No, no, no, no, no. Turn it this way.
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.400]   Turn it this way. There's two dots and they're debating the
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.200]   right way to flip a card over. No, the Baccarat Sweat is the
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.640]   most incredible performative act in the casino. It's the
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.120]   weirdest thing. Yeah, you're right. Everyone's got their own
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.160]   little technique about how they bend the card. It's all
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.360]   destroyed by the end of the deck. They get thrown out. I go
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.400]   lengthwise. I go like this and I try to see. Oh, like you're
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.200]   curling your mustache like an evil villain? It's the evil
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.560]   villain. And then you call out, oh my god, no spotter. If you
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.680]   see a spot or two across. And then you get to decide whether
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.800]   the bank turns over their cards and when they turn you lose it,
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.520]   then you lose a small house and then you're like, yeah, you're
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.080]   convincing yourself that you have all this control and ways
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.640]   to change the outcome. You're literally flipping a card.
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:05:00.000]   It's even worse than that. You're basically sitting down
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.240]   at the casino's table and then they tell you whether you've
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.760]   won or lost. And in order to convince yourself that that's
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.120]   not what's going on, you have to play with the card. But
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.920]   really, they just tell you, you either win or lose.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.520]   And I'm watching the smartest guys we know staring at the
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.080]   window at the little machine that tells you whether bank or
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:24.000]   player one and they're studying it, doing an analysis at one
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.040]   point. It's gotta go black. Helmuth's like, I'm calling it
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.600]   now. Bank, bank, player, player, player. And all the guys are
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.200]   like, let's do it. And then everyone's got heads, heads,
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.600]   tails. So Helmuth asked us to play in the high stakes
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.400]   poker game on Poker Go. So it was me, Helmuth, Stanley, Sammy,
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:45.440]   House, and then Jen Tilly, and Nick Airball and Robo. So most
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.880]   of the guys from the House game plus Jen Tilly and Nick Airball.
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.200]   Jennifer Tilly is amazing. What a great human.
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.200]   Listen to this. Well, listen to this hand. Literally, the
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:04.080]   second hand of the actual poker game, Jen Tilly is in the
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.400]   big blind. No, sorry. She's under the gun. She raises
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.920]   house and bull three bets. It comes all the way around to me
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:17.440]   on the button. I look and I have pocket kings. Oh, I ship the
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.920]   whole cheeseburger comes back to Tilly. She ships house ships.
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:26.240]   Listen to these hands. Jen Tilly has aces. Jeff house and
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.240]   bold has kings. I have kings. Oh, my god. I've never seen a
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:34.720]   cooler hand like this in my life doubts. And the second in the
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.160]   second hand of the game. Anyways. Wow. Don't worry, guys.
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:43.360]   It's back and I want to tell you they tripled up. She triples
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.240]   up and then into lockdown. The first time I ever played with
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.840]   her. And I stacked her right. Anyways, I don't want to reveal
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.800]   the game. But it was it was wonderful. This one. I show up
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.160]   at a mutual friend of ours game. And there's like beautiful
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.320]   Porsche or something in the driveway is a really notable
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:02.800]   car. And the I noticed on the license plate says DJ. But it's
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.520]   spelled with a J. And I'm like, Oh, degenerate. What a great
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.520]   license plate. I wonder who's that is. I go, it's Jennifer
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:12.880]   Tilly. She is so cool. She's very charming. Great, very
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.440]   charming. Great actress. Great. She was in. That's what it was.
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.200]   Yeah. You don't have to ask me twice. Yeah, exactly. Exactly.
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:25.840]   What a great gangster film. Yeah. With Gina Gertrude. I mean,
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:29.040]   Gina Gertrude. And that's the one. Oh, my God. That film. That
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.440]   film. Oh, my God. Well, let's not get canceled here. Okay.
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:37.040]   Yeah. And it is quite a film. All right. Speaking of action.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:42.480]   Big week, the AI industrial complex is dominating our
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.600]   docket here. Apologies to Biden, Ukraine and Nikki Haley. But we
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:51.360]   got to go AI right now open AI, launch chat GPT for Oh, 4.0.
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:56.480]   Monday, three days after Sam wise came on all in as a
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:59.600]   programming note, and we'll go to Freiburg about this. We
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:03.360]   probably made a bit of a strategical or tactical error in
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:06.640]   not postponing his apparent appearance. In fairness,
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:10.000]   Freiburg Sam wise did tell us. Originally, he was coming on to
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.480]   talk about those things. But then it got pushed back. Anything
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:15.520]   you want to add to that as a programming note? Because people
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:20.000]   are wondering what happened. I've been talking with Sam for a
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.360]   while a year about coming on the show. And every time I see him,
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.960]   we're like, Hey, you should come on the show. He's like, I want
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.680]   to come on the show. Okay, let's find a date. We never got a date
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:30.720]   that worked. I saw him in March. And he said, Hey, I want to come
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.760]   on the show. I said, Okay, well, come on, let me know when works.
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.920]   And a couple of weeks later, he's like, what about this date
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:38.960]   in May? And I'm like, yeah, that's, that's fine. We can make
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.840]   that work. He's like, well, I've got a big announcement we're
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:44.160]   going to be doing. And I was like, perfect. Come on the show
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:49.440]   that that sounds great. And then the night before, he asked me,
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:52.080]   he told me he texted me like, hey, we're actually not going to
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.800]   have this announcement happen tomorrow. It's going to be
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.640]   delayed. He didn't tell me how long and I'm like, well, is it
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:00.240]   chat? Is it GPT five? He's like, no, it's not GPT five. And I was
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.800]   like, okay, well, you know, come on the show anyway, because he
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.480]   didn't tell me when he's doing the announcement or when it's
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:07.040]   being pushed to so it didn't seem like that big a deal. And I
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:09.040]   thought we were just going to be able to have a good chat anyway.
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:11.200]   So it's really unfortunate. I think the fact that the
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.520]   announcement happened two days after and he had to stay quiet
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:17.040]   about it during our interview. But that's the story. I think in
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.960]   the future, if someone says they've got a big announcement
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:23.280]   to do, we should probably push them. If they if they don't be
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.200]   but I don't think we're gonna be doing a lot of these
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.760]   interviews. Anyway, I think people clearly don't love them.
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.760]   And it's better for us to just kind of hang out and talk.
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:35.680]   I think I think if we had just gotten Sam on the day after the
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:39.840]   launch of GPT for Omni, as opposed to what is it three days
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.560]   before? Yeah, you could have talked much more freely about
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:45.840]   it. Yeah, it was supposed to happen same day. So it's
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.680]   unfortunate. That's all it worked out this way. A little
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:51.040]   trick is to say you can tell us under embargo. But my
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:54.560]   understanding is they were still doing the videos over the
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:57.440]   weekend. So I think those videos and stuff, they were still
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:00.640]   figuring them out. And so yeah, lesson learned. In terms of the
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:04.400]   interviews on the show. Just to recap for people, we've done a
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.280]   dozen, half of them have been presidential candidates.
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:10.080]   Sometimes they break out, sometimes they don't. But we
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:13.920]   follow our interest and our passion here on the pod. It's
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.480]   got to be interesting for us too. So we think this person is
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.480]   going to be interesting. We do it. And yeah, we understand you
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.520]   miss a news subject. But yeah, it is what it is.
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:25.680]   And to your point, a lot of the people that come on, and
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.160]   increasingly, a lot of people asked to come on because they
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.520]   know we're not journalists. And so for all of those folks that
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:36.640]   expect us to be journalists, that's not what we are. We're
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:39.200]   for entrepreneurs, we're for business people, we're for
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:42.080]   friends before technologists before curious people were for
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:46.320]   poker players. But we're not for journalists. And so we're
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.840]   going to ask whatever we feel like asking. Sometimes those
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:52.000]   things will touch a chord, because it's what you wanted to
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.800]   have asked. And sometimes we won't go to a place, whether we
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:59.360]   didn't have time to or whether we forgot or whether we chose
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:01.520]   not to. And I think it's important to have that
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:06.880]   disclaimer, like we have day jobs. And this is what we do to
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:09.200]   coalesce a bunch of information in the way that we're thinking
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:13.920]   about the world. So we are not journalists. So I think what
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:17.120]   that means is that if the guest doesn't want to talk about
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:20.480]   something, we're not going to start peppering him with gotcha
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:23.840]   questions and things like that. I appeared at a conference a
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:27.760]   couple of days ago, to promote glue, which we'll get to. And
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:30.240]   the first half of the conversation was like a normal
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:32.400]   conversation about what we were launching. And then the second
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.440]   half was basically the reporter peppering me with fastball
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:38.400]   questions, which is fine. I knew what I was signing up for. It's
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.960]   a totally different style. It's a totally different style than
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:43.440]   coming on the pod and having a normal conversation. But it's
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:47.120]   not really our job to make somebody open up if they don't
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:47.600]   want to talk.
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:50.480]   What was the spiciest question, Sax? What was the fastball?
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:51.680]   Anything come close to your head?
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:55.280]   No, I mean, it's not worth really getting into. You can
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:58.560]   watch it if I was just curious, like, look, I kind of like
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:01.760]   sometimes when reporters pitch me fastballs, because, yeah, you
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:03.680]   can strike out or you can hit it out of the park. Yeah. And
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:04.240]   they do that.
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.840]   That's an important part here. I think, you know, as a former
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:11.120]   editor in chief journalist myself, I sometimes like to ask,
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:14.720]   I would say a challenging question in a respectful way. I
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:18.080]   did that, for example, vague, you know, just clarifying his
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:22.560]   thoughts on trans and gay rights, wasn't disrespectful,
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:26.080]   was thoughtful. Would you consider it spicy or hardcore? I
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:28.400]   don't think it was hardcore. He likes to talk about us.
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.480]   No, but that's because you asked it from a position of
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:32.800]   curiosity. You weren't trying to catch the guy.
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.720]   No, see the difference. I'm actually interested in his
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.120]   opinion. This is my point. That's why it comes out
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.120]   differently. And that's why I think people enjoy these
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:42.560]   conversations. And sometimes we don't get to the other kind of
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:45.360]   answer, because I'm not interested in trying to gotcha
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:46.880]   somebody that's working hard.
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.120]   I always have the same conditions when I do interviews,
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.960]   which is I don't clear questions. And I don't let
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:53.520]   people edit it. But you know, everybody's got a different view
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:56.960]   on how to do interviews and feel a difference. If you like it,
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:00.160]   you like it. If you like Lex Friedman's version, or Tim
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:04.240]   Ferris's version, or you prefer, you know, Fox or CNN, go watch
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:07.040]   those interviews there, you can have a whole range of different
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:09.600]   interviews and interview styles available to you in the media
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:12.480]   landscape. We are but one. Sam Weiss mentioned on the pod last
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:17.360]   week that the next big model might not be called GPT-5. So on
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:22.560]   Monday, they launched GPT-4-O. The O stands for Omni. It's
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:25.520]   everything you love about tech. It's faster, it's cheaper, it's
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:29.840]   better. But from my perspective, the real show was the massive
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:34.160]   amount of progress they made on the UI/UX. The O stands for
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:38.000]   Omni, as in omnivore. It takes in audio, text, images, even your
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.520]   desktop, and video from your camera to inform what it's
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:46.000]   doing. You can consider it like 360-degree AI. Producer Nick
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.400]   will show a couple of videos while I describe them here
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:50.320]   before we go to the besties for the reaction to the
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:54.320]   announcement. First, they made great progress in solving the
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:57.040]   CB problem we mentioned last week. That's where like when you
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:00.320]   use Siri or any of these tools, you say, you know, "Hey, JETCPT,
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:03.040]   what's two plus two over and you have to wait and then if you
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:06.720]   talk over each other, it breaks." They now have that
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:09.760]   working much smoother. They did an example of counting where
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.320]   they said speed up, slow down. They did a translator that
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:15.120]   worked really well. I would like you to function as a
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:18.240]   translator. I have a friend here who only speaks Italian and I
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:21.120]   only speak English. And every time you hear English, I want
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:23.840]   you to translate it to Italian. And if you hear Italian, I want
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:25.600]   you to translate it back to English. Is that good?
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:36.960]   Perfetto. Mike, io mi chiedo se le ballene potessero parlare, cosa ci direbbero?
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:42.160]   Mike, she wonders if whales could talk, what would they tell us?
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:46.000]   They might ask, "How do we solve linear equations?"
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:52.800]   Potrebbero chiederci come risolviamo le equazioni lineari?
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:56.480]   Sicuramente sì.
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:57.200]   Certainly yes.
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.200]   Great. Looks like it works.
[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:03.200]   I think Duolingo stock took a hit during that. Most impressive,
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:07.600]   to me at least, and also I had Sandeep Madhra on my other
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:11.520]   podcast and we talked about it, was their desktop and iOS app.
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:14.560]   What this app does is fascinating. It watches your
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:20.320]   desktop on your Macintosh or on your iPad or iPhone and it does
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.400]   things like adaptive learning. Here's a clip of Sal Khan from
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:29.280]   Khan Academy and his son basically using a drawing app to
[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:34.000]   do some arithmetic or geometry and it does adaptive learning
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.960]   and basically makes a personal coach because the app is
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:39.040]   watching his son try to solve a problem.
[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:44.160]   I'm here with my son and I'd love you to tutor him on this
[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:47.040]   math problem, but don't give him the answer. You can ask
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:49.200]   questions and nudge him in the right direction, but I really
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:52.720]   want to make sure he understands it himself. He's here in the
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:54.720]   room, so you can talk to him directly.
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:59.760]   Can you first identify which sides of the triangle are the
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:04.480]   opposite, adjacent, and hypotenuse relative to angle
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:04.980]   alpha?
[00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:09.040]   All right, so I'm pretty sure this is the angle alpha right
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:09.540]   here, right?
[00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:15.360]   Correct. Now, looking at the triangle, which side do you
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:16.480]   think is the hypotenuse?
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:25.840]   Um, I'm not totally sure. I think it might be this one, but
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:28.000]   I really am not sure. This side AC?
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:34.080]   You're close. Actually, side AC is called the adjacent side to
[00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:38.720]   the angle alpha. The hypotenuse is the longest side of a right
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:42.640]   triangle and is directly opposite the right angle. Can
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.880]   you find which one is the hypotenuse?
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:50.320]   Oh, OK, I see. So I think the hypotenuse is this really long
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.560]   side from A to B. Would that be correct?
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:55.120]   Exactly. Well done.
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:58.800]   It can also participate in Zoom calls, explain charts, all that
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.760]   great stuff. And so it's going to be your guide on the side.
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:05.360]   It's going to be a present, you know, personality while you're
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:08.640]   using your apps. It's really impressive, I have to say. So I
[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:12.720]   guess let's start, Freeberg, with your takeaways on all of
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:14.480]   these innovations that we saw.
[00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:18.800]   I think it's become quite apparent that there's an
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:24.160]   evolution underway in model architecture. We've, and I think
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.720]   you may remember, we talked about this briefly with Sam last
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:31.120]   week, but we're moving away from these very big, bulky models
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:35.760]   that are released every couple of months or quarters and cost a
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:38.560]   lot of money to rebuild every time they get re-released
[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:45.040]   towards a system of models. So this multimodal system basically
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:49.520]   leverages several models at once that work together or that are
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:54.240]   linked together to respond to the inputs and to provide some
[00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:57.120]   generative output, and that those individual models
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:00.960]   themselves can be continuously tuned and/or continuously
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:04.240]   updated. So rather than have, you know, hey, there's this big
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.880]   new release that just happened, this new model just got trained,
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:09.840]   cost $10 million to train it, it's been pushed, these models
[00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:14.000]   can be upgraded with tuning, with upgrade features, and then
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.320]   linked together with other new smaller models that are perhaps
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:19.680]   specialized for specific tasks like doing mathematics or
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:22.720]   rendering an image or rendering a movie. And so I think what
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:27.840]   we're going to see is soon more of an obfuscation of the
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:32.400]   individual models, and more of this general service type
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:35.760]   approach, where the updates are happening in a more continuous
[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:38.880]   fashion. I think this is the first step of OpenAI taking
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:44.080]   that architectural approach with GPT-4.0. And what's behind the
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:46.000]   curtains, we don't know. We don't know how many models are
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.680]   there. We don't know how frequently they're being
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:49.520]   changed, whether they're being changed through actually
[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:52.160]   upgrading the parameters, or whether they're being fine
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:55.200]   tuned. And so this seems to be pretty obvious. If you look at
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:59.040]   this link, one of the criticisms that initially came
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:03.600]   out when they released GPT-4.0 was that there was some
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:08.320]   performance degradation. And Stanford actually runs this
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:13.040]   massive multitask language understanding assessment. And
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:16.240]   they publish it, I think daily, or pretty frequently on how all
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:19.120]   the models perform. And you can see the scorecard here, that
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:23.360]   GPT-4.0 actually outperforms GPT-4. And so this goes
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:25.200]   counter to some of the narrative that in order to get
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.800]   some of the performance improvements and speed
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:29.840]   improvements they got in 4.0, that they actually made the
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:32.000]   model worse. And it seems actually the opposite is true,
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.520]   that the model's gotten slightly better, it's still
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:37.280]   underperforms cloud three. Opus, which you can see here
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:38.880]   ranks top of these charts, but there's lots of different
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:41.040]   charts, all the companies published on charts, they all
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:43.120]   claim that they're better than everyone else. But I like
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:44.320]   Stanford because it's independent.
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:47.440]   Chamath, any thoughts after seeing it and in combination
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:51.040]   with our interview? Do you think chat GPT is running away
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:55.120]   with the consumer experience? Or do you think this is like
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:57.120]   neck and neck with some of the other players?
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:00.000]   Not to tell tales out of school, but somebody that we
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.040]   all know in our group chat, posted something about the fact
[00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:07.040]   that the consumer growth had stalled. I don't know how they
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:10.400]   knew that, that they maybe they got some data or maybe
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:13.120]   they're an investor. You guys know what I'm talking about.
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:15.600]   And, and they said that they're trying to reinvigorate
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:19.440]   growth into the consumer app into an open AI. I mean,
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:21.920]   Any insights as to why it might be plateauing in your
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:22.420]   perspective?
[00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:28.080]   I wrote this in my annual letter. But there are these
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:32.400]   phases of growth. And when you look at like social networks
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:35.120]   as a perfect example, Friendster was magical when it
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:38.480]   was first created. Right. And then you had my space that
[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:41.040]   just ran circles around them, because Friendster didn't
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:45.440]   really invest the money and the quality that it took to,
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:49.680]   to create a moat. And then my space really wasn't able to
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:52.160]   compete. So we were, you know, Facebook, we were the eighth
[00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:54.480]   or ninth when we showed up on the scene, and we ran circles
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:58.720]   around everybody. I think what it means is that there are
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:02.960]   these phases of product development, which exist in many
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:05.360]   markets, this market, I think, is going through the same
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:07.760]   thing. And right now, we're in the first what I would call
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:11.280]   primordial ooze phase, which is everybody's kind of like
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:13.520]   running around like a chicken with their heads cut off.
[00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:17.200]   There's all these core basic capabilities that are still so
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:20.320]   magical when you see them. But we all know that five and 10
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:22.960]   years from now, these things will be table stakes, right.
[00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:28.000]   And what free bird just showed is a table of many companies
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.600]   and many trillions of market cap, all effectively running to
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:35.200]   the same destination. So I think where we are is probably
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:39.040]   within two years of where the basic building blocks are
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:42.720]   standardized. And then I think the real businesses get built.
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:46.560]   So I will maintain my perspective here, which is the
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:49.440]   quote unquote, Facebook of AI has yet to be created.
[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:54.160]   Okay. And here it is chat, GBT web visits, as you can see,
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:58.480]   have plateaued, this data is similar web, I would agree with
[00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:02.560]   you, Jamal, it seems like the use cases, and the lucky lose
[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:05.440]   who were just trying the software, because they heard
[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:08.880]   about it. They've gone away. And then we have to find actual
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:12.480]   use cases. Saxe, I'm wondering, but our friend, Jason, just to
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:14.400]   kind of complete that said something about the premium
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:16.160]   conversion, right? That's what he said. I don't know how he
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:20.240]   knows. Paid, paid. So to be clear, paid versus free. And
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:24.080]   then what Sam said on the podcast last week was, it seems
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:26.800]   like whenever they come out with something new, the old stuff
[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:30.240]   becomes free. In my talk with Sonny this week, he mentioned
[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:34.080]   that these new models are so much more efficient, that you
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:37.680]   actually can throw the old model in the garbage garbage because
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:42.240]   it's so inefficient. And these are now becoming about 90%
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.320]   cheaper every year, which means every two years, these things
[00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:49.280]   are gonna be 99% cheaper and better. Yep. And it might be
[00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:54.720]   amazing. I sacks on a strategic level is going to make all this
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:57.920]   free, or close to free and maybe just charge for multiplayer
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:01.120]   version. That seems to be where it's heading. You don't have to
[00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:05.520]   log in to use 3.5. You don't have to log in to use Google
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:08.160]   serve. No, you do have to log in still on Google services. But I
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:10.640]   think these are going to just be free. So on a product basis,
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:13.200]   what are your thoughts? And then maybe could talk about free to
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:16.160]   pay? Do you think everybody in the world is going to pay 20 30
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:19.520]   40 bucks 500 a year 200 a year to have one of these? Or are
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:22.400]   they just going to all be free? Well, I think you're assuming
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:25.280]   there that the long term business model of open AI is and
[00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:29.680]   you to see subscriptions, and I think that's probably the least
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:32.560]   attractive business model they have available to them. It's
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:35.280]   sort of the first one and the most obvious one because they
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:38.080]   put out chat GPT, and then it's pretty easy just to roll out
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:41.600]   premium version. But in my experience, B2C subscriptions,
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:44.480]   it's just not a very attractive business model, because
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:46.880]   consumers just aren't willing to pay a lot, and they have high
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:50.240]   churn rates, and there's no possibility of expansion, really.
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:53.760]   So I suspect they're going to move in more of a b2b direction
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:57.200]   over time, because that's where the real money is. And probably
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:01.200]   the way they do that is by monetizing all the apps that are
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:06.880]   built on top of it. And I think that in that sense, GPT 40 is a
[00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:11.840]   really important innovation. By the way, the the O stands for
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:15.040]   Omni, which I think stands for Omni channel. I think you may
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:17.120]   have said Omnivore, which is kind of funny.
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:19.920]   Yes, it's Omni. Yeah, which means all the different media
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:23.520]   types are currently currently coming in, right? Like, that's
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:25.360]   the difference. It's not like you just give it an image or
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:28.480]   give it a video. It's absorbing all those at the same time in
[00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:29.600]   parallel, I believe.
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:31.920]   That's right. So there's three big innovations with this model,
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:35.760]   right? So one is Omni channel, which means text, audio, video
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:40.240]   and images. Second, it's more conversational, like it
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:44.480]   understands the tone of people talking and understand sort of
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:47.360]   sentiment in a way it didn't before. And then the third
[00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:50.320]   thing, which is really important is that it's just much faster
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:53.840]   and more performant than the previous version, GPT-4 Turbo.
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:56.400]   In the speed test, they say it's twice as fast, we've played with
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:59.360]   it at glue, we can talk about that in a minute. And it feels
[00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:02.720]   10 times as fast, it is much faster. But it's the combination
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:06.080]   of all three of these things that really makes some magical
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:10.000]   experiences possible. Because when you increase the speed of
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.360]   processing, you can now actually have conversations within a much
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:17.120]   more natural way before it was the the models were just too
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:22.560]   slow. So there'd be a long delay after every prompt. Yeah. So now
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:25.440]   like you showed, it can do things like you point the camera
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:28.880]   at a blackboard or something with math equations on it. And
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:32.800]   it can walk you through how to solve that problem. Or two
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:36.480]   people can be talking and it does real time translation. You
[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:38.880]   know, there's that old saying that every Star Trek technology
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:41.360]   eventually becomes true. They've just basically invented
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:44.480]   the whole natural language real time. Yes. Universal
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:47.920]   translator. Yeah. So anyway, so those are some interesting use
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:51.040]   cases. But I just think they're going to be able to unleash a
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:55.520]   whole lot of new applications. And if they're metering the
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:58.880]   usage of the models and providing the best dev tools, I
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:00.320]   think there is a business model there.
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:02.960]   This thing is moving so fast. They're in like Leonardo
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:05.680]   DiCaprio mode, every two years, they throw the old model away.
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:10.480]   Okay, let's keep thank you, sex. But I mean,
[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:13.680]   did you write that ahead of time?
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:22.560]   One point on that is, there are a whole bunch of startups out
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:26.800]   there that we're creating virtual customer support agents.
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:30.240]   And they've been spending the last couple of years working on
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:34.880]   trying to make those agents more conversational, quicker, more
[00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:38.080]   responsive. I think their product roadmaps just became
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:41.360]   obsolete. Now, that's not to say there isn't more work for them
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:46.240]   to do in workflow in terms of integrating the AI with customer
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:50.960]   support tools and doing that last mile of customizing the
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:54.640]   model for the vertical specific problems of customer support.
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:27:00.240]   But my guess is that hundreds of millions of dollars of R&D just
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:03.520]   went out the window. And probably this is the best time
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:05.600]   to be creating a customer support agent company. If you're
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:08.720]   doing it two years ago, five years ago, your work has just
[00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:11.840]   like been, well, I mean, that is the thing of this pace, like,
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:14.400]   you know, you used to have to throw away client server stuff
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:17.360]   or, you know, whatever, you had a web based thing, you get an
[00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:19.920]   app out, you throw away some of the old code. But this is like
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:22.720]   every 18 months, your work has been replaced.
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:26.320]   If you're an app developer, the key thing to understand is where
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:30.640]   does model innovation and and your innovation begin? Because
[00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:33.600]   if you get that wrong, you'll end up doing a bunch of stuff
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:36.000]   that the model will just obsolete in a few months.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.320]   I think you're totally right. I think that's such a really
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:40.960]   important observation. That's why I think the incentive for
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:43.360]   these folks is going to be to push this stuff into the open
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:47.200]   source. Because if you if you solve a problem, that's
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:50.400]   operationally necessary for your business, but it isn't the
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:54.560]   core part of your business. What incentive do you have to really
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:56.880]   keep investing in this for the next five and 10 years to
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:59.440]   improve it, you're much better off like clarinet, for example,
[00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:03.360]   right, we talked about the the amazing improvement and savings
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:07.120]   that clarinet had by improving customer support, release it in
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:09.840]   the open source, guys, let the rest of the community take it
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:12.880]   over so that it's available to everybody else. Otherwise,
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:15.520]   you're going to be stuck supporting it. And then if and
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:20.000]   when you ever wanted to switch out a model, you know, GPT 404
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.160]   to 402, Claude to llama, it's going to be near impossible,
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:27.360]   and it's going to be costly. So I also think sacks the
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:32.160]   incentive to just push towards open source in this market, if
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:34.480]   you will, is so much more meaningful than any other
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:38.000]   market. Yeah, I mean, listen, you were there when I think you
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.120]   were there at Facebook when they did the open compute project,
[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:44.080]   and they just were like, sorry, guys, talk about talk about
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:47.680]   torching an entire market. Explain what it is. So there was
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:51.760]   this moment where when you were trying to build data centers,
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:54.880]   you'd have these like, one you rack mounted kind of like
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:58.560]   machines that you use. And what Facebook observed was there was
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:01.200]   only a handful of companies that provided it. And so it was
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:04.720]   unnecessarily expensive. And so Facebook just designed their
[00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:07.920]   own and then release the specs online just kind of said, here
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:10.800]   it is. And they went to these Taiwanese manufacturers and
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:14.000]   other folks and said, please make these for your cost plus a
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.760]   few bucks. And it was revolutionary in that market,
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:22.000]   because it allowed this open platform to sort of embrace this
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.120]   very critical element that everybody needs. And I think
[00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:29.600]   there's going to be a lot of these examples inside of AI,
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:33.040]   because the costs are so extreme, so much more than just
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:35.840]   building a data center for a traditional web app, that the
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:39.600]   incentives to do it are just so so meaningful. Yeah, and I just
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:42.240]   showed it on the screen. Saks, you've actually been dancing
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:46.160]   along this line. Last night, I was using your new slack killer
[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:48.560]   or coexist or I'm not sure it feels like a slack killer to me
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:51.280]   because I'm moving my company to it on over the weekend, we're
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:55.920]   moving to glue. And when I were doing some very, I think I may
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:59.600]   need to wet my beak on this one. We want you to wet your beak.
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:06.240]   I feels like 100 bagger to me. I'm in killer killer. Yes,
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:09.040]   because you got can you do that again in Christopher Walken
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:14.480]   voice, please. I get to wet my beak. It's like 100 x slide in
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:21.520]   the 500. Wow. Tell me about product decisions. Where does
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:26.960]   the AI end? And your product begin? Yeah, well, it's a good
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:30.480]   point. I mean, I think where the AI ends, we want to use the
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:33.760]   most powerful AI models possible. And we wanted to
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:37.760]   focus on enterprise chat. So you could think of us as for sure
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:41.200]   a slack killer slack competitor. It says that slack wasn't built
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:45.440]   for the AI era glue is AI native. What does that mean? No
[00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:47.600]   channels. You know, I showed this to Tomas, the first thing
[00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:50.480]   he said is you had me at no channels, right? People are so
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:52.480]   sick of channels, you have to keep up with all these hundreds
[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:54.480]   and hundreds of channels. And the real problem with channels
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:58.160]   is there's one thread in a channel that you want to see. In
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:00.320]   order to see it, you have to join the whole channel. And now
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:03.600]   you're getting all this noise. People just want the threads. So
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:06.720]   if you look at what's the chat model inside of chat GPT, it's
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:10.880]   just threads, right? You create a topic based thread in chat
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:15.680]   GPT, the AI comes up with a name for it, puts it in the sidebar.
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:17.520]   And then if you want to talk about something else, you create
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:20.240]   a new chat. That's exactly the way that glue works. It's just
[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:23.520]   multiplayer. You just put the groups and individuals you want
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:27.040]   on the thread. Let me just show you real quick. Here's my glue
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:29.120]   here. And you can see that in the sidebar, I've got all the
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:31.920]   threads that I've been involved in. And like I said, you can
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:34.720]   address them to multiple people or groups. And then you've got
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:39.920]   the chat here. Now, we've also fully integrated AI. And so Nick
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:43.600]   who's our producer, just in this thread seg at glue AI, what
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:47.280]   countries to sacks talk about most in episodes, episodes is a
[00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:49.760]   group we created to be the repository of all of the
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:55.280]   transcripts of our episodes. And so Lou did a search and it
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:57.920]   said David Sachs frequently discusses Ukraine, what the
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:02.080]   most. Yeah, really, then the Nick said, be more specific
[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:05.840]   about sack stance on Ukraine, Russia war. Oh, boy. And
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:09.360]   gonna basically overload the server. Well, here it said here,
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:11.600]   David Sachs has articulated a nuanced and critical perspective
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:13.600]   on the Ukraine, Russia war across various episodes, the
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:16.480]   all in pod. Here's some key points encapsulating his stance.
[00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:20.240]   And it like nailed it. It's talked about prevention through
[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:22.880]   diplomacy, opposition to NATO expansion, humanitarian
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:26.160]   concerns, skepticism, military intervention, peace deal
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:30.480]   proposal. You know, I'll copy and paste this onto Twitter x
[00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:34.080]   later today. But the point is, it like nailed it across all
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:36.720]   these different episodes. And then this is a feature of glue.
[00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:40.640]   It provided sources. So it cites where it got all the
[00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:44.320]   information from. So imagine, you know, we're doing this for
[00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:47.200]   the all in pod. But you could imagine that instead of it being
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:50.800]   transcripts of a podcast, it could be your work documents,
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:54.800]   you now have in your main chat, the ability just to ask, hey,
[00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:59.840]   at blue AI, remind me where we left that project or tell me
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:02.560]   who the expert is on this subject matter, or who's
[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:05.120]   contributed the most of this project. I've actually figured
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:08.000]   out using blue AI who's contributed the most deal flow
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.640]   at craft is pretty amazing. Now let me show you like,
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:16.560]   I'm not gonna say here. I think it's Brian. Okay, Brian's my
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:24.960]   guy. Those two guys. Daniel and Brian. I get sacks on. Okay, you
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:30.400]   know, Daniel, I'll hire Brian constitute craft. We'll call it
[00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:30.960]   on the raft.
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:40.880]   Sacks, I just looked at the chat GPT for Omni server. And when
[00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:43.920]   you did that query, it actually rolled its eyes. Keep going.
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:50.000]   Okay. So so we talked about how chat GPT for Oh, understand
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.480]   sentiment in conversations. And I think this is a really good
[00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:55.840]   example. So Evan, who's my co founder glue was just testing
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:59.680]   this for us. And he asked, What is each besties personality
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:03.360]   type based on conversations and episodes. And first of all, it
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:06.000]   figured out who the besties are, like we didn't program that it
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.760]   just figured it out on its own, which is pretty impressive. And
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:12.560]   here's what I said about each besties personality. So it says
[00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:15.840]   Jason calcaneus role, the moderator and entertainer,
[00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:19.440]   personality traits, charismatic, humorous, lively and the glue of
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:22.480]   the group. Same phrase, often praise for his ability to make
[00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:25.840]   the podcast entertaining, and keep the conversation flowing.
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:27.920]   Jason's energy and ability to bring humor and discussions are
[00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:30.000]   key elements that define his role in the podcast comments.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.080]   He's acknowledged for his role in bringing the group together.
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:35.760]   Chamath Palihapitiya the visionary and hustler, personality
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:38.720]   traits, insightful, driven, persistent, Chamath's relentless
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:41.120]   drive and ability to hustle are admired by his peers, making him
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:43.200]   a core part of the podcast intellectual discussions. I'll
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:46.880]   skip me but does Freeburg the pragmatic scientist and realist,
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:50.320]   pragmatic, methodical and a bit reserved? Oh, free birds, often
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:52.400]   the voice of reason, bringing a scientific and realistic
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:56.080]   perspective, the discussion, he focuses on analysis, logical
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:59.520]   reasoning. And then it cites where it got this from. And it
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:01.760]   says here, overall, the dynamic between the four besties creates
[00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:04.800]   a well rounded and engaging podcast with each member bringing
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:07.360]   their unique strengths and personality traits to the table.
[00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:08.720]   I think that's pretty incredible.
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:12.640]   How woke is this? Have you? Have you put any rails on or it's
[00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:18.080]   just just pure chat GPT for Oh, combined with the data? Yeah,
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:21.200]   yeah. So what we're doing here is we're wrapping chat GPT for
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:26.160]   Oh, with blue features that we've implemented to get the
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:28.560]   most out of the conversation. There's things we have to do to
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:33.200]   scope the the prompt. And then we're using a retrieval
[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:37.600]   augmented generation service called raggy, which does rag as
[00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:41.280]   a service that basically slurps in our transcripts and makes
[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:45.440]   them accessible to the AI. So that's basically the stack that
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:47.600]   we're using. But as the models get better and better, glue just
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:50.320]   gets better and better. Again, can I can I just make a comment
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:54.960]   on this? It's just so clean. J cal was the key for me and
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:36:00.560]   abandoning slack. He told me two or three years ago, he called
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:04.400]   me and he said, I have, you can tell me the exact channels, I
[00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:08.320]   eliminated some channels that were random. There was like two
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:10.720]   or three channels that you have a random channel, your slack
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:14.240]   instance wasn't allowed to have. And I was like, this is genius.
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:16.480]   And I went in and I was like, all of our companies should just
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:21.040]   eliminate these channels. And we could only get like 20% or 30%
[00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:23.520]   compliance. But it really started to turn me off slack
[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:26.640]   because I would get caught in these threads that were just so
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:31.040]   totally useless. And I thought, why aren't people working? And
[00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:33.840]   this is really great, because you cannot blather on about
[00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:36.720]   nonsense in glue, which I find really useful. Well, this is
[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:40.000]   what happens when slack in we use it at 8090 just so you know,
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.280]   so we were the when we got into the early get into slack too
[00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:46.720]   much, people start to think slack is the job. And replying
[00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:48.720]   to slacks and having conversations is the job when
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:51.200]   there's actually a job to be done. There's a job to be done.
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:53.840]   Yeah. And so it's important. And what I liked about this
[00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:58.160]   implementation facts was it's like the ability to make a feed
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:03.040]   or a data source inside of your communication platform. So the
[00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:06.560]   fact that you imported all of the episodes and the transcripts
[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:10.320]   is great. But what I want is like our HubSpot or our cell
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:15.840]   CRM. I want our Zen desk, I want our LinkedIn jobs and our
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:19.040]   LinkedIn job applications. I want our notion I want a coda to
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:22.320]   each have the ability and when I was using it last night, what
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:27.680]   you do is you use the at symbol to evoke and to summon in a way
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:31.280]   it's like summoning Beetlejuice. So you summon your AI, but then
[00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:35.120]   you tell it what data set you want to go after. So you say,
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:40.560]   you know, at AI, let's talk about, I don't know, how do you
[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:43.920]   manage your deal flow at craft? Do you use software like CRM
[00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:47.600]   software to manage deals, Brian, we just do it on you. But we do
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:49.840]   it all in glue. So it's ready right there. But you're right.
[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:53.520]   So So the first thing that glue AI has access to is all of your
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:57.040]   chat history, which is amazing, because you get like, you know,
[00:37:57.040 --> 00:38:00.000]   that we can look at all your attachments. And we've got, I
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.400]   think, six integrations at launch, there'll be more. So
[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:04.480]   yeah, like all of your enterprise data will be there.
[00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:06.320]   In the short term, you're right, you have to summon the
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:09.040]   repository by app mentioning because the AI needs a little
[00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:12.160]   bit of help of where to look. But in the future, it's going to
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:14.800]   figure it out on its own. So it's gonna become more and more
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:17.600]   seamless, but it'll insert itself. So we have a discussion
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:20.560]   about sales. And then you might have a sales bot that says, Hey,
[00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:23.680]   by the way, nobody's called this client in three months.
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:25.680]   Well, that's where I want to go with it is I call that
[00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:29.520]   promptless, which is I want the AI just to chime in when it
[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:32.560]   determines that it has relevant information and can help the
[00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:36.080]   team, even if it hasn't been summoned yet. But we need some
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:38.080]   model improvement for that, frankly, I mean, we'll be able
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:40.960]   to get there by GPT five. But that's totally where this is
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:44.320]   headed. I'll show you just one more fun example. If I could,
[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:48.800]   let me just show you this. So I asked it to write a letter to
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:53.440]   Lena Khan, to be a guest at the all in summit. And I told it
[00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:58.560]   mentioned positive things we've said about Lena Khan in episodes
[00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:02.800]   of the all in pod. And so it wrote this letter, Dear Chair
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:05.680]   Khan, we hope this message finds you well on behalf of the host
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:07.760]   the all in pod, we're excited to send an invitation for you to
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:11.760]   speak at the upcoming all in summit. And then it says, in our
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:13.520]   conversations, we have frequently highlighted your
[00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:15.920]   impressive credentials, and the impactful work you've
[00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:19.600]   undertaken. For example, in episode 36, we acknowledge your
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:23.680]   trailblazing role. And so the letter was able to quote
[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:27.520]   episodes of the all in pod, just without anyone having to go do
[00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:29.520]   that research and figure out like what would be the best
[00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:32.000]   because I told it only say positive things don't say
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.120]   anything negative. Right? And then it said warm regards. And
[00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:37.520]   it said who the four besties were, again, we never told it
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:41.200]   who the besties are. We just said, write us a letter. So
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:44.480]   it's pretty incredible. Now, this is an example of the all in
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:48.400]   pod or think about any work context, where the AI has access
[00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:52.480]   to your previous work documents. It's pretty amazing what it can
[00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:56.320]   do. Well, I mean, it is kind of in the name, like this is glue,
[00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:59.120]   put you together. And slack is where you slack off makes total
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:02.000]   sense. The brands give you a little bit of a tip. We should
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.320]   have seen it coming with slack. Totally.
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:13.040]   We have a breaking news story. It's a great story. I got
[00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:17.120]   breaking news coming in. Friedberg, your life's work.
[00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:21.760]   Saks did his product review. Now it's your turn, Friedberg.
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:24.960]   We got breaking news coming in. I did promise you that when
[00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:29.520]   Ohalo decides to come out of stealth, and explains what we've
[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:32.960]   done and what we're doing. I would do it here on the all in
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:39.280]   pod first, before the all in exclusive. So basically, by the
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:45.360]   time this pod airs, we're going to be announcing what Ohalo has
[00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:48.080]   been developing for the past five years and has had an
[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:50.640]   incredible breakthrough in, which is basically a new
[00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:55.120]   technology in agriculture. And we call it boosted breeding. I'm
[00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:57.760]   going to take a couple minutes just to talk through what we
[00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:03.920]   discovered, or invented at Ohalo and why it's important. And the
[00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:07.360]   kind of significant implications for it. But basically, five
[00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:12.960]   years ago, we had this theory that we could change how plants
[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:18.720]   reproduce. And in doing so, we would be able to allow plants to
[00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:22.800]   pass 100% of their genes to their offspring rather than just
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:25.760]   half their genes to their offspring. And if we could do
[00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:28.320]   that, then all the genes from the mother and all the genes
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:31.760]   from the father would combine in the offspring, rather than just
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:33.840]   half the genes from the mother and half the genes from the
[00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:38.080]   father. And this would radically transform crop yield, and
[00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:41.760]   improve the health and the size of the plants, which could have
[00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:45.440]   a huge impact on agriculture, because yield the size of the
[00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:48.960]   plants ultimately drives productivity per acre, revenue
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:51.360]   for farmers, cost of food, calorie production,
[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:54.560]   sustainability, etc. So this image just shows generally how
[00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:59.040]   reproduction works. You've got two parents, you get a random
[00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:02.960]   selection of half of the DNA from the mother, and a random
[00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:05.120]   selection of half the DNA from the father. So you never know
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:07.200]   which half you're going to get from the mother, or which half
[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:09.680]   you're going to get from the father. That's why when people
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:12.400]   have kids, every kid looks different. And then those two
[00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:15.120]   halves come together and they form the offspring. So every
[00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:19.200]   time a new child is born, every time a plant has offspring, you
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:22.960]   end up with different genetics. And this is the problem with
[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:26.400]   plant breeding. Let's say that you have a bunch of genes in one
[00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:28.560]   plant that are disease resistant, a bunch of genes and
[00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:31.040]   the other plant that are drought resistant, and you want to try
[00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:33.840]   and get them together. Today, the way we do that in
[00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:37.520]   agriculture is we spend decades trying to do plant breeding
[00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:40.400]   where we try and run all these different crosses, find the ones
[00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:42.000]   that have the good genes, find the other ones that have the
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.400]   good genes and try and keep combining them. And it can take
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:47.200]   forever and it may never happen that you can get all the good
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:50.960]   genes together in one plant to make it both disease resistant
[00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:55.280]   and drought resistant. So what we did is we came up with this
[00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:57.920]   theory that we could actually change the genetics of the
[00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:02.000]   parent plants, we would apply some proteins to the plants, and
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:06.640]   those proteins would switch off the reproductive circuits that
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:10.560]   cause the plants to split its genes. And as a result, the
[00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:15.040]   parent plants give 100% of their DNA to their offspring. So the
[00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:18.480]   offspring have double the DNA of either parent, you get all the
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:21.440]   genes from the mother all the genes from the father. And
[00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:24.800]   finally, after years of toiling away and trying to get this
[00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:26.800]   thing to work and all these experiments and all these
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:30.400]   approaches, we finally got it to work. And we started
[00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:33.920]   collecting data on it. And the data is ridiculous. Like the
[00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:37.360]   yield on some of these plants goes up by 50 to 100% or more.
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:41.280]   Just to give you a sense, like in the corn seed industry,
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:44.960]   breeders that are breeding corner spending $3 billion a
[00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:47.520]   year on breeding, and they're getting maybe one and a half
[00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:50.880]   percent yield gain per year. With our system, we are seeing
[00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:53.600]   50 to 100% jump in the size of these plants. It's pretty
[00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:56.320]   incredible. Here's an example. This is a little weed that we
[00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:59.920]   that you do experiments with in agriculture, called Arabidopsis.
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:01.760]   So it's really easy to work with. And you can see that what
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:05.600]   we have on the top are those two parents A and B. And then we
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:08.880]   applied our boosted technology to them, and combine them. And
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:11.120]   we ended up with that offspring called boosted IDs, you can see
[00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:13.040]   that that plant on the right is much bigger, it's got bigger
[00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:14.640]   leaves, it's healthier looking, etc.
[00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:18.000]   For your question, does that mean that the boosted one has
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.560]   twice the number of chromosomes as a and b?
[00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:22.320]   Exactly right.
[00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:23.920]   So is that like a new species, then?
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:28.080]   Yeah, so it's hard to survive with twice the number of
[00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:28.800]   chromosomes.
[00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:31.280]   Yeah, it's, it's called polyploidy. So we actually see
[00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:34.960]   this happen from time to time in nature. For example, humans
[00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:38.560]   have two sets of chromosomes, right? So does corn, so do many
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:43.520]   other species. Somewhere along the evolutionary history, wheat
[00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:47.440]   doubled, and then doubled again, and you end up actually in wheat
[00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:51.280]   having six sets of chromosomes. Wheat is what's called a
[00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:54.160]   hexaploid. Potatoes are a tetraploid, they have four sets
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:57.280]   of chromosomes. And strawberries are an octaploid, they have
[00:44:57.280 --> 00:45:00.640]   eight. And some plants have as many as 24 sets of chromosomes.
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:03.520]   So certain plant species have this really weird thing that
[00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:05.920]   might happen from time to time in evolution where they double
[00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:09.440]   their, their DNA naturally. And so what we've effectively done
[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:13.120]   is just kind of applied a protein to make it happen and
[00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:16.240]   bring the correct two plants together when we make it happen.
[00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:18.720]   And so this could only happen for a plant, right? This can
[00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:20.080]   never happen with an animal.
[00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:22.560]   It wouldn't, it wouldn't work in animals. It works in plants.
[00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:26.240]   Okay. And one way you can think about plant genetics is all the
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:29.920]   genes are sort of like tools in a toolbox. The more tools you
[00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:33.280]   give the plant, the more it is, it has available to it to
[00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:37.280]   survive in any given second to deal with drought or hot weather
[00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:40.960]   or cold weather, etc. And so every given second, the more
[00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:43.680]   tools or the more genes the plant has that are beneficial,
[00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:45.680]   the more likely it is to keep growing and keep growing. And
[00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:48.560]   that plays out over the lifetime of the plant with bigger,
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:51.440]   bigger leaves and bigger, you know, grows taller. But more
[00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:53.760]   importantly, if you look at the bottom, the seeds get bigger.
[00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:56.560]   And in most crops, what we're harvesting is the seed. That's
[00:45:56.560 --> 00:45:59.920]   true. And you know, corn and many other crops. And so seeing
[00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:03.040]   over a 40% increase in seed in this little weed was a really
[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:06.560]   big deal. But then we did it in potato. And potato is a crazy
[00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:08.960]   result. Potatoes, the third largest source of calories on
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:12.320]   earth. And so we took two potatoes that you see here in
[00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:15.840]   the middle A, B and C, D, we applied our boosted technology
[00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:18.560]   to it, to each of them and put them together and you end up
[00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:21.920]   with this potato ABCD. That's the boosted potato. And as you
[00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:24.560]   can see, these were all planted on the same date. And the
[00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:28.000]   boosted potatoes much bigger than all the other potatoes
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.720]   here, including a market variety that we show on the far right.
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:33.280]   That's what's typically grown in the field. Now here's what's
[00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:34.880]   most important when you look under the ground and you
[00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:38.480]   harvest the potatoes. You can see that that a B potato only
[00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:43.840]   had 33 grams, CD had nine grams. So each parent had 33 and nine
[00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:48.240]   grams potato. But the boosted offspring had 682 grams of
[00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:51.920]   potato, the yield gain was insane. And so you can see this
[00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:56.720]   being obviously hugely beneficial for humanity. You
[00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:58.880]   know, potatoes being the third largest source of calories,
[00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:03.040]   Indian potato farmers are growing one acre of potato in
[00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:07.360]   India, they eat potato two meals a day. In Africa, potato is a
[00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:10.080]   food staple. So around the world, we've had a really tough
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:12.720]   time breeding potatoes and improving the yield. With our
[00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:15.280]   system, we've seen incredible yield gains in potato almost
[00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:19.200]   overnight. And the other potatoes, those are normal size
[00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:22.160]   potatoes that you see there. Those are like, you know, table
[00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:24.160]   potatoes. Basically, that looks like a russet potato right
[00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:25.520]   there. That's like a normal size.
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:30.160]   It started as like a little creamer potato, basically, and
[00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:34.240]   you blew it up into a russet potato. Yeah, so the genetics on
[00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:37.600]   a B, you can see they're like little purple, tiny little
[00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:40.400]   purple potatoes, the genetics on CD are like these little white,
[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:43.360]   you know, tiny little ball potatoes. But when you put those
[00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:46.240]   two together with boosted, and you combine all the DNA from a
[00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:49.280]   B and all the DNA from CD, you get this crazy, high yielding
[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:52.640]   potato, ABCD, which by the way, is higher yielding than the
[00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:54.880]   market variety that's usually grown in the field on the far
[00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:58.720]   right. So why not just grow russet potatoes, then we are.
[00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:00.800]   And so we're working on doing this with russet. We're working
[00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:04.480]   on doing this with every major potato line. Sorry, the
[00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:06.640]   improvement you'll see is actually yield. So it's not the
[00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:08.320]   size of the potato, it's the number of potatoes that are
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:12.080]   being made. And, and so you'll see acre or something like that,
[00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:15.120]   like the exactly, you know, projects in the 60s and 70s,
[00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:19.120]   you can tell freebergs onto something here. You got David
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:23.120]   sacks to pay attention during it. Yeah, there's gonna be a
[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:25.920]   decker court and sacks is awake. So actually, like, how do I wet
[00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:29.120]   my because I was interrogating the potato lines. I've never
[00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:32.160]   what's going on. I think genetics is interesting. But so
[00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:34.880]   have you tried these potatoes? They taste different? Oh, no,
[00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:37.760]   they're awesome. Yeah, they're they're potatoes. And we do a
[00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:42.800]   lot of analysis. Any horns yet or anything like that? No. I
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:45.760]   mean, again, one of the other advantages of the system that
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:48.560]   we've developed, let me go back here. And I just want to take
[00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:52.240]   two seconds on this. One of the other things this unlocks is
[00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:56.880]   creating actual seed that you can put in the ground in crops
[00:48:56.880 --> 00:48:59.120]   that you can't do that in today. So potatoes, the third
[00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:02.000]   largest source of calories. But the way we grow potatoes, you
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.920]   guys remember the movie, The Martian, you chop up potatoes,
[00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:06.960]   and you put them back in the ground. Because the seed that
[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:09.440]   comes out of a potato, which grows on the top and the flower,
[00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:12.480]   every one of those seed is genetically different. Because
[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:14.960]   of what I just showed on this chart, right, you get half the
[00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:17.520]   DNA from the mother half the DNA from either. So every seed has
[00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:20.800]   different genetics. So there's no potato seed industry today.
[00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:24.960]   And potato is like $100 billion market. With our system, not
[00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:27.920]   only can we make potatoes higher yielding and make them disease
[00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:32.560]   resistant. What we also make is perfect seed. So farmers can now
[00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:35.760]   plant seed in the ground, which saves them about 20% of revenue
[00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:38.480]   takes out all the disease risk, and makes things much more
[00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:41.120]   affordable and easier to manage for farmers. So it creates
[00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:43.680]   entirely new seed industries. So we're going to be applying
[00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:46.880]   this boosted technology that we've discovered across nearly
[00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:51.040]   every major crop worldwide. It'll both increase yield, but
[00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:54.960]   it will also have a massive impact on the ability to
[00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:58.480]   actually deliver seed and help farmers and make food prices
[00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:02.400]   lower. Is it more sustainability? No, it's
[00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:05.120]   actually cheaper. So higher yield, lower cost, do you need
[00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:09.680]   more water, less water, less land, less energy, do you need
[00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:14.800]   more fertilizer? fertilizer usually scales with biomass, but
[00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:17.840]   these sorts of systems should be more efficient. So fertilizer
[00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:22.320]   use per pound produced should go down significantly. As we get
[00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:25.200]   to commercial trials with all this stuff. And we're doing this
[00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:27.760]   across many crops. So there's a lot of work to do in terms of
[00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:29.840]   like, how do you scale and tell us about production in the
[00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:35.360]   field? Tell us about the the patents, and how important
[00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:38.240]   patents play a role in this because isn't it like, like one
[00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:40.880]   of Monsanto's big things like they just go and sue everybody
[00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:43.040]   into the ground or whatever, like, I'm gonna answer you one
[00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:45.680]   second, I'm just gonna switch my headset just died. Wow, we
[00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:51.120]   went from sacks as bots to freebergs crops. I'm glad we're
[00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:53.840]   doing him second, because all of a sudden, like group chat
[00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:57.520]   doesn't seem very important. Yeah. Wow. He just, he just
[00:50:57.520 --> 00:51:01.040]   saw the whole Ukraine crisis here. I wouldn't be able to grow
[00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:04.800]   wheat in the desert. And in the race, he solved the world food
[00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:07.040]   problem. Yeah, sex. What if you what did you do for the last
[00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:09.360]   six months? Yeah, we made our price chat a little better. But
[00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:13.840]   we added AI to enterprise chat. We cleaned up your slack. So
[00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:16.400]   yeah, when you invest, we've invested a ton of money. This
[00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:19.200]   was stealth for five years, we put a ton of money into this
[00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:25.920]   business. So when you invest like I mean, north of 50. Yeah,
[00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:28.960]   50 million, five years, and you don't have a product in market
[00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:30.880]   yet. Wow, that's some we actually have some product.
[00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:32.960]   Yeah. So I haven't talked about the way we've been making money
[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:35.120]   in some of the business we've been doing. Okay, let me just
[00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:39.040]   make sure this is like clear. So that last photo you showed
[00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:43.280]   with the different types of potatoes, you had created the
[00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:46.880]   super huge ones. But you're saying that the the yield
[00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:49.280]   benefit here is just you create a much bigger, hardier plant
[00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:52.720]   that's capable of producing many more potatoes. The size of
[00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:55.440]   potatoes doesn't change. You can control for that when you
[00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:58.080]   breed. So the selection of what plants you put together in the
[00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:00.880]   boosted system allows you to decide you want small, medium,
[00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:04.080]   large, that's all part of the design of which plants do you
[00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:06.400]   want to combine? Okay, because your goal is not to turn like a
[00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:08.720]   russet potato into like a watermelon or something like
[00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:12.080]   that. No, the goal is to make more russet potato per acre, so
[00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:15.120]   that we use less water, we use less land, farmers can make more
[00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:18.640]   money, people pay less for food. That's the goal. And so it's
[00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:21.520]   all about yield. It's not about changing the characteristics.
[00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:23.200]   There are some crops where you want to change the
[00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:26.480]   characteristics, like you might want to make bigger corn kernels
[00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:28.640]   and bigger cobs on the corn, which is another thing that
[00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:32.160]   we've done. And that's actually been published in our patent.
[00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:34.480]   And the reason, by the way, I'm talking about all this is some
[00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:37.600]   of our patents started to get published last week. And so when
[00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:39.600]   that came out, the word started to get out. And that's why we
[00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:42.240]   decided to get public with what we've done, because it's now
[00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:44.720]   coming out in the open. You mentioned something briefly
[00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:50.800]   there about where different crops can be planted. You know,
[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:53.840]   we had these big talks about wheat and corn, they're only
[00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:57.440]   available in very specific parts, you know, north of the
[00:52:57.440 --> 00:53:01.120]   equator, the jungles can't be in obviously polar or desert
[00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:04.400]   extremes. So if you're successful, what would this do
[00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:10.480]   for on a global basis, where these crops are made? Because
[00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:14.000]   that's our whole discussion about you. Totally wheat belly
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:18.160]   of Europe, the cradle of wheat. It's a great question. I'm so
[00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:20.560]   glad you asked it because that's one of the key drivers for the
[00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:24.640]   business is that we can now make crops adapted to all sorts of
[00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:27.680]   new environments that you otherwise can't grow food. Today,
[00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:29.760]   there's close to somewhere between 800 million and a
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:31.600]   billion people that are malnourished, that means they are
[00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:34.800]   living on less than 1200 calories a day for more than a
[00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:39.200]   year. But on average, we're producing 3500 calories per
[00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:42.320]   person worldwide in our ag systems. The problem is we just
[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:46.240]   can't grow crops where we need them. And so by being able to do
[00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:49.120]   this sort of system where we can take crops that are very drought
[00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:53.040]   resistant, or can grow in sandy soil or very hot weather, and
[00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:55.840]   adapt cooler climate crops to those regions, but through the
[00:53:55.840 --> 00:53:59.200]   system, we can actually move significantly where things are
[00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:03.440]   grown. And, and improve food access in regions of how
[00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:05.760]   Friedberg when you look at a potato, how do you figure out
[00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:10.400]   what part of their DNA is the drought resistant part? Yeah.
[00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:13.200]   And then how do you make sure that that's turned on? So even
[00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:16.240]   if you inherit that chromosome, is there some potential
[00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:18.880]   interaction with the generally if we can, so these are what are
[00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:22.080]   called markers, genetic markers. And so there are known
[00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:25.520]   markers associated with known phenotypes, a phenotype is a
[00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:29.280]   physical trait of a plant. And so we know lots of markers for
[00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:32.560]   every crop that we grow markers for disease resistance, drought
[00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:37.520]   resistance, markers for big plants, short plants, etc. And so
[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:40.400]   what we do is we look at the genetics of different plants
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:42.720]   that we might want to combine into the boosted system. And we
[00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:44.480]   say these ones have these markers, these ones have these
[00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:47.520]   markers, let's put them together. And then that that'll
[00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:50.160]   drive the results. One of the other interesting things we're
[00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:54.800]   seeing, which I didn't get too much into in the slides. It's
[00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:59.360]   not just about combining traits. But it turns out, when you add
[00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:03.920]   more genes together, biology figures out a way to create gene
[00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:06.320]   networks. These are all these genes that interact with each
[00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:10.560]   other in ways that are not super well understood. But it makes
[00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:14.160]   the organism healthier and bigger and live longer. This is
[00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:16.400]   like when you bring like why mutts are healthier and live
[00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:19.360]   longer than purebred dogs, because they have more genetic
[00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:23.280]   diversity. So there's a lot of work now in what's called
[00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:25.520]   quantitative genomics, where you actually look at the
[00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:29.360]   statistics across all the genes, you use a model, and the model
[00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:33.360]   predicts which two crosses you want to make out of hundreds of
[00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:36.880]   1000s or millions of potential crosses that the AI predicts,
[00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:39.680]   here's the two best ones to cross, because you'll get this
[00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:42.240]   growth or this healthiness. So how do you want to how do you
[00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:44.960]   want to make money freeberg? Are you going to sell the seeds?
[00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:47.680]   Are you going to become the direct farmer? Are you going to
[00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:51.840]   become food as a service? Like, how do you make the most money
[00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:55.440]   from this, we're not going to farm, farmers are our customers.
[00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:58.640]   And so there are different ways to partner with people in the
[00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:01.920]   industry who already have seed businesses or already have
[00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:04.800]   genetics and help them improve the quality of their business.
[00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:08.000]   And then there's other industries like in potato, where
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.400]   we're building our own business of making potato seed, for
[00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:13.840]   example. So every crop and every region is actually quite
[00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:16.320]   different. So it becomes a pretty complicated business to
[00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:19.840]   scale. We're in the earlier days, we're already revenue
[00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:24.160]   generating, I would like a sweeter blueberry. No comment.
[00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:27.840]   No comment. Yeah, I get tilted by the quality of the Driscoll
[00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:30.160]   blueberries. Let me tell you something about the Driscoll
[00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:33.760]   blueberries. Also the Driscoll I've I've had only one batch of
[00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:37.280]   a Driscoll strawberry that was just off the charts. And every
[00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:42.080]   19,847 other batches I bought have been Yeah, now you want the
[00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:45.920]   European small ones or the Japanese ones from Hokkaido
[00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:48.720]   because they're rich and sweet. And they're not these like
[00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:52.400]   monstrosity of giant flavorful strawberries. What's that about?
[00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:56.800]   Could you do a seedless mango? Yes, no cut it.
[00:56:56.800 --> 00:56:59.680]   Oh my god, how great would that be?
[00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:04.240]   Work for a mango is like the worst ratio.
[00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:07.520]   Yeah. Well, somehow we made it about us.
[00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:10.080]   Yeah, no, no, look, I think that's it is all about you guys.
[00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:12.640]   Tell us about the blueberries. Sorry. Well, no, every year.
[00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:17.520]   Driscoll's puts out a special labeled package called sweetest
[00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:21.280]   batch. And they just had the sweetest batch of strawberry and
[00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:22.880]   blueberries. I don't know if they're still in the stores, but
[00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:25.360]   they only last for like a week or two. And that's the best
[00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:28.880]   genetics only grown on a small number of acres. Really
[00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:32.080]   incredible going as soon as this is done. See if they have
[00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:35.360]   it. So I got it a few weeks ago. It's quite delicious. Anyway,
[00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:38.240]   we know, let's just say we know the berry market very well. My
[00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:42.240]   co founder, CTO, Judd Ward, who's, who's brilliant idea
[00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:45.680]   boosted breeding was many years ago, who I met because they had
[00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:48.560]   a New Yorker article on Judd, I cold called him and said, Hey,
[00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:51.360]   will you come in and give us a tech talk, we started talking
[00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:53.920]   and Judd came up with this idea for boosted breeding. And so we
[00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:57.040]   started the business with Judd and Judd ran molecular breeding
[00:57:57.040 --> 00:57:59.520]   at Driscoll. So we have a lot of Driscoll's people that work at
[00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:01.040]   O'Halo, we know the market really well.
[00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:04.320]   Can you go back to the patent stuff? Like, are you a seed
[00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:08.640]   person? So we spent we spent 50 million bucks on you know, plus
[00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:12.960]   on this business today. So we have filed for IP protections
[00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:16.160]   that people can't just rip us off. But I would say I think
[00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:20.000]   that the real advantage for the business arises from what we
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:23.440]   call trade secrets, which is not just about taking patents and
[00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:26.080]   going out and suing people. That's not a great business. The
[00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:28.720]   business is how do you build a moat? And then how do you extend
[00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:32.080]   that moat? The great thing about plant breeding and genetics is
[00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:35.040]   that once you make an amazing variety, the next year, the
[00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:37.120]   variety gets better. And the next year, the variety gets
[00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:39.760]   better. And so it's hard for anyone to catch up. That's why
[00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:43.120]   seed companies generally get monopolies in the markets,
[00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:46.560]   because farmers will keep buying that seed every year, provided
[00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:49.840]   it delivers the best genetics. And so our business model is
[00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:52.240]   really predicated on how do we build advantages and moats and
[00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:55.840]   then keep extending them rather than try to leverage IP. So I'm
[00:58:55.840 --> 00:58:58.160]   a big fan of like building business model advantages.
[00:58:58.160 --> 00:59:00.880]   This is going to be a credible sax. If you think about, you
[00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:03.840]   know, geopolitically, what's going on in Somalia, Sudan,
[00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:08.720]   Yemen, Afghanistan, those places have 10s of millions of people,
[00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:11.280]   I think hundreds of millions collectively, who are at risk
[00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:13.200]   for starvation, if you could actually make crops that could
[00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:17.120]   be farmed there, Friedberg, you would change humanity. And then
[00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:20.800]   all these people buying up farmland in America, that could
[00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:24.720]   devalue that farmland, if that wasn't as limited of a resource
[00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:25.760]   you have Friedberg, like,
[00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:28.560]   no, I think. So first of all, like farmland in America is
[00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:32.960]   mostly family owned, that's 60% rented, actually. So a lot of
[00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:35.200]   families own it, and then they rent it out because they stopped
[00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:40.000]   farming it. But the great thing that we've seen in agriculture
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:43.920]   historically is that the more calories we produce, the more
[00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:46.320]   food we produce, the more there seems to be a market. It's like
[00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:47.520]   any other economic,
[00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:49.120]   what about wheat and rice?
[00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:54.080]   Yeah. So those are calorie sources one and two. And there's
[00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:56.880]   certainly opportunity for us to apply our boosted systems there.
[00:59:57.920 --> 01:00:00.720]   The big breakthrough with potato is we can make potato seed using
[01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:03.120]   our boosted system in addition to making better potatoes.
[01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:05.840]   McDonald's is the largest buyer of potatoes. Yeah.
[01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:09.520]   So in the US 60% of the potatoes go to French fries and potato
[01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:13.360]   chips. McDonald's buys most of the fries. PepsiCo under Frito
[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:17.200]   Lay buys most of the potato chip potatoes. 40% are table potatoes.
[01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:22.240]   In India, 95% of the potatoes are table potatoes, they're eaten
[01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:25.360]   at home. And the Indian potato markets three to four times as
[01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:30.080]   big as the US potato market. In Brazil, it's 90% table potato. So
[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:33.200]   all around the world potatoes different. The US is, you know,
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:36.560]   unusually large consumers of French fries and potato chips.
[01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:41.760]   I speak on behalf of Jay Cowan, I said, we will gladly invest a
[01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:44.400]   million at a 10 cap in both of your businesses.
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:47.440]   Absolutely. Yes, we will break our way into this.
[01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:50.480]   Jay Cowan and I will do the deal. We'll wire the money. We'll wire
[01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:52.880]   the money a little million to each of you guys at a 10 cap.
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:53.760]   Thank you.
[01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:56.880]   Absolutely. You're in. It may not be a 10 cap, though. But yes.
[01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:00.560]   Breaking news, Chamath and Jay Cowan have secured the bag.
[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:04.000]   It's breaking news. Chamath and Jay Cowan have secured the bag
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.080]   from the besties actually doing work.
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:09.200]   Yeah. Well, I appreciate you guys letting me talk about it today.
[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:10.400]   I'm excited to share it.
[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:11.360]   The both of you. I love it.
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:15.680]   It's been, yeah, building stuff is hard. There's always risk.
[01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:19.840]   It's a lot of work and a lot of setbacks. But man, when you get
[01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:21.360]   stuff working, it's great.
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:23.120]   We're each doing the things we do best.
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:27.200]   Freeburg is solving the world's hunger problem. And I'm making,
[01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:32.080]   I'm cleaning up your slack, making your enterprise chat a
[01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:32.880]   little better.
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:38.800]   All progress counts. All right. Stanley Druckenmiller has got a
[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:43.040]   new boyfriend. Druckenmiller's got a boyfriend and his name is
[01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:47.200]   Javier. And they've eloped to Argentina. Druckenmiller
[01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:51.680]   professed his love. Tom Cruise on Oprah's couch in a CNBC
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:55.440]   interview this week, the only free market quote leader in the
[01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:59.200]   world right now, bizarrely is in Argentina of all places. He cut
[01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:02.400]   social security at 35%. If he came to office, they've gone
[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:06.080]   from a primary deficit of like four or 5% to a 3% surplus.
[01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:09.520]   They've taken a massive hit in GDP, basically a depression for
[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:12.640]   a quarter. And his approval rating has not gone down.
[01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:17.520]   Druckenmiller has explained how he invested in Argentina after
[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:22.080]   seeing Millet's speech at Davos, which we covered. Here's a 30
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:23.680]   second clip, play the clip, Nick.
[01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:26.320]   By the way, do you want to hear how I invest in Argentina? It's
[01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:30.400]   a funny story. I wasn't at Davos, but I saw the speech in
[01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:33.440]   Davos and it was about one o'clock in the afternoon in my
[01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:37.280]   office. I dialed up perplexity and I said, give me the five
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:42.000]   most liquid ADRs in Argentina. It gave me enough of a
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:46.160]   description that I followed the old Soros rule, invest and then
[01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:49.520]   investigate. I bought all of them. We did some work on them.
[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:53.200]   I increased my positions. So far, it's been great, but we'll
[01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:53.840]   see.
[01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:57.280]   Yeah, that's quite interesting. Quick note, you hear
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:00.800]   Druckenmiller mention ADRs. For those of you who don't know, and
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:04.240]   I was one of them, they stand for American Depository Receipts,
[01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:07.360]   basically a global stock offered on a US exchange to simplify
[01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:13.360]   things for investors. Yeah, I mean, he didn't sign a prenup
[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:16.160]   here. He just went all in and he bought the stock, Chamath, and
[01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:19.120]   then he's going to figure it out later. Tell us your thoughts on
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:21.760]   this love affair, this bromance.
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:24.720]   There's a great clip of Millet. He goes on this talk show in
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:29.520]   Argentina and the talk show host, she's just so excited and
[01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:33.440]   greets him and then they start making out. Have you guys seen
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:33.680]   this?
[01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:34.160]   What?
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:39.040]   Full on French kissing each other. It's hilarious.
[01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:43.760]   Yeah, I mean, Soros has been very famous for this invest and
[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:49.200]   investigate thing. It's like a smart strategy for very, very
[01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:53.200]   liquid public market investors that have the curiosity that he
[01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:55.360]   does. I mean, I don't have much of a reaction to that. I think
[01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:59.840]   that the thing with Argentina that's worth taking away is when
[01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:05.200]   you've spent decades casting about and misallocating capital
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:08.800]   and running your economy into the ground, the formula for
[01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:15.040]   fixing it is exactly the same. You cut entitlements, and you
[01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:19.360]   reinvigorate the economy. And so the thing we need to take away
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:21.200]   is if we don't get our together, that's probably what we're
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:22.080]   gonna have to do.
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:27.600]   Saks, the influence of Millet on American politics. Will there
[01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:32.720]   be any? It seems like he has paralleled what Elon did at
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:37.200]   Twitter, Facebook, and Zuck did a Facebook. Do you think that
[01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:40.880]   this experiment he's doing down there of just cutting staff,
[01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:45.520]   cutting departments will ever make its way into American
[01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:46.080]   politics?
[01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:50.800]   Probably not. I mean, not until we're forced to. But what Millet
[01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:53.680]   did, he comes in, and they've got a huge budget deficit, and
[01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:55.920]   they've got runaway inflation, and they're debasing their
[01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:59.280]   currency. And just practically overnight, he just slashes
[01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:01.200]   government spending to the point where he has a government
[01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:04.560]   surplus. And then as soon as he gets credibility with the
[01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:07.200]   markets, that allows him to reduce interest rates, inflation
[01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:10.000]   goes away, and people start investing in the country.
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:10.500]   Magic.
[01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:11.600]   It's magic.
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:12.720]   So there is a path.
[01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:18.640]   It's obvious. Listen, I mean, you can't run deficits forever.
[01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:20.720]   You can't accumulate debt forever. It's just like a
[01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:26.320]   household. If your spending exceeds your income, eventually
[01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:29.440]   you got to pay it back or you go broke. And the only reason we
[01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:31.600]   haven't gone broke or experienced hyperinflation is
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:33.840]   because we're the world's reserve currency. So there's
[01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:37.600]   just a lot of room for debasement. And there's not a
[01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:39.600]   ready alternative yet. I mean, everyone's trying to figure out
[01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:42.720]   what the alternative will be. So we've been able to accumulate
[01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:45.200]   more and more debt, but it's reaching a point where it's
[01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:48.080]   unsustainable. And what we've already seen is that the Fed's
[01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:51.520]   had to jack up interest rates from very low, practically
[01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:55.760]   nothing, to 5.5%. And that has a real cost on people's
[01:05:55.760 --> 01:06:00.320]   well-being. Because now, your cost of getting a mortgage goes
[01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:03.600]   way up. I mean, mortgage rates are over, what, 7.5% now?
[01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:07.760]   Yeah, 6%, 7%, depending on how much net worth and your credit
[01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:08.480]   rating.
[01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:11.840]   Right. And so it's much harder to get a mortgage now. It's
[01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:14.640]   harder to make a car payment if you need to borrow to buy a car.
[01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:17.040]   And if you have personal debt, the interest rate is going to
[01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:19.520]   be higher. The inflation rate actually doesn't take into
[01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:22.480]   account any of those things. Remember, Larry Summers did that
[01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:26.080]   study where he said the real inflation rate would be 18% or
[01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:29.920]   would have peaked at 18% if you include a cost of borrowing.
[01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:33.520]   That's why people don't feel as well off as the unemployment
[01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:38.320]   rate would normally suggest. So people are hit really hard when
[01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:42.400]   interest rates go up in terms of big purchases they need to
[01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:45.360]   make with debt. And then, of course, it's really bad for the
[01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:49.200]   investment environment because when interest rates are really
[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:52.960]   high, that creates a higher hurdle rate and people don't
[01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:57.200]   want to invest in risk assets. And so eventually, the pace of
[01:06:57.200 --> 01:07:00.240]   innovation will go down. And Druckenmiller made this point in
[01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:03.520]   his next set of comments. He said that treasury is still
[01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:06.320]   acting like we're in a depression. It's interesting
[01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:08.000]   because I've studied the depression. You had a private
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:12.000]   sector crippled with debt, basically with no new ideas. So
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.880]   interventionist policies were called for and were effective.
[01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:17.360]   He said the private sector could not be more different today
[01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:19.760]   than it was in the Great Depression. The balance sheets
[01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:22.320]   are fine. They're healthy. And have you ever seen more
[01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:24.640]   innovation ideas that the private sector could take
[01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:28.000]   advantage of, like blockchain, like AI? He says all the
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.760]   government needs to do is get out of the way and let them
[01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:32.880]   innovate. Instead, they spend and spend and spend. And my new
[01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:36.720]   fear now is that spending and the resulting interest rates on
[01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:40.560]   the debt that's been created are going to crowd out some of
[01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:42.640]   the innovation that otherwise would have taken place. I
[01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:44.160]   completely endorse Druckenmiller's view of
[01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:47.760]   binomics. And actually, I mean, this is what I said way back in
[01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:49.600]   2021.
[01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:53.920]   Victory lap. Here we go. David Sacks victory lap. We need a
[01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:55.040]   little graphic for that.
[01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:57.520]   Druckenmiller used the word binomics. Instead, I give these
[01:07:57.520 --> 01:08:00.800]   guys an F because they're still printing money and spending
[01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:02.880]   money like we're in a depression, even though we're in
[01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:06.000]   a rip-roaring economy. And when they started doing this back in
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:09.600]   2021, I tweeted, "Binomics equals pumping trillions of
[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:11.440]   dollars of stimulus into a rip-roaring economy." I'm not
[01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:13.440]   going to pretend like I know what's going to happen next, but
[01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:15.760]   never tried this before. What happened next was a lot of
[01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:18.720]   inflation and that jacked up interest rates. According to
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:22.080]   even Keynesian economics, the reason why you have deficit
[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:24.640]   spending is because you're in a recession or depression. And so
[01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:27.600]   you use the government to stimulate and balance things
[01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:31.040]   out. You don't do deficit spending when the economy is
[01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:34.160]   already doing well. So this spending, there's no reason for
[01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:34.720]   it.
[01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:37.440]   It's like showing up to like a party that's going crazy and
[01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:39.760]   being like, putting gasoline on the fire.
[01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:44.560]   Yeah, I mean, more importantly, it should limit the approval or
[01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:49.040]   action of certain programs that you might otherwise want to do
[01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:53.200]   in a normal environment. But in an inflationary environment, you
[01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:56.880]   don't have the flexibility to do that. Student loan forgiveness
[01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:59.280]   is a really good example. Is now the time?
[01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:00.240]   Of course not.
[01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:03.440]   To do student loan forgiveness, or do we wait for inflation to
[01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:06.800]   temper a bit? Is now the time? You know, so there's just a lot
[01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:09.040]   of these examples that actually the opposite should be true.
[01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:12.720]   Yeah, but none of all of those things get you votes.
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:14.800]   Before we move on from this, look, what we have coming out of
[01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:17.120]   Washington here is a contradictory and therefore
[01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:20.480]   self-defeating policy. You've got the Fed jacking up rates to
[01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:23.440]   control inflation, you move across town, and you've got
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:26.000]   Capitol Hill on the White House, spending like there's no
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.640]   tomorrow, which is inflationary, right? Why would you do both
[01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:30.800]   those things? Choose what your policy is going to be like
[01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:33.280]   driving with your foot on the brake and the gas at the same
[01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:35.200]   time. It's not a great idea for the car.
[01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:37.440]   Let me just make one comment, Jekyll, before we move on about
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:40.320]   the Druckenmiller investment statement, of course, I just
[01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:42.720]   wanted to say, like, I think what it highlights about
[01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:47.040]   Druckenmiller, and call it a rift in investing philosophy or
[01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:50.240]   skill, is the difference between precision and accuracy.
[01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:54.560]   What I mean by that is precision really references that you do a
[01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:58.320]   lot of detailed analysis to try and make sure you understand
[01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:01.840]   every specific thing that is going right or could go wrong.
[01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:04.880]   But the problem, and so that means you, for example, might do
[01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:07.360]   a ton of diligence on a company and make sure you understand
[01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:10.960]   every dollar, every point of margin, all the specifics of the
[01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:13.600]   maturation of that business and where they are in their cycle.
[01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:18.400]   But you could be very precise, but be very inaccurate. For
[01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:21.840]   example, if you miss an entire trend, someone could invest in
[01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:25.280]   Macy's back when Amazon was taking off and have done a lot
[01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:29.120]   of precise analysis on Macy's margin structure and performance
[01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:31.680]   and said, this is a great business. But they missed the
[01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:34.800]   bigger trend, which is that e commerce was going to sweep away
[01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:38.560]   Macy's and consumers were simply that's not possible in the
[01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:41.520]   analysis, but they were doing to be honest, free bird, nobody
[01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:45.280]   can make that stupid of a trade to say Macy's versus Amazon over
[01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:46.480]   the next 10 years.
[01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:49.840]   Oh, yeah. And so like, and Jake, I want to show that.
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:55.120]   Do not poke the tiger. Let's not get into it. Other podcasters,
[01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:56.960]   the worst spread trade in history.
[01:10:56.960 --> 01:10:59.920]   Yeah, let me just finish the statement. But the other one is
[01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:03.520]   being accurate and accurate means you get the right bet the
[01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:06.880]   right sentiments, the right friend, the problem with being
[01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:10.240]   accurate, you could have said, in the year 2000, hey, the
[01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:13.280]   internet is going to take off. And you could have put a bunch
[01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:16.960]   of money in but the problem was you were right. You just had to
[01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:22.240]   have the necessary patience. And so accuracy generally yields
[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:25.840]   better returns, but it requires more patience because you can't
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:29.520]   necessarily time how long it will take for you to be right.
[01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:33.600]   So a guy like Druckenmiller is making an accurate bet he bets
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:36.800]   correctly on the trend on where things are headed. He doesn't
[01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:40.320]   necessarily need to be precise. But he has the capital and his
[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:42.640]   capital structure that allows him to be patient to make sure
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:44.080]   that he eventually gets the return.
[01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:46.320]   And to build on your thoughts, having watched this movie a
[01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:49.200]   couple of times, and you know, I overthought the Twitter
[01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:52.240]   investment as but one example, I had the opportunity to invest
[01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:55.280]   in Twitter when it was like a single digit millions company.
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:59.040]   And I just thought, you know what, this thing is only like
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:02.160]   the headline. And I told them, like, it's the headline. It's
[01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:04.960]   not like the entire blog post me a cacophony of idiots, this
[01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:07.440]   thing is going to be chaos. And I was right, but I was wrong,
[01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:12.080]   right? Great bet, but my wrong analysis, right. And so you can
[01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:15.840]   add precision to other aspects, like when you sell your shares,
[01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:18.640]   or when you double down, but you have to get the trend right,
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:20.720]   which is Evan Williams, great entrepreneur, jack great
[01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:24.000]   entrepreneur, Twitter taking off like a weed, just make the bet.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:27.920]   Right. And the problem is you knew too much about journalism,
[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:29.840]   you knew too much about the space they were trying to
[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:32.400]   disrupt. And that can be a mistake. Correct. We did.
[01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:35.120]   PayPal, none of us knew anything about payment. So that's one of
[01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:37.600]   the reasons we were successful. All the payments experts told us
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:40.480]   it couldn't be done. Right? So that happens a lot.
[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:44.000]   I had never even I didn't even know what a Facebook was when I
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.480]   joined Facebook. It's an American college phenomenon. No,
[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:48.480]   serious. You don't have that in Canada.
[01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:51.680]   But you knew Zach, and you saw some growth charts, and you saw
[01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:55.200]   some precision in his ability to build product. And that's the
[01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:55.520]   way to go.
[01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:59.200]   The great thing about network effect businesses is there's a
[01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:02.240]   trend line that sustains because it builds if it's an appropriate
[01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:05.760]   network effect. So you can be accurate about buying into the
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:08.960]   right network effect business. You don't need to use all of
[01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:14.480]   this diligence to be perfectly sound around the maturation of
[01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:16.800]   the revenue and the margin structure and all that stuff as
[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:18.720]   long as the trend line is right. And you're willing to be
[01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:21.520]   patient to hold your investment. I think Druckenmiller his point
[01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:24.400]   is incredible. He took a look, he very quickly made a macro
[01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:27.120]   assessment. From a macro perspective, what Millet is
[01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:30.160]   doing is significantly different than what we're seeing in any
[01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:33.280]   other emerging market, let alone mature market with respect to
[01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:36.320]   fiscal austerity and appropriateness in this sort of
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:39.040]   inflationary global inflationary environment. And he said, you
[01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:41.840]   know what, I don't see any other leader doing this. This is a no
[01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:45.120]   brainer bet. Let me make the bet. And as long as he's willing
[01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:47.440]   to hold this thing for long enough, eventually, the markets
[01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:51.120]   will get there and call it a spread trade against anything.
[01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:52.240]   He'll be proven right.
[01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:56.480]   Well, speed and so not to but speaking of bets, Jake, how you
[01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:58.960]   told me this week that you just made your largest investment
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:00.240]   ever. Tell us about that.
[01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:03.360]   Yeah, so I've gotten very lucky now, because a lot of my
[01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:08.000]   founders from the first couple of cohorts of investing I did
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.480]   when I was a Sequoia scout have come back and created second
[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:13.920]   and third companies. And so, you know, that happened with TK
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:17.040]   Uber, and the cloud kitchens that happened with Raul from
[01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:21.280]   report of then superhuman. And then it happened recently, just
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:23.920]   in the past year, my friend Jonathan, who's the co founder
[01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:26.720]   of thumbtack, asked me to come to dinner, he said, Hey, you
[01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:29.040]   know, you were the first investor in thumbtack, will you
[01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:31.280]   be the first investor in our next company, Athena? And I said,
[01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:33.760]   Sure, what do you do? And he explained it to me. And we put a
[01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:36.800]   seven figure bet in which is rare for us as a seed fund,
[01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:40.400]   right? Normally, our bet sizes are 100k to 50. You know, it's a
[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:41.360]   $50 million fund.
[01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:42.080]   Why did you do it?
[01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:45.120]   Yeah, it's very simple. It's the fastest growing company I've
[01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:49.680]   ever seen. And I'm including Uber in that it has been growing
[01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:54.800]   at, you know, a rate that I'll just say is faster than Uber and
[01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:57.280]   Robin Hood went when we were investing in intensive millions
[01:14:57.280 --> 01:15:02.080]   of dollars. It's a very simple concept. When thumbtack was
[01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:07.040]   building their marketplace, they used researchers in places like
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:10.000]   Manila, etc, in the Philippines, knowledge workers, and what they
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:14.640]   realized was, the point 1% of those knowledge workers were as
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:17.920]   good or better than say, Americans at doing certain jobs.
[01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:21.680]   And so they've created this virtual EA service, you can go
[01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:26.640]   see it at Athena, wow.com. And we now have two of them inside
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:29.200]   of our company. It turns out Americans don't want to do the
[01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:32.720]   operations role. So it's kind of like AWS, you just give them
[01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:36.320]   $36,000 a year, they give you essentially an operations or an
[01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:41.120]   EA. And they have ones that are kind of cheap of staff ish. And
[01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:45.360]   this company is growing like a weed. So I am working with them
[01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:49.360]   on the product design as well. So imagine having, you know, two
[01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:53.040]   or three of these incredibly hardworking people who are
[01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:59.760]   trained with MBA class level curriculum, they spend months
[01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:02.880]   training these people up, they pay them two or three times what
[01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:05.280]   they would make at any other company. And then they pair them
[01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:08.000]   with executives here. And it's kind of been an underground
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:11.920]   secret in Silicon Valley, because it's only by invitation
[01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:14.720]   right now, because they can only train so many people. But if
[01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:17.040]   you've tried to hire an executive assistant, I don't
[01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:19.760]   know if anybody's tried to do that recently, you hooked me up.
[01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:23.280]   So I will be guinea picking this service. Yes. Soon, and I
[01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:27.120]   have two of them. And so it is just the greatest that you can
[01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:30.560]   have an operations person powered by AI tools as well.
[01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:34.000]   Yeah, so that's the kind of secret sauce here is they're
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:37.760]   training them, and they watch you work, and then they will
[01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:40.480]   learn how you do your job. And then how quickly you can
[01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:43.280]   delegate and get stuff off your plate is the name of the game.
[01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:45.760]   So we have an investment team with researchers and analysts
[01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:48.400]   in it, we have a due diligence team. And then you have like
[01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:52.320]   executive functions in our fund. They have now started
[01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:56.960]   shadowing, you know, you know, highly paid Americans in an
[01:16:56.960 --> 01:17:00.720]   investment firm ours, and then train them up. And now our due
[01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:03.840]   diligence, our first level screening, you know, and our
[01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:07.440]   tracking of companies is being done by these assistants, for
[01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:10.400]   what I'll say is a third to a fourth of the price I was paying
[01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:13.840]   previously. So what that does in an organization is, we're just
[01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:17.200]   delegating away and then moving our investment team to doing
[01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:20.800]   in person meetings, and doing higher level stuff. And so
[01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:25.040]   you're 8090. So at 8090, we have this funny thing where we've
[01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:29.120]   made it a verb, whenever you see somebody doing high quality work
[01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:32.080]   at a quarter to a 10th of the cost, we say, Oh, you just
[01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:35.680]   8090 did. Correct. So you're you're 8090 in the investment
[01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:38.000]   team, I'm 8090 in the investment team. And you know what, it was
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.760]   scary as hell for them, because they're like, Am I gonna lose my
[01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:42.960]   job? It's like, No, you now get to instead of doing a check and
[01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:46.000]   call once a month, you can do a check and call every other week
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:49.840]   or every week, or instead of doing 15, first round interviews
[01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:53.040]   a week, you can do 25. Because you have this assistant with the
[01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:55.280]   way, doing all the repetitive work,
[01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:58.400]   the way that companies will work in five and 10 years, I don't
[01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:00.800]   think guys, any of us are going to recognize what it's going to
[01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:04.560]   look like. So this is where I go. I mean, like watching saxes
[01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:09.120]   demo earlier, how much progress and how seamless that product
[01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:12.400]   works with the features it has enabled by the underlying
[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:16.480]   models. You just get to thinking how all of these vertical
[01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:21.920]   software applications become completely personalized and
[01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:26.560]   quickly rebuilt around AI. You know, it's, it's so obvious,
[01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:29.520]   imagine how long it would have taken john to write a letter to
[01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:32.560]   Lena Khan to like if we said john invite Lena Khan, but be
[01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:35.120]   sure to reference all the nice things we said about her on
[01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:38.320]   episodes of the pod. I'll be 10 hours work. You gotta go find
[01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:41.040]   the episodes. Yeah, listen to him to figure out what the best
[01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:43.840]   quotes are. And you got it done in five seconds. It's
[01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:46.880]   incredible. Totally. And this is building that same sort of
[01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:50.080]   capability into a very specific vertical application that's
[01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:53.920]   specific to some business function. And you can probably
[01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:56.800]   spend a couple minutes or an hour building that function. And
[01:18:56.800 --> 01:19:00.640]   then it saves you hours a day in perpetuity. Yeah, you know, I
[01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:03.280]   think I think that's why these tools companies or the tools
[01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:09.600]   products that Google, Microsoft, Amazon and a few others are
[01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:12.480]   building are actually incredible businesses, because
[01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:16.080]   so many enterprises and so many vertical application builders
[01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:18.640]   are going to be able to leverage them. I got right their entire
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:22.240]   business functions. I got myself and my co founders at 8090. We
[01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:26.000]   get this stream of emails of companies that are like, or
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:29.120]   people that are like, we have this product idea, or we have
[01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:33.680]   this small product. One of the emails I got, this is crazy, was
[01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:36.720]   from a guy that's like, Oh, we've 8090 Photoshop. So like,
[01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:38.800]   we have like a much, much cheaper version of Photoshop.
[01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:42.080]   And the guy was doing like a few million bucks of, of ARR and
[01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:45.520]   growing really nicely. But then it turned out that somebody saw
[01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:51.200]   that and then 8090 did it. So then there's that thing. And so
[01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:54.800]   to your point, Friedberg, none of these big companies stand a
[01:19:54.800 --> 01:20:00.080]   chance. Yeah, it's everything. Not because they're not because
[01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:02.960]   the products aren't good. But like, Jake, I was going to go
[01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:05.200]   off and experiment with this, Zach's going to go off and build
[01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:07.920]   a product, you know, as every time that you're at a boundary
[01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:11.040]   condition, we're all going to explore, well, maybe we could do
[01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:14.960]   this with AI, maybe we shouldn't hire a person, not because we're
[01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:18.320]   trying to be mean about it. But it's because the normal, natural
[01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:21.920]   thing to do. And the opex of companies is just going to go
[01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:24.320]   down, which means the size of companies are going to shrink,
[01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:26.400]   which means the amount of money you need is going to go down.
[01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:29.760]   And that's just going to create the ability for these companies
[01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:33.600]   to sell those products cheaper. So it's a national, it's a
[01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:36.640]   massive deflationary tail. We had the same thing happen with
[01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:40.400]   compute. And now it's happening inside of organizations. I wrote
[01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:43.120]   a blog post about this on my sub stack called ADD. This is the
[01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:46.800]   framework I came up with. I told my entire team, look at what you
[01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:49.280]   got done every week. And I want you to ask three questions. How
[01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:53.280]   can I automate this? How can I deprecate this? How can I
[01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:56.480]   delegate it? And you know, the automate part is AI and what
[01:20:56.480 --> 01:21:00.080]   you're doing, David, the delegate part is Athena wow.com.
[01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:03.280]   And then the deprecate is, hey, just be thoughtful, what are you
[01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:06.400]   doing that you don't need to do? And that's 8090 in something
[01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:08.880]   like, there are things inside these products that you don't
[01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:12.320]   actually need. What's the core functionality of the product,
[01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:15.520]   you know, make it as affordable as possible. And then what's
[01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:18.000]   going to happen for people who think this is bad for society,
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:21.200]   you've got it completely wrong. We're going to have more people
[01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:25.280]   be able to create more products and solve more problems. The
[01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:27.920]   unemployment rate is going to stay very low. We're just going
[01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:31.600]   to have more companies. So the idea like, there was somebody
[01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:34.800]   who was working on very small, like software, I want to get
[01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:37.440]   pitched on very niche ideas, I want to create something where
[01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:40.080]   people can find people to play pickleball with, right, like a
[01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:43.520]   pickleball marketplace. Now, that didn't, wouldn't typically
[01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:46.480]   work, because you would need $5 million a year to build that
[01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:49.840]   product. But if you can build it for $500,000 a year, well, now
[01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:52.240]   you've only got to clear that number to be profitable. So a
[01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:55.280]   lot more smaller businesses, a lot more independence, all
[01:21:55.280 --> 01:21:58.720]   these little niche ideas will be able to be built. And a VC who
[01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:00.960]   says, I'm not giving you $5 million to build that app will
[01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:04.560]   be like, but I will give you 500k. And that's what I'm seeing
[01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:08.000]   on the ground in startups, the same startups that had a request
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:11.280]   of $3 million in funding five years ago are now requesting
[01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:16.240]   500 to a million. It's deflationary all the way down to
[01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:18.720]   you guys. Incredible. Did you see the Google thing? Did you
[01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:22.400]   guys see the Google? Oh, yeah, Gemini stuff, chat GPT omni
[01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:26.320]   launch, at the same time, or perhaps strategically right
[01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:31.840]   before Google dropped its latest AI announcements at IO. The
[01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:35.600]   biggest announcement is that they are going to change search.
[01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:38.880]   This is the piece of the puzzle on the kingdom that they have
[01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:41.680]   been very concerned with, and they're going for it. The new
[01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:45.200]   product and they have like 20 different products, you can see
[01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:47.280]   them at labs.google, where they put all their different
[01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:50.320]   products. But this is the most important one, they call it AI
[01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:53.600]   overviews. Basically, it's perplexity for most users by
[01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:55.680]   the end of the year, they're going to have this. Here's how
[01:22:55.680 --> 01:22:57.680]   it works. And you can see it on your screen. If you're watching
[01:22:57.680 --> 01:23:00.800]   us go to YouTube. Here, they gave an example, how do you
[01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:03.040]   clean a fabric sofa, this normally would have given you
[01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:06.160]   10 blue links here, it gives you a step by step guide with
[01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:10.320]   citations and links. So they're preempting, you know, the issue
[01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:14.240]   of people getting upset. And as I predicted, they're going to
[01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:18.000]   have targeted ads, here's the things you need in order to
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:21.120]   clean your couch. You can only use this if you're using your
[01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:24.640]   Gmail account. If you use like a domain name on Google Docs, it
[01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:28.240]   won't work there. So go to labs.google. But they're doing
[01:23:28.240 --> 01:23:32.320]   citations. And I think that we're going to see a major
[01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:34.960]   lawsuit here, those people who are in those boxes are going to
[01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:36.960]   look at the answer here and realize maybe they don't get the
[01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:39.680]   click through. And that this answer was built on that. And
[01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:41.440]   now we're gonna have to have a new framework, there's going to
[01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:45.600]   need to be sacks, a new company that clears this content so
[01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:48.560]   that Google can do answers like this.
[01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:52.560]   The workflow stuff in Gmail also kicked ass the demo that they
[01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:56.960]   showed was, you get a bunch of receipts. And the person giving
[01:23:56.960 --> 01:23:59.600]   the demo, she said something the effect of Walt, wouldn't it be
[01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:02.400]   great if like, you know, the AI assistant, we're able to find
[01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:05.680]   all the receipts, and then aggregated them, and put them in
[01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:09.600]   a folder, and then also actually generated an expense report, or
[01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:14.400]   like a spreadsheet, why not fly it? It's crazy. Yeah, I got to
[01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:18.160]   say, I think that it's free to change your mind. And so it's
[01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:22.720]   good to do that. Oh, and I think that Chamath, and a rare moment
[01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:26.400]   of reflection, might do a, are we gonna have a re underwriting?
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:29.040]   Is this a re underwriting? I change my mind all the time. I
[01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:30.960]   just, I mean, you know, because I'm
[01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:34.160]   Ladies and gentlemen, breaking news, Chamath is re-underwriting his
[01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:34.720]   Google train.
[01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:40.000]   Sorry, I know to blow your ears out. I think the Google thing is
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:44.080]   pretty special between last week's announcement of isomorphic
[01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:48.640]   labs, which, let's be honest, that's a, that's just a multi
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:51.600]   hundred billion dollar company. So you're saying there might be
[01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:54.400]   many, think about it this way, right? Multi billion dollar
[01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:56.960]   opportunity sitting there dormant inside of Google that AI
[01:24:56.960 --> 01:24:57.600]   unlocks.
[01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:00.800]   Look at a company like Royalty Pharma. So if Royalty Pharma,
[01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:04.160]   with a pretty, it's a phenomenal business run by a phenomenal
[01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:06.880]   entrepreneur, Pablo LaGarreta. But what is that business? That's
[01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:11.920]   buying two and 3% royalties of drugs at work. And you can see
[01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:14.160]   how much value that those guys have created, which is
[01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:18.640]   essentially 90% EBITDA margin business. It's outrageous,
[01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:21.280]   because they're in the business of analyzing, and then buying
[01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:25.200]   small slivers. I think something like isomorphic ends up being
[01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:28.480]   of that magnitude of margin scale, but at an order of
[01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:31.760]   magnitude, or two orders of magnitude higher revenue. So if
[01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:36.160]   you if you fold that back into a Google, if you think about what
[01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:39.280]   they're doing now on the search side, these guys may be really
[01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:44.400]   kicking some ass here. So I think that the, the reports of
[01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:46.800]   their death were premature and exaggerated.
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:49.360]   Absolutely. And the report of their death freeberg was based
[01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:52.880]   upon people don't need to click on the ads. But as I said on
[01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:57.120]   this very bogus, my belief is that this is going to result in
[01:25:57.120 --> 01:26:00.400]   more searches and more knowledge engagement. Because once you
[01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:04.720]   get how to cook your steak and get the right temperature, right
[01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:07.760]   for medium rare, it's going to anticipate your next three
[01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:10.720]   questions better. So now to say, Hey, what wine pairing would you
[01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:13.200]   want with that steak? Hey, do you need steak knives, and it's
[01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:15.440]   just going to read your mind that you need steak knives and
[01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:17.680]   trim off likes to buy steak knives, but maybe you like to
[01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:22.000]   buy mock meats, whatever it is, it's going to drive more research
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:25.040]   and more clicks. So while the monetization per search may go
[01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:28.480]   down, we might see many, many more searches. What do you think
[01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:33.040]   freeberg you work there. And when we look at the the future
[01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:35.760]   of the company and the stock price, Nick, we'll pull it up.
[01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:40.160]   Man, if you had held your stock? Yeah, I don't know. Did you
[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:42.080]   hold? I bought some
[01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:44.800]   original stock.
[01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:49.200]   Oh, no, I sold all my stock back when I started climate
[01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:52.240]   because I was a startup entrepreneur and needed to live.
[01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:58.880]   So which, you know, I did the math on it, it was pretty it'd
[01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:03.280]   be worth. It'd be worth a lot. It would be worth billions or
[01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:06.160]   tens of billions? No, no. Would it would have been a billion?
[01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:09.600]   No, no. Okay. You know, I was not like a super I was not a
[01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:13.600]   senior exec or anything. I think what you said is is probably
[01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:17.600]   true. So that's a creative. I think the other thing that's
[01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:22.560]   probably true is a big measure at Google on the search page in
[01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:25.360]   terms of search engine performance was the bounce back
[01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:28.240]   rate, meaning someone does a search, they go off to another
[01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:29.920]   site, and then they come back because they didn't get the
[01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:33.840]   answer they wanted. And then the one box launched, which shows a
[01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:37.200]   short answer on the top, which basically keeps people from
[01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:39.600]   having a bad search experience because they get the result
[01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:42.320]   right away. So a key metric is they're going to start to
[01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:48.000]   discover which vertical searches, meaning like a cooking
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:51.040]   recipes, that kind of stuff like referencing for travel, there's
[01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:53.920]   lots and lots of these different types of searches that will
[01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:57.680]   trigger a snippet or a one box that's powered by Gemini, that
[01:27:57.680 --> 01:28:00.560]   will provide the user a better experience than them jumping
[01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:03.680]   off to a third party page to get that same content. And then
[01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:06.800]   they'll be able to monetize that content that they otherwise
[01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:10.400]   were not participating in the monetization of. So I think the
[01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:13.680]   real victim in all this is that long tail of content on the
[01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:16.880]   internet, that probably gets cannibalized by the snippet one
[01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:20.080]   box experience within the search function. And then I do think
[01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:23.120]   that the revenue per search query in some of those
[01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:26.640]   categories actually has the potential to go up, not explain,
[01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:29.040]   explain, give me an example, you keep people on the page, you
[01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:33.600]   get more, more search volume. There, you get more searches
[01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:36.400]   because of the examples you gave. And then when people do
[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:39.520]   stay, you now have the ability to better monetize that
[01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:42.400]   particular search query, because you otherwise would have lost
[01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:45.520]   it to the third party content page. So for example, selling
[01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:47.360]   the steak knives is another is, you know, it's kind of a good
[01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:52.000]   example, or booking the travel directly, and so on. So by
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.880]   keeping more of the experience integrated, they can monetize
[01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:59.360]   the search per query higher. And they're going to have more
[01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:01.840]   queries. And then they're going to have the quality of the
[01:29:01.840 --> 01:29:05.440]   queries go up. So I think it's all in, there's a case to be
[01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:07.520]   made. I haven't done a spreadsheet analysis on this,
[01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:10.720]   but I guarantee you, going back to our earlier point about
[01:29:10.720 --> 01:29:13.760]   precision versus accuracy, my guess is there's a lot of hedge
[01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:17.280]   fund type folks doing a lot of this precision type analysis,
[01:29:17.280 --> 01:29:20.960]   trying to break apart search queries by vertical and try to
[01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:23.520]   figure out what the net effect will be of having better AI
[01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:26.160]   driven one box and snippets. And my guess is that's why
[01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:28.240]   there's a lot of buying activity happening in the stock right
[01:29:28.240 --> 01:29:30.800]   now. And I think they're probably all missing to most
[01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:36.000]   point, a lot of these call options like isomorphic labs, I
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:39.360]   can tell you meta and Amazon, what meta and Amazon do not
[01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:41.760]   have an isomorphic lab and Waymo sitting inside their
[01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:44.240]   business, that suddenly pops to a couple hundred billion of
[01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:47.520]   market cap. And Google does have a few of those. So so other
[01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:50.720]   bets actually pay off. These are maybe I look, I mean,
[01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:52.560]   there's Calico, no one talks about Calico. I don't know
[01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:55.040]   what's going on extension. Yeah, let me get sacks involved
[01:29:55.040 --> 01:29:58.720]   in discussion sacks. When we show that example, it's obvious.
[01:29:58.720 --> 01:30:02.320]   Google is telling you where they got these citations from
[01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:04.560]   and how they built their how to clean your couch, how to make
[01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:07.840]   your steak. Those they were in a very delicate balance with
[01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:11.040]   content creators over the past two decades, which is, hey,
[01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:13.760]   we're going to use a little bit of your content, but we're
[01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:17.600]   going to send you traffic. This is going to take away the need
[01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:20.160]   to send traffic to these places. They're going to benefit
[01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:23.280]   from it. To me, this is the mother of all class action
[01:30:23.280 --> 01:30:25.920]   lawsuits, because they're putting it right up there. Hey,
[01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:29.040]   we're using your content to make this answer. Here's the
[01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:31.280]   citations. We didn't get your permission to do this, but we're
[01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:34.720]   doing it anyway. What do you think is the resolution here?
[01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:38.160]   Does all these content go away because there's no model? Does
[01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:40.640]   Google try to make peace with the content creators and cut
[01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:43.600]   them in or license their data? What's going to happen to
[01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:46.880]   content creation when somebody like Google is just going to
[01:30:46.880 --> 01:30:50.000]   take wire cutter or these other sources that are not behind a
[01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.160]   paywall and just give you the goddamn answer?
[01:30:52.160 --> 01:30:55.280]   Well, look, this is the same conversation we've had two or
[01:30:55.280 --> 01:30:57.840]   three times where we're going to need the courts to figure out
[01:30:57.840 --> 01:31:00.960]   what fair use is. And depending on what they come up with, it
[01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:05.120]   may be the case that Google has to cut them in by licensing by
[01:31:05.120 --> 01:31:08.000]   doing licensing deals. We don't know the answer to that yet. By
[01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.960]   the way, I do know a founder who is already skating to where
[01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:15.200]   the puck is going and creating a rights marketplace so that
[01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:18.640]   content owners can license their AI rights to whoever wants to
[01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:21.440]   use them. I think that could be very interesting. I had a call
[01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:24.080]   with him yesterday and you and I will be on that cap table
[01:31:24.080 --> 01:31:27.280]   together once again. So I don't want to say who it is because
[01:31:27.280 --> 01:31:29.840]   we can't let him announce his own round, but I'm only
[01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:32.320]   participating in the seed round. Look, stepping back here.
[01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:35.280]   It's interesting. If you go back to the very beginning of
[01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:38.880]   Google, the OG Google search bar had two buttons on it, right?
[01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:42.560]   Search and I feel lucky. I feel lucky was just tell me the
[01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:45.840]   answer. Just take me to the best result. And no one ever did
[01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:49.120]   that, because it kind of sucked. Then they started inching
[01:31:49.120 --> 01:31:51.440]   towards with one box, but it wasn't you didn't get the one
[01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:55.680]   box very often. It's very clear now that Gemini powered one box
[01:31:55.680 --> 01:31:59.360]   is the future of Google search. People just want the answer. I
[01:31:59.360 --> 01:32:02.320]   think that this feature is going to eat the rest of Google
[01:32:02.320 --> 01:32:07.440]   search. Now, it's a little bit unclear what the financial
[01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:09.520]   impact of that will be. I think like you guys are saying,
[01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:11.840]   there'll be probably more searches because search gets
[01:32:11.840 --> 01:32:15.360]   more useful. There's fewer blue links to click on, but maybe
[01:32:15.360 --> 01:32:17.920]   they'll get, you know, compensated through those like
[01:32:17.920 --> 01:32:21.360]   relevant ads. Hard to say you're probably right, that Google
[01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:25.440]   ultimately benefits here. But let's not pretend this was a
[01:32:25.440 --> 01:32:28.160]   deliberate strategy on their point. They got dragged kicking
[01:32:28.160 --> 01:32:31.360]   and screaming into this by innovation of perplexing other
[01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:34.800]   companies. Yep, they had no idea they got caught completely
[01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:38.400]   flat footed. And they've now I guess caught up by copying
[01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:41.920]   perplexity and sexual perplexity. I think they're kind
[01:32:41.920 --> 01:32:45.680]   of screwed now unless they get over an acquisition deal. But
[01:32:45.680 --> 01:32:51.200]   perplexity came up with the idea of having citations in
[01:32:51.200 --> 01:32:54.320]   having a comprehensive search results. Yeah, which was
[01:32:54.320 --> 01:32:57.600]   something search result with citations and related questions.
[01:32:57.600 --> 01:33:00.560]   And right, they did extremely well. And quite frankly, all
[01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:03.680]   Google had to do was copy them. Now they've done that. And I
[01:33:03.680 --> 01:33:04.800]   think it does look like a killer.
[01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:08.080]   And by the way, this was all something that I saw 15 years
[01:33:08.080 --> 01:33:10.640]   ago, when I did Mahalo, which was my human powered search
[01:33:10.640 --> 01:33:14.160]   engine, and which I had copied or been inspired by neighbor
[01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:17.120]   and down in Korea, they were the first ones to do this, you
[01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:20.080]   know, it came up because there were only three or four markets
[01:33:20.080 --> 01:33:23.360]   where Google couldn't displace the number one, Korea, Russia,
[01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:28.480]   Japan, Russia had was a Russian search engine. God, I can't
[01:33:28.480 --> 01:33:33.120]   remember now. Japan had Yahoo Japan, which Masayoshi san had
[01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:35.600]   carved out and was never part of it. And they were loyal to
[01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:38.640]   that and very nationalistic. Koreans are very innovative
[01:33:38.640 --> 01:33:43.920]   folks at down. And neighbor just made search that was so
[01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:47.120]   amazing. You do a search and be like, here's music, here's
[01:33:47.120 --> 01:33:51.600]   images. Here's answers. Here's q&a. It was awesome. But you
[01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:53.760]   know, it just shows you like, you need to have a lot of
[01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:55.760]   wherewithal and timing is everything as an entrepreneur.
[01:33:55.760 --> 01:33:58.320]   My timing was 10 years too early in the wrong technology. I
[01:33:58.320 --> 01:34:00.960]   used humans, not AI, because AI didn't work 15 years ago.
[01:34:00.960 --> 01:34:05.360]   One thing I would say about big companies like a Google or
[01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:09.040]   Microsoft is that the power of your monopoly determines how
[01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:13.520]   many mistakes you get to make. So think about Microsoft
[01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:16.400]   completely missed iPhone, remember, and they like they
[01:34:16.400 --> 01:34:18.720]   screwed up the whole smartphone, mobile phone era,
[01:34:18.720 --> 01:34:21.920]   and it didn't matter. Didn't matter. Sasha comes in blows
[01:34:21.920 --> 01:34:24.640]   this thing up to a $3 trillion public company, same thing
[01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:27.360]   here with Google, they completely screwed up AI, they
[01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:30.640]   invented the transformer, completely missed LLM, then
[01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:33.760]   they had that fiasco, where, you know, they have George
[01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:36.960]   Washington, George Washington, doesn't matter. They can make
[01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:39.920]   10 mistakes, but their monopoly is so strong, that they can
[01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:42.880]   finally get it right by copying the innovator. And they're
[01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:45.360]   probably gonna become a $5 billion company now, sorry, $5
[01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:48.720]   trillion company reminds me, you know, the greatest product
[01:34:48.720 --> 01:34:53.200]   creation company in history. I think we all know who that was.
[01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:56.800]   And take a look down memory lane. Here are the 20 biggest
[01:34:56.800 --> 01:35:01.120]   failed Apple products of all time. The Apple Lisa, Macintosh
[01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:05.440]   portable, we all remember the Newton, which was their PDA, the
[01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:08.800]   20th anniversary, Macintosh, super sexy, people don't
[01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:10.640]   remember they had their own video game.
[01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:15.040]   I was at a conference a couple years ago, that Jeff Bezos
[01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:18.480]   spoke at, I think he's given this talk in a couple other
[01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:20.800]   places, you could probably find it on the internet. But he
[01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:24.800]   talks about Amazon's legacy of failure, and how they had the
[01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:28.400]   fire phone and the fire this and the fire that and he's like,
[01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:31.760]   our job is to fail big swings, we have to make these blunders.
[01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:34.640]   But what makes us successful is that we learn from the failures
[01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:37.040]   and, you know, we make the right next decision.
[01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:40.800]   Yeah, but if you're a startup, and you make big failures,
[01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:43.280]   usually it's got a business one and done. Yeah.
[01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:47.600]   But this is how you stay competitive. If you're a big
[01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:50.800]   founder led tech company, the only way you're going to have a
[01:35:50.800 --> 01:35:54.800]   shot at staying relevant is to take big shots that you're
[01:35:54.800 --> 01:35:59.680]   going to fail at. I just don't want you to do things that
[01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:01.760]   you're gonna fail at. Right? Remember this boombox is one of
[01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:04.400]   the huge difference between startups and big companies is
[01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:06.880]   that big companies can afford to have a portfolio of products,
[01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:09.440]   they have a portfolio of bets, some of them will work and that
[01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:12.160]   keeps the company going startup really has to go all in on their
[01:36:12.160 --> 01:36:15.360]   best idea. Totally. I always tell founders just go all in on
[01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:17.840]   your best idea. They're always asking me for permission to
[01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:22.160]   pivot. And I always tell them do go for the best idea. Don't
[01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:25.280]   don't hedge. Don't try to do five things at once. Just go all
[01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:28.960]   in on your best idea. Yeah. And if it doesn't work, you reboot
[01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:32.640]   and start with a new table. You're gonna go all in. So to
[01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:36.800]   speak another amazing episode is in the can the boys are in a
[01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:39.760]   good mood. You got your great episode. No guests this week.
[01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:45.760]   Just all bestie all the time. And very important. The march to
[01:36:45.760 --> 01:36:49.440]   a million continues halfway there. You got us there fans. We
[01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:54.800]   hit 500,000 subbies on YouTube, which means y'all earned a live
[01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:58.000]   q&a with your besties coming at you. In the next couple of
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:01.360]   weeks. We're going to do it live on YouTube. So if you're not one
[01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:03.680]   of the first 500 get in there now so you get the alert. We're
[01:37:03.680 --> 01:37:06.320]   going to take your questions live. It's going to be dangerous.
[01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:11.280]   Any questions? No questions. Who knows what could happen on a
[01:37:11.280 --> 01:37:13.520]   live show. And by the way, I just want to let you know that
[01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:17.040]   Phil Hellmuth breaking news Phil Hellmuth and Draymond Green
[01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:19.440]   just resigned from open AI. We didn't get into that. But the
[01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:22.880]   open AI resignations continue. Phil Hellmuth has tweeted he's
[01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:25.120]   no longer with open AI.
[01:37:25.120 --> 01:37:29.120]   You guys like my baby cashmere pink sweat.
[01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:32.240]   That's pretty great. We're gonna get summer Chamath soon.
[01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:35.760]   Are the buttons coming down? Are you gonna go linen? The linen
[01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:38.560]   Chamath show up. The unbuttoning is about to happen in the next
[01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:41.760]   great unbuttoning. This is how you know it's kind of like
[01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:45.360]   Groundhog Day. You know that summer's here. When you lose
[01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:49.600]   your buttons almost Memorial Day when after Memorial Day, the
[01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:52.720]   button can come down. Yeah, we're gonna go three buttons
[01:37:52.720 --> 01:37:56.560]   down. I'll still be wearing my black tee. Saks will still be
[01:37:56.560 --> 01:38:02.160]   blue blazer, blue shirt, red tie. And Freeberg in fields of
