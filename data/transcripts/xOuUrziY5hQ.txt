[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.520]   If you were to think about the major pillars of remaining healthy, especially when one
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:14.240]   is exposed to colds and flus from kids, in your case, also in the intensive care unit
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.980]   where people are coming in specifically because they're sick, often with infections like
[00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:25.180]   colds and flus or worse, you need to take specific precautions to avoid getting sick.
[00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.880]   What do you think of as the fundamental layer of keeping a healthy immune system to avoid
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:31.880]   getting sick?
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.640]   And then we'll talk about how to get over and move through being sick more quickly.
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.640]   Yes.
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.480]   Well, the question is, how do you avoid getting sick in terms of infectious diseases?
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.560]   And as it turns out, the answer to that is actually the same in terms of avoiding getting
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.320]   sick for anything.
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.000]   And it sort of goes to the pillars, as you call it.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   In my mind, there's actually a physician that I know very well, just outside of Stanford,
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.320]   actually, in a place called Weimar, Weimar University, Dr. Neil Nedley.
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.800]   And he's actually coined this mnemonic called "New Start."
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.560]   And each of those letters, to me, in my mind, is something that I go to when I want to improve
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.900]   health in people in general.
[00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.040]   So "N" starts for nutrition.
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:24.040]   We can talk about nutrition and what that does to the human body, obviously, as natural
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.480]   as possible, staying away from processed foods.
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.320]   That's something there.
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.200]   Exercise is "E."
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.840]   And when I'm talking about exercise, I'm talking about the understanding that we have regarding
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.800]   exercise, not to build muscle, necessarily be stronger.
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.100]   I'm talking about exercise in terms of health.
[00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.880]   And that has more of a J-hook type of picture.
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.840]   What I mean by J-hook is if you're not doing any exercise, you're going to have higher
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:50.840]   levels of inflammation.
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.560]   As soon as you start to do some exercise, even mild to moderate exercise, the amount
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.480]   of inflammation in your body starts to come down.
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.640]   But as you start to do more and more exercise, you do have to be careful in terms of your
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.640]   general health.
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.880]   This is exactly what happens with athletes.
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.820]   They have to be very careful that when they're doing that type of elite athletic exercise,
[00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.840]   that they're not sick on the day of performance.
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:15.840]   And so that's an issue.
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.440]   So I'm referring to just mild to moderate exercise is good.
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.640]   The next one would be "W," water.
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.240]   So this is something that's really interesting.
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.120]   Obviously, it seems pretty obvious.
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.180]   But not only the use of internal water, but external water.
[00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.360]   So in that area, we can talk about sauna, cold plunge, things of that nature that can
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.080]   actually help with our immune system.
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.840]   That's a whole interesting area of discussion.
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.480]   It involves the innate immune system.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.240]   It involves interferon.
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.880]   There's a lot of history and data that goes back over 100 years on how that's been used.
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.040]   "START," S-T-A-R-T.
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.080]   So S is sunlight.
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:58.040]   I've been a real proponent of getting people outside into the sun, and we can talk a lot
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.040]   about that.
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.700]   There's a lot of interesting research, not only in terms of sunlight, in terms of influenza,
[00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.280]   but also COVID, and just about any natural disease, a lot of interesting information
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.280]   there.
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.080]   "T," stands for the old term called "temperance," which you may recall is a term that we use
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.380]   to prevent us from taking in toxins into our body.
[00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.000]   That's a whole other discussion.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.320]   So staying away from things that would make you sick.
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.440]   "A" is air.
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.600]   And when I talk about air, it's not just what we focus on, which is keeping bad things out
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.600]   of the air.
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.600]   So having fresh air.
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:36.360]   But there's a whole discussion to be had in terms of air that has good qualities in it.
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.040]   So there's a whole area of research that looks at, for instance, phytoncides, which are chemicals
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.920]   that come off of trees.
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.440]   You may have heard of forest bathing.
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.360]   They've done a lot of research in Japan on this.
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.320]   And getting out into nature, there are actual chemicals that are in the air that you can
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.920]   breathe that actually have an impact on your innate immune system.
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.080]   Finally, "R," and we'll get into "R" and "T" at the end, "R" is rest.
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.880]   Now this goes without saying, but people who have good sleep habits are going to have much
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:10.080]   better immune systems, whether you're talking about the antibody response after a vaccine
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.840]   versus just the number of times per year you're sick.
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.840]   There's very good data, very good research that shows that getting seven, eight hours
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.920]   of sleep a night is going to be very beneficial for your immune system.
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.960]   It has to do with cortisol and beta receptors and all sorts of things.
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.680]   And the last "T," which is trust.
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.400]   And for some, it is trust in a higher power, trust in God.
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.080]   These are the sorts of things that can help us relieve stress.
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.160]   If someone else is helping you, if someone else is there, "T" would also include community,
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.460]   people that are around you.
[00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.240]   These are some of the less tangible ways of measuring it.
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.520]   But when someone asks me a question, "What can I do to avoid getting sick?"
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.840]   And as you just asked me in terms of influenza, there's a lot of specific things we can talk
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:06.600]   about, but that's where I start out with the pillars of health.
