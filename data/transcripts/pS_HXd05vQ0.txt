[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880]   So when I see the parents hand sanitizer on the tray and all of that, I don't know what's
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.540]   going on with that kid.
[00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.200]   That kid could have a very serious immune deficiency syndrome or some other reason, but most of
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.740]   the time it's a terrible idea because the kid is not catching Ebola from the tray.
[00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:22.720]   And what we have, what we clearly know now is that being too clean is worse than being
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:23.780]   dirty by far.
[00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:24.820]   Let them get dirty.
[00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:25.460]   It's great.
[00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:26.700]   Like a dog is a lot of work.
[00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.980]   So I'm not advocating for a dog if you don't have one, but there's studies that show that
[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.080]   households with children who have dogs, the kids end up on fewer antibiotics.
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.060]   They have fewer autoimmune diseases because a dog is bringing some dirt and some outdoors
[00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.960]   into your house.
