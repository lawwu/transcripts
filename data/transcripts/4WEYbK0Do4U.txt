[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.160]   If I go to sleep religiously every night at 10 p.m., are there things that I perhaps do
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.320]   in the preceding hours of the preceding day, like ingest caffeine or alcohol, that can
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.000]   make that first stage of sleep less effective even if I'm going to sleep at the same time?
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.520]   Alcohol definitely will do that because alcohol is a REM sleep suppressant and it even suppresses
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.800]   some of that stage two transition to REM with those sleep spindles.
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.720]   And those sleep spindles, we didn't talk about their function yet, but they're really important
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.120]   for moving memories to our cortex.
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.920]   It's a unique time when our hippocampus, sort of like the REM of our brains, writes it to
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.320]   a hard disk, which is the cortex.
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.560]   It's a unique time when they're connected.
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.640]   So if you don't want to miss that, you don't want to miss REM sleep, which is also a part
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.960]   of a consolidation process and schema-changing process.
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.720]   And alcohol, before we go to sleep, will do that.
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.760]   Until we've metabolized alcohol and put it out of our bodies, it will affect our sleep
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:04.760]   badly.
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:12.720]   So probably fair to say no ingestion of alcohol within the four to six hours preceding sleep,
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.720]   given the half-life.
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:14.720]   Given the half-life.
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.240]   Or it all would be better, but I know some people refuse to go that way.
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.920]   Maybe a little bit is okay.
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.080]   I don't know what the dose response is, but there are studies out there you can look at.
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.080]   Great.
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.360]   So we're still in the first stage of sleep, and I apologize for slowing us down, but it
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.060]   sounds like it's an incredibly important first phase of sleep.
[00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.000]   What about the second and third 90-minute blocks of sleep?
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.280]   Is there anything that makes those unique?
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.560]   What is their signature, besides the fact that they come second and third in the night?
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.560]   There's more and more REM sleep the later, the night we get.
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:56.160]   There's also a change in hormones, the growth hormone and melatonin levels are starting
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.360]   to decline, but other hormones are picking up.
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.180]   So it is a really different stage that you also don't want to shortchange yourself on.
[00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.080]   And I think that's the stage many studies are showing that those are the times in sleep
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.840]   when the most creativity can happen.
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.880]   That's when our dreams can incorporate and put together old and new things together into
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.040]   a new way, and our schema are built during that time.
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.720]   So yeah, we can change our minds best during those phases of sleep.
