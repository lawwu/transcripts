[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800]   It's Friday and here at Radical Personal Finance,
[00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.240]   that means Q&A.
[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.820]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:23.560]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast.
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.160]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.440]   Thank you for being with me.
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.440]   This is a show that's dedicated to providing you
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.400]   with the knowledge, skills, insight, and encouragement
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.600]   that you need to live a rich and meaningful life now
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.600]   while building a plan for financial freedom
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.300]   in 10 years or less.
[00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.460]   And today on Friday, we do Q&A.
[00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.800]   You ask questions, I do my best to give you good advice.
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.380]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:55.180]   These Friday call-in shows are done
[00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.400]   as a live conference phone line.
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.120]   I show up, I ask who's there,
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.600]   and then we see what we talk about.
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.040]   And then I release them as a podcast episode.
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.600]   If you would like to have your question or comment
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.720]   featured in a show like this, feel free to call in.
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.040]   First, if you are a patron at a certain level,
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.440]   make sure that you are keeping an eye on the Patreon page.
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.280]   You can find that at radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron.
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.000]   And if you're not a patron of the show,
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.520]   this is one of the benefits that you get
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.600]   for becoming a patron.
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.360]   You can become a patron at radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron.
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.920]   I've worked hard to try to keep this show
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.960]   listener-supported and grassroots
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.520]   to the biggest extent possible.
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.180]   But I've also tried to work it and figure out
[00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.720]   what are some of the benefits that I could offer
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.400]   that fit in well with the show.
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.080]   And I decided access to a Q&A call
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.160]   was one of the best solutions.
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.960]   So I would urge you, if you would like to have your call
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.280]   featured in a show like this,
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.240]   become a patron of the show
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.520]   at radicalpersonalfinance.com/patron.
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.680]   Welcome to the Q&A call.
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.520]   John, go ahead.
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.000]   How can I serve you today?
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   - First off, thank you very much, Joshua.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.840]   I appreciate your time.
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.120]   So the first question I wanted to throw at you
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.660]   was a question about taxable deductions.
[00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.240]   And in particular, the way in which we think about tax rates
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.160]   as being marginal tax rates and effective tax rates.
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.920]   But I don't think we necessarily approach tax deductions
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.440]   in the same way.
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.040]   And specifically, to put it into context,
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.160]   so married, filing, jointly,
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.080]   standard tax deduction of $12,600.
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.200]   When we talk about things
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.640]   like the home mortgage interest deduction,
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.320]   and people use the phrase as to,
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.440]   well, that's a tax deduction,
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.720]   save 25 cents on the dollar
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.040]   if you're in the 25% tax bracket.
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.640]   Albeit there is some truth to that,
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.600]   depending on how you approach it from a math standpoint.
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.600]   That $12,600 standard deduction is a big step to overcome
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:03.480]   in terms of really getting any effective benefit
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.780]   from further tax deductions,
[00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:12.240]   as opposed to considering it from a marginal perspective.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.720]   So I wanted to engage you in dialogue on that.
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.400]   - Yeah, I think you're absolutely right.
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.880]   It's the home mortgage interest deduction,
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.480]   I think is one of the most oversold deductions.
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.240]   Most people who have a house and who have a mortgage on it
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.480]   are quite happy with the fact that they have a mortgage
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.100]   because they are confident they can deduct the interest.
[00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.000]   But in practice, I think many fewer of them
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.220]   actually deduct the interest than they think.
[00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.800]   I can't pull the statistics to mind
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:46.760]   right off the top of my head,
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.640]   but many more people even who have a mortgage
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.760]   will simply use the standard deduction
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.040]   than the itemized mortgage interest deduction.
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.960]   It would be an interesting thing,
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.320]   I haven't done this recently, I did it in the past,
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.920]   but it's good to sit down and just calculate
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.000]   how big of a mortgage and what the interest rate
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.220]   would have to be on a certain size mortgage
[00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.860]   in order to have simply the mortgage interest deduction
[00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.680]   exceed the standard deduction.
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.300]   I think for many families who are buying modest houses,
[00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.240]   and especially in today's
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.360]   relatively low interest rate environment,
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:24.240]   where the actual interest paid on mortgages
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.460]   is somewhat modest,
[00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.440]   and also as you move through the amortization schedule
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.700]   of a mortgage and the actual interest that you're paid
[00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.360]   starts to decrease, I think many people find
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.720]   that the standard deduction is often in excess
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.440]   of the mortgage interest deduction.
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.860]   So I think your point is absolutely correct.
[00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.720]   We should pay attention to that and say,
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.400]   is this actually, I'm not sure what words we would use,
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.440]   but what's the marginal rate of this versus not?
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.940]   So I fully agree with your point.
[00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:03.560]   - So how do you think people approaching home ownership
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.120]   should take that into account,
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.120]   and/or what mindset should they approach that with?
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.360]   - Well, I think the best thing to do
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.200]   is to calculate the total cost,
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.400]   and most people don't do that.
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.720]   Hopefully listeners of this show
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.700]   have become a little bit more sophisticated
[00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.160]   so that they are actually calculating the total cost.
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.360]   But for example, if you look at the average
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.000]   principal, interest, taxes, and insurance payment,
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   the taxes and insurance are usually a hefty amount.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.400]   Most people don't take those into account as a pure cost.
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.720]   Then when you move to the interest,
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.360]   that also can be a hefty amount,
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.640]   and that also has to be taken into account as a pure cost.
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.920]   Your payment is not allowing you to build equity.
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.480]   So I think the best way to handle it is to unbundle it,
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.280]   unbundle the PITI payment,
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.480]   calculate what your actual principal deductions would be
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.480]   under a certain course of action,
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.680]   calculate the interest,
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.880]   and take a guess as to whether you'll be able
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.160]   to deduct it or not,
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.600]   and then calculate the other costs in.
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.020]   That's the best I've got,
[00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.320]   is just to simply actually look at the real numbers
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.200]   for a specific situation,
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.040]   and then to pay attention and be aware of the fact
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.080]   that as you said,
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.080]   the standard deduction is a sizable amount,
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:26.080]   and most people would need substantial itemized deductions
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.280]   in order to exceed it.
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.520]   Now, it's possible you might have other itemized deductions
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.560]   that are in addition to the mortgage interest,
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.120]   so you have to look at an individual situation.
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.040]   But just by breaking the numbers out
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.880]   and taking a look at it,
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.600]   you can make an accurate assessment.
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.840]   And then taking into account
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.600]   those other itemized deductions,
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:48.400]   whether it be charitable gifts or state or local taxes,
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.800]   that also raises the question as to,
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.320]   well, which one are you wanting to credit
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.960]   that I'm getting that marginal rate back on?
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.380]   I'm getting that 25 cents on my dollar.
[00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:07.360]   But hopefully for many people who are making charitable gifts
[00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:10.340]   they aren't doing that out of pure motivation.
[00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:11.380]   - Right, right.
[00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.300]   Yeah, I don't know how we would apply a formula to it.
[00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:15.460]   Your point is a good one,
[00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:19.260]   that we often treat the actual mechanics of it
[00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:20.300]   a little bit clumsier.
[00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:23.560]   We're good at talking about marginal and effective rates,
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.420]   but when it comes to actually the deduction,
[00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:27.700]   we kind of lump it all together.
[00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:29.620]   But because it's almost a cliff,
[00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:33.160]   it's almost a cliff where until you exceed
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.340]   that amount of itemized deductions,
[00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:36.900]   you get zero benefit,
[00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:39.600]   and then you get the full benefit at the marginal rate.
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.140]   I'm not sure how to talk about it.
[00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:44.580]   I'll put that one into the back of my mind
[00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:46.620]   and invite any listeners who can come up with a better term.
[00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:49.660]   Maybe we can coin here, maybe on the show here,
[00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:51.300]   we can coin a new way to refer to it
[00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:54.660]   to demonstrate the case.
[00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:57.420]   So you have more to say on that topic, John,
[00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:58.260]   or did you have another question?
[00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.460]   You said that was the first thing you wanted to talk about.
[00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:04.420]   - So it's changing gears a little bit,
[00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:07.020]   but still on the topic of taxes.
[00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:09.780]   I thought you might find it interesting of the experience
[00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:13.500]   which I had over the past few months of volunteering,
[00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:16.380]   doing low-income tax preparation work
[00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:19.900]   for folks in the Washington DC area
[00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.320]   through a local community organization.
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:27.140]   It was something that I was first introduced to
[00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:30.260]   as an opportunity through an announcement at my church.
[00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.420]   And the person making the announcement made a note that
[00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:38.260]   in a way doing tax preparation work for low-income personnel
[00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.500]   was more complicated than middle-income taxes,
[00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:44.980]   which I did find to be partially true.
[00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:47.740]   Just the way the credits work,
[00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:50.780]   the complexity of filing for some of those credits.
[00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.580]   But it was a really rewarding opportunity
[00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:56.780]   over the February to April timeframe
[00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:59.940]   of giving up a few hours on Saturday mornings
[00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.860]   to go do that volunteer work.
[00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:04.780]   - What was the two questions I'd love to hear from you?
[00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:09.780]   Number one, in working with the low-income population
[00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:11.500]   that you were serving,
[00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:15.060]   what did you find to be their general knowledge
[00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:16.940]   of even just the way the taxes work?
[00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:19.820]   Did you find them to be not at all knowledgeable,
[00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:21.420]   somewhat knowledgeable, very knowledgeable?
[00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:22.780]   What were your impressions?
[00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:29.100]   - Generally, I found them to be
[00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:32.620]   not very knowledgeable,
[00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:35.540]   though some had benchmarks as to
[00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:39.180]   what they were expecting relative to their
[00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:40.820]   tax returns from last year.
[00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:44.740]   I did have one person who,
[00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:46.420]   after we worked through his taxes,
[00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:49.100]   and then me being a volunteer,
[00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:53.780]   then had a more experienced reviewer check over the taxes.
[00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:56.060]   And when, after that was complete,
[00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:58.940]   we talked about what his returns were gonna be.
[00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:00.980]   He said that that wasn't enough,
[00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:03.780]   and he didn't want us to file his taxes.
[00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:07.020]   And he was gonna go off and consult H&R Block
[00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:10.860]   to try to achieve a higher tax return.
[00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:14.060]   So there was some experience as to,
[00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:16.700]   relative to what they knew before.
[00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.740]   And there was also some opportunities
[00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:22.820]   for people just learning pieces of information
[00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:24.620]   and/or hearing something.
[00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:27.020]   And one of the really rewarding stories
[00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:30.500]   was an elderly woman who received a mailing.
[00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:33.100]   I think it may have been through,
[00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:35.140]   that she received a mailing in a,
[00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:39.180]   mentioned about the Washington, D.C. property tax credit.
[00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:43.820]   And she had actually paid a accountant in Georgia
[00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:47.180]   to complete her federal and state tax returns.
[00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:50.540]   So she had already filed, but she received this mailing.
[00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:53.340]   And she consulted with us as to whether or not
[00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:56.900]   she may be eligible for some additional returns.
[00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:01.900]   And through the 2014, 2015 taxes,
[00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:04.100]   filing an amended return,
[00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:08.660]   she was able to get back nearly $2,500
[00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:11.860]   over those two years, predominantly for two things.
[00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:15.460]   One was the D.C. property tax credit,
[00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:17.820]   which is a credit for low-income folks,
[00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:21.500]   whether they be homeowners paying property taxes directly,
[00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:24.820]   or even renters in a calculation that is done
[00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:27.580]   as to a portion of their rental payment
[00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:30.380]   that would be equivalent of property taxes.
[00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:33.780]   And then second, the accountant failed to take into account
[00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:37.940]   her age and having the higher standard deduction
[00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:39.860]   for being elderly.
[00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:42.540]   So that was a pretty neat story
[00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:46.420]   that she was able to get that additional refund back.
[00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:48.740]   And we were able to help her in that regard.
[00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:50.140]   - That's really encouraging.
[00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:54.540]   - Not too much broad level of knowledge,
[00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:57.700]   but just some benchmarking.
[00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:01.700]   Some people came in with their previous year's tax return,
[00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:02.980]   some which were filed there
[00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:05.980]   at that same local volunteer site.
[00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:09.780]   - That's awesome, and that's encouraging
[00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:11.940]   when you can help situations like that lady you referred to.
[00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:15.820]   I mean, $2,500 can be very impactful
[00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:18.140]   for her to be able to do certain things
[00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:19.700]   that would be important to her.
[00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:21.860]   Do you recommend this to other people
[00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:24.620]   as far as it seems like it was a fulfilling area
[00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:26.100]   of volunteer service for you?
[00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:26.940]   Do you recommend it?
[00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:28.740]   And what type of training did you receive
[00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:30.020]   or would other listeners receive
[00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:32.460]   if they were to participate in this type of program?
[00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:34.860]   - I would recommend it.
[00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:38.420]   And I know other listeners of your show
[00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:40.300]   have the same interest as I do.
[00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:42.780]   Something like the tax preparation work
[00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:45.980]   is something we just find interesting
[00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:47.780]   to spend some time doing.
[00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:50.740]   So the fact that other listeners like me
[00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:53.300]   probably spend some time ourselves
[00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:56.300]   familiarizing ourselves and doing our own work,
[00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:58.620]   the ability to take those skills
[00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:02.060]   and help others is very rewarding.
[00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:04.580]   And I also found the clients that I worked with
[00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:09.220]   to be relatively patient and also gracious
[00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:14.260]   and thankful for the work that we did.
[00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:15.940]   Even when at certain times
[00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:19.260]   it did take a little bit long to work through the process.
[00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.500]   As I mentioned, one of the steps was having a reviewer
[00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:24.420]   come and check over my work.
[00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:29.100]   I was impressed at how patient
[00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:32.300]   and thankful most everyone was.
[00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:33.820]   In terms of the training,
[00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:37.700]   there was a organized training
[00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:42.700]   that I went to a local class
[00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:48.060]   and had three different training sessions to go through.
[00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:50.580]   One was a sort of introduction
[00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.780]   and overview of the tax code
[00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:56.340]   and talking about some of the detailed nuances
[00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:58.700]   such as their earned income credit,
[00:13:58.700 --> 00:13:59.780]   child tax credit,
[00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:02.180]   understanding some of those scenarios
[00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:03.980]   that apply in that regard.
[00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:05.700]   Then the second training session
[00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:09.020]   had to do with familiarizing ourselves
[00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:11.380]   with the software that was used.
[00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:15.500]   It wasn't like what you think of
[00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:19.900]   as a online walkthrough questions type software.
[00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:23.020]   It was more interfacing with the forms directly.
[00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:24.940]   Now, numbers would carry over,
[00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:26.700]   calculations would be done,
[00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:29.380]   but sometimes you have to know where to navigate
[00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:31.820]   in order to enter the information,
[00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:33.380]   link to different forms
[00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:38.380]   and make sure things were falling into the proper places.
[00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:42.340]   So there was the course that introduced you to that.
[00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.060]   And then the third course was
[00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:48.700]   actually going through the IRS exam.
[00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:52.300]   So the IRS has a exam where
[00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:56.500]   few of them were like short answer situation and questions.
[00:14:56.500 --> 00:15:00.580]   And then a few were preparing notional tax returns.
[00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:03.180]   And then a few questions from the tax return
[00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:06.060]   that you prepared to answer.
[00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:10.620]   There was also a little bit of home study
[00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:14.700]   in terms of a conduct and ethics course,
[00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:16.020]   just navigate through that
[00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:18.900]   and answer a few questions at home.
[00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:22.700]   So relatively speaking, on one hand,
[00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:24.780]   it didn't seem like all that much.
[00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:28.340]   So it wasn't a very extensive time commitment,
[00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:32.180]   but then there was also some on the job training, of course.
[00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:34.740]   And that's where the more experienced folks,
[00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:37.620]   including the reviewers and the site coordinator,
[00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:39.060]   who I worked under,
[00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:43.220]   were very helpful in addressing specific situations.
[00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:44.140]   - That's awesome.
[00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:45.660]   Thanks for sharing that with us, John.
[00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:49.340]   And I encourage other listeners to check it out.
[00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:51.300]   It could be helpful to others.
[00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:52.140]   Let's go on here.
[00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:54.500]   I've got a Missouri phone number on my screen here.
[00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:55.540]   Welcome to the call.
[00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:56.420]   Introduce yourself, please.
[00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:58.420]   And let me know how I can serve you today.
[00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:00.540]   - Oh, hi, Josh, this is Kishon.
[00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:04.300]   I was just checking in to see if you,
[00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:07.340]   I know you talked about this in a prior podcast
[00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:09.540]   about the infinite banking concept.
[00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:13.340]   You know, my ultimate thing is I wanna know what to do
[00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:16.620]   with some of my emergency cash and reserves,
[00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:19.220]   you know, the three to six months of cash
[00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:20.580]   I like to keep on hand,
[00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:24.420]   just in case of job issues and things to that such.
[00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:27.060]   And the infinite banking concept was introduced to me
[00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:29.580]   by one of my friends who's a life insurance agent
[00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:30.980]   and wanted to see your thoughts.
[00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:33.780]   And if you think that's a viable option,
[00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:38.140]   or would you go with something different like a CD ladder
[00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:41.620]   or using the home equity line to store that cash now
[00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:43.620]   in this negative carry environment?
[00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:45.260]   - Yeah, I'm comfortable with it.
[00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.660]   I've promised it on the show in the past
[00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:50.940]   and I haven't released my reviews of the books on it.
[00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:54.380]   I still intend to do it.
[00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:55.340]   I'm just a little intimidated
[00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:59.100]   by how to give it an accurate assessment.
[00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:01.660]   There are so many nuances and caveats
[00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:06.020]   and disclaimers that in many ways,
[00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:07.860]   it's difficult to navigate.
[00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:09.700]   'Cause I am not comfortable
[00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:12.700]   with a wholehearted endorsement of the concept,
[00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:14.700]   nor am I comfortable
[00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:17.260]   with a wholehearted denial of the concept.
[00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:20.220]   I think that either of those extremes
[00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:25.180]   is in my best present understanding, inaccurate.
[00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:27.300]   So rather than my talking in detail
[00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:29.740]   about the infinite banking concept in general,
[00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:31.420]   and for those listeners who aren't aware of it,
[00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:32.540]   to put it simply,
[00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:36.660]   the idea is by using a properly structured
[00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:40.260]   cash value rich permanent life insurance policy,
[00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.540]   you can avoid some taxation,
[00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:45.860]   enjoy a steady increase in the values of the contract
[00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:48.100]   and use it for various purchases
[00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:51.020]   and things that you would desire to do.
[00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:53.140]   So that's the basic of the infinite banking concept.
[00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:54.900]   Let me just stick to the question you said
[00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:58.300]   that you're asking about emergency fund cash.
[00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:01.940]   I think that a well-designed,
[00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:04.380]   properly funded whole life insurance policy
[00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:08.820]   can be a good option for some of your emergency fund cash.
[00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:10.300]   Now, I wouldn't,
[00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:13.260]   you mentioned three to six months of expenses.
[00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:14.180]   Let's say that,
[00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:17.140]   let's just stick with an example
[00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:19.380]   of a median household income.
[00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:20.860]   So around 45, 50,000 bucks.
[00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:22.620]   Let's assume that a family is spending
[00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.460]   about $4,000 a month,
[00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:25.900]   48,000 a year.
[00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:28.780]   So let's say monthly expenses are $4,000 a month.
[00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:31.500]   So with three to six months of expenses,
[00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:34.620]   we're talking about somebody having a target of saving
[00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:38.140]   in this scenario, 12 to $24,000.
[00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:42.180]   I would not pursue a life insurance policy
[00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:44.620]   for the purpose of saving $12,000.
[00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:46.300]   I think there's little benefit to it.
[00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:48.260]   I think there's a lot more benefit
[00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:51.980]   to just simply having the cash at hand.
[00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:53.460]   So the way that I would do it,
[00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:57.300]   if I were saving for a median household income
[00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:58.420]   of that amount,
[00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:01.100]   I would try to save a few thousand bucks
[00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:04.460]   in physical cash in a safe place
[00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:05.780]   that I could get my hands on it.
[00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:08.620]   And then I would just have a savings account
[00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:11.700]   funded with another five, 10,000 bucks.
[00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:16.620]   So 10 or $15,000 is,
[00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:18.840]   I don't see any reason to deal with the hassle
[00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:20.100]   of a life insurance policy
[00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:22.340]   because of some of the disadvantages,
[00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:24.300]   which I'll get to in a moment.
[00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:27.060]   In the case of just a small emergency of a few thousand
[00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:28.820]   dollars, I wouldn't wanna be going
[00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:31.820]   and being forced to take that first few thousand dollars
[00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:33.660]   in a life insurance policy.
[00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:35.900]   Now, when you get beyond those basic numbers,
[00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:37.900]   and I don't have a hard and fast cutoff,
[00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:41.100]   maybe it's 10,000, maybe it's 15,000,
[00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:43.300]   maybe it's 20,000, I don't know.
[00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:44.420]   But when you get beyond that,
[00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:46.500]   that's where I would start to consider it.
[00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:50.940]   The key disadvantage of life insurance policy
[00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:54.460]   is that when you take a loan against the policy,
[00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:56.580]   which is the most cost-effective way
[00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:59.660]   to access the cash values for a short-term need,
[00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:02.540]   you need to continue making premium payments.
[00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:07.540]   So the policy is able, if it's well-funded enough,
[00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:12.300]   it's able to make its premium payments
[00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:13.860]   out of its own cash values.
[00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:15.660]   But simply due to the fact that you've got
[00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:18.380]   this continual outlay of cash there that's needed,
[00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:19.740]   I wouldn't wanna pursue it
[00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:21.620]   for a small amount of money.
[00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:24.860]   What I think is a good perspective on it
[00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:29.860]   is for some of those other kind of deeper level savings,
[00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:34.260]   that is kind of the backup emergency fund type of approach.
[00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:39.060]   The reason, the major benefit of a well-constructed,
[00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:41.580]   permanent cash value life insurance policy
[00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:44.580]   is the stability of the cash.
[00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:47.940]   It will grow steadily and slowly.
[00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:51.740]   So when people are trying to compare it,
[00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:54.700]   you gotta recognize it's gonna grow slowly.
[00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:57.860]   Perhaps your real rate of returns,
[00:20:57.860 --> 00:20:59.780]   your cash on cash rates of return
[00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:02.780]   will be somewhere in the, depending on the policy,
[00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:06.100]   two, three, four, 5% in that range.
[00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:09.380]   So that's more attractive sometimes
[00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:11.540]   than other sources of stable cash,
[00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:13.460]   but it's not as attractive as investments.
[00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:16.860]   So I don't want all of my money subjected to market risk
[00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:18.980]   or to things that are gonna fluctuate.
[00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:22.060]   So I view cash value life insurance
[00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:25.920]   as kind of a component of that deeper level of savings.
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.860]   So that's what I do
[00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:31.060]   with my permanent cash value life insurance policies.
[00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:34.060]   I have emergency funds, ready cash on hand,
[00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:39.060]   cash that could easily be accessed
[00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:41.700]   in case of car broke, et cetera, things like that.
[00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:45.000]   And then I just think of the cash value life insurance
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.660]   as some of just the deeper emergency funds.
[00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:51.940]   I wouldn't see it as one versus another.
[00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:53.620]   If you can, for example, establish
[00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:55.520]   a home equity line of credit on your house
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:59.220]   with no cost or minimal cost to have access to it,
[00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:00.500]   that can be really useful.
[00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:05.260]   And you can use the life insurance cash value
[00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:08.100]   as a component of what you're doing.
[00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:10.980]   Once you have the cash values in the policy,
[00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:13.500]   you can use them in a few ways.
[00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:15.240]   You can always take money out.
[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:16.600]   You can take a loan against the policy,
[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:18.320]   but you can also use it as collateral
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:19.640]   for another form of financing.
[00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:22.200]   This is one of the under discussed aspects
[00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:23.900]   of life insurance.
[00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:27.520]   If you were going to look for a source of financing
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:29.720]   from a bank, sometimes you can go ahead
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:32.520]   and keep all of the money in your life insurance policy,
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:36.560]   but simply pledge it as collateral for another loan,
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:40.920]   as for a loan from a bank at a different interest rate.
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:42.440]   And then you get the best of both worlds.
[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:44.340]   The money continues to grow in the policy,
[00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:49.200]   and you are able to access cash on very favorable terms
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:51.260]   through the form of a loan from a bank.
[00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:53.400]   So there are some arbitrage opportunities.
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:55.400]   The major disadvantage of life insurance,
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:57.240]   and the final reason why I don't recommend it
[00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:59.040]   for the very short term savings, it just
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:01.200]   takes too long to get the money in there.
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:03.640]   So let's say that you establish a policy.
[00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:05.020]   You need to keep-- because you're
[00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:08.480]   going to be funding a policy for probably at least a decade,
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:10.360]   more likely a decade and a half or two,
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:13.720]   even for an aggressively constructed contract.
[00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:16.880]   You need to have it as a small enough portion
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:18.880]   of your monthly income that you can
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:21.640]   commit to the payments with little fear of having
[00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:23.040]   to discontinue them.
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:24.560]   Well, when you do that, it's going
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:26.080]   to take quite a while for the money
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:28.760]   to get built up into the policy.
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:31.960]   So hopefully, it's not going to take you a decade
[00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:33.880]   to save six months of expenses.
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:38.480]   So where I would recommend is start with just saving cash,
[00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:40.240]   building up an emergency fund.
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:43.600]   Once that's done, if you need life insurance,
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:46.040]   if you value having whole life insurance,
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.080]   don't buy life insurance just for the cash value.
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:52.400]   You must also value and benefit from the life insurance.
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:53.860]   It's always predominantly is going
[00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:55.800]   to be life insurance first.
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:59.440]   With the benefits of cash value attached,
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:00.760]   then you can start funding one.
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:01.880]   And it'll take a few years for it
[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:04.440]   to be funded to the level where it's even substantial.
[00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:08.760]   Is that clear enough?
[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:10.440]   Did I disagree with your insurance agent,
[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:12.280]   or did I agree with them?
[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:14.320]   Pretty much agree with them.
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:19.480]   Like I said, the IBC concept is sold by insurance agents.
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:23.760]   And they do have very aggressive structures
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:26.960]   for some of these IUL plans, where
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:31.120]   they can get you a high cash value early on if you decrease
[00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:34.160]   your death benefit and decrease some associated fees
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:36.960]   with the riders and things like that.
[00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:39.480]   And they use the term "riders" to kind of help
[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:42.040]   build that early cash value.
[00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:44.480]   So I kind of went through some of the scenarios with them.
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:49.720]   And it does seem attractive for easy access to some cash value
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:51.200]   and the added death benefit.
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:54.440]   But like you said, it has a lot of caveats.
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:57.640]   And I have to investigate a little further.
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:00.400]   Here's where I have to let individual agents look
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:03.640]   at an individual situation and let individual people kind
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:06.360]   of deal with their own stuff.
[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:08.600]   This is not an appropriate plan for people
[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:10.840]   who are novices at the financial market.
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:12.640]   There are a lot of ways to get hurt.
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:15.240]   And I think it can be useful for those
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:18.320]   who, I guess, have some experience
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:21.200]   and have done some research to be able to do it.
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.040]   But there are enough ways to get hurt.
[00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:24.540]   You've got to be careful, and you've
[00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:26.360]   got to make sure you know what you're doing.
[00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:28.800]   A couple of key points on what you described.
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:31.440]   Yes, you can heavily fund a policy
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.520]   over a short period of time.
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:37.840]   In general, due to the modified endowment contract rules,
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:41.060]   you're almost always going to be funding a policy.
[00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:44.580]   In order to retain the advantaged taxation,
[00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:47.280]   you're going to be funding a policy for at least seven years.
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:49.280]   And you're going to be funding it for two reasons.
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:50.880]   Number one, to fit those tax benefits.
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:56.440]   But also, if you get the ratio of insurance to premiums out
[00:25:56.440 --> 00:26:01.520]   of whack, it's not going to work from the basis of cash
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:05.360]   accumulation as well as it is if you have them more in line.
[00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:07.880]   Let's say that you've got--
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:09.760]   keep it simple just to illustrate the concept.
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:11.960]   Let's say you've got a million dollars of term riders
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:14.220]   on there, and you're just doing that so
[00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:16.360]   that you can fund the contract.
[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:18.640]   You're paying for all that term insurance.
[00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:20.960]   And if it's unnecessary, if you don't need or want
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:23.840]   the term insurance, you're letting the expenses get out
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:24.860]   of whack on the policy.
[00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:27.820]   So the policy should be designed appropriately.
[00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:30.040]   Now, it doesn't mean it can't be designed aggressively,
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:34.240]   where you're on a seven or 10-year plan
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:36.240]   to take it paid up, or however you're
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:38.760]   going to fund that individual contract.
[00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:42.880]   But it shouldn't be overly aggressive.
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:45.600]   Personally, when I used to design life insurance policies,
[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:50.400]   I always liked somewhere in the 10 to 15-year period
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:51.520]   for accumulation.
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:53.280]   I feel like that's a good amount of time.
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:57.160]   We're not necessarily planning on a 20- or 30-year plan.
[00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:58.880]   But 10 years is a good amount of time.
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:00.920]   And it would often work well in the contracts.
[00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:02.280]   But that's where the individual agent
[00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:04.440]   has to look at the situation, look at the contracts,
[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:07.040]   look at the company, and make a decision from there.
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:08.320]   So good question.
[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:09.600]   All right, I got more time.
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:10.640]   John or Kishon, would either of you
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:14.960]   like to ask another question before I close the call?
[00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:16.200]   No, I'm good right now, Josh.
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:17.120]   Thank you.
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:17.620]   Great.
[00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:19.800]   John, anything to add?
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:20.760]   Sure, Josh.
[00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:23.400]   So I know that you've been on spring break
[00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:24.760]   over the last couple of weeks.
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:27.760]   Can you tell us listeners a little bit more
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:29.360]   about how your spring break has gone
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:33.360]   and what we can expect here in the near future?
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:35.400]   Yeah, I was just--
[00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:36.160]   I needed a break.
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:38.440]   And I haven't really taken a break in a while.
[00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:40.440]   And I was getting to the point where
[00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:47.880]   I was approaching where I could see burnout ahead
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:49.120]   if I didn't adjust something.
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:51.920]   So I just decided to take some time off.
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:54.000]   The biggest challenge for me at this stage
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.720]   of radical personal finance has been to figure out,
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:58.840]   what am I doing, and how am I going to get it done?
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:03.520]   I know what I'm doing, but the challenges of getting it done
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:05.080]   have been really, really challenging.
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:07.520]   And the business is kind of in that little dip
[00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:11.720]   where I need help, and I have to expand the help.
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:13.600]   But I'm the bottleneck in the process,
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:16.040]   my own skills and abilities.
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:18.160]   So I spent some time just thinking.
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:19.960]   And I didn't go anywhere, travel anywhere.
[00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:20.540]   I just stayed at home.
[00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:21.920]   Also worked on some home projects
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:23.120]   that I had been ignoring.
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:26.680]   But I just tried to spend some time thinking and clarifying
[00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:29.840]   what am I actually trying to do, what's the vision for it.
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:31.520]   A lot of that was just even considering
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:32.840]   the format of the show.
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:36.080]   If I were-- I don't quite want to go
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:38.600]   into all the details of it, but just
[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:40.360]   as far as my decisions and the balance,
[00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:42.240]   I'll talk about that stuff in the future.
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:44.320]   But I had to give some serious thought to the way
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:47.040]   that I'm doing the show and what I'm actually doing it for,
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:50.000]   and how it's all going to work, what my monetization plans are,
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.080]   what are the products that I'm building and things,
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:53.840]   how am I going to get that stuff done.
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:58.960]   So I have definitely settled into a much better approach
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:28:59.460]   to it.
[00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:03.480]   I have a clearer vision now after the fact.
[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:06.560]   But I have plenty of work yet to do toward it.
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:07.360]   So I feel good.
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:11.360]   I've been able to adjust the way that I was doing some things,
[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:13.560]   get a little bit more organized.
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:16.960]   Launching a startup, I've never ridden a bull,
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:19.160]   but I've got to imagine that's kind of what it's like, where
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:21.800]   you're always kind of right on the edge of getting tossed off.
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:27.680]   And it's always a challenge, because what I often want to do
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:31.280]   is pull back and get organized and get efficient
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:32.320]   and get everything done.
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:34.120]   I don't like having stuff undone.
[00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:39.120]   But with most entrepreneurial endeavors, if you do that,
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:41.080]   you lose your momentum and you lose the inertia.
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:43.160]   You lose what got you here.
[00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:47.580]   So I'm making progress, but it was a good chance
[00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:50.560]   to have a little break and figure out
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:52.120]   what the future looks like.
[00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:53.320]   Still working on it.
[00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:55.680]   I don't have everything perfectly figured out,
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:58.960]   but I did settle some big questions in my mind.
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:02.240]   Good.
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:04.080]   I'm glad to hear that you had that time off
[00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:06.880]   and hope it was a rewarding time for you and your family.
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:09.440]   And thank you for what you continue to do for us.
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:10.520]   Appreciate it.
[00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:12.280]   Gentlemen, thank you for calling in.
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:13.640]   I appreciate hearing from you.
