[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800]   that there is no one right way to invest.
[00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.480]   Investing is so personal,
[00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.400]   and the right strategy depends on your situation,
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.600]   your risk tolerance, your long-term objectives,
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.480]   and a lot more.
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.920]   I sat down with Tad Fallows,
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.880]   who started this group called Long Angle,
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.640]   which is a private network for high-net-worth investors,
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.480]   and I got to attend their summit.
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.100]   We talked about the 10 lessons
[00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.560]   we took away from the conference,
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.040]   and it was so interesting that,
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.580]   despite that there were so many people,
[00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.700]   so smart, focused on investing,
[00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.080]   there was no one right answer.
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.300]   And even in the sessions
[00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.380]   where different types of alternative investments
[00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:33.720]   were being presented and shared,
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.200]   there was no perfect answer between those either,
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.080]   and it wasn't just that diversification was the only answer.
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.720]   It depended on how important liquidity was to you,
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.560]   how much risk you wanted to take on,
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.120]   how interested you were in exploring the topic,
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.520]   because some types of investments
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.640]   take a lot of time and energy and education.
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.600]   That was one really big takeaway for me,
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.600]   because I think I've always been hearing,
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.440]   "Oh, real estate's amazing, let's chase that.
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.920]   "Oh, this is awesome, private credit, angel investing."
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.400]   And you could chase that strategy
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.920]   of trying to find the best thing,
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.760]   but the reality is everyone is different,
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.280]   everyone has different ideas.
