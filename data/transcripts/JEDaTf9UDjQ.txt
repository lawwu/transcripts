[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640]   I should like to call your attention this evening to the first two verses in the seventh
[00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.040]   chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:16.720]   The book of the Acts of the Apostles, chapter 7, reading again the first two verses.
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.640]   Then said the high priest, "Are these things so?"
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:29.600]   And he, Stephen, said, "Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken!
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:38.720]   The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.040]   he dwelt in Canaan."
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.840]   Now these are the opening remarks, as you will have realized from the reading at the
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:55.360]   beginning of this great sermon, as we may well describe it, or statement that was made
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:04.080]   by Stephen, one of the men who had been appointed by the apostles, as we are told in the previous
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:13.320]   chapter, to look after the administration of alms and of kindness to the widows of the
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.160]   congregation of the early Christian church.
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.200]   Now it's a most important statement, this.
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.680]   It's a longish sermon.
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:32.440]   It is indeed the first account which we have in this book of the Acts of an extended sermon.
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.240]   We've had references, as those who gather here regularly will recall, in our study of
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.240]   the previous six chapters.
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:48.040]   We've already had several synopses of sermons delivered by especially the apostle Peter,
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:54.240]   and statements made by Peter and others when they were on trial before this great court,
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.520]   this Sanhedrin in Jerusalem.
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.200]   But all the previous examples have been very abbreviated.
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:08.280]   They've been obviously just summaries of the essence of what was said by the different
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.280]   speakers.
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:19.160]   But here we have this reported sermon in extenso, as it were, quite a long statement.
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.680]   And as it is the first example of this in the book of the Acts of the Apostles, it is
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:30.560]   obvious that it is something that is of unusual significance for us.
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:37.560]   Now you remember that this statement was made by Stephen in reply to the invitation extended
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.320]   to him by the high priest who was presiding over the council.
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.080]   You remember we read that portion from the previous chapter in which we are told that
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.160]   Stephen, this man Stephen, who had been made a deacon in this way, this man full of faith
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.560]   and of power, did great wonders and miracles among the people.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.200]   But because he had done that, because he'd done good, because he'd done acts of kindness,
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.440]   because he'd worked miracles, certain people rose up against him and brought these false
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.360]   charges against him.
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:16.800]   So Stephen finds himself on trial for his life before this great council at Jerusalem
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.600]   which is called the Sanhedrin.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:25.520]   Now if we are to follow his sermon, it is obvious that we should be clear as to what
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.800]   he was setting out to do.
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.720]   And what he was doing was to reply to the charges that had been brought against him.
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.800]   And therefore we must be perfectly clear as to what those charges were.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.520]   And we can summarise them there put before us there in chapter 6.
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.640]   He was charged with blasphemy.
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.060]   He was charged with being opposed to the law of Moses.
[00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.840]   He was charged with being opposed to the temple and the temple worship.
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:00.040]   And in addition, he was charged with being a follower of Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.040]   This is it.
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.640]   We have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and shall change the
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.080]   customs which Moses delivered us.
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.800]   He was charged, in other words, finally, with being a Christian, with being a follower of
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:22.680]   the Lord Jesus Christ and all that that involved and all that was implied in that.
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.920]   Now Stephen's statement, this sermon, was delivered by way of reply.
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.600]   The high priest presiding says, "Are these things so?"
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:39.640]   So Stephen gets up and he begins, "Men, brethren, fathers, hearken.
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:44.760]   The God of glory appeared unto our father Abram when he was in Mesopotamia before he
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.080]   dwelt in Cairn."
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:53.280]   And on he goes, giving this long historical review which runs on until about the end of
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.480]   the fiftieth verse.
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.440]   Then comes the application of the sermon.
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.480]   Now I want to consider this with you.
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.400]   Why are we doing so?
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.480]   Well, we are not doing so simply because we are animated by some mere historical or antiquarian
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.480]   interest.
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:14.440]   The days in which we are living are too desperate and too urgent to allow us to do anything
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.440]   like that.
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.920]   That is interesting, of course, in and of itself.
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:22.880]   But I can assure you that I am calling your attention to it not for that reason, but rather
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.320]   for this reason.
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:30.720]   I am calling attention to this because of the state of the world in which we live, because
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:37.920]   of the relevance of this message to our very condition and position at this present moment.
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:44.960]   We are in a world of trouble, in a world of confusion, in a world of sin, in a world of
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.560]   shame.
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.840]   Nobody will dispute that.
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.040]   The world is in great trouble.
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:54.280]   And not only is the world in trouble, individually we are all in trouble.
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.840]   We have got problems, we have got difficulties.
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:57.840]   That is why we are here.
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.880]   We would not be here but for that.
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:08.400]   Very well, it is our contention that there is only one message that can deal with this
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.000]   situation and that is this Christian gospel.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.440]   That is the business of the Church, to preach this gospel.
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.960]   It is good news.
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.000]   We are called, we are commissioned to preach good news to the world.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.760]   That is how it is put everywhere.
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.260]   It is called the gospel, meaning good news.
[00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.680]   These four accounts of the Lord Jesus Christ, they are called gospel.
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.280]   It is the most wonderful good news that has ever come into the world.
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:39.440]   You remember at his very birth the angels were to be heard singing and saying, "Glory
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.280]   to God in the highest and on earth, peace, goodwill amongst men."
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:49.560]   This is the most wonderful and the most amazing good news that has ever come to the human
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:50.560]   race.
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:56.480]   But here is the tragedy, and we are aware of it, that the world refuses this.
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:03.480]   The world rejects it, even in its trouble, even in its misery, even in its unhappiness.
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:06.040]   It turns against it, it will have nothing to do with it.
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:09.240]   And it does so with scorn and with derision.
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:15.640]   Can't you see the world is still doing to this message and to this blessed person, the
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:21.640]   Son of God, the very self-same thing that the members of that council, the Sanhedrin
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:25.640]   in Jerusalem were doing 1,900 years ago and more.
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.680]   It is exactly the same thing.
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:32.160]   Now that is my reason for calling attention to it.
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.760]   The world is rejecting the gospel now.
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:40.040]   The world, as represented by these good people, was doing it then.
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:46.200]   And I want to try to show you that the reasons for rejecting the gospel are still precisely
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:51.880]   the same as we shall find indicated and recorded here.
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:56.440]   Now that is my sole reason for calling your attention to this.
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:02.360]   We all by nature find it very much easier to grasp a teaching or a point of view when
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:05.640]   we see it illustrated in somebody else.
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.720]   The Bible has got many stories to show that.
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:11.800]   There is a famous story about David who had committed a terrible sin and couldn't see
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.880]   that there was anything wrong at all.
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:20.360]   Other people could see it, so the prophet went to him and made up a story, depicting
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:25.480]   and indicating the kind of thing that David had done, but in an entirely different context.
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:30.840]   David as king was filled with righteous indignation and wrath, and said that a person doing such
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:35.160]   a thing was worthy of severe punishment.
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:38.360]   Then the prophet looked at him and said, "Thou art the man."
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:40.400]   And David saw it.
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.160]   We are always tending to protect ourselves.
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:46.200]   We can see wrong things in others when we can't see them in ourselves.
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:51.480]   So it's a very good thing always to look at what is true of us by nature as we see
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.160]   it depicted in somebody else.
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:59.200]   And as we see it there, then it's possible that it can be applied to ourselves.
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:05.280]   Well I'm simply wanting to show you that the attitude of these members of the Sanhedrin
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:12.240]   to the message of Philip and the apostles is exactly the same as the attitude of so
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:19.240]   many men and women at this present time to the only message that really can deal with
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:22.320]   their problems and with their situation.
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:26.680]   Now then, what was the trouble with these members of the Sanhedrin?
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:27.680]   Let's have a look at them.
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.720]   Let's analyze the position.
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:31.000]   We've got to do this.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.840]   We won't be able to understand the point of Stephen's message, Stephen's address, Stephen's
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:36.840]   sermon.
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:42.880]   We shan't be able to understand the point he's making, why he did what he did, unless
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:46.600]   we can see exactly what their condition was.
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:50.800]   Well I can sum up their position by putting it like this.
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.520]   They were prejudiced.
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:57.840]   They really had never given the gospel a fair listening, a fair chance.
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:58.840]   They were prejudiced.
[00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:01.800]   They were blinded by prejudice.
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:07.520]   And they were blinded by prejudice because they had a completely false notion and idea
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:11.040]   as to what constitutes true religion.
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:15.760]   Now remember, these were highly religious people, yet they reject the gospel.
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:16.760]   Why?
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:20.380]   Well, because their whole notion of religion was wrong.
[00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:25.480]   It was that that was blinding them, as it blinded all the Pharisees who were so constantly
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:30.480]   contending with our Lord to his great and wonderful message.
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.240]   Now this comes out in many ways.
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:37.760]   I've already reminded you that here they've arrested a man and put a man on trial who
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:43.200]   not only had done no harm to anybody at all, but was doing great good, doing wonderful
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:48.280]   deeds of kindness, performing miracles, which they couldn't do.
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:49.640]   That's why they arrested him.
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:54.600]   Then you notice how they trump up false charges against him.
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:57.040]   You notice the lies that they introduce.
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:03.440]   They'll go to any length or to any extreme in order to charge and to convict these men.
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:07.080]   And you notice above all the spirit of bitterness which they display.
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:12.140]   And as we go on, that becomes more and more clear.
[00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:17.040]   We read of them later on when they heard these things, they were cut to the heart and they
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:20.240]   gnashed on him with their teeth.
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:23.620]   You see, this is just a few.
[00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:29.520]   People like to think that the objection to the gospel is always based on some calm, detached,
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.520]   cool, quiet, scientific reasoning.
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:33.520]   Never.
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.120]   It's never true.
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:41.360]   It's always a matter of prejudice and of passion and of feeling and of anger and it shows itself
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:42.360]   in contempt.
[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:44.640]   We are familiar with all this today.
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:48.160]   People you see not merely reject the gospel, they're bound to do so with contempt.
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.120]   They regard it with disdain.
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:55.320]   It's regarded as an insult to the modern intellectual, scientific, sophisticated men that he should
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:59.680]   be asked even to believe such an old story, an old gospel.
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.920]   The thing well is beneath contempt.
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:02.920]   That's the modern...
[00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:05.040]   Well, but it was the attitude in the first century.
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:11.520]   You see, here I say we are given a very perfect account and description of the reasons why
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:15.440]   mankind has been rejecting this gospel from the very beginning.
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:17.240]   I say this just in passing.
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:18.520]   I hope I've made this clear.
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:21.600]   There's nothing new about rejecting the gospel.
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:26.040]   If you thought you were doing something new and up to date by rejecting the gospel, well,
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.840]   I'm sorry, but it's just based on ignorance.
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:34.160]   They did it from the very beginning as we see here and as we've seen in previous instances.
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:39.560]   But there are certain very special features brought out here and these are the things
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.640]   I want to emphasize.
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:48.600]   Stephen's sermon, as you know, and I do beg of you to read it when you go home tonight
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:52.960]   in order that we may have the background in our minds as we go on Sunday after Sunday
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:53.960]   continuing it.
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:57.000]   And if there's somebody here who can't be here, you read it as well.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.400]   And notice the order and the arrangement.
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:03.080]   Now I'll tell you why he did order it and arrange it like that.
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:06.160]   He's dealing with a specific position.
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.160]   And what is it?
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.680]   Well, it is this.
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:13.280]   Why were these people prejudiced against the gospel?
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:15.200]   Why were they so annoyed with it?
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.000]   Why did they arrest these men?
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.320]   And why did they eventually stone him, put him to death by stoning him?
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:26.800]   Well, the first answer is, you see, that they were quite satisfied that they were all right
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:29.560]   as they were.
[00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:32.280]   There was nothing wrong with them.
[00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:34.740]   They were living a good life.
[00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:36.240]   They were religious people.
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:39.000]   They worshipped God.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:45.400]   But here is a suggestion in this man's preaching and teaching, as was true of all the apostles,
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:51.000]   that they were not all right, that there was something wrong with them, that they needed
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:57.200]   to believe in this new person, Jesus of Nazareth, and his message.
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:03.200]   That was the thing that infuriated them, this suggestion that they needed anything.
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:04.200]   Why?
[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:05.200]   They were the leaders of the people.
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:08.220]   They were the religious people.
[00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:09.240]   They were all right.
[00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:11.680]   Of course, there were people who were publicans and sinners.
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.320]   They were wrong, of course, but not these.
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:15.320]   These were moral.
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.320]   These were religious.
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:17.320]   These were good.
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:23.280]   But here comes a teaching that suggests that they're in great need themselves, and that
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:29.160]   there is only this one person who can satisfy their needs and give them what they desire.
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:32.680]   Now this is the thing that they resent.
[00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:38.260]   The same people, of course, had been doing it with our blessed Lord himself.
[00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:41.220]   Go back and read those four Gospels.
[00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:44.540]   Go back and read them as if you'd never read them in your life before.
[00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:46.660]   It's a good thing to do periodically.
[00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:49.100]   Just take it as if you'd never read this in your life.
[00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:53.620]   Here you see the account of the birth of this extraordinary person, this man at the age
[00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:59.540]   of 30, who'd been a carpenter, born in great poverty and humble circumstances and so on.
[00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:03.860]   Suddenly at the age of 30, he goes out and preaches in an astounding manner and works
[00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:08.540]   miracles and does good, and gathers a great crowd of people around him.
[00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:14.780]   Now why was it that the Pharisees and scribes and the doctors of the law dealt with him
[00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:15.780]   as they did?
[00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:18.460]   Have you ever faced that problem?
[00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:20.600]   What was it that could have caused it?
[00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:23.100]   He went about doing good.
[00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:26.620]   He was the essence, the incarnation of God's love.
[00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:32.180]   And yet, they argued with him, they tried to trap him in his conversation, they conspired
[00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:37.540]   against him, eventually they got rid of him by the cruel death of crucifixion.
[00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:39.140]   What made them do it?
[00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:40.140]   That's the question.
[00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:44.220]   And I say the answer is this.
[00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:47.420]   His preaching condemned them.
[00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:50.300]   They saw the implication of his preaching.
[00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:54.900]   They saw that they who thought themselves to be all right and were self-satisfied and
[00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:59.340]   perfect, they were convicted that there was something wrong about them.
[00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:04.020]   And so they constantly turned to him and said things like this to him, "We are Abraham's
[00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:05.020]   seed."
[00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:07.220]   And were never in bondage to any men.
[00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:10.300]   "How sayest thou, 'Ye shall be made free?'"
[00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:13.300]   Now this is, there's something almost ludicrous about it, isn't it?
[00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:14.300]   But it's true history.
[00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:19.460]   Our Lord was preaching on that occasion, and he said to these people, "If ye continue in
[00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:26.020]   my word, then shall ye be my disciples indeed, and ye shall know the truth, and the truth
[00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:27.020]   shall make you free."
[00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:30.740]   Well, you'd have thought that everybody would be delighted with that.
[00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:33.780]   Here's a message promising to set us free.
[00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:35.380]   But they were furious with that.
[00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:40.180]   They said, "We be Abraham's seed, and we're never in bondage to any men.
[00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:44.380]   How sayest thou, 'Ye shall be made free?'"
[00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:46.420]   You see, they saw the implication.
[00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:51.580]   When he promises to set them free, they see that the implication is that as they are,
[00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:52.900]   they're in bondage.
[00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:55.140]   And they couldn't stand that.
[00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:56.860]   That's the thing they resented.
[00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:58.820]   That is the thing that they hated.
[00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:03.140]   This suggestion that there was anything wrong with them, and that they needed what he alone
[00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:04.140]   could give.
[00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:05.380]   They hated him for that.
[00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:11.140]   They saw the same thing in the preaching of Stephen, and in the preaching of the apostles.
[00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:13.940]   But there's a second thing.
[00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:17.660]   And this is the most interesting thing.
[00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:25.220]   These people really failed to understand the true meaning of what they claimed to believe
[00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:26.220]   in.
[00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:30.220]   Now, I want to make this particularly clear.
[00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:32.420]   You know people with a tradition.
[00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:33.980]   They've got a background.
[00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:36.660]   They've got a history.
[00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:40.900]   And they think that this is all that is necessary, and they're very proud of it.
[00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:48.860]   Now you see that Stephen convicts them of a complete failure to understand even themselves
[00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:52.500]   what they claim to believe, and their own story.
[00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:57.740]   There's something almost incredible about this, but I'm emphasizing it because I'm trying
[00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:03.820]   to show that as I see things that inherit, this is perhaps still the greatest obstacle
[00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:10.700]   of all, which stands between many, many people in becoming Christian.
[00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:13.620]   Let me show you what I mean.
[00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:15.820]   Here are these people, Jews.
[00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:18.540]   They're very proud of their history.
[00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:24.140]   They're very proud of their father Abraham, and their descent from Abraham, the fathers.
[00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:29.140]   They were always talking about the fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and of Jacob.
[00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:32.020]   As I've reminded you, that's the thing they said to our Lord.
[00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:33.020]   We be Abraham's seed.
[00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:38.220]   They said it's all very well for you to preach as you're preaching, if you're preaching to
[00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:42.860]   some outsiders, some pagans or people like that, but don't you realize we are the Jews?
[00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:49.660]   The Jews were a very proud people, proud of their history, proud especially of their ancestry,
[00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:54.300]   because they were of the seed of Abraham.
[00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:58.060]   But they'd got a completely wrong view of that, and that's the thing that Stephen now
[00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:02.740]   proceeds to show them by reminding them of their own history.
[00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:06.500]   They've misunderstood their own history.
[00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:08.980]   Stephen is doing nothing original.
[00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:13.300]   Our Lord, as I've told you, had done exactly the same thing.
[00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:17.860]   He'd said to them, "If you were the true children of Abraham, you wouldn't be treating me as
[00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:20.740]   you are treating me.
[00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:22.620]   Abraham rejoiced to see my day.
[00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:23.980]   There's something wrong with you.
[00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:27.380]   You've somewhere misunderstood your relationship to Abraham.
[00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:29.340]   You're wrong about your own history."
[00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:32.180]   Abraham didn't do things like that.
[00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:38.700]   But John the Baptist, even before our Lord, he had made this self-same point.
[00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:46.460]   You remember John was there living out in the wilderness, living that abstemious life,
[00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:52.640]   that rigorous life, clothed with camel hair shirt and a leather girdle, eating nothing
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:58.220]   but locusts and wild honey, this flaming, blazing prophet in the wilderness, and the
[00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:02.940]   people crowded out to listen to him, and amongst them went these Pharisees.
[00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:09.740]   And they were listening, and John turned about upon them and said, "Who hath warned you to
[00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:12.820]   flee from the wrath to come?"
[00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:17.700]   And then, you see, they've got this idea that they're Abraham's seed.
[00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:22.620]   John looks at them and said, "Don't you know that God is able of these stones to raise
[00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:25.180]   up children to Abraham?
[00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:33.180]   Mean not to say in your hearts, 'We be Abraham's seed,' for God is able of these stones to
[00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:35.340]   raise up children unto Abraham."
[00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:37.620]   Now it's exactly the same point.
[00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:44.700]   You see, they were relying upon the fact that they were lineal descendants, physical descendants,
[00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:47.860]   from Abraham, that they were Jews.
[00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:51.740]   And this was the very essence of their trouble.
[00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:56.380]   They were misunderstanding their own history because they were regarding it in a purely
[00:20:56.380 --> 00:21:01.380]   nationalistic and in a purely political manner.
[00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:08.660]   They'd never understood the spiritual character of themselves as a nation.
[00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:13.780]   And thus they'd really missed the real significance of the whole of their history.
[00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:18.300]   The Apostle Paul, writing later to the Romans, has to make exactly the same point.
[00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:23.500]   He says, "They are not all Israel who are of Israel."
[00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:25.260]   You see, here was the trouble.
[00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:30.340]   If you could prove, tracing back your genealogical table, that you were a descendant of Abraham,
[00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:31.340]   you were all right.
[00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:33.020]   That was the one thing that mattered.
[00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:34.660]   That solved all your problems.
[00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:35.940]   That put you right with God.
[00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:39.540]   It made you a superior person in this life and in this world.
[00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:42.380]   This was the way that they were using it and interpreting it.
[00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:45.940]   As long as you were a physical descendant of Abraham, all was well.
[00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:50.860]   As long as you belong to Israel, as long as you can claim Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as
[00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:54.100]   the fathers, you are in a perfectly happy position.
[00:21:54.100 --> 00:22:00.860]   "No," says Paul, "they are not all Israel that are of Israel."
[00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:06.300]   You can belong to this nation physically, but you can be outside it in the real sense,
[00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:07.860]   the spiritual sense.
[00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:12.760]   That's exactly the point that we shall find Stephen is making.
[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:15.460]   But you see, we've got to grasp this.
[00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:20.260]   Then the second thing that he points out about them is this, this complete failure to understand
[00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:22.260]   even what they claim to believe.
[00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:27.940]   Not only are they wrong about their own history and their understanding of that history, their
[00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:34.060]   attitude to the temple and the temple worship was equally wrong, equally mistaken.
[00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:39.620]   Here again, they're very proud of this, proud of the temple.
[00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:45.060]   This was the place to worship, and one really couldn't worship anywhere else.
[00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:46.700]   They despised everybody else.
[00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:47.700]   How could they worship?
[00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:49.180]   They hadn't got the temple.
[00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:54.140]   In Jerusalem, here's the place to worship, the temple and Jerusalem.
[00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:55.500]   And they gloried in this.
[00:22:55.500 --> 00:23:02.700]   You'll find as you read the sermon that Stephen takes up this point and elaborates it, and
[00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:09.540]   he makes a big thing of this, as he's bound to do, because he saw it was of the very essence
[00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:10.700]   of their difficulty.
[00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:17.100]   One of the main reasons why they were rejecting the teaching of his blessed Lord and Savior.
[00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:22.300]   They you see, had developed this mechanical notion of worshipping.
[00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:26.940]   As long as you went to your temple regularly, as long as you took your offerings as they
[00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:31.460]   were prescribed, all was well, you needed nothing further.
[00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:34.420]   And they were living on this, they were relying upon this.
[00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:40.660]   The temple, they kept on saying, the temple, the temple of the Lord, our blessed Lord himself
[00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:43.100]   has to take them up on this.
[00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:49.500]   When he talks about which is the greater, the temple itself or the gift that is on the
[00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:55.020]   altar, you'll find that he goes into that in great detail on one occasion when he was
[00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:58.780]   dealing with them and arguing with them.
[00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:03.140]   This is how he puts it in the 23rd chapter of the Gospel according to St. Matthew.
[00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:09.100]   "Woe unto you, you blind guides, which say, 'Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is
[00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:13.740]   nothing, but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor.
[00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:18.860]   You fools and blind, for whether is greater the gold or the temple that sanctifieth the
[00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:23.700]   gold, and whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing, but whosoever sweareth by the
[00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:26.140]   gift that is upon it, he is guilty.
[00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:30.500]   You fools and blind, for whether is greater the gift or the altar that sanctifieth the
[00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:33.540]   gift, and so on."
[00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:40.300]   Now that was the condition into which they degenerated, this external religion, this
[00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:47.060]   religion of buildings and of forms and of ceremonies and of ritual, this kind of religious
[00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:50.020]   habit, this practicing of religion.
[00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:54.060]   They thought this was all that was necessary and as long as you did this all was well.
[00:24:54.060 --> 00:25:00.300]   And of course they carried it even to this ridiculous extreme, that God was confined
[00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:05.420]   to the temple, couldn't worship God anywhere else, only in the temple.
[00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:09.780]   That's why Stephen, you see, starts his sermon by saying, "The God of glory appeared unto
[00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:14.740]   our father Abram when he was in Mesopotamia, before he'd ever come even to Palestine,
[00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:16.620]   and when there was no temple."
[00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:21.500]   But this was it, they really believed it, God was confined to this temple, to the church
[00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:22.500]   as it were.
[00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:29.420]   Here is their second tragic blunder, they gloried in this, they were God's people,
[00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:33.460]   they were the only worshippers of God, they'd got the oracles of God.
[00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:38.980]   But here it was, it had degenerated into the most mechanical religion, a mere matter of
[00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:45.820]   form and ceremony, custom and habit, the spirit had long since gone right out of it.
[00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:52.780]   And it was all reduced to a matter of numbers, a mere mechanical performance.
[00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:57.460]   That's the second trouble with these members of the Sanhedrin.
[00:25:57.460 --> 00:26:03.220]   And the third was, and remember these are all showing you ways in which they had completely
[00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:06.700]   misunderstood the very thing in which they gloried.
[00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:08.140]   This is the tragedy.
[00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:14.780]   The third one is this, they'd completely misunderstood Moses and his teaching, the
[00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:16.820]   teaching of the law.
[00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:21.140]   You remember the charge that was brought against this man, Stephen?
[00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:26.660]   They said, "We have heard this man speak blasphemous words against Moses and against
[00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:27.660]   God.
[00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:34.860]   This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place and the law."
[00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:40.380]   Now, you know again how these Pharisees and scribes and the Jews in general, listening
[00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:46.620]   to their leaders, gloried in the fact that the law had been given to them.
[00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:48.900]   That's why they despised the Gentiles.
[00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:50.460]   They were dogs.
[00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:51.460]   They had no law.
[00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:55.100]   God hadn't given them these laws teaching them how to live.
[00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:59.540]   They would just live any how summer, but God had told them how to live, had given them
[00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:06.460]   the law, this living law through the hands of their great leader and lawgiver, Moses.
[00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:11.140]   And they thought the mere fact that they had the law, when nobody else had it, automatically
[00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:15.540]   put them right with God, and there was nothing further that could be desired.
[00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:21.020]   Well, now, here again is something, you see, that Stephen has to deal with.
[00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:23.460]   Again, he's not doing anything original.
[00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:26.020]   Our Lord had done exactly the same thing.
[00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:28.780]   That's really the burden of the sermon on the Mount.
[00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:33.580]   Our Lord there is facing these Pharisees and scribes, and he's saying unto them, "Ye
[00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:37.700]   have heard that it was said by them of old time, but I say unto you."
[00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:39.340]   And he goes through the law.
[00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:40.340]   And what's he doing?
[00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:45.580]   Well, he's showing them that they've completely misunderstood the law.
[00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:49.740]   He's showing them that they had reduced the law of God to a mere system of morality and
[00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:56.060]   ethics, and even worse, they'd even so arranged that that it just fitted their case.
[00:27:56.060 --> 00:28:01.900]   For instance, they said, "I've never committed murder."
[00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:04.880]   And our Lord takes that up and he says, "Wait a minute now.
[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:07.140]   You say you've never committed murder.
[00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:10.780]   Have you ever said in your heart about somebody, 'Thou fool'?
[00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:13.060]   If you have, you've committed murder.
[00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:14.700]   You've murdered him in your heart.
[00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:16.180]   That's what God's after."
[00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:18.380]   They said again, "We've never committed adultery."
[00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:20.140]   "Wait a minute," said our Lord.
[00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:23.120]   "Have you ever looked after a woman to lust with her?
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:25.540]   If you have, you've committed adultery in your heart.
[00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:27.420]   That's what God's concerned about."
[00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:28.420]   And so on.
[00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:31.140]   He takes them, you remember, through these various points.
[00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:32.140]   What was the trouble?
[00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:33.980]   Well, they'd never understood the meaning of the law.
[00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:35.460]   They say, "Ours is the law.
[00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:37.540]   We are the people who got it from Moses.
[00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:40.140]   Moses was our great leader and lawgiver.
[00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:41.860]   We are the people of the law."
[00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:44.900]   Our Lord tells them, in effect, "You know nothing at all about the law.
[00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:55.500]   You've twisted it, putting the commandments of men instead of the principles of the law.
[00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:57.900]   You've perverted the whole thing.
[00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:02.300]   You've put your traditions before the holy commandments of God."
[00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:04.860]   And that's exactly what they've been doing.
[00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:07.900]   I say they've reduced it to the level of just a moral system.
[00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:09.940]   They've never seen its real purpose.
[00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:10.940]   What's the purpose of the law?
[00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:15.100]   Is it that just I'm able to get up and say, "I've never done this, I've never done that,
[00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:16.100]   I've never done the other"?
[00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:17.780]   Not at all.
[00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:21.260]   The whole purpose of the law is its spirit.
[00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:25.740]   The object of the law is to lead a man to worship God.
[00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:30.100]   These are injunctions which show us our entire allegiance to God.
[00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:35.500]   Now, these Jews, you see, had completely misinterpreted this in its entirety.
[00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:40.500]   They said, "We've kept the law, and because we've kept the law, we are right with God,
[00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:42.260]   and we don't need any further preaching.
[00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:43.420]   Who is this Jesus?
[00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:45.380]   He says we need to believe in him.
[00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:46.380]   We don't need him.
[00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:47.380]   We've kept the law.
[00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:48.380]   We've kept the commandments."
[00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:53.260]   Their interpretation of the commandments, but in any case, they've missed this.
[00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:56.460]   The law was never given in order to save men.
[00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:59.140]   It was never its object.
[00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:00.700]   They'd misunderstood it.
[00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:05.660]   They thought they could save themselves by keeping the law, but it was never meant to
[00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:06.660]   save.
[00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:12.300]   Indeed, it's made quite plain and clear in the scriptures that no man could ever keep
[00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:13.300]   the law.
[00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:16.300]   No man could ever save himself by the law.
[00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:18.340]   What then is the object of the law?
[00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:22.460]   The object of the law is just to show us that we cannot save ourselves.
[00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:23.460]   That's why it was given.
[00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:29.540]   As Paul puts it, "The law is our schoolmaster to lead us to Christ."
[00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:31.980]   But these wretched Jews have misunderstood the whole thing.
[00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:34.220]   They said, "Here's the system.
[00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:35.500]   These are the things we've got to do.
[00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:36.660]   Those are the things we mustn't do.
[00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:39.100]   As long as I do these and turn to those, I'm all right.
[00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:40.460]   I've saved myself."
[00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:43.860]   It's a complete misunderstanding of the law.
[00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:48.820]   It's a reversal of the very thing the law was meant to teach.
[00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:54.460]   By the deeds of the law shall no man be justified in his sight, for by the law is the knowledge
[00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:55.460]   of sin.
[00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:58.300]   The law was added because of transgressions.
[00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:02.540]   The law was given that we might see the exceeding sinfulness of sin.
[00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:08.460]   The law was given to condemn us all and to drive us to Christ for refuge and for safety
[00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:11.500]   and for salvation.
[00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:15.220]   But these Jews, you see, had completely misunderstood it.
[00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:20.980]   The supreme example of this, of course, is none other than Saul of Tarsus, who later
[00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:23.220]   became the apostle Paul.
[00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:26.140]   As a Pharisee, he hated Christ.
[00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:28.360]   He blasphemed him.
[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:31.420]   He did everything he could do to destroy the early Christian church.
[00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:32.420]   Why?
[00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:34.220]   Well, because he felt this is all wrong.
[00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:37.060]   This says that I'm not all right as I am.
[00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:39.620]   This says that my keeping of the law doesn't save me.
[00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:43.500]   You remember how he puts it in Philippians 3, "Touching the righteousness which is of
[00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:45.380]   the law, blameless."
[00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:46.380]   Perfectly all right.
[00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:48.980]   Hebrew of the Hebrews, tribe of Benjamin.
[00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:55.180]   Here it is, you see, typical, relying upon nationality, physical descent from Abraham
[00:31:55.180 --> 00:32:00.140]   of the particular tribe of Benjamin, keeping the law, living a moral life, worshipping
[00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:01.140]   God in the temple.
[00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:03.580]   A Pharisee is an authority on these matters.
[00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:05.820]   Surely he's right, he's perfect.
[00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:08.100]   Nothing further can be desired.
[00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:16.500]   And there he was showing this tragic, blundering ignorance of the very essence and meaning
[00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:20.100]   of the law on which he was supposed to be an authority.
[00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:26.540]   Well, you see, I've shown you three ways, and they come out in this sermon.
[00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:33.820]   Three ways how the Jews had completely misunderstood their own heritage.
[00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:36.340]   This is an astounding thing, this.
[00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:45.380]   They had turned their own religion into something which was the exact opposite of what it was
[00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:52.260]   when it was given by God to them through Abraham and through Moses and through these men whose
[00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:55.420]   memories they claim to revere.
[00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:57.300]   This is almost incredible, isn't it?
[00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:58.300]   But it's the fact.
[00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:01.820]   This is the thing that Stephen deals with in this sermon.
[00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:03.980]   He says, "I'll take you on your own ground.
[00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:06.420]   Let me answer your charges as you bring them against me.
[00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:07.620]   You charge me with these things.
[00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:09.300]   Now I want to show you.
[00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:15.500]   You have so misunderstood your own heritage that when it's put to you truly, you think
[00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:20.980]   it's blasphemy, and you can't understand it, and you're annoyed."
[00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:23.460]   This is the condition at which they'd arrived.
[00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:26.980]   That was the second source of their trouble.
[00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:32.500]   The first was, you remember, that they thought they were quite all right as they were.
[00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:36.820]   Secondly, they'd completely misunderstood their own religion, the thing in which they
[00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:39.740]   gloried and in which they rejoiced.
[00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:48.500]   Thirdly, and as the result, of course, of the other two, oh, it was their complete failure
[00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:56.020]   to see the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ, to see the meaning of his message, to see
[00:33:56.020 --> 00:34:05.700]   the truth concerning him, to see that he is the Son of God and the Savior of the world.
[00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:13.940]   Their complete failure to see that he is the fulfillment of their religion, he is the fulfillment
[00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:20.900]   of their law, he is the end to which everything that had been given to them leads, and in
[00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:24.020]   which it finds its climax and its submission.
[00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:30.380]   They are so blinded by their prejudices and their own human thinking that they cannot
[00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:38.020]   see that this person whom they hate and revile is the inevitable and the logical outcome
[00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:42.020]   of all that they gloried in as the children of Abraham.
[00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:47.380]   Now again, as I'm reminding you, there's nothing original in all this.
[00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:49.860]   Our Lord, you see, has put it to them like this.
[00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:55.620]   Listen to this, John 5, 39 and following.
[00:34:55.620 --> 00:35:00.700]   These Pharisees and scribes following our Lord, arguing all along, he says, "Search
[00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:05.900]   the Scriptures, search the Scriptures, your own Scriptures, for in them you think you
[00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:06.900]   have eternal life."
[00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:08.900]   They did.
[00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:12.300]   They thought the possession of the Scriptures alone gave them eternal life.
[00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:13.700]   They said, "We've got these Scriptures."
[00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:15.700]   The Gentiles haven't got them.
[00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:17.140]   They haven't got the oracles of God.
[00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:18.140]   We are the people of the book.
[00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:19.500]   God has revealed himself to us.
[00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:25.780]   The Scriptures, ah, wonderful Scriptures, law, temple, these are the things that save.
[00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:31.260]   Search the Scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life.
[00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:37.660]   And they are they which testify of me.
[00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:41.060]   That was the thing that they couldn't see at all.
[00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:43.300]   They were so blinded.
[00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:45.460]   He's not a denier of the Scriptures.
[00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:48.380]   He is the fulfillment of the Scriptures.
[00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:53.500]   He says that not one jot, not one tittle of all this shall pass away until the very end
[00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:54.500]   of the world.
[00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:58.420]   Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my law shall not pass away.
[00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:04.180]   So you see, these people reject him and have nothing to do with him, and indeed resent
[00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:15.620]   him bitterly and crucify him, because of their complete failure to understand the very Scriptures
[00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:17.580]   in which they burst in.
[00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:21.540]   In other words, for me to sum it up now, the trouble with these people was that they were
[00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:23.380]   all wrong.
[00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:26.020]   They were not merely wrong in a detailed year or there.
[00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:28.500]   Their whole outlook was wrong.
[00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:31.300]   Their whole approach was wrong.
[00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:34.580]   That's the thing Stephen sets out to show.
[00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:39.980]   And I say again that I'm putting it to you and calling your attention to it, because
[00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:46.300]   my dear friends, the trouble and the problem is still the same today.
[00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:48.900]   Who are the last people to become Christians?
[00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:52.380]   The people who think they're already Christians.
[00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:55.740]   They are the last people always.
[00:36:55.740 --> 00:37:01.220]   As it was in the time of our Lord, you remember, he puts it to the Pharisees like this.
[00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:05.900]   He speaks a parable to them about a man with two sons and so on.
[00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:10.700]   And then he applies his parable and he says, "You," he says, "the leaders, the Pharisees
[00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:15.660]   and scribes," he says, "you refuse to go into the kingdom."
[00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:19.340]   It was offered to you first of all, but you won't go in.
[00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:24.660]   John came unto you, or even before that, whether they say unto him the first, "Jesus saith
[00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:29.620]   unto them, Verily I say unto you, that the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom
[00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:31.180]   of God before you.
[00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:35.180]   For John came unto you in the way of righteousness and you believed him not.
[00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:39.820]   But the publicans and the harlots believed him, and you, when you had seen it, repented
[00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:42.980]   not afterwards that ye might believe him."
[00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:45.940]   This is still the trouble, you see.
[00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:49.860]   It is because they think they're all right, because they think they've put themselves
[00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:50.860]   right with God.
[00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:57.540]   I say again, the greatest hindrance to becoming Christian is that we think that we are Christian.
[00:37:57.540 --> 00:37:58.900]   What makes us Christian?
[00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:01.920]   Born in Great Britain, a Christian country.
[00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:04.900]   We must be Christians because we are born in this country.
[00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:08.700]   As the Jew thought that that put him right, so many people in this country, they say,
[00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:13.140]   "I've always been a Christian, Christian country, christened when I was a child."
[00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:17.860]   You see the traditions, here it is the same thing, resting on the history, resting on
[00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:19.900]   the background.
[00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:20.900]   What else?
[00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:28.260]   Well, always brought up to be religious, taken to chapel or church when I was a child, circumcised
[00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:30.540]   the eighth, baptized when I was a child.
[00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:35.100]   I could repeat everything that Paul says about himself, and you'll find it's true of so many.
[00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:38.460]   People say, "I've always been a Christian, I've always believed in God, I've always
[00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:41.140]   said my prayers, always gone to church."
[00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:45.580]   Yes, particular types of worship, you may even have been zealous in them, may have been
[00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:49.100]   very regular, and you've lived a good life.
[00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:52.260]   Morality, I haven't done certain things.
[00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:55.180]   I know many people my same age, they've been doing terrible things.
[00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:56.460]   I've never done them.
[00:38:56.460 --> 00:39:00.140]   I'm all right, I'm a good person, I'm a Christian.
[00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:02.660]   Isn't that the trouble?
[00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:08.980]   You see, such people have never seen the very essence of Christianity.
[00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:15.620]   Can't you see that Christianity has done exactly the same thing as Judaism has done?
[00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:20.980]   Judaism had turned the message of God given to them through Moses into the exact opposite
[00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:22.860]   of what it was.
[00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:25.940]   Precisely the same thing is true of Christendom.
[00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:31.180]   People rarely believe that these are the things that make you a Christian.
[00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:38.700]   Birth, nationality, background, upbringing, heredity, regular worship, morality, good
[00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:42.660]   conduct and behavior, doing good to other people.
[00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:43.660]   Isn't that it?
[00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:48.340]   They've never felt the need of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:52.500]   They've never seen their guilt and their emptiness and their woe.
[00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:56.460]   They've never seen the need of the death and the cross on Calvary's hill.
[00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:57.460]   Why?
[00:39:57.460 --> 00:39:59.220]   Well, of course, because they're all right.
[00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:02.860]   Other people may need that sort of thing, but not they.
[00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:07.060]   You see, it's been something external, something mechanical, something formal.
[00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:11.580]   It's never been personal, it's never been living, they've never known any condemnation.
[00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:15.420]   And indeed, when they hear the true gospel, like the members of the Sanhedrin, they don't
[00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:16.420]   like it.
[00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:18.040]   They resent it.
[00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:23.000]   They make their sarcastic remarks about the blood of Christ.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.660]   They ridicule this necessity of being born again.
[00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:29.180]   They say, "Nobody believes anything like that now."
[00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:31.100]   They resent all this.
[00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:34.380]   Isn't this the chief difficulty still?
[00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:36.780]   That men and women think they're already all right.
[00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:40.900]   There are some who go so far, of course, as to believe that everybody's all right, whether
[00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:41.900]   you're religious or not.
[00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:47.340]   And therefore, there is no need of a convicting message or something that disturbs you.
[00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:52.260]   It is indeed nothing but a repetition of this whole old trouble with the members of the
[00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:53.260]   Sanhedrin.
[00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:58.060]   And as I summed it up about them, I can sum it up about the modern men.
[00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:03.660]   The main difficulty with people who are not Christian is this.
[00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:04.660]   It's not a matter of details.
[00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:07.660]   Oh, I know they're ready to argue about the details.
[00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:11.740]   They say, "You know, my trouble is about miracles.
[00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:15.220]   I like the sermon on the mount, but I'm in a bit of difficulty about the supernatural
[00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:16.220]   and the miraculous."
[00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:20.860]   Oh, they'll bring up their, you know, those chestnuts about Cain's wife and Jonah and
[00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:21.860]   so on.
[00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:23.500]   They say, "These are my problems, my difficulties.
[00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:26.940]   I'm right, of course, on the big things, the central things, but I'm in a little bit of
[00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:28.740]   difficulty about these things on the periphery."
[00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:31.860]   My dear friend, it's exactly the opposite of that.
[00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:36.020]   Your trouble is that you're entirely wrong.
[00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:37.340]   Entirely wrong.
[00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:38.980]   It isn't a matter of details.
[00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:42.340]   It is a matter of one's entire position.
[00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:49.980]   This is the tragedy of the modern age as it was the tragedy of the Jews in the first century.
[00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:59.060]   We have turned the message of Christianity into a kind of institutionalized religion.
[00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:02.100]   And men and women are in trouble because of that.
[00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:04.820]   The whole outlook is wrong.
[00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:07.420]   It can scarcely be recognized at all.
[00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:12.180]   Now then, that being the trouble, is there anything that we stand in greater need of
[00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:15.700]   than to listen to the message of Stephen?
[00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:18.740]   That's the very position with which he had to deal.
[00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:23.020]   It is the very position with which we have to deal still.
[00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:24.020]   What's the message?
[00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:30.100]   Well, all I'm doing tonight, of course, is to introduce it to you.
[00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:32.100]   And here is the introduction.
[00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:36.100]   "Men, brethren, and fathers."
[00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:38.700]   Well, what?
[00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:42.260]   Here's the first word.
[00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:43.740]   Harken!
[00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:45.260]   Harken!
[00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:46.780]   Hear!
[00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:48.260]   Listen!
[00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:51.700]   That's how he begins.
[00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:57.300]   And that's how any preaching of the gospel must begin.
[00:42:57.300 --> 00:43:01.620]   We've got to start by listening patiently.
[00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:05.140]   That's the meaning of the word "harken."
[00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:08.260]   Lend me your ears, if you like.
[00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:11.060]   I've got something to put before you that's not going to be easy.
[00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:12.060]   Listen.
[00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:13.420]   Listen for all your worth.
[00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:14.420]   Listen for your very life.
[00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:15.420]   Men, brethren, and fathers.
[00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:16.420]   Harken.
[00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:17.420]   Listen.
[00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:18.420]   Listen.
[00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:19.420]   Why?
[00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:22.380]   Well, now, you see, here are preliminary matters.
[00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:23.780]   This is where people go wrong.
[00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:26.780]   I say not over details and minutiae.
[00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:31.180]   It's over this whole question, the whole case of the gospel.
[00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:36.060]   Here are the things which I deduce from this word "harken."
[00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:41.580]   The gospel is an argument.
[00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:47.140]   The gospel is a statement of a reasoned case.
[00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:48.700]   That's what Stephen is doing.
[00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:54.020]   He's on trial, and he's addressing his judges, and he presents his case.
[00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:55.020]   And you read it.
[00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:56.020]   Read it.
[00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:57.020]   Study it.
[00:43:57.020 --> 00:43:58.140]   Read it many times over.
[00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:00.380]   Watch the procession of argument.
[00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:02.940]   Watch the building up of the facts of the case.
[00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:04.780]   Watch the logic in it all.
[00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:08.700]   Now this is Christianity, you know.
[00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:10.540]   This is a matter of reason.
[00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:13.180]   This is a matter of a reasoned case.
[00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:14.180]   It is an argumentation.
[00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:16.340]   Why am I saying this?
[00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:21.940]   Well, I'm saying this because so many people today fondly think and imagine that they reject
[00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:27.140]   Christianity because they're reasonable people and that they're not interested in some stuff.
[00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:28.140]   Emotionalism.
[00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:32.580]   Christianity, they say, all right for women and children, all right for people perhaps
[00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:37.980]   in the backwoods of some unknown and unexplored continent, but not for modern men.
[00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:41.980]   Modern men come of age with reason, understanding, scientific knowledge.
[00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:47.500]   Or they say the thing is monstrous, and I'm not going to allow you to play on my feelings.
[00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:49.860]   I know your Christianity, they say.
[00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:55.980]   The dope of the people, the opium of the people, the drug, the sheer emotionalism, the playing
[00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:57.340]   on the surface emotions.
[00:44:57.340 --> 00:45:01.300]   Now, I want to be quite fair and to be quite honest.
[00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:06.740]   Christianity has often been misrepresented in that way, but that's not Christianity.
[00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:10.660]   If you want to know what Christianity is, you go back to this book of the Acts of the
[00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:11.660]   Apostles.
[00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:16.700]   Here, I say, is the first extended report of a sermon delivered under the auspices of
[00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:17.700]   the Christian church.
[00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:20.980]   Here is my notion of evangelism.
[00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:26.660]   I don't care what anybody else is doing, but this is New Testament evangelism.
[00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:32.420]   And it's very typical and representative of all the other speeches and reports of sermons
[00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:36.860]   that you'll find in this book of the Acts of the Apostles and later in the church in
[00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:40.500]   the great periods of reformation and of revival.
[00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:44.340]   It is not emotionalism.
[00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:51.460]   It is, I say, something that demands our full attention.
[00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:57.260]   It demands the use and the exercise of all our best faculties.
[00:45:57.260 --> 00:46:00.500]   It is something that demands our concentration.
[00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:06.580]   Now, I put it like this, I think I've probably said this sort of thing before in this pulpit.
[00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:11.140]   You see, the modern man dismisses Christianity and the preaching of Christianity as this
[00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:16.900]   sob stuff, playing on feelings, unintelligent and emotional.
[00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:19.740]   And what do they do then, who reject it for that reason?
[00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:20.740]   What are they doing tonight?
[00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:24.420]   Well, they're at home, aren't they, looking at their television sets.
[00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:25.420]   What do they get there?
[00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:31.260]   Well, they get lurid drama, perhaps, Western, some sob stuff in connection with some love
[00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:33.740]   affair or something like that.
[00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:35.220]   Is that reason?
[00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:36.820]   Is that understanding?
[00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:41.660]   Now come, my friends, I want to issue a challenge as I'm starting an exposition of this great
[00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:43.700]   sermon.
[00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:48.100]   Have I been playing on your feelings this evening?
[00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:51.260]   Have I just been entertaining you by telling you stories?
[00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:55.220]   We are told that that is Christianity and the modern, intelligent, sophisticated man
[00:46:55.220 --> 00:46:57.300]   has nothing to do with it.
[00:46:57.300 --> 00:47:01.340]   He wants something to appeal to his mind, to his reason, to his understanding.
[00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:03.940]   Well, I'm just asking you a simple question.
[00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:05.540]   Have I been playing on your feelings?
[00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:07.980]   Have I just been putting you off with some stories?
[00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:09.260]   Have I been wheeling you?
[00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:13.540]   Now, let's be quite frank and honest.
[00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:19.460]   When did you last think as much and as for long a time as you've done in this service?
[00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:23.820]   You find it an intellectual exercise to look at the television or listen to the radio or
[00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:26.140]   read your newspaper or read the novels?
[00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:28.220]   Of course you don't.
[00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:33.380]   Indeed, some of you may be complaining that I'm putting too great a strain on your intellect.
[00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:34.380]   All right.
[00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:36.700]   That I'm prepared to accept.
[00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:42.780]   But it proves my case, you see, that this is something that comes to us and says, "Harken!
[00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:43.780]   Listen!
[00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:45.780]   Pull yourself together!"
[00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:48.740]   You can't follow this lounging back in a comfortable chair.
[00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:49.940]   You've got to sit up.
[00:47:49.940 --> 00:47:52.340]   You need every ounce of intellect you've got.
[00:47:52.340 --> 00:47:54.300]   Here is a reasoned case.
[00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:55.300]   It's not easy.
[00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:56.300]   It's not simple.
[00:47:56.300 --> 00:48:00.220]   It demands all the energies and the faculties of a man.
[00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:01.220]   Why?
[00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:04.100]   Well, because, you see, this is truth.
[00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:06.680]   This is a body of truth.
[00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:09.260]   This is a body of doctrine.
[00:48:09.260 --> 00:48:13.260]   This is a body of great statements of truth.
[00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:15.700]   And truth is addressed to the mind of men.
[00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:21.420]   The Bible teaches that men's greatest gift, in a sense, is his mind.
[00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:23.700]   He has a mind, in a sense, that no animal has.
[00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:25.100]   He's able to follow an argument.
[00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:26.100]   He's able to reason.
[00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:29.100]   He's able to look on at himself and examine himself.
[00:48:29.100 --> 00:48:30.100]   Man's mind.
[00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:31.100]   And what is this message?
[00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:32.100]   Well, it is truth.
[00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:37.580]   Truth which comes to the mind of men.
[00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:43.060]   So Stephen, very rightly, looks at this great body that he is addressing.
[00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:44.460]   He sees their passion.
[00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:46.380]   He sees their prejudice.
[00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:48.020]   He sees their violence.
[00:48:48.020 --> 00:48:50.740]   He sees they're too emotional.
[00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:55.740]   So he, very politely, he addresses them, you notice, in a very nice way.
[00:48:55.740 --> 00:48:58.020]   Men, brethren, and fathers.
[00:48:58.020 --> 00:49:01.660]   There's no need to insult anybody.
[00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:02.660]   Honor to whom?
[00:49:02.660 --> 00:49:03.660]   Honor is due.
[00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:06.700]   He's a gentleman and he presents his case.
[00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:09.060]   But he does venture to say this at the very beginning.
[00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:14.300]   "Please," he says, "please, try and control yourselves.
[00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:16.220]   Try and control your passion."
[00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:19.620]   They were already, some of them, beginning to gnash their teeth.
[00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:23.700]   He could see the violence, the look in the eye, the curled lip.
[00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:26.620]   You know, the modern attitude of sarcasm and derision.
[00:49:26.620 --> 00:49:30.340]   Now the appeal to all such is this.
[00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:31.660]   Stop.
[00:49:31.660 --> 00:49:33.820]   Stop being governed by prejudice and passion.
[00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:35.580]   Hold yourself in.
[00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:38.540]   You're going to listen to an argument.
[00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:39.540]   What else?
[00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:45.300]   Well, he's suggesting that they're going to hear something which is unlike everything
[00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:47.940]   else they've ever heard.
[00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:51.460]   Something that is unique.
[00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:55.940]   Something that differs from everything that the world has got to offer and that they have
[00:49:55.940 --> 00:49:58.500]   always been accustomed to.
[00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:02.460]   Stephen knows that he's on trial for that reason, as I've been showing you.
[00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:04.580]   You see, this complete misinterpretation.
[00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:08.580]   Now he's going to give them the things with which they were so familiar, but put them
[00:50:08.580 --> 00:50:10.220]   in the right way to them.
[00:50:10.220 --> 00:50:13.020]   Now that is a difficult thing for them and for him.
[00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:18.580]   So he pleads with them, because it's going to be cutting so across all that they're accustomed
[00:50:18.580 --> 00:50:21.460]   to, to listen, and to listen very carefully.
[00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:24.300]   I apply that in this way.
[00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:30.860]   The message of the gospel is unlike everything else in the world tonight.
[00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:36.380]   Think of your politics, think of your arts, think of your learning, think of your science,
[00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:38.460]   think of your music, anything you like.
[00:50:38.460 --> 00:50:43.100]   Here, I say, is something that is entirely different.
[00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:44.780]   There's nothing like it.
[00:50:44.780 --> 00:50:47.860]   This is absolutely unique.
[00:50:47.860 --> 00:50:50.820]   And we've got to realize that at the very beginning.
[00:50:50.820 --> 00:50:53.900]   We've got to shut down our prejudices, therefore.
[00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:59.140]   We've got to realize that we are here facing something we've never really faced before.
[00:50:59.140 --> 00:51:01.160]   So it demands the whole of our attention.
[00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:06.220]   But further, you see, it cuts across all our prejudices and our preconceived ideas.
[00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:10.980]   We've got to be prepared for this, whether we like it or not.
[00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:15.260]   This is one of the first steps in becoming Christian.
[00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:18.700]   And then it leads me to my last point, which is this.
[00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:24.060]   We've got to be ready for something that is going to convict us, something that will come
[00:51:24.060 --> 00:51:29.740]   to us personally, and something that will condemn us.
[00:51:29.740 --> 00:51:33.620]   I would be very lacking as a preacher if I didn't tell you that the message of the Christian
[00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:38.660]   gospel is very objectionable to the natural man.
[00:51:38.660 --> 00:51:41.900]   I'm not surprised when people refuse the gospel.
[00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:43.940]   They can't do anything else.
[00:51:43.940 --> 00:51:48.580]   The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, says Paul, for they are
[00:51:48.580 --> 00:51:49.980]   foolishness unto him.
[00:51:49.980 --> 00:51:56.620]   Neither can he know them, for they are spiritually discerned.
[00:51:56.620 --> 00:52:01.740]   Here is something that tells the best men that he's useless and hopeless.
[00:52:01.740 --> 00:52:06.860]   Here is something that comes to the most moral individual and says, "Your morality is filthy
[00:52:06.860 --> 00:52:07.860]   rags.
[00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:10.540]   It is nothing but dumb and refuse."
[00:52:10.540 --> 00:52:14.980]   Here it comes to a man who says, "I've worshipped God ever since I was born."
[00:52:14.980 --> 00:52:18.500]   And it tells him, "You've never worshipped God.
[00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:21.540]   You worshipped the figment of your own imagination.
[00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:23.820]   You've been worshipping a tradition.
[00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:26.020]   Ye know not whom ye worship.
[00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:27.620]   You don't know what you've been doing."
[00:52:27.620 --> 00:52:30.900]   "Yea," you say, "but I'm a religious person."
[00:52:30.900 --> 00:52:36.860]   And the reply comes back, "Yes, you're a religious person in the same sense as a Jew or a Mohammedan
[00:52:36.860 --> 00:52:39.740]   or a follower of Buddha or Confucius is.
[00:52:39.740 --> 00:52:43.300]   But are you a true worshipper of the living God?"
[00:52:43.300 --> 00:52:48.380]   "Yea," you say, "is something that we must realise at the very beginning.
[00:52:48.380 --> 00:52:54.580]   You can't face this gospel as it is and still feel happy, still feel sound, still feel that
[00:52:54.580 --> 00:52:58.020]   you're good and that you're right and that because you seem to be better than other people
[00:52:58.020 --> 00:52:59.940]   that that puts you right with God.
[00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:04.740]   This is something that demolishes our whole position, that makes us all guilty sinners
[00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:05.740]   before God.
[00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:10.780]   Here is something that convicts us all of sin.
[00:53:10.780 --> 00:53:18.660]   And here is something that tells us that there is only one way of a knowledge of God and
[00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:25.300]   forgiveness and hope of everlasting life and that is to believe in the Son of God,
[00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:28.220]   our blessed Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ."
[00:53:28.220 --> 00:53:31.700]   My friends, we've got to leave it at this for this evening, but let me put it like this
[00:53:31.700 --> 00:53:32.700]   to you.
[00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:37.300]   Am I speaking, I know I am, to someone who is not a Christian.
[00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:38.380]   You've rejected it.
[00:53:38.380 --> 00:53:40.940]   I simply ask you one question.
[00:53:40.940 --> 00:53:44.060]   Do you know what you've rejected?
[00:53:44.060 --> 00:53:46.940]   Do you know the case of the gospel?
[00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:50.100]   These people thought they were all right, they thought they knew.
[00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:54.300]   It is people I say who think they are Christians who dislike the message of Christianity most
[00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:55.300]   of all.
[00:53:55.300 --> 00:53:56.300]   Have you ever really listened to this?
[00:53:56.300 --> 00:54:00.260]   Have you ever really considered it?
[00:54:00.260 --> 00:54:02.340]   You know the tragedy of this, we've all done it.
[00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:05.740]   We reach a certain age and we think we know.
[00:54:05.740 --> 00:54:07.660]   We said nothing in Christianity.
[00:54:07.660 --> 00:54:08.660]   We dismissed the whole thing.
[00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:10.060]   I have nothing more to do with it.
[00:54:10.060 --> 00:54:14.260]   The sign of being a man is that you stop going to a place of worship, stop doing what you
[00:54:14.260 --> 00:54:15.900]   were forced to do as a child.
[00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:19.020]   You become a man and you say there's nothing in Christianity.
[00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:25.700]   I'm simply asking you in the name of God to listen, to hearken, to hear, to consider
[00:54:25.700 --> 00:54:32.220]   the case, be open minded enough to give it a chance, find out what Christianity really
[00:54:32.220 --> 00:54:33.220]   is.
[00:54:33.220 --> 00:54:38.500]   And you know the moment you do that, you'll soon find that you've never known anything
[00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:41.060]   about it at all.
[00:54:41.060 --> 00:54:45.980]   You've known about some tradition, you've known about Christendom.
[00:54:45.980 --> 00:54:48.980]   Oh, have you ever heard this message?
[00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:54.460]   That God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth
[00:54:54.460 --> 00:54:58.740]   in him should not perish but have everlasting life.
[00:54:58.740 --> 00:55:03.420]   My dear friend, have you ever come to see your need of him?
[00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:06.820]   Do you know the biggest and the greatest and the most glorious thing that's ever happened
[00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:09.140]   in the whole of human history is this?
[00:55:09.140 --> 00:55:14.620]   That at a given point when the fullness of the times was come, God sent forth his son
[00:55:14.620 --> 00:55:19.980]   made of a woman, made under the law to redeem them that were under the law.
[00:55:19.980 --> 00:55:25.420]   Have you ever realized why the son of God ever came into this world?
[00:55:25.420 --> 00:55:30.900]   Had you realized until this minute that he did it because you were so hopelessly lost
[00:55:30.900 --> 00:55:36.960]   and damned and impossible that nothing but his coming and even his dying on the cross
[00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:43.220]   on Calvary's Hill could save you and redeem you for time and for eternity and really introduce
[00:55:43.220 --> 00:55:48.620]   you to God and enable you for the first time in your life really to worship and then give
[00:55:48.620 --> 00:55:54.340]   you his spirit so that you start living a new and a true and a noble life?
[00:55:54.340 --> 00:55:59.980]   Have you ever realized the essence, the meaning of this Christian message?
[00:55:59.980 --> 00:56:04.860]   The first appeal of the gospel is this.
[00:56:04.860 --> 00:56:13.860]   Hearken, listen, control your prejudices and your passion.
[00:56:13.860 --> 00:56:16.660]   Read the Bible for the first time truly.
[00:56:16.660 --> 00:56:18.740]   Get hold of the whole case.
[00:56:18.740 --> 00:56:22.060]   Ask God to give you his spirit to enlighten you.
[00:56:22.060 --> 00:56:29.300]   Open your mind, your heart, your everything to this blessed and glorious gospel.
[00:56:29.300 --> 00:56:37.420]   The moment you begin to hearken, you are on the high road to believing and experiencing
[00:56:37.420 --> 00:56:39.780]   so great a salvation.
[00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:46.420]   Well God willing, we'll go on with our consideration of this great sermon next Sunday evening.
[00:56:46.420 --> 00:56:53.500]   Now shall we join in singing our closing hymn, hymn number 12, "The God of Abraham Praise,
[00:56:53.500 --> 00:56:59.380]   who reigns enthroned above ancient and everlasting days, and God of love."
[00:56:59.380 --> 00:57:00.380]   Hymn number 12.
[00:57:00.380 --> 00:57:15.380]   [music]
[00:57:15.380 --> 00:57:35.380]   The God of Abraham praise, who reigns enthroned above ancient and everlasting days, and God
[00:57:35.380 --> 00:58:00.820]   of love.
[00:58:00.820 --> 00:58:04.740]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
