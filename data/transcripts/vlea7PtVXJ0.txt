[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   In your book, The War of Art, you talk about resistance,
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.200]   with a capital R, as the invisible force
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.320]   in this universe of ours that finds a way
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.320]   to prevent you from starting or doing the work.
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.120]   Where do you think resistance comes from?
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.840]   Why is there a force in our mind
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.080]   that's constantly trying to jeopardize our efforts,
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.600]   with laziness, excuses, and so on?
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.280]   - That's another great question.
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:35.200]   I mean, in Jewish mysticism, in Kabbalistic thinking,
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.440]   it's called the Yetzir Ha-Rah, right?
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.520]   And it's a force that if this up here is your soul,
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.040]   or Neshamah, trying to talk to you, us down here,
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.000]   the Yetzir Ha-Rah is this negative force in the middle.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.520]   So I'm not the only one that ever thought about this.
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.480]   But, and I don't know if anybody really knows the answer,
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.000]   but here's my answer.
[00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.380]   I think that there are two places
[00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.600]   where we as human beings can seat our identity.
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.880]   One is the ego, the conscious ego,
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.460]   and the other is the greater self.
[00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.220]   And the self in the Jungian sense,
[00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.660]   the self in the Jungian sense includes the unconscious
[00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.420]   and butts up against what Jung called the divine ground,
[00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.560]   which what I would call the muse, the goddess, or whatever.
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.360]   And I think, and the ego is just this little dot
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.460]   inside this bigger self.
[00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.460]   And the ego has a completely different view of life
[00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.680]   as from the self.
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.940]   The ego believes, I'm gonna give you a long answer here.
[00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:39.940]   - No, perfect.
[00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.300]   - The ego believes that death is real.
[00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.180]   The ego believes that time and space are real.
[00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.960]   The ego believes that each one of us
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.860]   is separate from the other.
[00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.340]   I'm separate from you.
[00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.380]   I could punch you in the face and it wouldn't hurt me.
[00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.220]   It would only hurt you.
[00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.220]   And in the ego's world, the dominant emotion is fear
[00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.460]   because we are all made of flesh.
[00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.300]   We can all die.
[00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.140]   We can all be hurt.
[00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.820]   We can all be ruined, bump, bada-bump.
[00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.940]   So we are protecting ourselves and even our desire to create
[00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.380]   as we were talking about before
[00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.020]   comes out of that fear of death.
[00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.820]   The self, on the other hand, the greater self
[00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.000]   that butts up against the divine ground
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.500]   believes that death is not real,
[00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.980]   that time and space are not real,
[00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.460]   that the gods travel swift as thought.
[00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.620]   And the ego also believes that, I mean,
[00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.900]   the self believes that there's no difference
[00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.460]   between you and me, that we're all one.
[00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:42.060]   If I hurt you, I hurt myself, karma, right?
[00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.620]   And in the world of the self, of the greater self,
[00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.280]   the dominant emotion is love, not fear.
[00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.760]   Now, so I think that, let me, I'll go farther back here,
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.160]   I'll try to, a long way to answer your question.
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.520]   When Jesus died on the cross,
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.520]   or when the 300 Spartans willingly sacrificed their lives
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.600]   at Thermopylae, they were acting according
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.520]   to the rules of the self.
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.320]   Death is not real, no difference between you and me,
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.960]   time and space are not real, predominant emotion is love.
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.960]   So, in my opinion, we as conscious human vessels
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:28.540]   have, are in a struggle between these two things,
[00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.140]   the ego and the self.
[00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.900]   To me, resistance is the voice of the ego,
[00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.540]   saying, and it's a fearful voice,
[00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.460]   because if, when we identify with the self,
[00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.020]   we move our consciousness over to the self,
[00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.640]   as artists or scientists, opening ourselves up
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.900]   to the cosmic dimension, to the other forces,
[00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.280]   the ego is tremendously threatened by that,
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.260]   because if we're in that space, that head space,
[00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.440]   we don't need the ego anymore.
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.920]   So I think resistance is a voice of the ego
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.240]   trying to keep control of us.
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.520]   In a way, I'll give you a bad example, Trump is the ego.
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.860]   - That's probably a very good example, right?
[00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.800]   - You know, it's a zero-sum world for him,
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.340]   and for anybody that's in that,
[00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.940]   and the opposite of that would be somebody
[00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.520]   like Martin Luther King, or Gandhi.
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.380]   And that's, of course, why they all wind up
[00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.340]   getting assassinated, because that voice,
[00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.260]   that ego is hanging on to itself,
[00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.040]   and feels so threatened by,
[00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.680]   - I could talk more about this if you want.
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.120]   - No, for sure, that's fascinating,
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.320]   it's just, it's interesting why the fear
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.920]   is attached to the ego.
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.240]   I really like this dichotomy of ego and self,
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.080]   and that struggle.
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.720]   It's just, ego has a, you know,
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.720]   the self-obsession of it, why fear is such a predominant
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:11.120]   thing, like why is resistance trying to undermine everything?
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.040]   - It's fear, it's out of fear.
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.800]   Let's think about the whole thing in terms of stories.
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:22.880]   In a story, the villain is always resistance,
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.960]   is always the ego.
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.960]   The hero is always, of course, always is not everything,
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.600]   but you know what I mean, pretty much,
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.600]   represents kind of the self.
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.680]   If you think about the alien on the spaceship,
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.360]   that's like the ultimate kind of villain,
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.240]   it keeps changing form, right?
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.000]   First it goes on the guy's face,
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.840]   then it pops out of his chest,
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.360]   but it always just has that one monomaniacal thing
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.720]   to destroy, you know?
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.560]   And just like the ego, just like resistance.
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.520]   And maybe alien is a bad example,
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.640]   because Sigourney Weaver has to sort of fight
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.840]   on the same terms as the alien,
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.120]   but maybe a better example might be
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.080]   something like Casablanca, where in the end,
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.880]   the Humphrey Bogart character has to,
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.520]   acting, operating out of the self,
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:19.360]   has to give up his selfish dream
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.520]   of going off with Ingrid Bergman,
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.520]   Neil Salon, the love of his life,
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:28.320]   and instead, you know, puts her on a plane to Lisbon
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.040]   while he goes off to fight the Nazis,
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.440]   and you know, in the desert.
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.120]   I don't know if that's clear,
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.880]   but in almost every story,
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:41.440]   the villain is the ego, is resistance, is fear,
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.840]   is that zero-sum thing,
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:47.480]   and in almost every story, the hero is someone
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:52.480]   that is willing to make a sacrifice to help others.
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.680]   - It's letting go of that fear
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.960]   is what leads to productivity and to success.
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:58.800]   - Yeah.
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.500]   - Do you think there's a,
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.840]   probably the answer is either obvious or impossible,
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.720]   but do you think there's an evolutionary advantage
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.380]   to resistance?
[00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:17.760]   Like, what would life look like without resistance?
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.400]   - That's another great question.
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:25.200]   I think, I also believe that resistance, like death,
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.720]   gives a meaning to life.
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.560]   If we didn't have it, it's gonna be, you know,
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.440]   what would we be?
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.040]   We'd be in the Garden of Eden,
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.960]   picking fruit and just happy and stupid, you know?
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:40.840]   And I do think that that myth of the Garden of Eden
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.840]   is really about this kind of thing, you know,
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:46.640]   where Adam and Eve decide to sort of take matters
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:51.640]   into their own hands and acquire knowledge,
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.160]   that until then, God had said,
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.600]   "I'm the only one that's got that knowledge."
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.920]   And of course, once they've acquired that knowledge,
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:03.520]   they're cast out into the world you and I live in now,
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.240]   where they do have to deal with that fear
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.880]   and they do have to deal with all that stuff.
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.760]   It's a human condition.
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.680]   - It's a human condition, and the meaning and the purpose
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:17.680]   comes from the resistance being there
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.520]   and the struggle to overcome it.
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:21.920]   - To overcome it, right.
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.360]   And also, the other aspect of it is that
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.200]   it's not real at all.
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:30.160]   It's not even like it's an actual force.
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.520]   It's all here, right?
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:37.520]   So the sort of, in a way,
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:40.260]   it's sort of a surrender to it, you know?
[00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.920]   You know, or it's just--
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:45.760]   - Surrender to its reality.
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.920]   - Sort of like turning on the light in a dark thing.
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.280]   It's like, "Oh, it's gone."
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:52.880]   - But not quite because it's never really--
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.200]   - Not quite, 'cause it comes back again tomorrow morning.
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.080]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.800]   So you have to keep changing light bulbs every day.
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:02.800]   So what's been, maybe recently, but in general,
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:06.200]   maybe in your life, what's been the most relentless
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.800]   or one of the more relentless sources of resistance
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.240]   to you personally?
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:12.640]   - I mean, it's always the same.
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.300]   It's about writing, for me,
[00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:20.680]   and evolving within my own body of work.
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:26.440]   It never goes away, it never gets any less.
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:28.240]   - Do you have particular excuses,
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:32.520]   particular justifications that come out?
[00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.180]   - No, it's always the same.
[00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:35.880]   Well, I would say it's always the same,
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.940]   but it's really not because resistance is so protean.
[00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:41.020]   You know, it keeps changing form.
[00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:45.200]   And as you move to, hopefully, a higher level,
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.040]   resistance gets a little more nuanced
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.840]   and a little more subtle, trying to fake you out.
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:54.040]   But I think you learn that it's always there,
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.400]   and you're always gonna have to face it.
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:00.840]   - I mean, your battle is sitting down
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:05.000]   and writing to some number of words to a blank page.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.080]   Do you have a process there with this battle?
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:13.520]   Do you have a number of hours that you put in?
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:14.360]   Do you sit down?
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:16.960]   - Yeah, I'm definitely a believer
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:19.520]   that even though this battle is fought
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:22.100]   on the highest sort of spiritual level,
[00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:25.120]   that the way you fight it is on the most mundane,
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:28.880]   I'm sure it's like martial arts must be the same way.
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:32.040]   I mean, I go to the gym first thing in the morning,
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:35.240]   and I sort of am rehearsing myself.
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:39.240]   The gym is called resistance training, right?
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.240]   You're working against resistance, right?
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.760]   And I don't wanna go, I don't wanna get out of bed.
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:44.760]   I hate to, you know.
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:51.480]   But I'm sort of fortifying myself to be ready for the day.
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:55.760]   And like I said, over Knockwood, over years,
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:59.120]   I've learned to sort of get into the right kind of mindset,
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.920]   and it's not as hard for me as it used to be.
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.200]   The real resistance, I think, for me,
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.620]   and I think this is true for anybody,
[00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:08.900]   is the question of sort of what's the next idea?
[00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:11.120]   What's the next book?
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:13.520]   What's the next project that you're gonna work on?
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:17.840]   And when I ask that question, I'm asking it of the muse.
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:20.040]   I'm kind of saying, what do you want me,
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.480]   or I'm asking it of my unconscious.
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:25.300]   If we're looking at Bruce Springsteen's albums,
[00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:27.080]   it's gonna, well, what's the next album?
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.440]   Now he's on Broadway.
[00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.000]   That was a great idea, right?
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.680]   Where'd that come from, you know?
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:34.840]   (laughing)
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:36.880]   And then for him, what's after that?
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:42.760]   Because that body of work is already alive.
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:49.040]   It already exists inside us,
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:51.440]   kind of like a woman's biological clock,
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.360]   and we have to serve it.
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:57.960]   And we have to, otherwise it'll give us cancer.
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:01.480]   I don't mean to say that if anybody has cancer,
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:03.200]   that they're not, but you know what I mean.
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.080]   It'll take its revenge on us.
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:08.280]   So the next resistance to me is sort of,
[00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:12.440]   or a big aspect of it is what's next?
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:13.800]   When I finish the book I'm working on now,
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.800]   I'm not sure what I'm gonna do next.
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:18.240]   - But see, at the same time, you have a kind of,
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:24.680]   you have a sense that there's a Bruce Springsteen
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:28.000]   single line of albums.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.440]   So it's already known somewhere in the universe
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.920]   what you're going to do next, is the sense you have.
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.480]   - In a sense, yes.
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.920]   I don't know if it's predetermined, you know?
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:40.420]   But there's something like that.
[00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:45.400]   - Yeah, I'd like to believe that there's,
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:48.440]   well, it's kind of like quantum mechanics, I guess.
[00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:53.000]   Once you observe it, maybe once you talk to the muse,
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.560]   it's one thing for sure,
[00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:57.520]   it was always going to be that one thing.
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:01.240]   But really, in reality, it's a distribution.
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:02.800]   It could be any number of things.
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:03.640]   - Yeah, I think so.
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:04.840]   There's alternate realities.
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:06.120]   - Alternate realities, yeah.
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.460]   - But they're not that far apart.
[00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:10.280]   I mean, Bruce Springsteen is not gonna write
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:12.640]   a Joni Mitchell song, you know?
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:13.480]   No matter how hard he tries.
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:14.440]   - Well, he still went on Broadway,
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:15.880]   I mean, he still did that,
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:18.320]   which is not a Bruce Springsteen thing to do.
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:21.920]   So I think you're being, in retrospect,
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:22.760]   it all makes sense. - I think it is
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:23.840]   a Bruce Springsteen thing to do.
[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:25.720]   It's a next sort of evolution for him.
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:28.840]   Why not take his music to there, you know?
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:32.760]   - In retrospect, it all makes perfect sense, I think.
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:35.020]   'Cause if you pull it off, especially.
[00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:37.260]   (chuckles)
[00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.840]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.420]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:45.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:50.160]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.740]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:52.740 --> 00:14:02.740]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
