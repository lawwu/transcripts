[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Well, two weeks back, two Mondays ago, we looked at how to glorify God in our business
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   successes.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   That was APJ 1915.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   Now, two weeks later, we're talking about business again, and more broadly, it's a question
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   from a listener named Travis.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   "Pastor John, hello to you.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   Can you tell me whether our work today is a blessing or a curse?
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   Much of our work seems to be cursed based on Genesis 3, but a lot of our work also seems
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   to be a God-given blessing according to Ecclesiastes.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   So, according to the Bible, is my 9-to-5 job a blessing or is it a curse?"
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   Let's start with the first work mentioned in the Bible, namely God's work.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   So, Genesis 2, verse 2, "On the seventh day, God finished his work that he had done, and
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   he rested on the seventh day from all his work that he had done."
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   So, God blessed the seventh day and made it holy because on it, God rested from all his
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   work that he had done in creation.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   You can't miss the point.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   God worked, God worked, God worked.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Now, work was not a curse for God.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   God is not cursed.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   He's not burdened.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   He's not frustrated.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   He's not coerced to do what he does not wish to do.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   He worked in creation because it was a sign of his greatness and his fullness that he
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   should overflow in creating a world that declares his glory and a human image of himself that
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   can enjoy and worship that glory.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   That's no sign of weakness or burdensomeness or frustration.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   That's glory.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Work was glory for God.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   So, from the beginning, work was not a curse.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   It was a God-like gift, a blessing.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   The essence of work, as God designed it before the fall into sin, was creativity.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Creative, productive doing, arranging, making.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   When God did his primal work, he created the world.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Now, that's the essence of work.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Then he created us in his image to put us in a world that he had made, and he said,
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   chapter 1, verse 26, Genesis, "Let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   thing that creeps on the earth.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Let them fill the earth and subdue it."
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Then, in Genesis, chapter 2, verse 15, he said, or it says, "The Lord God took the man
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   and put him in the garden of Eden to work it and keep it."
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Literally, the word is serve, serve it, almost like serving in the work of the Lord, to serve
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   it, to work it and keep it.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Now, I presume this working and keeping of the garden before the fall was a partial fulfillment
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   of having dominion over the earth and subduing it.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Now, what does that imply then?
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   It does not mean that the garden was imperfect as God made it.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   It wasn't imperfect.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   It didn't need correction, as if God had made a mistake.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   Oops, I didn't fix the garden right.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   It needs help.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   It means God made the garden for man, and part of its perfection was in providing for
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   the man the raw material for being creative like God.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Man would flourish in working the garden.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   The garden would flourish in being worked.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   It would be beautifully satisfying, not frustrating, not burdensome, not futile.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   That's work before the fall, thrilling, satisfying, creative.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Now, what the fall did, that's chapter 3 of Genesis, what sin did when it came into the
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   world was to make this glorious reality of satisfying work become futile, burdensome,
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   frustrating.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Genesis 3, verse 17 to 19, "In pain," Adam, "in pain you shall eat of the earth
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   all the days of your life.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread till you return to the ground."
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   So, it's not accurate to say that work is a curse.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   What's accurate is to say that the futility and frustration and burdensomeness and painfulness
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   of work is a curse.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Paul said in Romans 8:20, "The creation was subjected to futility."
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   When sin came into the world, God subjected creation to futility, not willingly, but because
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   of him who subjected it in hope that the creation itself would be set free from its bondage
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   to futility.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   The futility and burdensomeness of work, therefore, is part of the curse of creation, and it won't
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   always be this way.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   He said there's a hope coming, and God put the world under this curse temporarily to
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   show the exceeding sinfulness of sin.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   But Christ has come to redeem the world from the curse, and that happens in stages, not
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   all at once.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   This is true for work as well.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   It is really significant, when you think about it, that the gospel—good news of Jesus'
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   salvation—the gospel does not stipulate that work is how you earn it.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   You can't earn it.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   It's free.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   Work is not assigned that impossible, hopeless, burdensome role in salvation.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   This is really good news.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   Listen to the three things said about work in our salvation, according to Ephesians 2,
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   8-10.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Three things.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   "By grace you have been saved; through faith this is not your own doing; it is the gift
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   of God, number one, not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   For we are his, number two, workmanship; we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus,
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   number three, for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them."
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   This is glorious.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   First, work does not bear the weight of having to save us.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   Christ saves us.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   He does it by faith.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   Second, God steps in and does the work.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   He makes us new, and he does everything required to make us new creatures in Christ.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   We are his workmanship.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   And number three, now that we are loved and forgiven and accepted and adopted, we are
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   created for good works.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   So, we were created the first time that he's brought into being as human people.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   We were created the first time for good work, way back in the beginning.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   That was our original intent as human beings.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   And we are recreated in Christ for good work.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   And this work in Christ is not burdensome.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   If we find it burdensome, if you find obedience to Jesus and work for Christ to be burdensome,
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   then you're not thinking clearly, or you're not trusting Christ the way you should.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   Listen to Matthew 11:28.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   This is the paradox of the work that Christ calls us to do.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   On the one hand, we're like hardworking, yoked oxen.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   And on the other hand, our work is lighter than a feather.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   Here's what he says.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   "Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest."
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   Take my yoke.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   Whoa, wait a minute.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   You just said rest.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   What's with the yoke?
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   Yoke is what you put on oxen to pull a plow, and it's hard.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   "Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I'm gentle and lowly in heart,
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   and you will find rest for your souls, for my yoke is easy and my burden is light."
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   So, yes, there is meaningful work to do as we follow Christ.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   That's the meaning of yoke.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   We have a yoke to wear.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   We're not thrown out to be doers of nothing.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   How boring would that be?
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   But in that work, that yoke, there is a restfulness of spirit that is free from the curse.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   The key in all our work, the key that turns it from curse to blessing,
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   and the key that glorifies Christ in it is described in 1 Peter 4:11.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   "Let the one who serves," just say, "Let the one who works,
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   work in the strength that God supplies so that in everything God may be glorified
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   through Jesus Christ."
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   The one who gives the strength gets the glory.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   We get the help.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   He gets the glory, and work is delivered from its burdensome cursedness.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   Or here it is again in 1 Corinthians 15, 10.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   "By the grace of God, I am what I am, and His grace toward me was not in vain.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them," any of the other apostles,
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   "though it was not I, but the grace of God that is with me."
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   That's the glory of hard work in the Christian life, just like it was before the fall.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   I don't doubt that Adam gloried in a long day's work in the garden,
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   making it perfectly suitable to his needs, flourishing in all his efforts.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   "Not I, but the grace of God with me," that takes away the misery of burdensomeness
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   and futility.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   So, when Paul calls us to do lots of work as Christians,
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   he's not calling us to a burdened, frustrated, cursed life.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   He's calling us to our glory and our joy.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   1 Corinthians 15, 58.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   "Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable,
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   always abounding in the work of the Lord."
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   I think that means doing lots of it.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   "Always abounding in the work of the Lord,
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain."
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   It's not futile.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   And I think that applies to any work done in the name of Jesus,
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   for the glory of Jesus, in reliance upon the power of Jesus.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   Not just church work. All work.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   In fact, Paul says in Colossians 3, 23, "Whatever."
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   That's an important word.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   "Whatever you do, work heartily as for the Lord and not for men,
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   knowing that from the Lord you'll receive the inheritance as your reward.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   You are serving the Lord Christ."
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   So that elevates all of our work, not just church work,
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   but all of our work to the level of worship.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   If we do it in the name of the Lord, in reliance on the Lord,
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   for the glory of the Lord, it's not mere human work.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   It's divine work. It honors Christ.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   So, I'll say it again.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   From the beginning, we were made for work,
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   shaping, creating, subduing the world according to the wisdom and goodness and beauty of God.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   This was not, it is not, a curse.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   It is a blessing, and I think it will last happily forever.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   Yeah, an important concluding word there, hinting about work in the new creation.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   And thank you for joining us today.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   Ask a question of your own.

[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   Speaking of our work, God's plan for the globe and God's plan for your life
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   are all one unified plan.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   And we will look at that plan more closely on Wednesday in our place in it.
