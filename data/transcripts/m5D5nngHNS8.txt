[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.520]   A podcast listener named Ian writes in to ask this, "Pastor John, like many Christians,
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.360]   as part of Scripture I have always struggled with the Canaanite genocide. I feel like I
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.880]   understand why God commanded Israel to cleanse the land of pagan influence to protect them
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.260]   from the potential idolatries. But my question is this, when we see ISIS and other terrorist
[00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.880]   organizations essentially doing the same thing for what they consider to be the same reason,
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.660]   purging the land of infidels by the command of God, how can Christians take the moral
[00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.020]   high ground and condemn this modern genocide?"
[00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.820]   It's interesting, I've been thinking about that question recently, thinking I've got
[00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.900]   to write a blog about this because it seems so not only relevant, but increasingly relevant
[00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:54.860]   on to the end of the age. I just think this kind of question is going to be imperative
[00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.500]   to answer. So I'm glad I've been pushed a little bit to think about it some more.
[00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:09.060]   So first, let's clarify. There are similarities and dissimilarities between what ISIS is doing
[00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.180]   and what Joshua, as they entered the Promised Land, did. A couple of similarities. Both
[00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.900]   killed people, even in horrible ways, men, women, and children. There's no sense in trying
[00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:30.660]   to whitewash what happened there. God told Joshua to clean house on the Canaanites. Number
[00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:37.900]   two, both believed that they were killing people who ought to be killed and whom God
[00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.260]   had commanded them to kill.
[00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:48.980]   Ian said in his question that one reason God ordained this through Joshua was to protect
[00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:55.480]   them from idolatry. That's true, but that's not what made it just and right. What made
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:02.940]   it just was that these nations had sinned against God for so long and so deeply. God
[00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:10.440]   said to Abraham, a key verse, Genesis 15, 16, that the Jews would come back from Israel
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.580]   and they would perform his judgment. And here's what he said, "They shall come back here in
[00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:24.580]   the fourth generation, for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete." In other
[00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:31.940]   words, God was timing his judgment on the peoples of the land at a point where it would
[00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:41.220]   be perfectly right and just for him to work a horrific judgment because of the fullness
[00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:49.940]   of their sins. And God warned Israel not to think that God's punishment was owing to Jewish
[00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:56.540]   righteousness, but rather was owing to pagan wickedness. And the key text there is Deuteronomy
[00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:03.260]   9, 4, "Do not say in your heart after the Lord your God has thrust them out before you,
[00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:09.300]   it is because of my righteousness that the Lord has brought me to possess this land,
[00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:15.100]   whereas it is because of the wickedness of these nations that the Lord is driving them
[00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:21.660]   out before you." Not because of your righteousness or the uprightness of your heart are you going
[00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.300]   in to possess the land, but because of the wickedness of these nations the Lord your
[00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:32.660]   God is driving them out from before you and that he may confirm the word that the Lord
[00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:39.780]   swore to your father, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. So today we look back and we approve
[00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:49.780]   of God's right to punish the wicked and in those days to use a human instrument, namely
[00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:56.180]   Joshua and his armies, the Jews, to carry out his kingship over the land and his right
[00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:06.540]   to punish. That was God's way in that day. However, that's not his way today. So we need
[00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:14.460]   to consider two massive differences between Isis killing today and what Joshua did in
[00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:20.020]   that day and would not do today. So this is my answer to the question, "How do we take
[00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:28.500]   the moral high ground here?" So two differences. Number one, Isis does not serve the true God.
[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:37.060]   Joshua did. We know that Isis does not serve the true God because Jesus has come into the
[00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:48.100]   world from God as the Son of God and the Messiah and he has made himself the litmus test for
[00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:53.980]   who truly knows God and loves God and worships God. For example, John 5.42, "I know that
[00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:59.340]   you do not have the love of God within you, for I have come in my Father's name and you
[00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:04.620]   don't receive me." Anybody who does not receive Jesus as the Son of God does not love
[00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:13.060]   God. John 5.42. John 5.23, "Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father
[00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:20.460]   who sent him. Therefore, Isis, not honoring the Son of God, does not know and honor God."
[00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.660]   John 8.19, "If you knew me, you would know my Father. They didn't know him." Isis
[00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:31.220]   doesn't know Jesus for who he really is. They reject him for who he really is, and
[00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:36.860]   therefore they don't know the Father. John 8.42, "If God were your Father, you would
[00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.620]   love me." Isis does not have God as their Father because they don't love the Jesus
[00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:49.380]   of the Bible. 1 John 5.12, "Whoever does not have the Son does not have life." Isis
[00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.980]   doesn't have eternal life. They're lost. They're perishing because they don't have
[00:05:52.980 --> 00:06:01.300]   the Son of God. All these texts mean that whoever does not have love and honor and know
[00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:08.380]   and have the Son of God as their Savior, as their Lord, as God, does not love, does not
[00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:14.660]   know, does not worship, does not honor, does not have the true God. Therefore, Isis does
[00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:21.260]   not serve the true God because they do not serve Jesus Christ as their Savior and their
[00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:27.260]   God. They do not have the moral high ground. They occupy the low ground of treason against
[00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:34.580]   the God of heaven. That's the first difference. Joshua served the true God. Isis doesn't
[00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:45.400]   serve the true God. Second difference, and the first one leads to it. Joshua was performing
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:55.660]   God's will then in a way that would not be God's will now. That was then, this is
[00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:03.580]   now, and Isis is failing to make that distinction, as though the way Joshua acted before the
[00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:09.260]   coming of the Son of God is the way it is appropriate to act after the coming of the
[00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:14.580]   Son of God. But the New Testament makes crystal clear, with the coming of Christ, massive
[00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:21.100]   changes entered the world in the way God deals with the world. And I'll just mention two.
[00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:27.940]   There's lots more, but these are the ones most relevant for Isis and the difference
[00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:34.140]   that Isis has from what God calls us to be and to do today. They don't take either
[00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:41.040]   of these into account. Number one, God no longer works through a people who are a political
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:49.860]   state or an ethnic entity to perform his kingdom-spreading, saving work. In the days of Joshua, God was
[00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:56.940]   the king over an ethnic people, Israel, who had a political identity as a state, among
[00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:03.260]   other political states. That is not the way God works in the world since the coming of
[00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:08.540]   Jesus. And here's a key text, Matthew 21, 43. "I tell you," Jesus is talking, "I
[00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:14.420]   tell you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you, Israel, and given to a people
[00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:21.420]   producing its fruits." In the context, that means God is no longer dealing with Israel
[00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:26.140]   as the embodiment, ethnically and politically, of his kingdom on the earth. He's giving
[00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:33.100]   it to a people who produce its fruits, namely, the Church of Jesus Christ. And since God
[00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:40.200]   works through his Spirit by his Word in a people called the Church, they have no status
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:46.540]   as a political state, and they have no singular ethnic identity. That's the new way that
[00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:53.300]   has come about since the coming of Jesus. God does no longer work as a king, exerting
[00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:58.740]   immediate authority over a people gathered as a political state or as a single ethnic
[00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:03.660]   identity. And here's the second big difference in the change, and this is probably the most
[00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:15.380]   decisive. Since Christ came, the kingdom of God is not now of this world and does not
[00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:23.260]   spread by the sword or the bullet or the bomb. And the key text is John 18, 36. Jesus said,
[00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:28.540]   "My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would
[00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:34.580]   be fighting that I might not be delivered over to the Jews, but my kingdom is not of
[00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:42.820]   this world." Therefore, it's wrong, it's sinful today to use violence and force and
[00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:50.980]   coercion to try to spread the faith in Jesus Christ, faith in Christ, the Son of God. That's
[00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:57.740]   the mark. Faith is the mark of God's people, and it cannot be coerced by sword or bullet
[00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:08.100]   or bomb. No force will be used in establishing God's kingdom on the earth until King Jesus
[00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:13.340]   steps out. When he appears on the clouds, he alone will have the right to bring the
[00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:19.420]   punishment that he now will give, and he will make clear that he has the sovereign rights,
[00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:25.720]   and he will destroy all his enemies. But until then, Christians die to spread the gospel.
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:34.320]   We do not kill to spread the gospel. And if Obama orders a destructive strike against
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:43.700]   ISIS militarily with a bomb, it's not because they are Muslims and have a faith, a particular
[00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:49.700]   sign. It's because they're murderers. It's not in the service of compelling faith, like
[00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:54.980]   Western faith is going to be spread by the dropping of a bomb. That's not at all. Christian
[00:10:54.980 --> 00:11:01.060]   faith is not Western. It's not spread by dropping bombs. The dropping of that bomb
[00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:07.420]   is not the spreading of a faith, it's the preventing of the destruction of life and
[00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:14.740]   the removal of the possibility of any faith, Muslim or Christian. So we approve of God's
[00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:21.420]   rights to punish sin the way he did through Joshua. But we do not approve of anything
[00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:28.380]   like that today, because Messiah has come and put the advance of his kingdom on a different
[00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:31.740]   footing of gospel proclamation.
[00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:37.500]   >>Amen. And he's coming back. Thank you, Pastor John. What an end to this week. We
[00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:42.060]   will return on Monday to try and reconcile two passages that seem to be in tension, 1
[00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:46.700]   Corinthians 12.3 and Matthew 7.21. Some of you know just how perplexing these passages
[00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:50.620]   are to try and put together. I'm your host, Tony Reinke. Have a wonderful weekend.
[00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:51.620]   >>Thank you.
[00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:51.620]   >>Thank you.
[00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:52.620]   [END]
