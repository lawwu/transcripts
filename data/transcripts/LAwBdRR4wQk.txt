[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.220]   Welcome to Huberman Lab Essentials,
[00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.040]   where we revisit past episodes
[00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.220]   for the most potent and actionable science-based tools
[00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.000]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.880]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.560]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.080]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.740]   Today, we are going to talk all about
[00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.180]   attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD.
[00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.140]   Now, just a quick reminder
[00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.540]   that anytime we discuss a psychiatric disorder,
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.500]   it's important that we remember
[00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.960]   that all of us have the temptation to self-diagnose
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.320]   or to diagnose others.
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.600]   The clear and real diagnosis of ADHD
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.460]   really should be carried out by a psychiatrist,
[00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.900]   a physician, or a very well-trained clinical psychologist.
[00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.480]   So right now, the current estimates
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.960]   are that about one in 10 children,
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.960]   and probably more, have ADHD.
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.880]   Now, fortunately, about half of those
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.920]   will resolve with proper treatment,
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.540]   but the other half typically don't.
[00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.120]   The other thing that we are seeing a lot nowadays
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.560]   is increased levels of ADHD in adults.
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.520]   For sake of today's discussion,
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.000]   attention, focus, and concentration
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.660]   are essentially the same thing.
[00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.540]   So people with ADHD have trouble holding their attention.
[00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.380]   What is attention?
[00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.140]   Well, attention is perception.
[00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.260]   It's how we are perceiving the sensory world.
[00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.080]   For instance, right now, you're hearing sound waves.
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.440]   You are seeing things.
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.060]   You are sensing things against your skin,
[00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.960]   but you are only paying attention to some of those.
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.020]   And the ones that you're paying attention to
[00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.160]   are your perceptions.
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.100]   So if you hear my voice, you are perceiving my voice.
[00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.020]   You are not paying attention to your other senses
[00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.640]   at the moment, okay?
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.420]   You might even be outside in a breeze.
[00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.580]   And until I said that,
[00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.440]   you might not be perceiving that breeze,
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.400]   but your body was sensing it all along.
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.320]   So attention and focus are more or less the same thing,
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.140]   but impulse control is something separate
[00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.760]   because impulse control requires pushing out
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.180]   or putting the blinders on to sensory events
[00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.900]   in our environment.
[00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.800]   It means lack of perception.
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.480]   Impulse control is about limiting our perception.
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.680]   People with ADHD have poor attention
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.260]   and they have high levels of impulsivity.
[00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.060]   Yes, they are distractible.
[00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.520]   Yes, they are impulsive.
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.560]   Yes, they are easily annoyed
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.340]   by things happening in the room.
[00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.020]   They sometimes have a high level of emotionality as well.
[00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.300]   However, people with ADHD can have a hyper focus,
[00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.700]   an incredible ability to focus on things
[00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.120]   that they really enjoy or are intrigued by.
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.680]   Now, this is a very important point
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.360]   because people with ADHD have the capacity to attend,
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.160]   but they can't engage that attention
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.440]   for things that they don't really, really want to do.
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.280]   There are a couple of other things
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.740]   that people with ADHD display quite often.
[00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.660]   One is challenges with time perception.
[00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.700]   People with ADHD often run late.
[00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.740]   They often procrastinate.
[00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.900]   But what's interesting and surprising
[00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.740]   is that if they are given a deadline,
[00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.660]   they actually can perceive time very well.
[00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.340]   And they often can focus very well
[00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.540]   if the consequences of not completing a task
[00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.520]   or not attending are severe enough.
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.440]   If they're not really concerned
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.220]   about a deadline or a consequence,
[00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.020]   well, then they tend to lose track of time
[00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.760]   and they tend to underestimate
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.360]   how long things will take.
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.320]   The other thing that people with ADHD
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.900]   have real trouble with is so-called working memory.
[00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.680]   Now, you might think that people with ADHD
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.200]   would have really poor memories,
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.640]   but in fact, that's not the case.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.200]   People with ADHD often can have a terrific memory
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.280]   for past events.
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.760]   They can remember upcoming events quite well.
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.240]   Their memory is clearly working.
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.520]   However, one aspect of memory in particular
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.400]   that we call working memory is often disrupted.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.440]   Working memory is the ability
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.200]   to keep specific information online,
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.540]   to recycle it in your brain over and over again
[00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.500]   so that you can use it in the immediate or short term.
[00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.160]   A good example of this would be you meet somebody,
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.380]   they tell you their name,
[00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.220]   they give you their phone number verbally,
[00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.240]   and you have to walk back to your phone
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.360]   and enter it into your phone.
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:22.820]   People without ADHD might have to put some effort into it.
[00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.060]   It might feel like a bit of a struggle,
[00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.740]   but typically they would be able to recite
[00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.460]   that phone number in their mind over and over
[00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.140]   and then put it into their phone.
[00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.000]   People with ADHD tend to lose the ability
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   or lack the ability to remember things
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.660]   that they just need to keep online
[00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.960]   for anywhere from 10 seconds to a minute or two.
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.660]   Okay, so we've more or less established
[00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.540]   the kind of menu of items
[00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.540]   that people with ADHD tend to have.
[00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:46.680]   Some have all of them,
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.180]   some have just a subset of them.
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.160]   Their severity can range from very intense to mild,
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.560]   but in general,
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.220]   it's challenges with attention and focus,
[00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.140]   challenges with impulse control.
[00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.660]   They get annoyed easily.
[00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.180]   They have kind of an impulsivity.
[00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:03.520]   They can't stay on task.
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.020]   Time perception can be off.
[00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.000]   And they have a hard time with anything that's mundane
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.080]   that they're not really interested in.
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.900]   But again,
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.880]   I just want to highlight
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.900]   that people with ADHD are able
[00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.940]   to obtain heightened levels of focus,
[00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.000]   even hyper-focus for things that are exciting to them
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.900]   and that they really want to engage in.
[00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.960]   So let's drill into this issue
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.480]   of why people with ADHD
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.700]   actually can focus very intensely
[00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.260]   on things that they enjoy
[00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:30.640]   and are curious about.
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:31.540]   Now,
[00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.440]   enjoyment and curiosity,
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.420]   they're just the way
[00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.320]   that we describe our human experience
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.500]   of liking things,
[00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.320]   wanting to know more about them.
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.840]   But from a neurobiological perspective,
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.040]   they have a very clear identity and signature,
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.920]   and that's dopamine.
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.540]   Dopamine is released from neurons.
[00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.260]   It's what we call a neuromodulator.
[00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:52.720]   And in particular,
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.720]   dopamine creates a heightened state of focus.
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.540]   It tends to contract our visual world
[00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.980]   and it tends to make us pay attention
[00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:03.560]   to things that are outside
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.240]   and beyond the confines of our skin.
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.000]   It's what we call exteroception.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.680]   So as I mentioned earlier,
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.240]   you have all these senses coming in
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.700]   and you can only perceive some of them
[00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:14.860]   because you're only paying attention
[00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:15.780]   to some of them.
[00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.400]   Dopamine,
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.480]   when it's released in our brain,
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.340]   tends to turn on areas of our brain
[00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.520]   that narrow our visual focus
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.180]   and our auditory focus.
[00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.840]   So it creates a cone of auditory attention
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:29.640]   that's very narrow.
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.100]   It creates a tunnel of visual attention
[00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:32.960]   that's very narrow.
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.900]   Whereas when we have less dopamine,
[00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.340]   we tend to view the entire world.
[00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.480]   We tend to see the whole scene that we are in.
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.400]   We tend to hear everything all at once.
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.340]   So as I describe this,
[00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.220]   hopefully you're already starting to see
[00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.340]   and understand how having dopamine release
[00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.840]   can allow a person,
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.740]   whether or not they have ADHD or not,
[00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:57.380]   to direct their attention to particular things
[00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:58.120]   in their environment.
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.040]   All right.
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.320]   So now what we're doing
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.180]   is we're moving away from attention
[00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.780]   as this kind of vague, ambiguous term,
[00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:07.840]   and we're giving it a neurochemical identity, dopamine,
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.560]   and we are giving it a neural circuit identity.
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.320]   And just to put a little bit of flavor and detail
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.940]   on which neural circuits those are,
[00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:19.060]   I want to discuss two general types of neural circuits
[00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:20.780]   that dopamine tends to enhance.
[00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:24.120]   The first one is called the default mode network.
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.980]   The default mode network
[00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:28.260]   is the network of brain areas
[00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:29.440]   in your brain, in my brain,
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.500]   and in everybody's brain
[00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:34.360]   that is active when we're not doing anything,
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.580]   when we're just sitting there idle at rest.
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.700]   The other set of circuits
[00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:40.300]   that we're going to think about
[00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:41.900]   and talk about with respect to ADHD
[00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:44.440]   are the task networks,
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.220]   the networks of the brain
[00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:48.020]   that make you goal-oriented.
[00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:51.020]   And those are a completely different set of brain areas.
[00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:54.100]   However, the default mode network
[00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:56.220]   and these task networks
[00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:58.340]   are communicating with one another,
[00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:00.460]   and they're doing that in very interesting ways.
[00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:03.460]   Frontal cortex, no surprises in the front,
[00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:05.120]   and you have a dorsal, the top,
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:06.800]   and side, lateral part,
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.620]   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.
[00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:10.160]   And then you have a brain area
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.940]   called the posterior cingulate cortex.
[00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:13.380]   And then you have an area
[00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:14.860]   called the lateral parietal lobe.
[00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:16.540]   Again, you don't need to remember these names,
[00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:17.680]   but these are three brain areas
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.800]   that normally are synchronized in their activity.
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.620]   So when one of these areas is active
[00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:23.920]   in a typical person,
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.000]   the other areas would be active as well.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.580]   And in a person with ADHD,
[00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:30.800]   or even a person who has subclinical ADHD,
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.520]   or in any human being who hasn't slept well,
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.460]   what you find is the default mode network
[00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:37.480]   is not synchronized.
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:40.080]   These brain areas are just not playing well together.
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:43.700]   Now, the task networks include
[00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:45.920]   a different set of structures.
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.940]   It still involves the prefrontal cortex,
[00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:51.320]   but it's a different part of the prefrontal cortex, okay?
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.820]   Tends to be the medial prefrontal cortex.
[00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:55.780]   And there are some other brain areas
[00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:57.100]   that the medial prefrontal cortex
[00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.140]   is communicating to all the time,
[00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:01.440]   mainly to suppress impulses.
[00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:03.380]   Anytime you're restricting your behavior,
[00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:07.120]   these task-directed networks are very active, okay?
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.780]   Now, normally in a person without ADHD,
[00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:15.300]   the task networks and the default mode networks
[00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:17.580]   are going in kind of seesaw fashion.
[00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:20.260]   They are actually what we call anti-correlated.
[00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:21.900]   In a person with ADHD,
[00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.520]   they actually tend to be more correlated.
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:26.180]   The default mode networks
[00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:29.080]   and the task networks are actually more coordinated.
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.720]   And we can now confidently say,
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:33.000]   based on brain imaging studies,
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.900]   that when somebody gets better
[00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.520]   when they're treated for ADHD
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.640]   or when they age out of ADHD,
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.180]   as sometimes is the case,
[00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:42.900]   that the default mode networks
[00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:44.060]   and the task networks
[00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:46.100]   tend to become anti-correlated again.
[00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:48.300]   What dopamine is doing in this context
[00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:51.040]   is dopamine is acting like a conductor.
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.900]   Dopamine is saying this circuit should be active,
[00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:55.060]   then that circuit should be active.
[00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:56.520]   It should be default mode network.
[00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:58.680]   And then when the default mode network is not active,
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.360]   then it should be the task network.
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.400]   And in ADHD,
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.400]   there's something about the dopamine system
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:07.680]   that is not allowing it to conduct these networks
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.220]   and make sure that they stay,
[00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:12.300]   what the engineers or physicists or mathematicians
[00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:13.460]   would say out of phase,
[00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:15.080]   to be anti-correlated.
[00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:17.000]   So what exactly is going on
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.140]   with the dopamine system in people with ADHD?
[00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:21.660]   And what's going on with the dopamine system
[00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:24.400]   in people that have terrific levels of attention
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:25.520]   for any task?
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:28.600]   Well, in the year 2015,
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:30.340]   an important paper came out
[00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:32.480]   and it formalized the so-called
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:35.220]   low dopamine hypothesis of ADHD.
[00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:39.420]   It turns out that if dopamine levels are too low
[00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:41.560]   in particular circuits in the brain,
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:44.640]   that it leads to unnecessary firing
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.420]   of neurons in the brain
[00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:48.900]   that are unrelated to the task
[00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:50.160]   that one is trying to do
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:53.000]   and that is unrelated to the information
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.600]   that one is trying to focus on.
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.200]   So if you think back before,
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.980]   you've got this default mode network
[00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:59.280]   and a task-related network
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:01.900]   and they need to be in this kind of concert
[00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:03.980]   of anti-correlation and in ADHD,
[00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:05.120]   they're firing together.
[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.500]   Well, the problem seems to be
[00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.060]   that when dopamine is low,
[00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:11.880]   neurons fire more than they should
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.560]   in these networks that govern attention.
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:17.220]   This is the so-called low dopamine hypothesis.
[00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:20.840]   And if you start looking anecdotally
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:24.800]   at what people with ADHD have done for decades,
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.820]   what you find is that
[00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:30.000]   they tend to use recreational drugs
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:36.180]   or they tend to indulge in non-drug stimulants.
[00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:39.280]   So things like smoking a half a pack of cigarettes
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.340]   and drinking four cups of coffee a day.
[00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:43.820]   Or if the person had access to it,
[00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:46.440]   using cocaine as a recreational drug
[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.520]   or amphetamine as a recreational drug.
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:51.400]   All of those substances that I just described,
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:54.000]   in particular cocaine and amphetamine,
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.200]   but also coffee and cigarettes,
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:59.560]   increased levels of multiple neurotransmitters,
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.580]   but all have the quality
[00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:03.880]   of increasing levels of dopamine in the brain
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:06.540]   and in particular in the regions of the brain
[00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:07.940]   that regulate attention
[00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:10.960]   and these task-related and default mode networks.
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:13.400]   Now, young children fortunately don't have access
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:16.120]   to those kinds of stimulants most of the time,
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.640]   but if you look at children,
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:20.440]   even very young children with ADHD,
[00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:24.620]   they show things like preference for sugary foods,
[00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:28.360]   which also act as dopamine-inducing stimulants.
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:29.440]   For a long time,
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:30.840]   it was thought that children with ADHD
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.660]   consumed too many sugary foods
[00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:33.820]   or drank too much soda,
[00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:38.440]   or adults with ADHD would take recreational drugs
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.020]   like methamphetamine or cocaine,
[00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:42.640]   or would drink coffee to excess
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:44.140]   or smoke cigarettes to excess
[00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:46.680]   because they had poor levels of attention
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:49.700]   and because they couldn't make good decisions.
[00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:51.660]   They were too impulsive and so forth.
[00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:53.900]   Knowing what we now know about dopamine
[00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:56.680]   and the fact that having enough dopamine
[00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:59.840]   is required in order to coordinate these neural circuits
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:02.700]   that allow for focus and quality decision-making,
[00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:07.100]   an equally valid idea is that these children
[00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:10.100]   and these adults are actually trying to self-medicate
[00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:12.420]   by pursuing these compounds, right?
[00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:14.880]   Things like cocaine lead to huge increases in dopamine.
[00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:19.020]   Well, what happens when somebody with ADHD takes that drug?
[00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:23.040]   It turns out they actually obtain heightened levels of focus.
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:25.740]   Their ability to focus on things other than things
[00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:29.460]   they absolutely care intensely about goes up.
[00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:32.740]   Likewise, children who consume anything
[00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:34.520]   that increases their levels of dopamine,
[00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:37.000]   if those children have ADHD,
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.820]   they tend to be calmer.
[00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:41.900]   They tend to be able to focus more.
[00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:45.620]   So dopamine and low levels of dopamine
[00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:48.820]   apparently are what's wrong in people with ADHD.
[00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:52.700]   That dopamine hypothesis is what led to the idea
[00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:55.820]   that treating people, children and adults included,
[00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:58.660]   with dopaminergic compounds
[00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:02.100]   would somehow increase their ability to focus.
[00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:05.740]   And if you look at the major drugs that were developed
[00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:08.320]   and now marketed by pharmaceutical companies
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.000]   for the treatment of ADHD,
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.820]   those drugs have names like Ritalin.
[00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:17.220]   Nowadays, it's typically things like Adderall,
[00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:20.660]   Modafinil, and some of the other derivatives.
[00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:23.800]   They all serve to increase levels of dopamine,
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:25.900]   in particular dopamine in the networks
[00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:28.180]   that control task-directed behavior
[00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:30.800]   and that coordinate the default mode network
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:33.040]   and these task-related networks.
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:34.920]   Let's take a step back for a second
[00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:36.840]   and just ask, what are these drugs?
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:38.120]   We know they increase dopamine,
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:40.160]   but what are they really?
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:44.680]   Well, Ritalin, also called methylphenidate,
[00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:48.080]   is very similar to amphetamine, speed,
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:50.440]   or what's typically called speed
[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:53.260]   in the street drug nomenclature.
[00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.680]   Adderall is basically a combination
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:58.340]   of amphetamine and dextroamphetamine.
[00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:01.300]   Now, some of you probably realize this,
[00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:02.940]   that Adderall is amphetamine,
[00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:05.660]   but I'm guessing that there are a good number of you out there,
[00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:08.080]   perhaps even parents and kids that don't realize
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:10.880]   that these drugs like cocaine and amphetamine,
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:14.240]   methamphetamine, which are incredibly dangerous
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:19.100]   and incredibly habit-forming and have high potential for abuse.
[00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:22.240]   Well, the pharmaceutical versions of those
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:25.400]   are exactly what are used to treat ADHD.
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:27.980]   Now, they're not exactly like cocaine or methamphetamine,
[00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:30.660]   but they are structurally and chemically very similar,
[00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:33.680]   and their net effect in the brain and body
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:34.980]   is essentially the same,
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:37.620]   which is to increase dopamine primarily,
[00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:40.140]   but also to increase levels of a neuromodulator
[00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:42.360]   called epinephrine or norepinephrine,
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:44.280]   also called noradrenaline and adrenaline.
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:45.160]   Those names are the same.
[00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:46.400]   So what I'm essentially saying
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:50.080]   is that the drugs that are used to treat ADHD are stimulants,
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:51.820]   and they look very much like,
[00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:53.720]   in fact, nearly identical
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:56.260]   to some of the so-called street drug stimulants
[00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.340]   that we all hear are so terrible.
[00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:00.680]   However, I do want to emphasize
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:03.140]   that at the appropriate dosages
[00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:06.640]   and working with a quality psychiatrist
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:09.180]   or neurologist or family physician,
[00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:11.040]   it does have to be a board-certified MD
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.180]   that prescribes these things,
[00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:17.100]   many people with ADHD achieve excellent relief
[00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:17.800]   with these drugs.
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:19.560]   Not all of them, but many of them do,
[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:22.880]   especially if these treatments are started early in life.
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:24.840]   So now knowing what these drugs are,
[00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:28.440]   I want to raise the question of why prescribe these drugs?
[00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:30.960]   Children have a brain that's very plastic,
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.680]   meaning it can remodel itself
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:35.160]   and change in response to experience
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.500]   very, very quickly compared to adults.
[00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:40.520]   Taking stimulants as a child,
[00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:42.940]   if you are a child diagnosed with ADHD,
[00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:46.860]   allows that forebrain task-related network
[00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:50.460]   to come online, to be active at the appropriate times.
[00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:53.240]   And because those children are young,
[00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:56.560]   it allows those children to learn what focus is
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:00.100]   and to sort of follow or enter that tunnel of focus.
[00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:02.080]   Now, by taking a drug,
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:04.260]   it's creating focus artificially.
[00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:05.880]   It's not creating focus
[00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:07.680]   because they're super interested in something.
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:10.480]   It's chemically inducing a state of focus.
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.540]   And let's face it,
[00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:14.100]   a lot of childhood and school
[00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:15.440]   and becoming a functional adult
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:16.620]   is about learning how to focus
[00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:17.980]   even though you don't want to do something.
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.920]   So what are we to make of this whole picture
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:21.460]   that we need more dopamine,
[00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:22.940]   but these kids with ADHD,
[00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:26.000]   they're getting their dopamine by way of a drug,
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.520]   which is for all the world, amphetamines.
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:30.200]   What are the long-term consequences?
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:31.540]   What are the short-term consequences?
[00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:34.120]   Well, in order to get to some of those answers,
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:36.320]   I went to one of my colleagues,
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:38.920]   a pediatric neurologist that specializes
[00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:41.520]   in the treatment of epilepsy and ADHD
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:45.320]   in kids of all ages from age three to 21.
[00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:47.200]   I asked the following questions.
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.240]   First of all, I asked,
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:51.000]   what do you think about giving young kids amphetamine?
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.080]   Provided that the lowest possible dose is used
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:58.820]   and that that dosage is modulated as they grow older
[00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:00.760]   and develop those powers of attention,
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:05.320]   their observation was that they've seen more kids benefit
[00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:08.280]   than not benefit from that.
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:10.500]   Now, the fact that this person,
[00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.620]   this now friend of mine and colleague of mine
[00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:16.020]   has so much expertise in the way that the brain works
[00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:20.140]   and is considering putting their child on such medication,
[00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:22.280]   I said, you know,
[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:25.560]   why wouldn't you wait until your kid reaches puberty?
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:28.840]   I mean, we know that in boys and in girls,
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:30.700]   there are increases in testosterone and estrogen
[00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:33.600]   during puberty that dramatically change
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.280]   the way that the body appears,
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:37.400]   but also that dramatically change the way
[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:38.320]   the way that the brain functions.
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:40.500]   In particular, we know this,
[00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:43.360]   that puberty triggers the activation
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:47.020]   of so-called frontotemporal task-related
[00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:48.120]   executive functioning.
[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:51.360]   That's just fancy science speak for being able to focus,
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:52.700]   being able to direct your attention,
[00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:54.360]   being able to control your impulses.
[00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:56.920]   And their answer was very specific
[00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:57.900]   and I think very important.
[00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:58.800]   What they said was,
[00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:03.480]   look, neuroplasticity is greatest in childhood
[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.920]   and tapers off after about age 25,
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:09.240]   but neuroplasticity from age three
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:13.900]   until age 12 or 13 is exceedingly high.
[00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:17.160]   If you have the opportunity to work with a quality physician
[00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:18.620]   and treat these things early,
[00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:22.140]   these drugs can allow these frontal circuits,
[00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:23.260]   these task-related circuits,
[00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:26.860]   to achieve their appropriate levels of functioning
[00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:28.820]   and for kids to learn how to focus
[00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:30.760]   in a variety of different contexts.
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:33.060]   So we've talked about the neural circuits of focus
[00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:34.740]   and the chemistry of focus,
[00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:37.300]   but we haven't talked yet about
[00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:39.800]   what would make us better at focusing
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.660]   and what focusing better really is.
[00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:42.900]   So let's take a step back
[00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:45.820]   and think about how we focus
[00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:47.420]   and how to get better at focus.
[00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:49.500]   And I'm going to share with you a tool
[00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:52.380]   for which there are terrific research data
[00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:55.200]   that will allow you in a single session
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:57.220]   to enhance your ability to focus
[00:19:57.220 --> 00:19:59.600]   in theory forever.
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:02.320]   What we're about to talk about
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:04.580]   is when attention works
[00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:06.780]   and when attention falters.
[00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:09.140]   And what we are specifically going to talk about
[00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:11.640]   are what are called attentional blinks.
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:13.280]   It's not actual eye blinks.
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:15.280]   Attentional blinks are really easy to understand
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.120]   if you think about a where's Waldo task.
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:18.720]   You know this task, where's Waldo,
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.780]   where there are a bunch of people
[00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:22.440]   and objects and things in a picture
[00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:24.020]   and somewhere in there is Waldo
[00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:25.640]   with the striped hat and the glasses
[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:27.000]   and kind of a skinny dude
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.620]   and you have to find Waldo.
[00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:30.100]   And so it's a visual search
[00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:32.520]   and it's visual search for an object
[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:33.700]   that has distinct features
[00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:35.220]   but is embedded in this ocean
[00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:37.080]   of other things
[00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:39.140]   that could easily be confused as Waldo.
[00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:41.080]   So you tend to look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look.
[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:42.720]   When you find Waldo
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.720]   or when you search for a target
[00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:46.980]   in some other visual search task,
[00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:48.000]   at that moment,
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.720]   your nervous system celebrates a little bit
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:53.680]   and it celebrates through the release of neurochemicals
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:54.620]   that make you feel good.
[00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:56.280]   You found it and you pause.
[00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:58.720]   Now the pause is interesting
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:00.640]   because when you pause,
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:03.300]   what we know from many experiments
[00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:05.680]   is that in that moment of pause
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:07.060]   and mild celebration,
[00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:08.740]   however mild,
[00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:13.280]   you are not able to see another Waldo
[00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:14.620]   sitting right next to it.
[00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:16.520]   So what this means is
[00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:18.220]   in attending to something,
[00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:19.140]   in searching,
[00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:22.440]   and in identifying a visual target,
[00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:24.380]   your attention blinked.
[00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:25.840]   It shut off for a second.
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:28.940]   If you see something that you're looking for
[00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:30.580]   or you're very interested in something,
[00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:33.240]   you are definitely missing other information
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:37.480]   in part because you're over-focusing on something.
[00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:40.000]   And this leads to a very interesting hypothesis
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.500]   about what might go wrong in ADHD
[00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:46.360]   where we've always thought that they cannot focus,
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:48.220]   and yet we know they can focus on things
[00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:49.700]   they care very much about.
[00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:52.360]   Well, maybe, just maybe,
[00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:55.520]   they are experiencing more attentional blinks
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:57.820]   than people who do not have ADHD.
[00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:00.480]   And indeed, there are data now
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:01.920]   to support the possibility
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:03.620]   that that's actually what's happening.
[00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:05.620]   So what they really need
[00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:09.140]   is this property that we call open monitoring.
[00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:10.120]   First of all,
[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:15.780]   your visual system has two modes of processing.
[00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:17.540]   It can be highly focused,
[00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:18.560]   a soda straw view.
[00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:21.580]   However, there's also a property of your visual system
[00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:23.300]   that allows you to dilate your gaze
[00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:24.840]   to be in so-called panoramic vision.
[00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:27.320]   Panoramic vision is actually mediated
[00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:30.540]   by a separate stream or set of neural circuits
[00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:32.180]   going from the eye into the brain.
[00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:34.340]   And it's a stream or set of circuits
[00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:36.620]   that isn't just wide angle view.
[00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:40.060]   It also is better at processing things in time.
[00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:41.840]   Its frame rate is higher.
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:44.000]   You can use panoramic vision
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.300]   to access the state that we call open monitoring.
[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:50.860]   So when people do that, they are able to attend to
[00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:54.060]   and recognize multiple targets.
[00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:56.540]   So this is something that can be trained up
[00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:57.480]   and people can practice,
[00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:00.020]   whether or not they have ADHD or not.
[00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:01.440]   What it involves is learning
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:02.880]   how to dilate your gaze consciously.
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:04.800]   That's actually quite easy for most people.
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:06.660]   You can consciously go into open gaze,
[00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:09.880]   and then you can contract your field of view as well.
[00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:13.300]   That might not seem like a significant or unusual practice
[00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:15.580]   or that it would have any impact at all.
[00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:20.580]   But remarkably, just doing that once for 17 minutes,
[00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:24.820]   significantly reduced the number of attentional blinks
[00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:26.240]   that people would carry out.
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:29.780]   In other words, their focus got better in a near permanent way,
[00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:32.280]   without any additional training.
[00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:34.360]   Now let's talk about actual blinks,
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:36.320]   the sort that you do with your eyelids.
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:37.740]   Believe it or not,
[00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:41.960]   your perception of time is also changed on a rapid basis,
[00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:45.900]   moment to moment basis, by how often you blink.
[00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:48.160]   I want to just emphasize one study in particular,
[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:51.120]   which is quite appropriately titled,
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:53.780]   time dilates after spontaneous blinking.
[00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:57.360]   They examined the relationship between fluctuations
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:00.220]   in timing and blinking.
[00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:02.420]   And to make a long story short,
[00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:06.160]   what they found is that right after blinks,
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:08.400]   we reset our perception of time.
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:10.000]   Now what's interesting,
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.980]   and will immediately make sense to you
[00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:14.520]   as to why this is important,
[00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:20.120]   is that the rate of blinking is controlled by dopamine.
[00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:23.300]   So what this means is that dopamine is controlling attention,
[00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:26.060]   blinks relate to attention and focus,
[00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:28.700]   and therefore the dopamine and blinking system
[00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:32.480]   is one way that you constantly modulate
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:35.600]   and update your perception of time.
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:38.840]   And fortunately, it's also one that you can control.
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:40.900]   So the basic takeaway of this study
[00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:42.980]   was that blinking controls time perception,
[00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:47.740]   but also that levels of dopamine can alter your sense of time
[00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:50.080]   and, stay with me here,
[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:54.700]   and that blinking and dopamine are inextricably linked.
[00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:57.900]   They are working together to control your attention.
[00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:00.680]   Let's remember back to the very beginning of the episode,
[00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:02.820]   what's going on in people with ADHD.
[00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:06.080]   They are not good at managing their time.
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:08.480]   They tend to run late or they are disorganized.
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:10.180]   Their dopamine is low.
[00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:11.680]   We know that as well.
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:14.500]   And so they are underestimating time intervals.
[00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:17.020]   And so it makes perfect sense that they would be late.
[00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:19.360]   It makes perfect sense that they would lose track of time
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:21.280]   or the ability to focus.
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:22.400]   This is really exciting,
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:25.700]   because what it means is that children with ADHD,
[00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:26.980]   adults with ADHD,
[00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:28.800]   or people with normal levels of focus
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:31.560]   that want to improve their ability to focus,
[00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:35.680]   can do so through a training that involves learning,
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.920]   how often to blink and when,
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:41.480]   and how to keep their visual focus on a given target.
[00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:43.900]   And it turns out this study has actually been done,
[00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:47.680]   entitled Improvement of Attention in Elementary School Students
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:50.380]   Through Fixation-Focused Training Activity.
[00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:51.840]   And I won't go through all the details,
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:56.520]   but what they found was a short period of focusing
[00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:00.260]   on a visual target allowed these school children
[00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:02.300]   to greatly enhance their ability
[00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:05.280]   to focus on other types of information.
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:08.220]   And a significant component of the effect was due to the way
[00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:10.680]   that they were controlling the shutters on their eyes,
[00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:13.360]   their eyelids, and controlling their blinks.
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:15.860]   So what they did in the study is they had these kids
[00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:18.440]   focus their visual attention on some object
[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:19.660]   that was relatively close,
[00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:22.300]   like their hand, for a minute or so,
[00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:24.520]   which actually takes some effort if you try and do that.
[00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:26.360]   They were allowed to blink.
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:29.020]   It only took a few minutes each day to do this,
[00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:31.460]   30 seconds in one condition or maybe a minute,
[00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:34.260]   and then at another station of looking a little bit further out
[00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:35.520]   and a little bit further out.
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:38.160]   However, there was an important feature of this study
[00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:40.340]   that is definitely worth mentioning,
[00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:45.340]   which is before they did this visual focus task or training,
[00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:49.160]   they did a series of physical movements with the kids
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:52.280]   so that the kids could sort of eliminate or move out
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:54.380]   some of their desire to move
[00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:58.400]   and would thereby enhance their ability to sit still.
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:26:59.800]   Now it should make perfect sense
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:01.540]   that these shutters on the front of your eyes,
[00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:03.380]   they aren't just there for winking
[00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:06.000]   and they aren't just there for cosmetic purposes.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.360]   They are there to regulate the amount of information
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:10.740]   going into your nervous system,
[00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:14.180]   and they're there to regulate how long
[00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:17.020]   you are bringing information into your nervous system,
[00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:22.100]   and in what bins, how widely or finely you are binning time,
[00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:24.000]   is set by how often you blink,
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.800]   and how widely or specifically you are grabbing attention
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:30.380]   from the visual world is set by whether or not
[00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:31.960]   you're viewing things very specifically,
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:34.840]   like a crosshair or through a soda straw view like this,
[00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:37.080]   or whether or not you are in this panoramic,
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:40.220]   sort of whole environment mode,
[00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:43.620]   this kind of fisheye lens or wide angle lens mode.
[00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:46.920]   So now I want to switch back to talking about some of the drugs
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:49.500]   that are typically used to access those systems,
[00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:50.400]   prescription drugs,
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:52.660]   and I want to talk about some of the new and emerging
[00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:56.580]   non-prescription approaches to increasing the levels of dopamine,
[00:27:56.580 --> 00:28:00.840]   acetylcholine and serotonin in the brain using various supplement type compounds,
[00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:06.960]   because several of them are showing really remarkable efficacy in excellent peer reviewed studies.
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:12.260]   So before moving to some of the newer atypical compounds and things sold over-the-counter,
[00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:19.980]   I'd like to just briefly return to the classic drugs that are used to treat ADHD.
[00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:22.020]   These are the ones I mentioned earlier.
[00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:25.100]   Methylphenidate, also called Ritalin.
[00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:26.800]   Modafinil.
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:29.040]   R-modafinil is another one.
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.880]   And Adderall.
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:35.520]   Again, all of these work by increasing levels of dopamine and norepinephrine.
[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:39.440]   I think it is important to understand the extent to which they all carry
[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:44.240]   more or less the same side effect, such as high propensity for addiction and abuse,
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:49.680]   amphetamines of any kind, as well as cocaine can cause sexual side effects
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:51.280]   because they're vasoconstrictors.
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:53.760]   So these drugs are not without their consequences.
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:57.760]   In addition, they almost all carry cardiac effects, right?
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:02.800]   They increase heart rate, but they also have effects on constriction of blood vessels
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:07.600]   and arteries and veins and so forth in ways that can create cardiovascular problems.
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:16.160]   The best use of things like Adderall, Modafinil, R-modafinil, and Ritalin is going to be to combine
[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:21.760]   those treatments with behavioral exercises that actively engage the very circuits that you're
[00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:23.680]   trying to train up and enhance.
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:28.800]   And then perhaps, I want to highlight perhaps tapering off those drugs so that then one can
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:32.400]   use those circuits without any need for chemical intervention.
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:36.400]   So despite any controversy that might be out there, I think it's fair to say that
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:43.760]   the consumption of omega-3 fatty acids can positively modulate the systems for attention and focus.
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:52.240]   So then the question becomes how much EPA, how much DHA, does that differ for what's helpful for
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:53.840]   depression, et cetera?
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:55.120]   And actually it does differ.
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:30:01.760]   In reviewing the studies for this, it appears that a threshold level of 300 milligrams of DHA
[00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:05.200]   turns out to be an important inflection point.
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:08.880]   So typically fish oils or other sources of omega-3s
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:11.920]   will have DHA and EPA.
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:16.880]   And typically it's the EPA that's harder to get at sufficient levels, meaning you have to
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:21.600]   take quite a lot of fish oil in order to get above that 1,000 milligram or 2,000 milligram
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:24.640]   threshold to improve mood and other functions.
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:30.480]   But for sake of attention, there are 10 studies that have explored this in detail.
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:36.240]   And while the EPA component is important, the most convincing studies point to the fact that getting
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:42.240]   above 300 milligrams per day of DHA is really where you start to see the attentional effects.
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:47.200]   Now, fortunately, if you're getting sufficient EPA for sake of mood and other biological functions,
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:53.120]   almost without question, you're getting 300 milligrams or more of DHA.
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:56.800]   What's interesting is that there's another compound, phosphatidyl sterine,
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:31:02.480]   that has been explored for its capacity to improve the symptoms of ADHD.
[00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:10.240]   Phosphatidyl sterine taken for two months for 200 milligrams per day was able to reduce the
[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:12.000]   symptoms of ADHD in children.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.160]   It has not been looked at in adults yet, at least as far as I know,
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:22.560]   but that this effect was greatly enhanced by the consumption of omega-3 fatty acids.
[00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:28.560]   So now we're starting to see synergistic effects of omega-3 fatty acids and phosphatidyl sterine.
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:33.520]   So I'd like to talk about the drug modafinil and the closely related drug R-modafinil.
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:39.920]   That's A-R-modafinil because modafinil and R-modafinil are gaining popularity out there,
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:48.480]   both for treatment of ADHD and narcolepsy, but also for communities of people that are trying to stay awake long periods of time.
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:52.640]   So it's actively used in the military by first responders.
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:58.080]   It's gaining popularity on college campuses and people are using it more and more as an alternative
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:03.280]   to Adderall and Ritalin and excessive amounts of coffee.
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:06.480]   It does increase focus and to a dramatic extent.
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:14.640]   I want to emphasize that unlike Ritalin and Adderall, modafinil and R-modafinil are weak dopamine reuptake
[00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:18.000]   inhibitors and that's how they lead to increases in dopamine.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.680]   Now you may notice that I haven't talked much about acetylcholine.
[00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:27.120]   Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that at the neuron to muscle connections, the so-called neuromuscular
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:31.520]   junctions is involved in generating muscular contractions of all kinds for all movements.
[00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:36.080]   Acetylcholine is also released from two sites in the brain.
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:39.920]   There is a collection of neurons in your brainstem that send projections forward,
[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:44.960]   kind of like a sprinkler system that's very diffuse to release acetylcholine.
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:51.920]   And those neurons reside in an area or a structure that's called the pedunculopontine nucleus, the PPN.
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:57.840]   And then there's a separate collection of neurons in the basal forebrain called unimaginatively
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:00.080]   nucleus basalis, the nucleus at the base.
[00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:05.120]   And they also hose the brain with acetylcholine, but in a much more
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:06.720]   specific way.
[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:10.880]   So one is sort of like a sprinkler system and the other one is more like a fire hose to a particular
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:11.360]   location.
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:18.880]   And those two sources of acetylcholine collaborate to activate particular locations in the brain and
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:23.760]   really bring about a tremendous degree of focus to whatever is happening at those particular
[00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:24.560]   synapses.
[00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:27.600]   So now you have an example and you have an understanding and hopefully a picture in your
[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:29.120]   mind of how all this is working.
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:34.960]   Not surprisingly, then drugs that increase cholinergic or acetylcholine transmission
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:37.840]   will increase focus and cognition.
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:45.280]   One such compound is so-called alpha GPC, which is a form of choline and increases acetylcholine
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:46.320]   transmission.
[00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:51.840]   Dosages as high as 1200 milligrams per day, which is a very high dosage spread out.
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:58.480]   Typically it's 300 or 400 milligrams spread out throughout the day have been shown to offset
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:02.800]   some of the effects of age-related cognitive decline, improve cognitive functioning.
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:06.560]   People that don't have age-related cognitive decline, typically when people are using
[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:11.520]   alpha GPC to study or to enhance learning of any kind, they will take somewhere
[00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:13.920]   between 300 and 600 milligrams.
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:14.960]   That's more typical.
[00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:17.520]   Again, you have to check with your doctor.
[00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:20.480]   You have to decide if the safety margins are appropriate for you.
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:26.560]   And there are some over-the-counter compounds that are in active use out there for treatment
[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:31.360]   of ADHD and in use for simply trying to improve focus.
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:36.640]   L-tyrosine, it's an amino acid that acts as a precursor to the neuromodulator dopamine.
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:40.480]   The dosaging can be very tricky to dial in.
[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:45.920]   Sometimes it makes people feel too euphoric or too jittery or too alert that they are then
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:47.120]   unable to focus well.
[00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:50.640]   So the dosage ranges are huge.
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:55.200]   You see evidence for a hundred milligrams all the way up to 1200 milligrams.
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:58.960]   It's something that really should be approached with caution, especially for people that have any
[00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:04.720]   kind of underlying psychiatric or mood disorder, because dysregulation of the dopamine system is
[00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:11.360]   central to many of the mood disorders such as depression, but also especially mania,
[00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:14.880]   mania bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, things of that sort.
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:17.920]   So it's something that really should be approached with caution.
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:20.240]   Everybody nowadays seems to have a smartphone.
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:24.720]   They grab our attention entirely, but within that small box of attention,
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:29.760]   there are millions of attentional windows scrolling by, right?
[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:33.360]   So just because it's one device that we look at does not mean that we are focused.
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:39.680]   We are focused on our phone, but because of the way in which context switches up so fast within the phone,
[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:45.840]   it's thought that the brain is struggling now to leave that rapid turnover of context.
[00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:51.360]   Even though there are trillions, infinite number of bits of information in the actual physical world,
[00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:58.320]   your attentional window, that aperture of constriction and dilating that visual window is the way in which
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:01.040]   you cope with all that overwhelming information typically.
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:08.960]   Well, within the phone, your visual aperture is set to a given width and within there,
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:15.200]   your attentional window is grabbing a near infinite number of bits of information, colors, movies.
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:21.280]   And so the question is, does that sort of interaction on a regular basis lead to deficits
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:25.600]   in the types of attention that we need in order to perform well in work and school relationships,
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:31.360]   et cetera? And the short answer is yes, we are inducing a sort of ADHD.
[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:36.000]   I'm not here to tell you what to do, but I think whether or not you have ADHD or not,
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:41.840]   if you're an adolescent, limiting your smartphone use to 60 minutes per day or less,
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:49.840]   and if you are an adult to two hours per day or less is going to be among the very best ways to
[00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:55.760]   maintain your ability to focus at whatever level you can now. And as I always say,
[00:36:55.760 --> 00:37:01.440]   most of the things that we get recognized for in life, success in life, in every endeavor, whether
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:08.400]   or not it's school, relationships, sport, creative works of any kind are always proportional to the
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:13.200]   amount of focus that we can bring that activity. It is important to rest, of course, to get proper
[00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:19.440]   sleep, but I stand behind that statement. And I leave you with that about attention and cell phones and how
[00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:24.400]   cell phones are indeed eroding our attentional capacities. So I realized I covered a lot of
[00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:31.360]   information about ADHD and the biology of focus and how to get better at focusing. We talked about the
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:38.000]   behavioral and psychological phenotypes of ADHD. We talked about the underlying neural circuitry.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:43.280]   We also talked about the neurochemistry and we talked about the various prescription drug treatments
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:49.280]   that are aimed at that neurochemistry and aimed at increasing focus in children and adults with ADHD.
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:51.280]   Music.
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:51.780]   you
[00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:53.840]   you
