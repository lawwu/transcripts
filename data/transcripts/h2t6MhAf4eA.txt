[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:25.360]   He saw the city as a giant traffic problem. Jane Jacobs, who was a person without portfolio most
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:31.440]   of her life, except of her own powers of judgment and persuasion, she thought,
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:38.400]   "Well, what does the shoe repairman got to do with the grocery store, got to do with the
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:45.120]   school, got to do with something else?" She saw what Moses didn't see. She saw the intricacies
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.920]   of the city. He saw a giant landscape. She saw the block, just the block.
