[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Well, men should not wear long hair. The Apostle Paul says so. But why?
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   Because nature says it's unnatural. But how does Paul arrive at such a conclusion?
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   Isn't nature the reason why men can grow long hair in the first place?
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   Today's question comes from the one and only Dr. Andy Nasselli, who asks this.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   Well, Pastor John, Paul argues from nature in both Romans 1 26 27 and 1 Corinthians 11 14 and 15.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   In Romans, Paul argues that same-sex passions and intercourse are contrary to nature
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   because they fundamentally rebel against God's created design for sex.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   In 1 Corinthians, Paul asserts that nature teaches that long hair on men and short hair on women are dishonorable.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   How do you reconcile those two passages? Is Paul using the word nature in the same way?
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   Or is he using the same word in different senses?
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   It's problematic to see Paul as using nature in exactly the same way in both passages.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   If you say they're both only cultural, then that opens the door to same-sex passions and intercourse being okay in other cultures.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   But if you say that they are both based on God's created design,
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   then you have to say that long hair on men and short hair on women are always wrong in every culture without exception.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   And as a friendly reminder, Jonathan Edwards had long hair.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   Pastor John, how do you respond to Andy?
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   Andy's trying to get some free counselor here.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Well, we'll get to Jonathan Edwards in a minute.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   Great question, of course, coming from Dr. Andy Nasselli, professor of New Testament at Bethlehem College and Seminary,
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   who even as we speak is writing a commentary on 1 Corinthians.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   I'm sure he knows way more than I do about this text and all the others.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   So this may sound a little complicated, and I just suggest to those who want to go deeper and think harder,
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   I do have a little short article on this at Desiring God called "Creation Culture and Corinthian Prophetics."
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   So you can search on that at the website.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   So let me state the problem and the solution as simply as I can, at least the solution as I see it.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   First, let's quote the two passages.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Romans 1, here's what Paul says, "They exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   For this reason, God gave them up to dishonorable passions.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature."
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   That's the word that Andy's referring to.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Verse 27, "And the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another,
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error."
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Now, I think what Paul means by nature in this passage is who we are as male and female humans designed by God
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   with our built-in God-designed natural differences, both physical and, more essentially, the deeper-than-physical distinct realities of manhood and womanhood rooted in our God-designed male and female souls.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Now, that's a long definition of nature, but you can pause and go back and listen to it rather than me repeating it here.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   The implications for Paul are that we should conform our sexual relations to what God has designed our natural bodies for and written on our natural male and female souls.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Homosexual intercourse, Paul says, is contrary to this nature and so is shameful, dishonorable.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Now, here's the text in 1 Corinthians 11 that Andy's specifically focusing on in dealing how women may properly pray and prophesy in mixed gatherings in Corinth in the first century.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   And here's what it says, "Judge for yourselves, is it proper," prepon in Greek, fitting, seemly.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   That's an interesting ethical category for Paul, very important.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   "Is it proper, seemingly fitting for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   Does not nature," same word as in Romans 1, 26, "Does not nature itself teach you that if a man wears long hair, it is a disgrace for him?
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   But if a woman has long hair, it is her glory, for her hair is given to her for covering."
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   She takes it, wraps it up, and puts it on her head for a covering.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Now, here's the key statement.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   "Does not nature itself teach you that if a man wears long hair, it is a disgrace for him?"
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   And Andy asks, "Is Paul using the word nature in the same way," in these two texts, "or is he using the same word in different senses?"
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   And then I think Andy makes a wrong assumption.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   Now, perhaps and probably he's doing this for the sake of asking the question, not because he's got a settled conviction,
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   but I think he states a wrong assumption for me to react to.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   He says, "If you say that they both are based on God's created design, then you have to say,"
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   in other words, if they have the same meaning and they refer to God's created design,
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   "then you have to say that long hair on men and short hair on women are always wrong in every culture without exception."
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   And my response is, "No, you don't."
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   That is not true.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   That's a false inference from saying that the word nature has the same meaning in both texts.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   I do think Paul is using the word nature in the same way in Romans 1 and 1 Corinthians 11.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   At least basically, essentially the same way.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   And I don't think this demands that we think Paul was teaching that any particular length of hair in relation to women is a universal requirement.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   So the key question is, how does nature teach us that it's disgraceful for a man to have long hair?
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   If you think about it one way, nature teaches exactly the opposite of what Paul says.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Male lions have longer hair.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   They have manes.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   Cocks have combs.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   Peacocks have long feathers, and the female peahens don't.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   And the human males left to nature will have just as much hair on their heads as women and more hair on their faces.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   So if you think one way—and Paul's not stupid.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   He can feel his cheek.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   He's not stupid.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   He doesn't assume—I don't assume that Paul is thinking that way.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   I think Paul is saying that nature, that is, natural, intrinsic maleness, inclines a man to feel repulsed, shameful, by wearing the culturally defined symbols of womanhood.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   I'm going to say that again.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   I think Paul is saying that nature, that is, natural, built-in, God-given, intrinsic maleness, inclines a man to feel repulsed, shameful, by wearing the culturally defined symbols of womanhood.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   If I walked into church—five years ago while I was still preaching—if I walked into church to preach my final sermon wearing a dress, high heels, stockings, long floppy earrings, and lipstick,
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   the elders should hustle me off to a side room and with dismay say, "Pastor, doesn't nature teach you not to wear a dress?"
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   And they would be right.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   It would be horrifically contrary to my maleness.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   Nature does teach me that.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   The very same nature that teaches me that having sex with a man is shameful.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   But this is not because kilts in Scotland are sinful or that long earrings on a Papua New Guinea man are sinful.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   This is because whatever culturally defined accompaniments of femininity are in a culture, a man's nature as a male will find this—that Greek word prepon—unseemly, improper, indeed shameful, repulsive.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   And since Andy mentioned Jonathan Edwards, maybe I should cite him because he argues exactly this way in his blank Bible and his notes on Scripture.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   He's got a long section on this with remarkable illustrations.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   I would love to give all of them, but let me just give one.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   Here's a quote.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   "It is against nature in a proper sense to bow down before an idol because 'tis against nature to adore an idol.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   And bowing down by universal custom is used to denote adoration.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   But if bowing down by universal custom were used to denote contempt, it would not be against nature, but proper to bow down before an idol and show contempt."
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   That's brilliant!
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   That's exactly right.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   That's right.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   The universal truth that it is against nature to bow down to what is false becomes relative in its outward expression according to what customs denote adoration.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   So here's my summary.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   "Did nature teach the Corinthians that if a man wears long hair, it is a disgrace for him?"
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   Yes, it did.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   Nature did, because the God-designed healthy male soul revolts against clothing himself in symbols of femininity,
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   just like the God-designed healthy female soul revolts against presenting herself as a man.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   And that revolt from nature is a God-given teacher.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   That's really helpful.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   And I hope it's helpful to you, Dr. Neseli, out there listening.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   Great question.

[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   Well, our friend Jen Wilkin is a wife, a mom, a Bible teacher, and she's the author of a very fine book,
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   Women of the Word, How to Study the Bible with Both Our Hearts and Our Minds.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   That book is now four years old this summer, and it sold 200,000 print copies already.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   Amazing.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   When we return on Wednesday, I want Jen to talk with us about the book and trends she sees in Bible reading and Bible studies,
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   specifically what social media is doing to our time in the Word.
