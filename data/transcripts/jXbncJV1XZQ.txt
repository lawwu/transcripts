[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480]   Hey everyone, this is Tony, and before we dive into today's episode, I want to ask you a favor.
[00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.560]   We love to serve you, and we want to serve you better in 2020 and beyond,
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.880]   and to do this means we need to know you better, and we need to hear from you.
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.400]   And to this end, we put together a brief survey that takes just a few minutes to fill out,
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.120]   and many of you have already taken the survey. Thank you for doing that.
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.760]   We want to hear from you. What do you like about this podcast? What do you not like
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.880]   about this podcast? Tell us. Go online to DesiringGod.org/survey.
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.840]   That's DesiringGod.org/survey. And I'll mention this address again
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.080]   at the end of today's episode, which starts right now.
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:46.320]   Will God give my future spouse a similar calling to the calling he has given me?
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.520]   Should we expect marriage to be a harmonizing of vocational passions?
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.040]   The question is from a listener named Arielle.
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.240]   Hello, Pastor John. As I look forward to marriage, Lord willing,
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.920]   I wonder if the partner God has for me, my future husband,
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.280]   will have a similar calling for God's specific purposes.
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.360]   For example, will he give my husband the same level of desire I have for missions?
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.640]   Is that what God designed for marriage to be, a union of purpose?
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.480]   Or is this naive? Are marriages more likely comprised of a husband and wife who are on
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.720]   their own individual trajectories with unique and different callings?
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.800]   In your pastoral experience, how does this normally work?
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:37.600]   Perhaps I should start with this sentence. Marriage is not fundamentally the linking of arms
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:45.120]   in the pursuit of an agreed-upon vocation. Now, here's one of the ways to see why that is true.
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:52.880]   When you get married, you have no certainty whatsoever that the person you marry
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:00.080]   will not undergo profound changes. Your spouse may become an unbeliever in 10 years.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:09.360]   He or she may totally change his or her mind about what vocation they want to go after.
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:16.000]   They may experience deep depression. They may be in an accident and become disabled
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.880]   and never be able to work a day in their life. They may turn to drink or drugs or sit in front
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:30.400]   of TV every night or just become a total lazy couch potato doing nothing. When you get married,
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:37.840]   you take a huge risk and don't have any way of predicting for sure how this will turn out.
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:47.120]   So, Jesus, unlike our culture, even our church culture, I am sad to say, said divorce is not
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.760]   the Christian response to these unforeseen changes. Matthew 19, 9, "Whoever divorces his
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:01.680]   wife except for sexual immorality and marries another commits adultery." Now, the disciples
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.520]   respond to that statement with typical man-centered skepticism. They say, this is
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:14.800]   Matthew 19, 10, "Well, if such is the case of a man with his wife, it's better not to marry."
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.000]   In other words, if there's no back door to the marriage leading to a better marriage,
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.680]   second marriage, third, then this unexpected disappointment I might walk into is not worth
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:33.360]   walking into. I'm not walking into the front door if there's no back door for a second marriage.
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:39.040]   Now, Jesus' answer to that response, that skeptical man-centered, I could never do that
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:47.840]   response, in Matthew 19, 11 says, "Well, celibacy is a worthy option. Not everyone can receive my
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:56.560]   standards of marriage, but if you can trust me for it, then I will be sufficient to help you keep
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:05.280]   your covenant no matter what changes come." So my point is, marriage is most fundamentally
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:12.720]   a covenant commitment to live as husband and wife till death do us part, even if there are totally
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:23.360]   unexpected changes in vocational preference or disability or capacities for work or changing
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:31.200]   preferences on a hundred things that might alter your life. Marriage is not most fundamentally
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:40.240]   about linking arms in an agreed-upon vocational track. It's about covenant keeping to the glory
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:47.680]   of Christ till death do us part no matter what. Now, to answer Ariel's question, I need to draw
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:54.880]   out some biblical realities about the roles, the glorious realities, of how husband and wives
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:02.000]   in marriage are to relate to each other. For example, God created man first and then woman
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:10.240]   in Genesis 2, which Paul says that order is of significance for the cause of leadership in the
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:17.760]   home, and then God said in Genesis 2.18, "It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:25.040]   helper fit for him." And then in the New Testament, God says, "Wives, submit to your husbands as to
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:30.960]   the Lord, for the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church," Ephesians
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:42.720]   5.22. So these two texts, Genesis 2.18, Ephesians 2.22, these two, not to mention several others,
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:48.480]   point—and I think the combination of the two makes the point especially strong—point to the
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:54.240]   protection and the provision and the leadership of a husband toward his wife. In other words,
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:02.800]   the man bears a unique responsibility for the direction and biblical functioning of the family,
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:12.320]   not the only responsibility, a unique one as the head. The reality of woman as helper in Genesis
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:20.880]   2.18 and the reality of headship and submission in Ephesians 5 point to a relationship in marriage
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:29.200]   where the wife is following the lead of her husband's sense of calling and finding her own
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:40.240]   ministry in that helping, supportive framework. So my counsel to unmarried people would be to the man,
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:48.160]   seek God's vision for your life, and don't be a jellyfish just coasting or floating along.
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:55.600]   See a goal, pursue it for the glory of God. And when a woman comes into your life
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:02.960]   and it looks like God may be knitting your hearts together toward marriage, be sure
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:13.280]   that her commitment is to you, not your vocation and not her vocation. Ask her, "Will you follow
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:22.640]   me wherever God leads me, provided we do not sin? I do not lead you into any sin."
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:27.680]   I wouldn't have married Noelle. I wouldn't have married a woman who said, "Well, I don't think
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:33.280]   your sense of calling should guide us, but my calling should guide us," or "We should split
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:40.080]   the difference and always find a way so that I can do my vocation and you can do yours." I don't
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:46.000]   think that way of relating as husband and wife fits the biblical teaching about how we should
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:53.680]   relate to each other. And to the unmarried woman, I would say, "Look to God in this second most
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:59.520]   significant decision of your life—marriage, Christian commitment is the first—look to God in
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:08.640]   this second most significant decision of your life and discern if this is the kind of man you want in
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:16.800]   the headship of your life and marriage." Now, with that biblical framework in place, I should say
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:26.400]   this. God does not teach that any of His children, male or female, should be without a fruitful,
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:33.840]   meaningful ministry, whether vocational or non-vocational. Nobody, nobody in Christ should
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:42.000]   be coasting. Nobody in the kingdom coasts. Nobody is wasting his or her life watching TV or merely
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:49.920]   playing with hobbies. Home and children are among the highest callings, and there will almost
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:55.920]   certainly be lengthy seasons of life when the children are not home, they're out, they're gone,
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:03.200]   that don't require the total focus. God has always put His daughters to work in a thousand ways
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:10.960]   that bless the church and the world, and what I'm arguing for is that God loves to do this
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:17.520]   within the framework of a marriage where the wife delights to stand by her man,
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:25.440]   support him, help him, follow him, and find in that drama of Christ in the church a ministry,
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:32.800]   vocational or non-vocational, that blesses the world and glorifies God.
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:37.760]   Thank you, Pastor John and Ariel. Thank you for the very good question. Appreciate it.
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:42.960]   And the weekend hits again, and we return on Monday, the third Monday of January,
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:49.520]   which marks our celebration of Martin Luther King Jr., a day fitting to step back and assess
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:54.560]   the current state of race relations in the church in America, which we will do on Monday.
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:00.160]   And our online survey is closing soon. In fact, this is the last time I'll mention it.
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:03.840]   It just takes a couple of minutes and really helps us out. Many of you have done so already.
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:08.560]   Thank you. And if you would give us a few minutes of your time, we would really appreciate your
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:16.880]   feedback. You can go online to DesiringGod.org/survey. That's DesiringGod.org/survey.
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.080]   Thanks.
