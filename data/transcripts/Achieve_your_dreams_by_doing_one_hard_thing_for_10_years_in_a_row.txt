[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai, and in this episode, I want to talk about
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:10.240]   doing one hard thing for 10 years in a row in order to achieve our dreams.
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:16.160]   I think too many of us quit before giving our effort a chance to produce amazing results,
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.160]   and that's really a shame.
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.280]   Imagine working for two, three, four years, and then you decide, "You know what?
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.880]   Ah, forget it.
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.920]   This is never going to get anywhere."
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.720]   But if you had stuck it out for the fifth year, then maybe you would have caught your
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.880]   lucky break or seen some type of tremendous amount of improvement.
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.360]   So I think 10 years is the magical number, and it just doesn't come out of thin air.
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.280]   It comes from four years of high school, four years of college, and then finally three years
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.360]   of going to business school part-time for me to finally feel comfortable having a solid
[00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.920]   grasp on everything finance.
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:01.720]   Ten years comes from my experience working at one firm from 2001 to 2012.
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.880]   After 10 years, I realized a lot of good things can happen to one's career and to one's net
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:06.880]   worth.
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.360]   There's definitely a lot of network effects there.
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.360]   Ten years comes from investing in the stock market and real estate market.
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.200]   Unless you're extremely, extremely lucky, chances are high that you will earn a nice
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.200]   return on your investments in any 10-year period.
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.160]   Ten years also comes from my adventures in battling it out in USTA tennis.
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:36.000]   I was able to get to a 5.0 level at age 39 after starting at a 4.0 level at age 29.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.320]   So generally, after you turn 30, your level plateaus or generally goes down.
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.760]   But after hundreds of hours of practice, it's possible to get better.
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.720]   And then finally, 10 years comes from publishing three times a week on average between July
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.200]   2009 to July 2019 on Financial Samurai.
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.320]   So this is basically a 10-year anniversary celebration podcast and post that I've written.
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.520]   But I really don't want to celebrate me so much.
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.720]   I want to think about ways in which you can reach a 10-year milestone in whatever it is
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.460]   you want to do so you can achieve your goals.
[00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.360]   So to start, I think you don't have to be special.
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:26.200]   Stop thinking you need to be smart or good-looking or tall or rich or connected to succeed at
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.880]   your goals because it's simply not true.
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.720]   Regular people get ahead all the time.
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.880]   I came to America at 14 years old where only 5.5% of the population looked like me.
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.920]   I had no mentors or connections.
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.440]   I had to start all over and find new friends.
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.880]   It was really hard at first because all of my classmates were all friends since elementary
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.260]   school.
[00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.720]   So I was that misfit who constantly got in trouble.
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:59.360]   I ate lunch at the library with other misfits and we got suspended, we got into fights,
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.280]   we snuck off campus to do random things.
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.280]   We were troublemakers.
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.480]   And growing up I lacked the ability to think quickly on my feet because I found my thoughts
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.920]   constantly getting garbled and juggling around between Mandarin and English.
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:16.920]   It would have been nice.
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.120]   It would have been nice to get my English language fundamentals down as a kid but that's
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.480]   just the way it was.
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.160]   My grades and SAT scores were nothing to write a home about and as a result I went to a public
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.160]   university after attending a public high school.
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.640]   And the only reason why I got into a major investment bank, and it was a really tough
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.800]   one, it was a tough one to get into Goldman Sachs, it was private at the time and I think
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.520]   the acceptance rate was like 2% or something.
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.880]   The only reason why I got in was because I got on a 6am bus on a Saturday morning.
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.880]   The career fair was two hours away in Washington DC.
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.600]   Thirty people signed up to attend and I was the only one to show up.
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:02.080]   So the guy, the driver, went to his headquarters and then switched the bus for a limousine,
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.880]   Lincoln Town Car and then we drove up together.
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.600]   That was my first experience having a private chauffeur.
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.960]   So seven months, six rounds and 55 interviews later I finally got that job.
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.640]   I was thinking to myself, really there's nothing special about me.
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.480]   Not my looks, not my intelligence, not my physique, not my wit, not my writing, not
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.760]   my voice, not my personality.
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:31.360]   The only thing I did was keep on going and I kept on going until I left work in 2012
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.080]   to focus on financial samurai.
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.000]   So I really believe grit is by far the most important attribute to achieving your goals.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.080]   Don't think you need to have special skills to get ahead.
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.720]   Who you are is good enough already.
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.800]   And if you last, if you last for 10 years, if you last for at least 5 years, you're going
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.000]   to eventually catch your lucky break.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.560]   It's impossible, I think it's practically impossible to dedicate so much of your time
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.760]   to your craft and not get noticed by somebody.
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:00.760]   Success is a numbers game.
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.580]   The more you put yourself out there, the more successful you will be.
[00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.480]   If your success rate is 1%, you've got to ask 100 people to go out on a date with you
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.480]   before you can get just one yes.
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:18.720]   My lucky break came in 2010 when the LA Times profiled financial samurai because I wrote
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.880]   an article about umbrella policy, the importance of an umbrella policy if you have teenagers.
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.880]   That was totally all random lucky break.
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.560]   But once financial samurai got featured in a legitimate paper, other journalists started
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.560]   reaching out.
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.000]   Another thing you need to do is cherish the criticism.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.580]   If you're getting criticized, know that what you're doing is making a difference.
[00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.700]   People who don't care, don't criticize.
[00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.520]   They couldn't give two craps about what you're doing.
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.440]   Listen to what your critics are saying and make any necessary changes.
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:58.640]   If you have a chance, go watch Randy Pausch's YouTube video called The Last Lecture.
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.700]   It is so powerful, it is so important, and it's so relevant today than ever before.
[00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.500]   It's one of the best videos you could ever watch.
[00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:11.840]   For some reason, I get pumped anytime someone throws a nasty gram at me or says something
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:12.840]   bad.
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:13.840]   I don't know why.
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:14.840]   I just love criticism.
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.500]   It's like getting a dose of Popeye's spinach that motivates me to keep on going.
[00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:23.960]   One time I got mobbed on Twitter for saying I was a high school tennis coach, which I
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:30.480]   was and I still am, and I make $1,100 a month, which is the truth.
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.860]   And I was just looking for educators to interview to highlight their story and how they can
[00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:38.120]   make it in an expensive city.
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:44.180]   So instead of getting high-fived or rewarded, "Hey, good job trying to highlight other
[00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:48.600]   people in other professions who might not make as much," I was mobbed.
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.360]   So instead, I was like, "You know what?
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.840]   I'm going to write a new post about raising a family in pricey San Francisco on a tennis
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.200]   coach's salary."
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:00.620]   And of course, there was a twist to it, and the post ended up getting picked up by Business
[00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.920]   Insider and a couple other outlets, and it ended up doing very, very well.
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:09.560]   So if you can cherish that criticism, it'll help you improve on your weaknesses and shine
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:13.200]   a spotlight on all your blind spots.
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.920]   Use criticism to get better and prove your critics wrong.
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.160]   A next tip, be a super optimist.
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.920]   When an ambulance wails by, do you feel sad or happy?
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:29.400]   I used to feel very sad knowing that someone was suffering until a friend changed my perspective.
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:35.440]   She said, "Instead of feeling sad, Sam, feel happy that help is on the way."
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.840]   And as soon as I heard that, I thought, "Damn right, that's awesome.
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:43.480]   That is awesome that someone is going to go and help that person."
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:48.360]   You must believe in your mission, because if you don't, nobody else will.
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:52.600]   Do your best to see the positives in every single situation.
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:56.680]   I oftentimes, well, not often anymore, but I used to sprain my ankle like once every
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.240]   six months to a year.
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:04.360]   And every time I would sprain my ankle, I'd think, "Damn, thank goodness I did not break
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.360]   my ankle."
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:09.480]   So find the positives in every single situation.
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:13.120]   Next, make sure you focus on what matters most.
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:19.740]   It is really, really easy to get distracted nowadays thanks to social media, TV, all these
[00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:21.720]   other random shiny objects.
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:25.960]   You must ruthlessly focus on just doing one or two things at a time.
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:31.400]   For me, that was publishing without fail three times a week on average for 10 years in a
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:32.400]   row.
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:38.600]   I can get easily distracted by lots of other things, but I knew if I would just publish,
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.680]   everything was going to be all right.
[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:42.880]   So it's kind of like paying yourself first.
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:49.200]   Pay yourself first, whatever it's 20%, 30%, 50% of your income after tax, and then go
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.960]   free, go hog wild and spend the rest of your money, because you know you've already taken
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:55.560]   care of the most important thing.
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:00.200]   The next item on the list is reduce your time on social media.
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:04.960]   Social media is a real time sick where nothing really productive gets done.
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:07.120]   You know it, be honest with yourself.
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:12.360]   Some people even ruin their lives or their careers based on what they've said online.
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:16.560]   Try to limit your time on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, et cetera, to 30 minutes a day
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:18.120]   or less.
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.120]   Maybe not at all.
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:25.240]   If you've read the book Skin in the Game by Nassim Taleb, there's a great quote that says,
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:28.520]   "You don't want to win an argument.
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.120]   You want to win."
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.560]   Think about that for a little bit.
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:38.280]   There are all these wars on Twitter where people try to convince the other side that
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:46.360]   they're wrong and they're right, and it just goes on and on, and it's just endless.
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:50.640]   What you want to do instead of spending your time trying to convince other people that
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:55.280]   your way is the right way, you need to just spend time living your life exactly the way
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:56.880]   you want.
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:02.360]   Focus on your offline relationships way more, 10 times more, 100 times more than your online
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:03.360]   relationships.
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.640]   They are just so much more important.
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:10.440]   Next, give as much as you can without asking for anything in return.
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.200]   This is really important.
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.720]   The more you give, the more you will get.
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.120]   I truly believe this.
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:19.080]   Too many people ask first and then maybe give something.
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:21.480]   Even more people just take, take, take.
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:23.700]   It's unbelievable.
[00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:28.960]   Find ways to endlessly help someone in your field that you admire, and I promise you,
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:31.720]   he or she will take notice and eventually help you out.
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:37.260]   You've got to learn to ask, and the best way to learn to ask is to say, "Hey, may I help
[00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:38.260]   you in any way?
[00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.120]   I've noticed you've done this, this, and that.
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:43.080]   I would love to help you get better in this, this, and that."
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.520]   That is the right way to ask.
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.000]   Don't say, "Hey, can I pick your brain?
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.960]   I need to know this, this, this and get help on this, this, this, and that."
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.320]   You've got to respect the other person's time.
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:58.320]   You've got to develop that relationship and make them care about you.
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:03.120]   It can't just be a cold ask without any kind of buildup.
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:06.040]   So spend time learning how to ask properly.
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:10.160]   Next, realize some people will hate you no matter what.
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:11.280]   This is really important.
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.960]   You cannot expect to be universally loved.
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:15.920]   Therefore, do not try to please everyone.
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:19.840]   If you try to please everyone, you're just going to disappoint yourself and other people
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:21.840]   because you're going to sound like a fake.
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:24.920]   Instead, be true to your own principles.
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:28.480]   People who share your principles will eventually gravitate towards you.
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:33.600]   Every week, someone tells me over social media, in the comments, or over email how bad of
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.880]   a writer I am.
[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:39.760]   If they don't denigrate my writing, someone will say something negative about my race,
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:45.400]   my sex, that I live in San Francisco, my attitude towards whatever.
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:49.760]   But I keep on going because of my promise to last 10 years.
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:54.240]   And to be frank, I do get a thrill out of negativity because it just pumps me up like
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.440]   I said.
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:59.080]   And now that I have a podcast, people have left reviews saying that I have a terrible
[00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:06.040]   voice, have too many pauses, say "like" and "um" way too many times, I'm out of touch,
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:07.480]   yada yada yada.
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:12.160]   But I keep on going because the only way I can improve is if I continue to practice my
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:13.440]   delivery.
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:16.360]   Years from now, I'm sure my podcast will be better.
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:21.000]   Besides, I'm determined to build an audio library for my children in case I die before
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.720]   they become adults.
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:26.960]   I've already come to accept the fact that some people will always hate me for who I
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:28.320]   am.
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.200]   And so should you.
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:37.600]   Just accept that people will find something about you that they won't really like.
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:41.960]   It's not your problem that they don't like you, it's theirs.
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:45.480]   No matter what happens, you'll feel great knowing that you're living a life true to
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:46.840]   your principles.
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:50.880]   Next, don't take yourself too seriously, silly goose.
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:55.120]   Learn to laugh at yourself, especially during impossible, impossible situations.
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:58.560]   You'll loosen up and be less offended by random things.
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:04.160]   Boy, it sure seems like folks are getting really offended very easily nowadays.
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:10.160]   And can you imagine always getting just bothered by whatever you hear and see?
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:13.080]   You can't even relax and concentrate.
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:16.080]   You probably develop a tremendous amount of anxiety.
[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:20.840]   That's not really helpful or conducive to you reaching your 10 year milestone.
[00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:22.800]   Learn how to make other people laugh as well.
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:26.120]   They'll appreciate you more for making them feel good.
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:31.800]   It'll create this connection, a positive connection, about who you are and that joy
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:33.520]   that you bring to them.
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:35.920]   Next, change your inertia.
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:40.640]   You can always find ways to minimize or solve your pain points to help you focus.
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:43.320]   One of my worries is publishing a post full of errors.
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:49.580]   Oftentimes, no matter how hard and how often I review a post, I cannot catch all the errors.
[00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:53.800]   So as a result, I enlisted my father to help me edit most of my posts for the past several
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:58.920]   years and he's helped a lot and I've also changed the way I've sent out my RSS email
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:13:59.920]   blasts.
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:05.080]   In the past, the email blast would just get sent out with the entire post.
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:09.800]   And then I'd cringe when I saw the errors I did not catch beforehand.
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:13.520]   So now, the email RSS blast is more like a snippet.
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:17.280]   And the snippet, if there's error, it's okay.
[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:22.640]   But it leads the reader to the post on my website and from there, if I see something,
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:25.800]   I can just quickly edit it and it'll feel like nothing ever happened.
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:31.040]   So if you have nagging problems, stop letting inertia force you to do things the way they've
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:33.440]   always been done before.
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:37.200]   Take some time to take a step back to see if you can do things differently because I'm
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.120]   sure you can.
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:42.000]   Next, good enough is good enough.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.880]   Stop feeling like you need to be perfect in order to launch.
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:46.520]   There's no such thing as perfect.
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:48.840]   People don't expect perfect from you.
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:51.000]   You shouldn't expect perfection from yourself.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.400]   The largest, richest, most resourceful tech companies in the world are not perfect.
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:15:00.520]   If they were, they wouldn't push out app updates every week, maybe every other day
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:03.120]   to fix bugs you had no idea existed.
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:05.960]   Go look in your app store right now and see how many updates there are.
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:06.960]   It's crazy.
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:12.520]   If you can get 70% to 80% of the way there, I say press the button.
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:13.680]   Ship it.
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:16.840]   Once live, continuously work to make your product better.
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:19.640]   Next, find your competitive advantage.
[00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:23.900]   If you have a competitive advantage, you can last far longer than those who don't.
[00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:26.920]   Be honest about your strengths and your weaknesses.
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:30.120]   My weaknesses, I probably don't follow instructions very well.
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:35.320]   I have a problem with authority, especially if I don't respect you.
[00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:37.000]   I need some more patience.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:43.960]   As a result, full-time work is a little bit difficult for me if it's not the perfect fit.
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:45.840]   I know my strengths as well.
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:47.840]   I'm creative and I have endurance.
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:51.000]   Therefore, I think blogging is a perfect fit.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.280]   As someone who worked in finance for 13 years, got an MBA, and actively invests in multiple
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:16:01.040]   asset classes like stocks, real estate, private equity, venture debt, real estate crowdfunding,
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:06.400]   and so forth for the past 20 plus years, writing about financial topics comes really naturally
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:07.400]   to me.
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:09.800]   I don't have to force it because I'm not making anything up.
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:12.680]   It's all from first-hand experience.
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:17.360]   I'm also not as driven by money because I had already made enough money before I started
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:18.900]   Financial Samurai.
[00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:24.320]   Of course, I would love to have more money and it would be nice to feel even more financially
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:29.920]   independent, but I'm not super driven by money, which is why it's been much easier to write
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:32.120]   for free for so long.
[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:36.720]   If I started a cooking site, I'm sure I'd quit within 12 months, maybe 6 months, because
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:39.880]   I have zero competitive advantage and no great interest in cooking.
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:44.860]   I'd rather just go out to eat and eat food by an expert than by me who just might chop
[00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:48.120]   his finger off while dicing the carrots.
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:53.360]   So do what you're good at and outsource tasks in areas where you lack interest and expertise.
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:56.760]   Next, pivot if you're not growing or getting better.
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:01.420]   You've got to really be honest with yourself about your own progress.
[00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:06.480]   After about 3 years of working on your craft, if you're still spinning your wheels or just
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:12.200]   simply not getting anywhere, you've got to be honest with yourself and say, "Hey, you're
[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:15.660]   not providing enough value," and you've got to pivot.
[00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.840]   You've got to change your approach somehow.
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:21.280]   When it comes to growing a business, if you're not growing the way you want, you're simply
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:23.200]   not adding enough value.
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:24.680]   It's very simple.
[00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:27.760]   Everything is really rational in terms of business.
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.500]   Find new ways to add value.
[00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:32.680]   When it comes to getting better at a sport, if you're still losing to the same type of
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:37.640]   players, then you need a new coach and you need to work on some new skills.
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:41.920]   And when it comes to increasing your net worth, if you're falling further and further behind,
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:46.680]   you've got to do a deep dive analysis to figure out what's wrong with your income, your savings,
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:48.960]   your type of investments, your returns.
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:52.800]   Maybe you have an overpriced or overpaid financial advisor.
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:57.680]   You've got to turn the bed upside down and figure out what's underneath.
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:01.760]   You can't do the same thing over and over again and expect different results.
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:05.080]   Next, you've got to think much, much bigger.
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:06.080]   Way bigger.
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:09.160]   Whatever your vision is, think much, much bigger.
[00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:14.480]   When we're in high school, most of us think, "Oh, let's hope to get into a great university."
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:19.160]   And then when we're in university, we're like, "Let's hope to get into a great graduate school
[00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:21.240]   or get a great job."
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:25.560]   But instead of thinking about or dreaming about the next promotion or the next job or
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:31.160]   the school, why not think bigger like, "Hey, I dream of becoming the next CEO of a Fortune
[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:37.400]   500 company," or, "I dream of becoming the next great lifestyle entrepreneur or the next
[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:41.920]   great inventor or the next mayor or senator or president of the United States."
[00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:46.560]   If you think big, big, big, you're going to take action to try to get there.
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:50.840]   The likelihood of you getting there is not very high, but you're going to get farther
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:56.000]   than if you didn't think and dream as big as the person who's thinking, "Oh, just the
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.960]   next little step."
[00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:01.800]   So when I started Financial Samurai, I was just thinking, "Well, hopefully it'll make
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:05.800]   enough to fill the gap between my passive income investment, which was about $80,000
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:13.440]   in 2012, and my desired lifestyle expenses, which is probably around $150,000."
[00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:15.680]   This was the plan for family.
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:19.320]   And then after I started thinking, "Hey, maybe Financial Samurai could be a billion-dollar
[00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:22.720]   business," the site started doing better.
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:27.200]   And of course, it's not anywhere near a billion-dollar business, but it's large enough to provide
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:31.000]   fully for my family, my parents, and my in-laws.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.400]   And that's far beyond what I had expected.
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:37.800]   So the bigger your dream, the more you will achieve.
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:41.080]   Next, recognize how lucky you are.
[00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:44.280]   The more grateful you are, the more you will appreciate what you have.
[00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:47.240]   And the more you appreciate what you have, the harder you will work because you will
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:50.120]   never want to take what you have for granted.
[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:58.020]   This is why you see poor folks ascend and work so hard, or first-generation immigrants.
[00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:03.400]   If you can experience poverty, if you can see poverty, you kind of don't want to go
[00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:04.400]   back.
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:05.480]   You want to go forward.
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:07.280]   You want to move ahead.
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:11.600]   And this is the problem with America, I think, because life is generally so comfortable all
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:14.440]   around that we take our lifestyles for granted.
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:15.480]   We eat a little too much.
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.640]   We exercise a little too little.
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:18.520]   We don't work as hard.
[00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:21.600]   Even though we are one of the most prosperous nations in the country, I think we can do
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:22.600]   better.
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:26.160]   And I think we can do better by being more appreciative of what we have.
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:29.380]   Next, always know your why.
[00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:35.840]   Never forget why you are doing what you're doing for so long and for so hard.
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:40.120]   Financial Samurai, when I first started, it was to deal and cope with the financial loss
[00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:42.520]   of the financial crisis.
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:46.160]   Then I began writing for the community to try to help us figure out how to make more
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:49.120]   money and escape the rat race.
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:53.340]   Now I mainly write to keep intellectually stimulated while also building an archive
[00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:55.960]   of content for my children.
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:21:02.000]   If money is your main goal, it's going to be a little difficult to keep your motivation.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.760]   Money will disappoint you because it will never feel like you have enough, or if you
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:13.800]   get to your goal, whatever that is, you'll realize that money doesn't make you any happier.
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:17.440]   So know your why because it will pull you forward.
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:20.280]   Next, know that things get easier.
[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:24.920]   The great thing about doing something for a very long time is that you eventually gain
[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:25.920]   mastery.
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:28.480]   You become an expert in whatever it is you're doing.
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:31.540]   And when you become an expert, things get easier.
[00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:38.220]   And when things get easier, you can actually do more with less energy and more efficiency.
[00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:39.580]   And what happens there?
[00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:40.800]   Your productivity increases.
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:45.920]   And when your productivity increases, your returns are greater.
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:50.300]   The problem is, the problem is because things get easier, you see an endless amount of things
[00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:53.040]   you could do and you could eventually burn yourself out.
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:59.120]   So make sure you give yourself breaks and walk away and separate yourself from what
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:03.120]   it is you really want to do and the other more important things in life.
[00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:06.080]   Next, you're stronger than you think.
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:07.840]   You can do more than you think.
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:12.040]   It's only after challenging yourself to the extreme will you realize your true abilities.
[00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:16.440]   Whatever you think you're doing that you feel is very hard, please, please know that you
[00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:17.440]   can do more.
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:22.400]   I remember running track in high school and puking my guts out after a 200-meter race.
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:24.440]   My coach offered zero sympathy.
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:30.280]   Instead, she said, "Now you know what it's like to give everything you've got.
[00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:32.840]   Now go run a cool-down lap."
[00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:37.240]   And that was the point where I was like, "Well, I guess she's right because I was dying, but
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:42.400]   I guess I had to run that cool-down lap in order for me to finish practice."
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:47.000]   I thought working 60 to 70 hours a week for 13 years in finance was hard until I decided
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.360]   I had to go to business school part-time just to save myself just in case I got let go.
[00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:57.480]   Adding on another 20 to 30 hours a week on top of 60 to 70 hours a week was hell.
[00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:00.520]   It really was so, so terrible.
[00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:06.080]   But I got through it and once I graduated in 2006, working 60 to 70 hours a week in
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:09.480]   finance felt like a walk in the park.
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:14.040]   I used to think publishing something interesting on Financial Samurai three times a week while
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:17.120]   also responding to comments and emails was hard.
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:22.040]   But after my son was born in 2017, I realize now that writing on Financial Samurai without
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:28.220]   children was like getting a full-body massage compared to full-time fatherhood.
[00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:35.720]   And another thing, achieving financial freedom without kids now seems so, so easy.
[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:43.360]   I had so much more time to hustle, to save, to work, to earn extra income, whatever it
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:45.680]   was during all hours of the day.
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:47.600]   I just had endless time.
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:52.880]   Now my time has been cut in half and it's just getting harder and harder because I'm
[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:54.960]   getting older with less energy.
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:59.840]   So if you don't have kids right now, know that life is actually pretty good and seize
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:04.120]   the moment, seize that energy to hustle and make more and save more.
[00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:09.080]   Because once you have kids, I tell you, it is really, really hard.
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.480]   So now I've got to learn how to do both.
[00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:16.400]   Take care of my boy full-time and write and podcast full-time.
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:19.520]   It's not easy, so I just got to get it done.
[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:21.940]   And I know I will get it done.
[00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:27.360]   I hope this podcast has given you some ideas and some tips on how to get to your 10-year
[00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:28.560]   mark.
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:34.560]   My one motto in life is never fail due to lack of effort because effort requires no
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:35.960]   skill.
[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:41.020]   I say this to myself whenever I'm feeling lazy or whenever I want to make excuses on
[00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:44.200]   why I can't get things done.
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:46.160]   Effort requires no skill.
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:47.160]   Just think about that.
[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:49.520]   And I hope this saying will help you too.
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:53.240]   Your ultimate goal is to be proud of your effort.
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:57.400]   No matter what happens, whatever the results, so long as you know you did your best, you
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:01.160]   will be at peace with the results.
[00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:05.840]   Regret is that one nagging thing that's going to eat you up inside.
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:10.360]   And you can eradicate regret if you do your best.
[00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:15.800]   So please try to focus on staying committed to that one thing you care about for at least
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:17.040]   10 years.
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:20.360]   If you do, I promise you great things will happen.
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:25.820]   Sorry this podcast was a little bit long, but hey, you don't get to 10 years too often.
[00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:28.740]   If you like this podcast, please leave a review.
[00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:29.740]   I'd love to hear from you.
