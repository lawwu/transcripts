[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280]   and that you are walking closely with our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, and finding
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:12.000]   much joy in your relationship with Him. This has been a great blessing and a great privilege to be
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.880]   able to study God's Word with you, and we're working our way through some very important
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:24.560]   counseling issues that we trust that you will dig deep and study well on these topics. They will
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:30.720]   serve you well in counseling ministry for years to come, and it's just a privilege to study with you
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:38.320]   in this online format. And so tonight we are looking at the subject of worry, anxiety,
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:49.200]   and fear, the WAF combo, as we called it in our year one training. Worry, anxiety, and fear tend
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:56.080]   to go together and are really used interchangeably in the Scriptures. I guess there's someone who
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:03.040]   could possibly say that I'm really worried, but I'm not anxious at all, or someone might try to
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.960]   say that I'm really, really anxious, but I'm not afraid, but I think all of you would agree along
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:16.800]   with me that if you are worried, you are most likely also anxious and fearful, that those three
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:24.160]   terms tend to go together. And we made an argument in our year one training that the WAF combo, the
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:34.480]   triad, is really dealing with a cluster of sins that need to be addressed biblically, and we want
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:41.520]   to do our best to do that, to give hope and help from God's Word. And I trust that you will be
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:51.680]   equipped to help people change in this area. Just an introductory comment as we began before I go to
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:02:00.400]   prayer. The Bible does give so much hope and so much comfort to those who are anxious, to those
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:10.400]   who are afraid. John 14 verse 25, Jesus said to his disciples, "These things I've spoken to you
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:16.800]   while I am still with you, but the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name,
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:23.040]   he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you. Peace
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.320]   I leave with you, my peace I give to you, not as the world gives do I give to you.
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:35.360]   Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid." And I often think to this
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.960]   last evening that Jesus spent with his disciples in the upper room, and how
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:48.880]   they were tempted to be anxious, they were tempted to be afraid, they were facing the prospect of
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.920]   life without their Master. As Jesus has told them, "Then I'm going away, and where I'm going
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:02.400]   you cannot come." And Jesus speaks to them these words of comfort, these words which speak peace
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:09.360]   to their souls, and he promises them that there will come the Helper, the Holy Spirit, who will
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:16.320]   bring his peace into their lives. And I just think that the tenor and the tone of Jesus's
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:24.160]   loving words to his disciples ought to mark and characterize our ministry as biblical counselors,
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:31.520]   especially as we minister to those who are anxious and weighed down by life's troubles,
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.920]   that God has given to us his Holy Spirit, that we may experience the peace of God,
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:46.320]   that Jesus the Prince of Peace has died on the cross and risen again, that we may have objective
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:54.320]   peace with God our Father, and because of that we can experience the peace of God which surpasses
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:04.880]   all comprehension, and we can face the future with courage and with assurance, knowing that
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:10.640]   our Father will never leave us or forsake us, knowing that the Son has died in our place for
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:18.960]   our sins, and that the Holy Spirit lives in us and will produce his sweet fruit in us as we walk
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:26.560]   by his influence and his leadership day by day. I just think that we as biblical counselors have
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:32.400]   so much hope and so much help to offer those who are anxious, those who are afraid, and if you look
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:38.960]   at this subject from the standpoint of secular psychology, you will find that so many of what
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:47.440]   the world calls psychological disorders really center around this triad of worry, anxiety,
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:56.480]   and fear. You have everything from social anxiety disorder, those who experience great anxiety in
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:05.440]   social settings. You have the issue of PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder, those who have
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:14.080]   experienced traumatic events in the past and who in some sense relive that past experience due to
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:24.560]   certain events that happen in the present. You have the issue of obsessive compulsive disorder or OCD,
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:30.800]   those who seek to deal with their anxieties and their fears, their worries through repetitive
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.960]   behavior. They seek to control their lives or control a certain situation,
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:42.240]   and you have what the psychological world calls generalized anxiety disorder.
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:51.600]   Just a whole host of psychological symptoms and what the world calls disorders that really center
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:06:01.440]   around the triad of worry, anxiety, and fear, and as Ed Welch has said helpfully in his book
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:08.960]   "Running Scared" that the most common command, the most repeated command in the scripture is
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:17.360]   what God says to his people, "Do not fear and do not be afraid." He always attaches that
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:24.560]   commandment with a promise that the Lord has promised to be with us. He has promised to provide
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:31.840]   for us and therefore we have every reason not to be afraid and not to live in fear. So we just have
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:38.400]   so much help and hope to offer on this subject. So whether you are counseling someone who is dealing
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:46.880]   with insomnia, just the inability to fall asleep due to anxieties and the stresses of life or
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:52.720]   possibly counseling someone who is involved with a business and who is just being driven to
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:07:03.280]   overwork and experiencing what Psalm 127 calls anxious toil, just this anxiety mixed with an
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:11.600]   overworked type of lifestyle that results many times in burnout and exhaustion or whether you
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:19.760]   are dealing with someone who lives in the fear of man. Ed Welch has a great book out called "When
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:29.120]   People are Big and God is Small" dealing with the desire to be a people pleaser or a desire to
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:37.680]   live in fear of man. Just a whole broad section of counseling issues are addressed by
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:44.320]   worry, anxiety, and fear. And I do trust that you will be well equipped to handle this issue,
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:50.800]   that you will study the scriptures thoroughly as it relates to worry, anxiety, and fear, that you
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:57.040]   will study both the Old Testament and the New Testament teaching on this subject, and that you
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:06.560]   will be well equipped to help people walk with God through the trials of life. The answer to worry,
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:16.080]   anxiety, and fear is not behavioral modification. It's not just telling people stop doing that or
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:23.600]   stop being afraid. The answer to worry, anxiety, and fear is to help people walk with their God
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:30.480]   through the issues of life. Help them walk with God their Father. Help them know the provisions
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:37.680]   of Christ their Savior. Help them to be filled with the Holy Spirit. And then they will experience
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:45.920]   what the Old Testament calls the shalom of God. Not just the absence of anxiety, but the presence
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:53.920]   of God's blessing and a wholeness of life that comes through the knowledge of God as revealed
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:09:01.520]   in the scriptures. That's something that secular psychology cannot offer. We offer people a
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:11.120]   relationship with God through Christ our Savior. And so we offer the world what the secular world
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:18.160]   can never offer. So just a great topic, and we'll dive in in just a moment. But let me pray for us
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:24.800]   and ask the Lord to bless us in our study. Let's pray. Father, we thank you that you indeed are the
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:31.600]   God of peace. We thank you that you have sent the Prince of Peace, the Lord Jesus Christ, into this
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:39.200]   world to be the sacrifice for our sins. And we thank you that your Holy Spirit gives us peace,
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:47.360]   that the fruit of the Spirit is indeed the peace of God. We thank you that as we trust in you and
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:54.640]   as we walk with you through the issues of life, that you indeed give us the peace of God which
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:10:02.320]   surpasses all comprehension. And we pray that we as counselors will be filled with your peace,
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:10.000]   and that we would be able to minister your peace to others. Help us to come alongside those who
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.480]   are weighed down by life's anxieties. We think of so many in our churches who are just
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:20.160]   weighed down by the worries and the stresses of life, and we pray that you would help us to
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:25.440]   bring to them the hope that is found in your word. And so we thank you for this time, and we pray this
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:34.320]   in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. Well, let me go ahead and read the counseling exam question for you.
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:39.520]   This is counseling exam number six, and the question is, "Provide a biblical definition
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:48.480]   of anxiety and fear. Describe manifestations of anxiety and worry in both the inner and outer man.
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:56.720]   Explain the biblical factors that drive anxiety and fear. Detail several biblical strategies to
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:05.280]   respond to anxiety and fear." So, you see the W-A-F triad right there in the question. Even
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:13.440]   the question itself is using the words anxiety, fear, and worry interchangeably. And so in your
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:21.520]   essay, you can go ahead and note that and use those terms interchangeably, and this question
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:28.880]   is addressing that triad of worry, anxiety, and fear. You'll notice that there are four parts to
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:35.280]   this question. It breaks down nicely into a four-paragraph essay, if that's how you want to
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:42.160]   approach it. Give a definition. Describe the manifestations in both the inner and outer man,
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:49.040]   and then we'll talk about some of the biblical factors that drive anxiety and fear and end with
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:57.680]   some practical helps to ministering to those who are seeking to overcome anxiety and fear.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:04.400]   If you look at page one of your handout, I just noted there are some good resources that you can
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:11.280]   use in your study for this exam question. I know that you're not going to run out and get all of
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:18.480]   these resources, but I do want to commend them to you for further study, and I do think that as you
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:24.880]   work your way through the counseling ministry that you will want to do further research,
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:31.840]   further reading on the subject, and just deepen your understanding of worry, anxiety, and fear.
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:37.200]   The first book you have there is Marshall and Mary Asher's The Christian's Guide to Psychological
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:46.080]   Terms, which I have recommended for your reading in year one. The Asher's have actually some really
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:53.840]   good definitions as it relates to this particular topic. If you look up the definition of panic
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:13:00.080]   attack in that resource, or if you look at the definition of obsessive-compulsive disorder,
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:07.120]   or if you look at the definition, I believe there's a section there on social anxiety disorder,
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:14.400]   you will find both the secular description of that disorder, and you'll find the biblical
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:23.040]   terms that are related to that issue, and they do have some helpful definitions there that
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:30.400]   you might want to quote and use in your essay exam, so just a great work that I would commend
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:36.640]   to you and would recommend that you have on your bookshelf. Elyse Fitzpatrick's work,
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:45.120]   Overcoming Fear, Worry, Anxiety, Becoming a Woman of Faith and Confidence. Some of these resources,
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:52.160]   they are written for an audience of women, but that particular resource is really a helpful one
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:59.200]   and both men and women will benefit from that material. She has some really good resources
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:06.640]   there or some language there talking about how to put off unbiblical thoughts about the future
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:15.200]   that lead to anxiety and fear, and then putting on the thoughts which lead to peace and lead
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:20.960]   to confidence in the Lord. So, I would recommend Elyse Fitzpatrick's work to you. John Piper has
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:28.480]   a chapter in his book, Future Grace, that's entitled Applying the Purifying Power of Faith
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:36.480]   in Future Grace vs. Anxiety. The thesis of that book is that you can apply the promises of God
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:46.480]   to specific sin issues and that the issue behind many sin issues is really an unbelief in the
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:53.600]   promises of God. That's a thesis that we have sought to unpack in our year one training that
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:59.360]   I would love to unpack even further, but if you want an example of that, look at chapter 3 of
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:06.560]   Future Grace, and it just talks about how the promises of God can be applied to the issue of
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:12.800]   anxiety, and that's an approach that I would recommend that we follow as biblical counselors,
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:21.600]   that counselee is usually experiencing much anxiety because there is an unbelief in God's
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:29.440]   protection, provision, and promises. Jesus said, "Why are you anxious?" in Matthew chapter 6,
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:36.640]   and then he said, "O ye of little faith." The issue that is driving much of our anxiety
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:43.440]   is really an unbelief in the promises of God, and Piper does a great job in unpacking that material.
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:50.480]   Stuart Scott's booklet, Anger, Anxiety, and Fear, is a good one to put into your
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:16:00.240]   counselee's hands. It is brief, it is summarized material, it is short, and that is a very helpful
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:08.640]   work that we have used in our counseling ministry. Paul Tochkis just came out with this resource that
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:13.040]   we have just started using in our counseling ministry. It's called Anxiety, Knowing God's
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:23.520]   Peace, and it is a 31-day devotional centered around the issue of anxiety and fear. PNR Publishing is
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:29.280]   doing a really good work coming out with these 31-day devotionals. They're meant to be read one
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:37.040]   reading per day, and I have not read this entire work myself, but I have put it in the hands of
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:44.880]   those who are struggling with anxiety and gotten just some really rave reviews about this 31-day
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:50.160]   devotional. People's lives are being changed as they interact with the material in that devotional,
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:57.600]   and so I would recommend that resource to you and just a helpful work to put in the hands
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:05.360]   of those struggling with anxiety. Four books by Ed Welch. Ed Welch probably has done the most
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:13.280]   thorough thinking on the subject of worry, anxiety, and fear. I really have come to appreciate his
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:20.800]   writings on this subject, Running Scared, which is an excellent work I would commend to you that
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:27.680]   you read, and really I would hope you would get the flavor or the tenor of the counseling ministry,
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:35.120]   what he calls the ethos of our ministry or the spirit of our ministry as we interact with those
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:43.680]   who are dealing with anxiety. Just a very helpful work there, and then he has written a smaller work
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:52.000]   that's meant to be read for 50 days at a time, a brief reading for 50 days in a row. It's called
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:58.720]   a small book for the anxious heart, and that is a good homework assignment to give to counselees
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:05.760]   who are wrestling with anxiety. Some book lists there. Our senior pastor at Kindred has come out
[00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:12.160]   with a booklet, Help, I'm Anxious. That is a very helpful resource to be used for homework
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:18.880]   in our counseling ministry. We have that on our counseling bookshelf, and then as I said before,
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:27.200]   anything by David Powelson as well is worth reading, worth digesting, and just helpful material.
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:33.360]   He has a couple booklets out on the subject of worry, so just a wealth of material that's
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:39.040]   been put out there on this subject from the biblical counseling world, and I hope that many
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:48.960]   more good resources will be written on this subject. Let me move to page two of your handout,
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:55.760]   and just talk through a beginning introduction on this subject, and just note, as I said,
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:02.640]   that the Bible does abound with hope for those who are dealing with worry, anxiety, and fear.
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:10.320]   Jay Adams has said, and we want to repeat, that our task in biblical counseling is to give people
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:17.040]   hope. We want people to have true hope, biblical hope, hope that is grounded upon the truth of
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:22.800]   God's word, not pie-in-the-sky thinking, not the sun will come out tomorrow, bet your bottom dollar
[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:30.240]   that tomorrow there'll be sun, not just optimistic thinking, but real hope that is grounded in the
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:37.520]   all-sufficient word of God, and we want to be counselors who abound with hope. We have hope
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:44.080]   to offer to those who are anxious. Psalm 23, verse 4, "Even though I walk through the valley of the
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:53.920]   shadow of death, I will fear no evil." That is a believer who overcame fear based upon an
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:20:00.880]   understanding and a knowledge of his shepherd. He says, "You are with me, your rod and your staff,
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:09.120]   they comfort me." I do want you to note that there is a simplicity to ministering to those with
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:14.640]   anxiety. We want you to understand the breadth of all that scripture says. We want you to
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:20.400]   understand the breadth of all that's been written on this subject, but I also want to emphasize
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:28.320]   that ministering to those who are dealing with anxiety is not complicated. You want them to walk
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:34.480]   with their shepherd. You want them to know the presence of Christ. You want them to know God's
[00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:42.560]   gracious provisions. You want them to intimately know their Savior and His love for them. There is
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:50.160]   a simplicity to this, of just helping them talk to God about their anxiety and fear, and to have
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:56.000]   them interact with the word of God, and to learn what God's word has to say about their problems.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:03.440]   David said, "I will fear no evil." Psalm 27, verse 1, "The Lord is my light and my salvation. Whom
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:13.200]   shall I fear?" That's a verse that can be applied to social anxiety, or people pleasing, or what the
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:21.200]   secular world will call codependency, but the Bible would call an idolatry of man's approval.
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:31.280]   "Whom shall I fear? The Lord is the stronghold of my life. Of whom shall I be afraid?" I love Isaiah
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:37.200]   41, verse 14, "Fear not, you worm, Jacob, you men of Israel. I am the one who helps you, declares
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:45.200]   the Lord. Your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel." You will note here that the Bible does not just
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:52.960]   say, "Stop being worried," or "Stop being afraid," but there is attached to that command a promise,
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:22:01.520]   "Fear not." Why? God says, "I am the one who helps you." If you would only understand the one who is
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:09.680]   with you, you would understand you have no reason to be afraid or to be worried. This is the same
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:16.160]   language or the same line of reasoning that Jesus follows in Matthew 6, verse 25, where he says to
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:23.040]   his disciples, "Therefore, I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what
[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:29.040]   you will drink, nor about your body. What you will put on is not life more than food, and the body
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:35.280]   more than clothing. Look at the birds of the air. They neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns,
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:43.760]   and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they?" Jesus is reasoning
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:49.520]   with us. He's not just telling us to stop being anxious or stop being worried, but he is reasoning
[00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:58.160]   with us from the lesser to the greater. You have a heavenly Father who is committed to provide for
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:04.800]   you. He even provides for the birds of the air. He even provides for the flowers in the fields.
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:14.640]   Are you not of more value to him than they are? Because you have a heavenly Father who is
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:22.240]   committed to provide for you, you have no reason to be afraid, and you have no reason to be worried.
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:28.320]   And so I just want you to note that the commandment is always attached to a promise,
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:36.480]   and there is a tenderness here in how Jesus deals with his disciples. You will notice the
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:44.080]   compassionate language of Luke 12 verse 32, "Fear not, little flock, for it is your Father's good
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:53.600]   pleasure to give you the kingdom." That's a tender word of encouragement and comfort. "Oh,
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:24:02.640]   little flock, little sheep, fear not. You have a heavenly Father, and it is his pleasure to give
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:09.440]   to you not only everything that you need, but to give to you the kingdom." See the generosity of
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:15.360]   your Father who is in heaven. I really pray that this type of language and perspective would be
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:21.920]   what you bring into your counseling sessions. It's really easy just to say to your counselee,
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:28.320]   "Well, repent," or "Don't you see that that's wrong?" or "Stop worrying, stop being afraid."
[00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:35.200]   But a seasoned biblical counselor will call out sin, to be sure, and will call for repentance,
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:41.920]   to be sure, but will also bring into that conversation the promises of God and the
[00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:48.720]   tenderness of the Father and bring into the conversation the blessings of God given to
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:54.480]   his children through the all-sufficient work of Jesus on the cross, and will plead with the
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:25:01.280]   counselee to abandon the orphan mentality. You are not an orphan. You do not need to fend for
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:07.280]   yourself. You do not need to take care of everything on your own. You have a heavenly
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:16.960]   Father who is committed to provide for you, and therefore you ought not to be anxious or afraid.
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:23.600]   So we have much hope to offer to those who are struggling with life's problems. Ed Welch writes,
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:29.680]   "It sounds that the king actually cares about us. He isn't ordering us to make bricks without straw.
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:37.440]   Instead, it sounds as if he wants his people to know peace." So even when seen as an authoritative
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:43.120]   command, this reveals something lovely about God. Unlike other kings, at least those who have
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:49.360]   despotic authority, God knows the concerns of those in his realm and commands things that are
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:58.160]   in their best interest. Now, we note here that there are many issues that cause anxiety and worry
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:07.040]   for the believer. Now I'm going to bring you back to what we learned in year one, and you will
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:13.040]   recognize this from our year one training, hopefully, the three-tree diagram, which is
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:20.640]   a diagram that's been put out by the good people at CCEF. And I know that you all love this diagram.
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:27.360]   We've used it in our self-counseling project, but you will note that we have used this diagram to
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:34.480]   make a distinction between heat issues and heart issues. And so the heat represents,
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:41.520]   the diagram is based upon Jeremiah 17, where it says that the believer will be like a tree
[00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:49.280]   who will not fear even when the heat comes. And so the heat broadly is used conceptually to refer
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:56.800]   to the external circumstances that a believer faces in life. And we just use this diagram,
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:03.040]   if you remember, to note that we want to be thinking through heat issues versus heart issues.
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:10.480]   What is the external situation that the counselee is in? And then what are the heart issues that
[00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:18.640]   are being brought out by that situation? So you will note here that believers do experience
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:28.160]   situations and circumstances in life, which bring about or draw out an anxious heart.
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:37.760]   Some of these heat issues include financial pressures. There are many who struggle with
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:43.920]   financial anxiety. I mentioned Psalm 127, verse two, "It is vain that you rise up early and go
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:53.920]   late to rest, eating the bread of anxious toil." That phrase, anxious toil, refers to a godless
[00:27:53.920 --> 00:28:02.960]   hype of activity, a striving. It is not just talking about the diligent worker that's described
[00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:10.320]   in the book of Proverbs that is working hard at his job because of a desire to honor God,
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:18.000]   but it's talking about this heart that feels that he or she has to take care of it all on their own.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.720]   And I'm alone in the world, and I've got to provide for myself, and I've got to do it all
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:26.640]   by myself, and there is no God who loves me and who's committed to care for me.
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:34.880]   And so it drives this anxious toil that usually results in overwork, usually results in exhaustion
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:42.000]   and a type of burnout. Well, there are financial pressures that people face in life. There is
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:51.440]   physical illnesses. I want to recommend, I was talking to one of the counselors that I'm working
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:58.400]   with and just recommending Esther Smith's 31-Day Devotional on Chronic Illness and Physical
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:05.280]   Sickness. That is an excellent work put out by PNR Publishing that talks about the issues that
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:11.920]   people deal with as they walk through a chronic physical illness. It's a very helpful work,
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:19.200]   but you will find that that is a heat issue that will also draw out a heart issue, a heart of
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:27.280]   fear, worry, and anxiety. And so we want to be equipped to minister carefully and compassionately
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:32.560]   to those who are dealing with a physical illness. There's decisions about the future
[00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:39.520]   that needs to be made. There is the prospect of getting old and dying. There are just the
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:45.840]   daily responsibilities of life. Sometimes it's not the big issues in life which causes anxiety. It's
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:55.440]   just what's on my to-do list for today. Jesus said to Martha in Luke 10 41, "Martha, Martha,
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:30:01.280]   you are worried and troubled about many things." And Martha was trying to get a meal together. She
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:08.240]   was trying to clean the house and she was worried and anxious about those things. Sometimes it's
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:16.000]   just getting things done today that is causing us anxiety. And so these are heat issues that deal
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:25.760]   with, that draw out the anxieties of life. And there are many types of anxiety that is caused
[00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:30.320]   in relation to each of these heat issues. Now just keep that in mind. I'm going to throw a
[00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:36.080]   number of pictures your way. Hopefully you'll be able to pull them together in your mind. Some of
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:42.000]   this is going to be review. And I think this is going to be helpful if you can put all of these
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:49.200]   concepts together. But let me move to page three of your handout there. And let's talk through
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:59.280]   manifestations of anxiety and worry in the inner and outer man. Now remember that man is both
[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:09.760]   physical and spiritual. We did a whole essay on this in the theology exams where we talked about
[00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:17.680]   the dual nature of man. Man is material and immaterial. He is physical and spiritual. Man
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:24.080]   has a body and man has also a soul. And so as we talk through inner and outer man, we're talking
[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:31.840]   about the spiritual aspect of man and also the physical aspect of man. And we're always thinking
[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:39.680]   through how does the two aspects of man relate to each other and go together. Well, you will note
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:46.960]   that as you survey the secular literature on anxiety disorders, that there are many physical
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:56.000]   manifestations of an anxiety disorder. You will note that the DSM-IV and its treatment of
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:06.400]   anxiety disorders talks much about a person's physical manifestations of anxiety. Now we will
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:13.200]   note that the DSM-IV is helpful insofar as it makes observations about human behavior.
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:20.240]   Secular psychology can't diagnose the root cause of that behavior, but secular psychology can
[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:28.720]   make observations about this is how people behave when they are anxious. And so I think the DSM-IV
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:37.520]   is helpful insofar as it describes the physical manifestations of people who have anxiety. And
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:42.480]   here are some of the things that the secular literature notes. There is an inability to relax.
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:49.280]   You have under generalized anxiety disorder, a persistent worrying or anxiety about a number
[00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:55.920]   of areas that are out of proportion to the impact of the events, inability to set aside or let go
[00:32:55.920 --> 00:33:04.160]   of a worry, inability to relax, feeling restless and feeling keyed up or on edge. I think you can
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:11.920]   include in that many people have an inability to sleep at night. They have insomnia. They're
[00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:19.440]   possibly on sleep medications because they are up thinking through the issues of life. The mind is
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:29.840]   racing with anxious thoughts. You also have under physical manifestations, the feeling keyed up or
[00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:37.920]   on edge, we noted repetitive behaviors. This would be under the classification of obsessive compulsive
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:43.360]   disorder. And the secular literature notes hand-washing, ordering, checking,
[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:50.080]   aimed at preventing or reducing distress or preventing some dreaded event or situation.
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:56.720]   Now, obsessive compulsive disorder, there is full-blown OCD. And then there is what we might
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:34:06.240]   call a mild form of OCD. But this is repetitive behaviors that are designed in the counselee's
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:15.360]   mind to control a certain situation. And then you have panic attacks, which are characterized by
[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:21.920]   palpitations or pounding heart. Oftentimes, a panic attack can feel like a heart attack
[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:30.720]   because it deals with a person's accelerated heart rate. There is sweating, trembling or shaking,
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:37.200]   difficulty breathing, chest pain or discomfort. A panic disorder, according to the secular
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:43.200]   literature, is characterized by recurrent panic attacks. But you do have physical manifestation
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:54.880]   there of an anxiety issue. You have PTSD, in which a person has been exposed to a traumatic
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:35:01.680]   event and persistently re-experiences that event. The person with PTSD can experience
[00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:07.600]   intense psychological distress at exposure to internal or external cues that resemble
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:17.440]   an aspect of the traumatic event. Now, I can't speak to all the full manifestations of PTSD,
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:26.160]   but I use this example in my own life where I was on the freeway and got stuck in traffic and
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:37.760]   was rear-ended by a lady who had a trailer that had a couple of horses in it. And it totaled our
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:46.800]   van. And we were thankfully not injured in that accident, but it was a scary moment of just being
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:55.600]   rear-ended on the freeway. And for about a month or two after that incident happened, whenever I
[00:35:55.600 --> 00:36:02.640]   drove that certain place in the freeway, I noticed that my body was tensing up and that my heart
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:11.520]   started pounding, even though the incident was past and was in the past. I just took that as
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:17.360]   a mild form of when you go through something traumatic, and then you go through a situation
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:23.760]   where something reminds you of that incident, there can be a bodily response, a physical response to
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:31.200]   what you've experienced. And I think when you deal with the issue of the broader subject of PCSD,
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:38.560]   you are dealing with something that is much bigger, in many cases, much more traumatic than
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:45.040]   being rear-ended on the freeway and is something that you want to think through and be able to
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:53.200]   provide some help biblically. Greg Gifford has a good work on PTSD from a biblical counseling
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:58.880]   perspective. I didn't note that on your bibliography, but I would encourage you to
[00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:06.160]   make use of Greg Gifford's work. I'm not sure what it's called, but he does have a work on PTSD.
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:13.360]   And then social anxiety disorders, specific phobias, I think you can note that all of those
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:20.800]   have physical manifestations, even though they are expressions of a heart issue.
[00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:30.720]   And so man is physical, and man is also spiritual. We observe the physical manifestations of anxiety,
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:38.880]   fear, and worry, but that's not where we as biblical counselors have our focus. We want
[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:45.200]   to understand how the physical is relating to the spiritual, but our task as biblical counselors is
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:54.720]   to address the heart issues. We are those who care for souls, and so we want to be focused on
[00:37:54.720 --> 00:38:02.000]   the inner man. We want to note the outer man aspects of anxiety, fear, and worry, but we are
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:09.440]   tasked to focus on the inner man. And so what does the Bible say about the inner man? What are the
[00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:18.480]   heart issues that are expressing themselves in these physical manifestations? Well, this is a
[00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:27.040]   review of year one material. We note that the inner man has thoughts, Matthew 6, verse 31. Jesus says,
[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:33.920]   "Therefore do not be anxious, saying," now this is the internal monologue of someone who is
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:41.680]   experiencing anxiety about the future. The internal monologue of the heart is, what shall we eat? What
[00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:48.000]   shall we drink? Or what shall we wear? These are the questions that are going through a person's
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:58.160]   heart that is resulting in anxiety, fear, and worry. One of the helpful assignments that you
[00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:05.120]   may want to give to a counselee who's dealing with anxiety is to journal their anxious thoughts,
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:11.760]   is just to write out what are the thoughts that are going through your mind in your most anxious
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:17.520]   moments. Or maybe if you are on the verge of having a panic attack, what are the thoughts
[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:22.160]   that are racing through your mind? Or when you are up at night and you can't sleep, what are
[00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:29.920]   the thoughts that you are dealing with? And writing them down can be helpful in just identifying
[00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:39.920]   the anxious thoughts that characterize a person's heart attitudes. And in most cases, you will find
[00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:47.680]   that those anxious thoughts do not include the promises and the provisions of a faithful God.
[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:58.960]   You also have an inner man desires. Anxiety and fear would reveal what you most desire. As David
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:07.680]   Powelson well notes that if you are anxious about financial concerns, then it reveals a desire for
[00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:15.200]   financial security. Or if you're most anxious about physical illness, then it reveals a desire for
[00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:20.560]   physical health. This is really basic. I don't think I need to explain all of that to you,
[00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:28.400]   but anxiety would be the flip side of desire. And the heart is always characterized by desire. If I
[00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:35.280]   am up at night and I'm anxious about my children's education or my children's wellbeing, or what are
[00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:41.360]   they doing in life? Or what are they going to do in the future? Then it reveals a desire for
[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:49.040]   a certain future for my children. And so what you are most anxious about reveals what you most
[00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:57.280]   desire. And the heart issue of that we all face in our sanctification is submitting our heart's
[00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:04.480]   desires to the gracious authority of the Lord Jesus Christ. But as you look at the number of
[00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:12.880]   ways that fear presents itself, you will find that the heart is always desiring a certain outcome
[00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:19.280]   or a certain thing. And that brings us to values. Again, this is a little bit of review of year one
[00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:28.640]   material, but the heart has treasures or values. You will note what you tend to worship when you
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:37.360]   see what you are most anxious about. Sinfully, that is where you will find the idolatry of the
[00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:44.640]   heart saying to a certain thing or person or event, "You are my greatest treasure. You are
[00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:51.200]   worth living for." And so the thoughts and desires and the values of the heart are always expressing
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:59.920]   themselves in certain behavior. Now you will note here, again, watch the interaction between physical
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:09.120]   and spiritual. The values of the heart, the immaterial man, the immaterial aspect of man,
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:17.760]   the values of a worshiping heart. Let's say, for example, if I most value and worship my physical
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:26.080]   health. So I'm spending all my time at the gym and I'm eating only vegetables and bran. And there's
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:30.320]   nothing wrong with that if that's what you want to do. But let's just say, for example, that my
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:38.320]   idolatry is my physical health. And so I'm obsessive compulsive about washing my hands,
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:44.080]   which by the way, in this time is not a bad thing to do. But you get the picture here that I
[00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:51.360]   develop these obsessive compulsive behaviors guarding my physical health. And then because
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:59.840]   I'm most treasuring my physical health, then I'm up at night worried about what's going to happen
[00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:07.360]   in the future, worried about certain physical illnesses. And it actually impedes my physical
[00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:13.360]   health from being all that it could be because now I'm not sleeping, I'm anxious. And you will
[00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:20.800]   note here that the values and the desires and the thoughts of the heart express themselves
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:28.080]   in physical manifestations. So what this essay question is asking you to do is to think through
[00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:34.960]   anxiety, fear, and worry in terms of inner and outer man. You will want to craft most likely
[00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:41.600]   a paragraph that talks about outer man manifestations of anxiety and fear, and then
[00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:49.120]   relate them to the heart issues, the thoughts and the desires and the values of the heart,
[00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:57.600]   which give rise to physical manifestations and expressions. So just use that what's on the slide
[00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:04.640]   as a basic framework or as a basic template. We're always thinking through this physical and
[00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:12.880]   spiritual. What aspects are physical? What aspects are spiritual? And as I said in previous classes,
[00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:20.960]   we are not anti-medication. We are not against the idea of psychotropic drugs necessarily,
[00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:27.680]   although we have a concern that those things are over-prescribed. Our agenda is not to do
[00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:33.920]   away with all psychotropic medications, but you do see the limitations of such an approach that
[00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:42.560]   deal with anxiety issues only from a physical perspective. Let's say that the issue is only
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:47.760]   physical and there must be an imbalance chemically that is causing all of these
[00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:55.360]   behaviors and gives only a physical response to what is perceived as a physical issue. You do see
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:45:00.720]   the limitations of such an approach that that approach does not deal with the issues of a
[00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:08.080]   worshiping heart. And that is where we as biblical counselors can be helpful and that we can give
[00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:15.040]   real hope and help to those who are in need. So let me move on at this point and go to page four
[00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:24.160]   of your handout. I want to talk a little bit about the biblical factors that drive anxiety
[00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:32.480]   and fear, and just note these for you. Some of these you will note are the dynamics of a worshiping
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:38.320]   heart. The heart is always worshiping either rightly or wrongly, but just talk through some
[00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:45.200]   biblical factors as it relates to this issue. Letter A, a lack of trust in the sovereignty,
[00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:56.720]   wisdom, and love of God. What I've described as the orphan mentality. This is related to Psalm
[00:45:56.720 --> 00:46:02.880]   56 verse 3 where the psalmist says, "When I'm afraid, I put my trust in you." So the opposite
[00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:12.160]   of fear is trust in the Lord. Jerry Bridges does a great work on this where he talks about
[00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:22.160]   the whole idea of worry, of fear, and anxiety in relation to a person's trust in the Lord. I'm
[00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:30.160]   having a little trouble here with my slides, but okay, we'll get through this.
[00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:38.880]   I'm not a technical wizard here. I'm having anxiety about my slides, but you'll all be
[00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:46.320]   gracious to me. I'll work up my handout here. We have a lack of trust in the sovereignty,
[00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:53.440]   wisdom, and love of God. I want to encourage you to get Jerry Bridges' Trust in God. He talks about
[00:46:53.440 --> 00:47:01.200]   this whole idea of the sovereignty of God, the wisdom of God, and the love of God really being
[00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:09.120]   the three truths that go together that give us reason to trust God. So we're not just telling
[00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:15.680]   people, "Well, trust God. Just do it." We're reminding them of these beautiful truths that
[00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:23.600]   God is sovereign over every aspect of our lives, that he is in control of every circumstance in
[00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:29.360]   each of our lives, but he's not just sovereign and in control, but he's also loving, that he
[00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:35.520]   loves us with an infinite love, and therefore he orders the events of our lives for our good and
[00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:42.480]   for his glory, and that he is also wise. That means he ordains the best ends, and then he also
[00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:50.000]   ordains the best means to those ends. He has a goal to which he is working all of human history
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:57.520]   towards, that he is moving your life and mine to a glorious conclusion, and that every event in our
[00:47:57.520 --> 00:48:04.960]   lives is meant to move us toward that goal. The result of understanding the sovereignty, wisdom,
[00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:11.120]   and the love of God is that we can trust him. We can place our lives in his hands, and because we
[00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:19.040]   trust him, we are not afraid. We don't fear the future because we know that God is in control
[00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:27.360]   of every aspect of our lives, and so one of the biblical factors that drive anxiety and fear is
[00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:33.680]   just a lack of trusting God, wanting to take our lives in our own hands, which is a very scary
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:40.080]   thing to do because we are not God, and we cannot control all of the events of our lives. Trying to
[00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:50.640]   control an uncontrollable world is a recipe for anxiety and fear, and so you often find that people
[00:48:50.640 --> 00:49:01.520]   who are really anxious are also in control. I am most anxious about my children when I'm trying to
[00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:08.080]   control every aspect of their lives. I am most at peace with my children's future when I trust God
[00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:16.560]   with my children and with their future. Letter B, you have an inner monologue which rehearses
[00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:24.720]   unbiblical thoughts until they become the dominant theme in the heart. This is Psalm 42, verse 5,
[00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:31.520]   the psalmist speaking to himself and not allowing his internal monologue to go unchecked,
[00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:38.800]   but questioning himself, asking himself, "Why are you cast down on my soul? Why are you in turmoil
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:45.120]   within me?" and then exhorting himself, "Hope in God, for I shall again praise him, my salvation,
[00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:51.280]   and my God." You will find if you assign counselees journal assignments that they
[00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:59.520]   are oftentimes rehearsing godless thoughts in their heart that, "I have to take care of myself.
[00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:05.040]   I have to provide for myself. I have to do it all," and they have rehearsed these thoughts in
[00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:12.720]   their hearts to such a degree that it's become a dominant theme in their heart's monologue,
[00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:17.360]   and they need to learn to question themselves, to correct themselves, to speak to themselves,
[00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:25.120]   not listen to themselves, but that is a factor that does drive anxiety and fear. Letter C is
[00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:31.840]   refusal to live in the present. Jesus said, "Therefore, do not be anxious about tomorrow,
[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:36.560]   for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble."
[00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:40.960]   Have you ever noticed that, dear friends, that most of our anxieties concern the future,
[00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:45.600]   does not concern the issues of today, that today is very simple.
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:52.080]   One day at a time, give us this day our daily bread. Jesus taught us to pray in the Lord's
[00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:58.640]   prayer, and yet most of our fears and anxieties relate to things that haven't happened yet,
[00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:04.160]   that probably will never happen yet, never happen in the future, but we've created in our minds a
[00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:12.800]   certain future that we project to be a worst-case scenario, and then we live in that scenario and
[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:21.840]   experience fear and worry as it relates to what might happen. We imagine the doctor's appointment,
[00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:29.440]   the worst-case scenario, and then we live in that possible future, which many cases does not come
[00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:35.920]   to pass. It's just helpful to know that that's a factor that drives anxiety, is the heart's desire
[00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:45.120]   to live in tomorrow, where God is always calling us to live one day at a time, sufficient for the
[00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:51.520]   day is its own trouble. God gave manna to his people in the Old Testament one day at a time.
[00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:57.920]   You can't store it up. You can't save up for tomorrow or next year or next decade. You have
[00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:06.320]   to live trusting one day at a time. Ed Welch has talked about this, that worriers are false prophets.
[00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:12.960]   They look into a future and they predict a future that does not come to pass, and then they live as
[00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:20.400]   if that future is true, and so we want to bring our counselees to live one day at a time. It takes
[00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:26.800]   humility to live one day at a time. It takes a recognition of your own limitations to live
[00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:34.320]   one day at a time, trusting in God's provision for today. Pride always wants to have the answers
[00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:42.320]   for the next 10 years and to have those answers right now when God is always calling us to humbly
[00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:48.240]   walk with him, and then letter D related to that is a refusal to recognize personal limitations.
[00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:55.520]   You know this from Psalm 131, where David says, "I do not occupy myself with things too great and
[00:52:55.520 --> 00:53:00.800]   too marvelous for me." I wake up every Monday morning probably as you do. I have thoughts about
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:04.880]   the United States. I have thoughts about the government. I have thoughts about what the
[00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:10.480]   senator should do. I have thoughts about the Supreme Court. I have thoughts about global
[00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:18.560]   trends and economics. I have opinions. I have perspectives. I have thoughts about what should
[00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:24.800]   happen nationally as the church of the Lord Jesus Christ, what should happen in the church,
[00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:28.400]   and then I wake up on a Monday morning and I have to humble myself and say,
[00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:36.080]   you know, I just got to go to work and love my wife and love my kids and do the dishes tonight
[00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:41.600]   and take out the trash and just concern myself with the simple things in life. It's not that
[00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:46.480]   I'm naive about what's going on in the world and what's going on in the nation, but there are things
[00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:52.480]   that are too great and too wonderful for me, and it's an act of humility just to recognize
[00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:58.000]   that I can't solve the world's problems. I'm not a senator. I'm not a congressman.
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:04.480]   I don't belong on the Supreme Court. My world is much smaller than all of that,
[00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:09.040]   and even though I pray for all of those things to be done in a God-honoring way,
[00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:17.840]   there is a humble recognition that I need to occupy myself with my circle of responsibility,
[00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:23.200]   and David says that that's why my soul is like a weaned child and that I'm resting upon the care
[00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:33.120]   of the Lord because I have made a commitment not to occupy myself with things that are too great
[00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:38.400]   and too marvelous for me, and if you look at that language of things that are too great and too
[00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:44.000]   marvelous for me, you will find that the language of great and marvelous in the Old Testament is
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:53.200]   used in reference to the things which God does, to the issues that God concerns himself with.
[00:54:53.200 --> 00:55:01.680]   David is saying, "I'm going to allow God to run the universe, and I'm not going to try to be God.
[00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:10.640]   I'm going to concern myself with what he has called me to be responsible for, and therefore,
[00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:19.360]   my soul can be free of anxiety because God has this world and the nation's history and the history
[00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:28.160]   of the world under his control, and he is working it out for his glory and for my good," and so just
[00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:37.200]   note some of those factors. Use Paul Tripp's helpful circles of responsibility diagram that
[00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:43.360]   is found in his work Instruments in the Redeemer's Hands. That's helpful to use with a counselee,
[00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:49.840]   just what is your circle of responsibility? What has God called you to be responsible for,
[00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:54.320]   and then what is outside of your circle of responsibility? What are the things that God
[00:55:54.320 --> 00:56:00.400]   has called you to trust him for? Just to note that when you move outside of your circle of
[00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:07.040]   responsibility, that is when your heart is going to experience anxiety because you are trying to
[00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:15.040]   concern yourself with things that only God can do, and you're going to have anxiety, worry, and fear
[00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:24.320]   in your heart. Just a helpful thing to observe as we work through what are the factors driving
[00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:29.040]   fear and anxiety. Now, let me wrap this up by moving to the last page on page five
[00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:36.560]   with some practical words on how to help a counselee with anxiety and fear,
[00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:44.880]   and this is just from some of my own experiences in counseling as well as interacting with
[00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:52.480]   counselors in our ministry who have worked with people dealing with anxiety and fear. I would say
[00:56:52.480 --> 00:57:00.880]   that we can help. We have the Bible. We have Christ. We have the Holy Spirit. The local church
[00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:08.080]   is the place you want to go to when you are dealing with anxiety and fear. We have help to offer,
[00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:16.560]   and even sometimes just giving a simple assignment as Philippians 4 verses 6 to 7
[00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:22.400]   to pray with thanksgiving about everything and to not be anxious about anything, and a simple
[00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:28.080]   assignment such as giving to a counselee, write out the things that are causing you anxiety,
[00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:33.680]   and then a separate column, write out the things that you ought to be thankful for, and then what
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:39.680]   I want you to do this week is to pray each day down your thankfulness list, and you'll be obeying
[00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:45.920]   Philippians 4 verses 6 to 7 to pray with thanksgiving about everything, and then I also
[00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:51.680]   want you to everything on your anxiety list, I want you to saturate those things with prayer
[00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:58.000]   and to pray through each item on your list. A simple assignment like that can do wonders
[00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:06.000]   in helping a counselee work through anxiety, and that is the power of biblical counseling,
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:13.120]   that we can give our counselees real hope and help from the Word of God, and so just some
[00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:19.280]   perspectives real practically on counseling those who are dealing with anxiety and worry. Number one,
[00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:26.240]   I would encourage you to view the counseling opportunity as an opportunity to help the
[00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:32.000]   counselee experience God's grace. When someone comes in for counseling in other words, and they're
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:40.000]   saying I'm having panic attacks, or I'm on medication for anti-anxiety, taking anti-anxiety
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:46.720]   medications, or I can't sleep at night, or I'm having you know PTSD type of symptoms because
[00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:54.240]   I had a traumatic event in my past, it's easy to hear that type of experience and struggle
[00:58:54.800 --> 00:59:00.720]   and feel overwhelmed, or feel like I don't know if I can help as a biblical counselor.
[00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:08.640]   I want to encourage you to look at those counseling opportunities as an opportunity to bring
[00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:16.640]   the counselee closer to the Lord, as an opportunity for God's grace to be put on display, because
[00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:24.560]   if you look at what the scripture says about anxiety and fear, God wants to draw near to the
[00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:33.600]   believer who has an anxious heart. I think if you take the broad teaching of the Word of God
[00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:40.320]   on this subject, the number of times God addresses the anxious heart, the number of times that God
[00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:46.160]   talks to the person who is fearful about the future, the number of times God addresses the
[00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:53.440]   issue of worry, and then if you take all of that and look through the tenor of scripture, of all
[00:59:53.440 --> 01:00:00.160]   the promises that God gives to the person who is struggling with anxiety, I think we could summarize
[01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:08.080]   in this statement that God desires to minister to the anxious heart. God desires that the anxious
[01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:16.480]   person experiences his peace, his provision, and his comfort. That's Jesus in the upper room with
[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:23.360]   his disciples, that he wanted the disciples to experience the peace of God, and so he spoke
[01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:29.360]   words of comfort and peace to his disciples, and that's Jesus walking with the disciples through
[01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:36.960]   his three-year public ministry, oftentimes gently admonishing them, saying, "Oh ye of little faith,
[01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:45.120]   why are you afraid? Why are you anxious?" That if you just knew the promises and the provision of
[01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:51.520]   God, you would understand that you have no reason to be worried or be afraid, and so just view this
[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:58.160]   as an opportunity for God's grace to be put on display, and I think that God will give you
[01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:08.000]   opportunities to help counselees to overcome anxiety. Number two, give hope. Emphasize the
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:14.960]   presence of Christ and his faithful provisions. Number three, you do want to become skilled at
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:22.000]   exposing the heart issues which are driving fear and anxiety, so just some practical questions.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:28.080]   You want to find out walking through the heat issues versus the heart issues. What are the
[01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:34.400]   external circumstances that are drawing out the counselee's anxious heart? You want to ask the
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:41.680]   questions, what is the counselee anxious about? What is the specific concern that is leading to
[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:50.400]   fear and anxiety? How often does the counselee struggle with anxiety? What are the settings that
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:02:01.120]   cause anxiety and fear? What is the intensity of the anxiety that's being experienced? Does it
[01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:08.720]   become more intense in certain times and issues versus other settings? Now, those are just some
[01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:15.840]   questions that you want to ask, and then drawing out the issues of the heart. What are the thoughts,
[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:24.800]   the desires, and the treasures, the values that are being exposed by a counselee's
[01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:35.040]   situation or heat issues? And just note that the number of times that Jesus identifies the issue
[01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:41.920]   of faith being the root issue that drives anxiety and fear. "Oh ye of little faith,
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:48.320]   oh you of little faith, oh you of little faith, why did you doubt," Jesus said. That's one word
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:55.280]   in the Greek, by the way. It's "little faiths." It could be translated. It's a term of both
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:03:00.880]   affirmation and correction at the same time. You have faith,
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:09.280]   and that faith is real, but that faith is little and it needs to grow. And oftentimes,
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:20.320]   our anxieties reveal where we have placed our trust, and it reveals the true state or the true
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:28.320]   status of our faith. And so, as Robert Jones writes, "Worries and fears are simply concerns
[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:34.880]   that become inordinate. They cross the line. They become sinful because of unbelief and idolatry."
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:42.320]   And John Piper says, "Well, that Jesus says that the root of anxiety is inadequate faith in our
[01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:48.880]   Father's future grace. As unbelief gets the upper hand in our hearts, one of the effects is anxiety.
[01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:56.000]   The root cause of anxiety is a failure to trust all that God has promised to be for us in Jesus."
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:04.480]   A last helpful work that I would recommend, I believe it's Adam Clark's Book of Promises. It's
[01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:11.520]   an older work, but it's a work that I have put into counselees' hands who struggle with anxiety.
[01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:22.480]   I believe it's Clark's Book of Promises, C-L-A-R-K-E, and just a number of promises found
[01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:28.240]   in the Word of God that you can just have your counselee read through that and study through that
[01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:38.080]   and just realize that God has promised to give provision in whatever the issue is that they're
[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:44.720]   having anxiety over. And then number four, lastly, let me encourage you to get practical. "The battle
[01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:52.720]   to overcome anxiety and fear must be fought in the trenches of everyday life." And so, we call this,
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:05:01.440]   this is the battle at the dishwasher or the battle at the kitchen where you're doing your dishes or
[01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:09.040]   some counselors call this the stoplight battle. This is the battle for the mind and the heart
[01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:14.800]   when you are at a stoplight and you're waiting for the stoplight to turn green. What are the
[01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:22.000]   thoughts which are flooding your mind and causing you anxiety? What do you think about when you
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:27.760]   don't need to think about anything? And there are certain places and situations in life where you
[01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:33.920]   are not having to have your mind occupied and that's when anxious thoughts flood in. And so,
[01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:40.080]   some of our counselors give very practical assignments, writing out the promises of God
[01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:49.600]   on index cards and then placing them at those certain situations. An index card at your kitchen
[01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:56.160]   sink where you are tempted to have anxious thoughts and you can quickly glance at a certain
[01:05:56.160 --> 01:06:02.720]   promise of God like Hebrews 13 verse 5 and 6 that the Lord has promised never to leave me or forsake
[01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:07.040]   me. Well, you can place that on an index card next to your kitchen and as you do the dishes,
[01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:12.880]   you can be rehearsing that promise in your mind instead of the anxious thoughts about the future.
[01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:18.480]   And you can help your counselee to do that as well or even placing the index card on the dashboard
[01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:23.440]   of your car so that when you are at the stoplight, I mean, you want to be watching the stoplight,
[01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:31.760]   but you can be rehearsing a certain verse as you wait for the light to turn green. And in that way,
[01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:39.840]   do a real battle for sanctification in the everyday situations of life. As a counselor,
[01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:46.320]   if you are not seeing the change that you want to see in your counselee, then you want to get
[01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:53.520]   more specific about your counseling, your homework assignments. It takes work to design homework that
[01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:57.920]   is that specific. And that's why I appreciate some of the counselors who have given me these
[01:06:57.920 --> 01:07:03.440]   recommendations. They've really thought through the issue of homework. How do you design homework
[01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:11.280]   to help the counselee do battle for their sanctification in real practical situations?
[01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:17.440]   And it's not like you can do battle for that one day and then coast off that victory the
[01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:22.560]   rest of the week. You need to engage in that battle on a daily basis. And just helping your
[01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:32.080]   counselee work through that is very conducive to a profitable counseling relationship.
[01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:40.800]   A thankfulness journal, being very specific, I've noticed that counselees who struggle with anxiety,
[01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:45.600]   many of them can quote Philippians 4, 6, and 7 to pray about everything and be thankful
[01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:51.680]   for everything, but not to be anxious about anything. They can quote that. But when you
[01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:57.200]   ask them the question, are you actually praying that way? They are not praying that way. Because
[01:07:57.200 --> 01:08:02.160]   if they did pray that way on a daily basis, then the peace of God would guard their hearts and
[01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:07.440]   their minds in Christ Jesus. And so just good homework assignments, again, that are designed
[01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:13.840]   to keep the counselee accountable. Are you actually praying about everything on your anxiety list?
[01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:18.640]   Are you actually giving thanks to God for everything on your thankfulness list?
[01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:24.400]   Those are helpful assignments to give to a counselee. Engaging in service opportunities
[01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:30.960]   for others. Oftentimes, counselees are overly occupied with their own world. They need to engage
[01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:36.800]   in the concerns and the cares of other people. They need to, in a godly sense, be anxious for
[01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:42.880]   other people's concerns. It's difficult to be overly anxious about yourself when you are engaged
[01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:49.840]   in prayer for 10 other people and intensely engaged in interceding for other people. That's
[01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:55.600]   helpful in just overcoming your own anxiety. Scripture memory. And then I've noted the
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:09:01.200]   circles of responsibility assignment, noting what is in your own circle of responsibility
[01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:09.680]   versus what is in God's circle of responsibility. So I hope that's helpful. There's much more that
[01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:19.680]   can be said, but just noting that in the end, there's a breadth of material to study and
[01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:26.480]   digest on this subject. But in the end, counseling with someone who is struggling with anxiety,
[01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:33.440]   it can be a very simple focus, and I would encourage you to start there. What you want to do
[01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:42.480]   is you want to bring the heart to worship Christ, to experience Christ's grace, to understand Christ's
[01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:50.400]   provisions and promises. And you can do that, and I can do that because we have the Word of God. We
[01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:57.120]   are biblical counselors, and we are able to give hope and help in this area. So may the Lord bless
[01:09:57.120 --> 01:10:02.640]   you this week as you study on the subject and as you write on this topic. I encourage you to dig
[01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:08.720]   deep, and if you do so, you will build a great foundation for future counseling ministry. And
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:18.960]   then I would encourage you to take this material and be confident. Be humbly confident in your
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:28.240]   ability to take God's Word and give it to someone else so that an anxious heart can be flooded with
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:33.520]   the peace of God which surpasses all understanding. And I trust that God will give you
[01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:42.000]   grace for that. So may the Lord bless you. Thank you again for joining us tonight on this webinar.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:47.680]   We will be back next Sunday at 5 o'clock p.m. Pacific time, and we're going to be talking
[01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:54.880]   through the issue of how to conclude a counseling relationship. Some of those relationships
[01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:59.600]   go really well, and you want to know how to conclude good counseling relationships. You
[01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:04.160]   also want to know how to conclude counseling relationships when they aren't going so well,
