[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.320]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:08.320]   I'm Cal Newport, and this is Deep Questions, episode 180.
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:15.420]   I'm here at my Deep Work HQ,
[00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.100]   joined with my producer, Jesse.
[00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.920]   The Jesse ominous sign, ominous sign
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.360]   happened just the other day.
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.480]   My oldest son asked us if we would set up
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.600]   a Zoom conference for him and some of his school buddies,
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.100]   because they're setting up a business
[00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.980]   to sell Pokemon cards.
[00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.160]   And so they needed to do a Zoom meeting.
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.820]   And so I thought the tentacles,
[00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.900]   the heart numbing, deadening tentacles,
[00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.040]   that is doing meetings on Zoom,
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.960]   work meetings on Zoom,
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.680]   and not extend past us to our kids, but they have.
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.300]   Now my own son is setting up on his own accord,
[00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.680]   the things that have tortured us for the last two years,
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.360]   which is Zoom based business meetings.
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.160]   So I think that's an ominous sign.
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.800]   If he starts sending me calendar invites,
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.480]   we're moving to a farm.
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.320]   That's it.
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.080]   He doesn't have to be exposed.
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.820]   He's too pure to be exposed to the inanities
[00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.820]   of the world of digital remote work.
[00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.140]   (laughing)
[00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.060]   Speaking of farm, so I read,
[00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.240]   last week you were telling me about
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.820]   this big New Yorker profile of Wendell Berry.
[00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.940]   So I went on your recommendation and I read it.
[00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.300]   I had to read in the physical magazine,
[00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.700]   because Wendell Berry,
[00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.500]   you gotta read a Wendell Berry thing in physical form.
[00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.680]   And that's really interesting, really interesting.
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.700]   I mean, I knew about Berry,
[00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.420]   but it was interesting to hear more of a long form,
[00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.140]   long form description of what his life was like.
[00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.980]   The thing that caught my attention is that
[00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.100]   he is a purified instantiation of this deep life philosophy
[00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.220]   that we talk about on the show.
[00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.540]   I don't know if you had the same reaction,
[00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:05.380]   but think about it.
[00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.980]   This is someone who said,
[00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.080]   I'm gonna do exactly what's at the core
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.380]   of our notion of the deep life,
[00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.420]   which we talk about in our core idea video
[00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.500]   on the deep life, if people aren't familiar.
[00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.060]   So YouTube page, core idea video on the deep life,
[00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.060]   we talk about this, but at the core of the deep life
[00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.020]   is making radical change to your life
[00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.220]   to put it into alignment with the things that you value.
[00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.980]   And that's what Berry did.
[00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.300]   I mean, he moved, he left New York
[00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.700]   to move to a farm in Kentucky near where he grew up
[00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.980]   to cultivate land with horses
[00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.020]   while teaching at a local college there,
[00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.060]   built his entire life around incredibly intentionally,
[00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.040]   here are the things I value, community, connection to land,
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.760]   these older ways of living, the idea of writers
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.560]   having a, being cited in a particular place and context
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.680]   from which they write about,
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.120]   as opposed to, as he talks about,
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.000]   just being in this cosmopolitan abstraction
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   where you live in a city and are of no place.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.960]   And he did all those things
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.560]   and built a really unusual life around it,
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.640]   but it sounds cool.
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:07.980]   I don't know what your, was your thought,
[00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.960]   my thought was, this sounds like kind of a cool life
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:10.880]   he built out there.
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:11.760]   - Well, a couple of things.
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.200]   I mean, you read one of his books in the past month,
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.160]   I think it was January or December or something like that.
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.320]   So I hadn't heard of him until you were explaining
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.600]   in the book that you read about him
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.480]   and then he came up here.
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.480]   And he's a prolific writer.
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.480]   He's written a ton of stuff.
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.760]   I mean, he's probably like 80 something years old
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.680]   and he's written nonstop for 50 years.
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.320]   - Poems, novels, essays, and nonfiction books.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.200]   And he's a professor, was a professor and a farmer,
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.480]   but they have like no technology.
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.120]   Didn't have a computer, they weren't on the internet,
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.000]   he wasn't on phone.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.920]   So maybe it tells you something about,
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.980]   you're up at dawn to tend your horses,
[00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.240]   even if you have a teaching job,
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.400]   you have a lot of time to write.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.240]   - He lives in a town of 60 people, something like that.
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.200]   - Yeah, and he's related to half of them.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.040]   - Yeah.
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.920]   - Yeah.
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.800]   I'll tell you the big revelation of the article for me
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:03.920]   was his writing shed.
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.600]   I hadn't heard about that before,
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.840]   that he has this house, it's overlooking a river,
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.520]   not a house, it's like a little cabin up on pillars.
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.880]   Because I guess the river overflows,
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.780]   no electricity, no running water.
[00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.060]   And he goes out there and he writes.
[00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.840]   And he's out there and he writes.
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.880]   But I love in this piece,
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.780]   but also in the book of essays I read,
[00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.800]   how he knows the land and he has a connection to it
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.880]   and he wanders the land and canoes on his river
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.580]   and is completely connected to his town
[00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:40.840]   in that particular place.
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.680]   And now his family, multiple generations now,
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.360]   a lot of them all live around there.
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.040]   And in the article, his daughter and his granddaughter
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.080]   would just wander into their house.
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.880]   I mean, it really looks like a great case study
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.200]   of the deep life in action.
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.760]   Figure out what matters to you,
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.080]   reorient your life around that,
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.480]   as opposed to arbitrary metrics that are nice in the moment
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.000]   or seem just culturally palatable,
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.180]   like just going up the ladder in a career
[00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.500]   or just seeking distraction.
[00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:11.960]   And then be willing to make radical changes.
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.480]   And what's more radical than leaving a teaching,
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.640]   writing job in New York, move to Kentucky.
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.000]   - Speaking of which, you do a good job
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.700]   of explaining the radical part,
[00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.620]   because it's important to do, you explain it,
[00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.640]   like there being some sort of a test before you do that,
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.280]   'cause then you gave the example of the one fellow
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.600]   who in your book who went to become a monk
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.400]   and it didn't really work out.
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.860]   So I think for new listeners,
[00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.180]   it's good to explain that briefly,
[00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.000]   just so they don't think that you just jump
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.040]   into the radical part.
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.440]   - Yeah, radical is important,
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.280]   but it has to be aligned with your values.
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.880]   So you have to make, if you really wanna live deeply,
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.880]   ultimately you wanna make some sort of radical shift
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:46.960]   because that signals to yourself
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.440]   that you take this really seriously.
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.160]   It makes it an adventure.
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.360]   And it allows you to really immerse yourself in that value.
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.900]   So if Wendell had just said,
[00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.440]   I work in New York, I live in Northern New Jersey,
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.760]   but like a little bit South,
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.620]   so I have a little bit of a plot of land
[00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.800]   and I really have a nice garden that I take care of
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.500]   because I find land really important.
[00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.400]   And I take the commuter train into New York
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.400]   and work in New York.
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.920]   That's not the same thing as I'm using horses
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.440]   to plow land in Kentucky.
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:20.640]   And there's something about the radicalness
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:21.480]   of what's important, right?
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.920]   That's the immersion in the value.
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.800]   You can make the value that you're orienting
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.600]   towards a guiding direction for your life.
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.520]   But radical without prep becomes just change
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.200]   for the sake of enjoying the disruption
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.120]   and that can fade out.
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.440]   So you're right, it's so good they can't ignore you.
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.520]   I talk about the guy who says,
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.280]   I'm gonna go become a monk
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.980]   and he's in Mountain Monastery and he gets there
[00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:44.980]   and is like, oh, all right,
[00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.660]   this is not immediately making my life better
[00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:48.860]   and why exactly am I doing this
[00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.260]   other than the fact it's disruptive?
[00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:51.860]   And he gave up on that.
[00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:56.060]   I talked about in the video where we explain the deep life
[00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:57.940]   from that Core Ideas playlist,
[00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.580]   the Mark Fredenfaller,
[00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:03.100]   where they moved to that island in the South Pacific.
[00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:04.580]   And it's because of disruption.
[00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.500]   You're like, hey, it's radical, change is radical,
[00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:07.340]   it's something to do.
[00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:08.180]   And they're like, oh, this is terrible
[00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:09.100]   and we feel weird about it.
[00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.340]   And our kids have lice and they got ringworm.
[00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:13.200]   And it was like, this is not great.
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.840]   And they couldn't open the coconuts.
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.120]   This is another thing I didn't leave out.
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.520]   They imagined themselves just cracking open the coconuts
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.360]   and it turned out it's really hard to open coconuts
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.360]   and they're like, this is terrible, why did we do this?
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.440]   And then he went back and did make a radical change,
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.920]   rebuilt his whole life around DIY and started a new magazine
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.680]   and getting back in touch with building things
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:33.520]   with his hands.
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:34.680]   And that's actually the real story.
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.180]   So I think it's a really important point
[00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.760]   is that you have to do something radical, really,
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:39.840]   if you're gonna embrace the deep life,
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.840]   but it has to be very much oriented towards things
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:43.680]   that are valuable to you.
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:44.640]   You have to know why you're making
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.120]   that particular radical change.
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.040]   And there's a lot of self-insight involved there.
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:50.520]   And that would be fascinating,
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:54.240]   to really be a fly on the wall with Wendell Berry
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:57.200]   in his 20s, when he's trying to figure this out
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.000]   and trying to convince his wife, this is what we need to do.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.200]   - A couple of things that come to mind.
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.400]   One, I mean, the article was written by the daughter
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.880]   of his first editor who was sentenced to pass,
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:08.680]   but that was kind of cool to see the interchange
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.080]   of that throughout the story.
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.400]   I mean, it was a long article.
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:15.880]   And then talking about what he was like when he was younger,
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.440]   there was a quote in there where someone was like,
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:19.640]   did you tell him to lighten up?
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.040]   I think he was pretty intense.
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:24.680]   - Yeah, his book's gonna be pretty polemical.
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.560]   His nonfiction work can be pretty polemical.
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.000]   And his new book, he's writing a book
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.440]   as like an 80-something year old on racism.
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.440]   So that's gonna be interesting, I think.
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.120]   - Two other, yeah, I think it will be for sure.
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.200]   - I don't think he cares.
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.320]   He's like, whatever.
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:39.160]   What did he say?
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:42.960]   He said like, I'm 80, I have friends, I have family.
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.560]   Like, I don't care if people are mad at me.
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.800]   And so I'll read it.
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.120]   I think it'll be interesting.
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:48.960]   It's an awful guy.
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.360]   - He's written about that in the past.
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:53.880]   And I think that he's thought a lot about it.
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:54.880]   - Yeah, he did a lot of writing
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.680]   about the civil rights movement
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:59.280]   and trying to understand it as a movement
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.280]   and compare and contrast it to other movements.
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:02.400]   I don't remember the punchline,
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:06.080]   but I know he had some pretty provocative essays
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:09.680]   in the book I read that was comparing
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.200]   and contrasting the civil rights movement
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.880]   to the environmental movement.
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:17.880]   So he thinks a lot about movements and how they expand.
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.800]   I mean, one of his main critiques, if I remember,
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.920]   is the problem with movements is there's a certain place
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:27.120]   where his real worry, which I think seems
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.200]   really relevant today, but his real worry is
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:35.040]   when movements get separated from personal action.
[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:38.560]   So he talks about the environmental movement
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:42.840]   and he's like, what matters is you're in a place,
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:46.480]   actually stewarding the land in that place
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:48.680]   and building up from personal experience
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:51.080]   a respect for land and its interaction with humans.
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.280]   What he worries about is that you say,
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:55.600]   no, no, I just live in suburban America
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:10:00.120]   and I give money to these groups
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.560]   that are trying to influence legislation.
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.600]   Or today it would be, and he's talked about this
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.880]   probably more recently, I tweet about things
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:08.760]   or change my Twitter profile or whatever.
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:11.080]   And he says these movements become professionalized
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.760]   and abstracted and their identity badges,
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.920]   I'm a part of this movement, I wear the right thing,
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.880]   I say the right things, no action actually happens.
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.440]   And in my memory is when he was talking
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:23.000]   about the civil rights movement,
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.840]   the degree to which I guess this was,
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:29.000]   it was cited in personal action.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.640]   You were out there sitting at the lunch counters
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:33.480]   or this or that.
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:36.160]   So I think he was lamenting about the environmental movement
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.680]   but I think it's a big thing today
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:41.720]   that social media gives you the ability
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.760]   to superficially be connected with movements
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:46.720]   but it also accelerates the abstraction of these movements
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:50.320]   into just components of an identity presentation.
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:53.280]   And there feels like there's a lot of crackling energy
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:56.320]   but that energy is not being conduited
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:59.400]   into actually any sort of motive force.
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.720]   And so actually, yeah, I think this book will be interesting.
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:04.680]   Interesting guy.
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:05.960]   - There was a cool part in the book
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:07.880]   where he was talking about the difficulty of writing.
[00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:08.880]   He's like, yeah, writing's hard.
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.840]   And then he gave the analogy or gave the story
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:13.600]   about when he goes out to change the wires at night
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.080]   and it's cold and he started doing the work
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:15.960]   and then it was getting better.
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:18.120]   And then he related that to writing
[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:20.160]   and getting into the groove.
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.480]   - Yeah, if you're a farmer, you're used to hard work.
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:23.800]   Yeah, writing's hard work.
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:27.840]   Yeah, that's always my thing is what writer's block
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:30.800]   is another way of describing what it feels like to write.
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.080]   Because it's a weird, unnatural thing
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:33.320]   you're asking your brain to do.
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:34.920]   So why are you rewarded for doing it well
[00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:36.720]   is because you're able to overcome that.
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.600]   So the difficulty should be the first thing
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:40.960]   that you expect.
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:45.200]   But anyways, I think we'll see more
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:49.480]   of Barry style lifestyles potentially
[00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.920]   in this current sort of post pandemic period
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.120]   where people are reinventing their lives
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:58.360]   and becoming disillusioned with what life was like
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.320]   pre pandemic and having the disruption
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:02.160]   give them the space to think about it.
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.280]   That's a direction I think a lot of people should consider
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:07.560]   which is this hardcore deep life direction.
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.520]   Radical changes to align your life with your values.
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:10.960]   You have to know what you value,
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:11.920]   be very careful about that,
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:13.760]   but then make the changes radical.
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:16.520]   So don't do radical for the sake of radical.
[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:18.920]   Should be very aligned clearly with your values,
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:22.480]   and why not?
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:23.920]   I mean, Barry did it.
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.080]   He has an interesting life out there.
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:29.200]   So I think we need to move this podcast to a farm.
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:33.000]   I want video.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.720]   We should be on horses.
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.920]   I think we should be on horses as we do the podcast.
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:41.760]   Here's an AV challenge for our contractors.
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:44.200]   Like we wanna record this podcast from horses.
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.000]   Like we're just sort of walking over our land
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.880]   and sort of chatting about life.
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:50.760]   - We can do that the 201st episode
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:52.160]   'cause the 200th episode will-
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:53.120]   - We're going to South Africa.
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.640]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:57.960]   And then after our treatment for black mamba venom,
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:12:59.880]   we'll go to a farm.
[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:01.040]   And we'll get, we do this from a farm
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:02.800]   and then we'll get the next headline.
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:07.520]   Minor podcaster hilariously bit by mamba in South Africa,
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:11.560]   immediately trampled by horses on farm,
[00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:14.880]   ruining the land and the financial future
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.360]   of the land's owner, Wendell Barry,
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:20.320]   who has now been forced to move to New York
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:22.560]   to become a TikTok influencer
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:24.960]   in hopes of salvaging his waning fortune.
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:25.800]   It's a long headline.
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.320]   - And he couldn't pack his typewriter.
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:29.840]   - Yeah, couldn't pack his typewriter.
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:34.040]   So now is using virtual reality goggles
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:35.760]   and living mainly in the metaverse.
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:39.920]   And it's all gonna have, it's a long headline.
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:41.600]   You know, the headlines are long these days.
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:42.840]   You have to, because you got to pack
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.400]   a lot of information into them.
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:46.320]   Oh, well, all right.
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:47.160]   Well, enough of that nonsense.
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.080]   We got calls today, right?
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:48.920]   So we got a-
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:50.040]   - Yeah, we got some good calls.
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:51.120]   - Listener call episode.
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.760]   We got to pay the bills a little bit
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:54.600]   because I think these medical expenses
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.800]   are gonna pile up fast after our 200th
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:59.920]   and 200th first episode.
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:03.280]   So let me just tell you briefly about PolicyGenius.
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:06.680]   So PolicyGenius helps you easily find home
[00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:10.400]   and auto coverage similar to what you have now,
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:13.920]   but at a lower price.
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.520]   So you go to PolicyGenius.com,
[00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:17.560]   you answer a few questions,
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:19.720]   and it will show you price estimates for policies
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:21.160]   that fit what you need,
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:25.680]   but can be cheaper than what you're already paying.
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:28.560]   Now, PolicyGenius has been doing this for a while.
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:31.920]   They've helped over 30 million people shop for insurance.
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:34.320]   On last week's episode, I asked Jesse to guess
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.720]   the average amount of money that they have saved
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:40.920]   their customers each year on average.
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:44.160]   And my memory is Jesse said $10.
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:45.840]   It was really dismissive.
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:48.000]   He said, "Oh, PolicyGenius probably didn't save people
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.880]   any money, probably $10."
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:51.960]   And I said, "Jesse, you idiot.
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:55.840]   The real amount is $1,250."
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:57.640]   And if you remember on Monday's episode,
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:01.880]   he then said, "I have been bested, PolicyGenius,
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:03.320]   my apologies."
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:06.440]   And he did a dramatic hand-waving bow.
[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:08.200]   That's my memory of Monday's episode.
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.720]   But $1,250 is pretty good.
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.240]   That's what they say people on average,
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:12.520]   because they find you insurance
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:13.480]   that gives you what you need,
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.520]   but it's cheaper than what you are paying.
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:19.720]   They work for you, not the insurance companies.
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:21.280]   They have your best interest in mind.
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:22.680]   30 million people have used them,
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:25.040]   thousands of five-star reviews.
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.400]   So go to PolicyGenius.com and get your free home
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:28.880]   and auto insurance quotes today
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:31.860]   and see how much you can save.
[00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:36.080]   Also wanna talk about a new sponsor, Workable.
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:39.320]   A lot of people are trying to hire right now.
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:41.960]   A lot of people are having a hard time hiring.
[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.400]   It can be a grueling process,
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.320]   especially when you have to go through a lot of candidates
[00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:48.440]   to find one who is right and who actually is available.
[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:50.960]   Workable makes that all easy for you.
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:55.360]   It helps you find the right candidates and hire them fast.
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.880]   It starts by helping you cast the widest net possible
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:01.420]   by posting your job listing
[00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:03.920]   to more than 200 total top job boards.
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:05.520]   Just one click, boom, it's posted.
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:07.340]   But then here's what's important.
[00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:09.840]   It also gives you the tools to efficiently deal
[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:12.200]   with the candidates who are interested.
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:14.540]   We're talking about video interview tools,
[00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:17.200]   e-signature tools that can automate repetitive tasks
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.760]   like scheduling interviews.
[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:20.420]   So you can focus on doing those interviews
[00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:21.760]   and finding the right people,
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:26.560]   not on spreadsheets and scheduling and setting up calls.
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:28.040]   So whether you're hiring for your coffee shop
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:28.960]   or your engineering team,
[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:30.480]   Workable is exactly what you need
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:33.840]   to hire the right people fast.
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:36.520]   You can start hiring today with a risk-free 15-day trial.
[00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:37.360]   Here's the cool thing.
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:40.400]   If you hire someone during the trial,
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:43.480]   won't cost you a thing, remains free.
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:46.520]   So go to workable.com/podcast to start hiring.
[00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:49.760]   Workable is hiring made easy.
[00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:51.780]   - All right.
[00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:53.780]   Well, speaking about easy,
[00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:56.240]   let's see how easy our questions are this week.
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:59.660]   Jesse, what is our first call we have on the docket?
[00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:01.460]   - All right, the first call is from Simon
[00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:04.820]   and he references an article that you were a focus of
[00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:06.700]   and it basically challenges some
[00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:08.740]   of your metrics of productivity.
[00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:17.020]   - Hi Cal, Simon here.
[00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:19.740]   I'm calling from New Zealand.
[00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:22.380]   Recently, Alan Jacobs, a philosopher,
[00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:25.020]   Alan Jacobs published a small bit of writing
[00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:26.060]   in the Hedgehog Review.
[00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:27.940]   The writing's called "The Problem with Productivity
[00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:29.700]   and the Good Work of Love."
[00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:33.860]   And in it, he takes you to task a little bit
[00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:38.380]   in one of your New Yorker articles
[00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:41.140]   and just has some questions about
[00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:42.860]   the way you describe productivity
[00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:46.100]   and the metrics of productivity.
[00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:48.460]   And his questions are kind of about
[00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:52.620]   the way in which those people involved
[00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:55.980]   and things that are less able to be quantified,
[00:17:55.980 --> 00:18:00.020]   how they fit in your, let's say, picture of the world.
[00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:02.460]   Would love to hear your response.
[00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:03.300]   Cheers.
[00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:07.180]   - Well, Simon, I went back and I read that article.
[00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:08.820]   I like the Hedgehog Review.
[00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:09.940]   This was an interesting piece,
[00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:14.060]   as you mentioned, by Alan Jacobs.
[00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:16.820]   He was talking about a piece I wrote for the New Yorker
[00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:21.460]   on productivity culture, people's frustration
[00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:23.580]   with the notion of productivity,
[00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:27.340]   and what we should do about it.
[00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:28.780]   So there's a couple points in his piece,
[00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:30.420]   if I'm remembering properly.
[00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:33.100]   So part of this was just saying
[00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:37.340]   productivity is hard in a lot of contexts
[00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:41.140]   to even measure, like what do we even mean by productivity?
[00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:46.140]   And he felt, sort of the typical anti-neoliberal critique
[00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:49.580]   of this seems to, your language seems to quantify
[00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:54.580]   too systemic, too economically blinkered, I would say.
[00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:59.700]   Now, I think this is a common fault line right now
[00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:02.260]   in the discussion of productivity and anti-productivity.
[00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:05.580]   So I would say the popular lane right now
[00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:08.500]   in elite discourses when talking about productivity,
[00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:10.740]   roughly speaking, falls into the club
[00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:14.340]   of the post-capitalist, post-liberal types,
[00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:17.300]   where the big things to talk about
[00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:22.180]   is how just work itself, we need to rethink work itself,
[00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:25.460]   and this drive to produce and to define your life
[00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:27.180]   too much by work is a problem,
[00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:29.740]   and it's a sort of a necessary outcome
[00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:31.140]   of our capitalist systems.
[00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:35.420]   And can't we, we need to rethink what work means
[00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:37.180]   and the role it plays in a life,
[00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:40.500]   and productivity discourses, typically it's influenced
[00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:42.100]   by like Bayes superstructure theory.
[00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:45.380]   Productivity discourses are really just an opiate
[00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:49.060]   of a Zoom-equipped bourgeois that is trying to coerce you
[00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:51.740]   into giving up more of your labor
[00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:54.060]   towards extracting value for the capitalist,
[00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:54.900]   et cetera, et cetera.
[00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:56.620]   So there's a sort of post-capitalist thread
[00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:58.340]   that's really popular right now
[00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:02.500]   in, I would say, left-leaning elite discourses.
[00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:03.580]   They don't like me.
[00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:06.300]   So they think I'm a neoliberal shill
[00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:07.980]   because I think while those are interesting
[00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:09.820]   philosophical ideas, I'm much more
[00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:11.420]   boots-on-the-ground pragmatic.
[00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:13.060]   These people at this company right now
[00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:15.100]   in this job are stressed out, and why?
[00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:16.260]   And how can we change this company
[00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:17.260]   so they're not so stressed out?
[00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:18.860]   Like, I like to get into the nuts and bolts
[00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:21.820]   about how knowledge work actually unfolds
[00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:24.860]   and work in a much more narrow way
[00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:27.380]   of what can we do in here, pragmatically what's going on.
[00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:31.300]   So again, I'm often disparaged by that crowd
[00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:33.020]   as some sort of neoliberal shill
[00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:37.380]   because I'm not appropriately having these
[00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:40.940]   navel-gazing, more philosophical, grandiose theories
[00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:45.220]   about work and life and capitalism, et cetera.
[00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:47.740]   I'm much more narrow.
[00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:49.540]   So what I'm arguing about and what I argue about
[00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:52.740]   in that article is actually something very specific.
[00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:54.820]   What I'm saying here is let's get boots-on-the-ground,
[00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:57.180]   ethnographically in the cubicles,
[00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:58.940]   seeing what is frustrating people.
[00:20:58.940 --> 00:20:59.940]   And this is, again, one of the things
[00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:01.700]   that I think distinguishes my work.
[00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:05.420]   I have such a deeply embedded surveillance network
[00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:07.700]   into the world of work because I have this
[00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:10.700]   decade-plus career writing about this stuff
[00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:12.340]   where I hear from people constantly.
[00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:13.900]   So I really have my finger on the pulse,
[00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:16.700]   like what's happening in these type of knowledge work jobs?
[00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:17.940]   And what I was pointing out is here
[00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:20.020]   is a specific pragmatic issue.
[00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:23.580]   We said productivity should be personal.
[00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:25.460]   It's up to the individual to figure out
[00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:28.740]   how to manage their work and their workload.
[00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:33.180]   A necessary consequence of this is that in this informal,
[00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:35.180]   you-have-to-figure-it-on-your-own type context,
[00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:38.300]   people became way overloaded.
[00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:40.740]   They have more work than they know how to handle,
[00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:45.740]   and it is a almost dehumanizing, cruel act to say,
[00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:48.020]   we're gonna give you more work than you can handle
[00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:51.180]   and figure it out, forcing you into a position.
[00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:52.980]   So there's no sort of professional,
[00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:54.140]   personal Fifth Amendment here,
[00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:56.780]   forcing you into a position of having to make
[00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:58.860]   these judgment calls between your personal life
[00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:00.860]   and your work life because the more of your personal life
[00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:02.620]   you give up, the more work you can get done.
[00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:04.020]   And they're just like, hey, be productive,
[00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:05.420]   and it's up to you to figure out how to do it.
[00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:07.460]   And I'm like, this is an untenable situation.
[00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:09.660]   We're overloaded, we were in this untenable situation
[00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:11.980]   where we have to figure out how to balance
[00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:15.260]   our professional lives and our personal lives.
[00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:17.060]   And the whole thing is a recipe for frustration
[00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:20.100]   and exhaustion, and people are getting fed up with it.
[00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:23.580]   And so my argument is, we gotta get this off
[00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:27.620]   of the individuals, the structure and systems
[00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:29.300]   by which we actually figure out things like,
[00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:31.500]   how much work should you have on your plate?
[00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:35.660]   How many projects should someone be working on?
[00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:38.140]   How do we communicate and talk about this work?
[00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:42.260]   These type of things need to be surfaced and made explicit.
[00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:45.540]   So A, it can prevent us from being
[00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:48.260]   in these terrible situations where we're overloaded
[00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:50.700]   and are being implicitly pushed to just sacrifice
[00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:52.900]   more and more of other things that are important to us.
[00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:54.580]   And it makes it something that we can argue
[00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:55.500]   and fight back against.
[00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:57.460]   When you say, this is how we assign work,
[00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:58.980]   and this is how we communicate about work.
[00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:02.700]   And if that system is onerous, we can all point to that
[00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:04.220]   and say, this is an onerous system.
[00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:06.380]   We don't like this, do something better.
[00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:08.980]   It gives you something to push back on.
[00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:10.780]   You don't have any targets to push back on,
[00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:12.620]   which is up to everyone, and work is informal,
[00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:13.700]   and we're all sitting back and forth,
[00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:15.260]   calendar invites and emailing.
[00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:17.740]   Surface and make explicit the systems
[00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:22.140]   by which work is assigned, how you collaborate on that work,
[00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:23.860]   how much should be on your plate.
[00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:25.060]   And now we have something to push back on,
[00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:26.740]   now we have something to optimize,
[00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:28.820]   and now we can actually move past, I think,
[00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:32.500]   the excesses in terms of workload,
[00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:34.420]   the excesses in terms of sacrifice
[00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:36.300]   that our current knowledge work context creates.
[00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:38.220]   Now, this is like an intensely pragmatic thing.
[00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:41.700]   I'm talking about processes for communication
[00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:45.460]   and task boards and push versus pull work allocation systems
[00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:47.580]   and what we can learn from just-in-time manufacturing
[00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:48.420]   and Kanban.
[00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:49.540]   None of this is sexy.
[00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:51.900]   It's much better to have a sub stack and a Twitter account
[00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:54.820]   and talk about the excesses of capitalism
[00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:57.940]   and how we have to, in the sort of the post-capitalist order,
[00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:00.860]   we'll all just have, I guess, universal basic incomes
[00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:02.420]   and write poetry or whatever.
[00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:03.940]   And I'm not being fair to Jacobs.
[00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:06.780]   I'm obviously exaggerating here, and that's all fine.
[00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:08.180]   And I think it's good to have avant-garde
[00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:10.220]   philosophical critique because the avant-garde
[00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:12.500]   pulls forward the mainstream, and that's all good,
[00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:14.540]   but I'm not on the avant-garde.
[00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:18.140]   I like to think of myself as more in the cubicle trenches.
[00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:19.900]   And so I think this is what I was talking about in that article.
[00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:21.500]   This is a core issue right now.
[00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:22.540]   It's very pragmatic.
[00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:26.260]   Implicit informal systems for work assignment,
[00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:28.380]   organization, and collaboration cause issues,
[00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:29.860]   and it frustrates and burns people out.
[00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:31.220]   So let's make them explicit.
[00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:33.980]   And I think that's what Jacobs was taking me to task.
[00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:38.060]   He was like, "Well, but let's not talk about systems.
[00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:39.980]   "That seems weird and corporate and capitalist.
[00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:41.100]   "Let's not talk about systems.
[00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:42.980]   "Let's not talk about trying to figure out
[00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:44.460]   "what's more productive.
[00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:46.900]   "Let's be very careful about the language we use."
[00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:47.740]   And I'm like, "That's fine."
[00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:50.980]   I think when I write for the Hedgehog Review,
[00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:53.820]   I'll be more careful about the appropriate language,
[00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:55.660]   but I think this is a concrete issue
[00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:58.620]   that I think real people have.
[00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:00.300]   And this is a concrete approach
[00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:03.500]   to actually solving those issues.
[00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:05.740]   I mean, let's get in the trenches and figure out
[00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:10.060]   why do you have 200 emails and are working on the weekend?
[00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:14.540]   And yes, we could stand back and say because of capitalism,
[00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:17.580]   but that's not gonna fix this person's problem next week.
[00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:23.660]   And so again, I think both of these levels
[00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:26.340]   of analysis are important.
[00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:29.580]   I talk at my level.
[00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:34.020]   I think a lot of the elite discourses talk at another level.
[00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:35.300]   Both are important.
[00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:38.380]   The avant-garde pulls forward, the mainstream.
[00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:40.460]   And I also think debate is good.
[00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:41.860]   I think this is a useful article
[00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:43.740]   and it's a well-written article.
[00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:46.460]   And I think Jacobs is very thoughtful,
[00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:48.860]   but there's a lot of other commentators out there
[00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:53.380]   where I think the anti-productivity discourse
[00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:58.300]   so easily just falls more into, I want applause.
[00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:02.820]   I want applause for how radically critical I am
[00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:04.740]   and aren't I smart and I hate capitalism,
[00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:06.620]   subscribe to my sub stack because I want more money.
[00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:10.500]   Yeah, it's like this whole, it's fine and I'm boring.
[00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:12.460]   And I think we get too many emails and I wanna fix it.
[00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:16.060]   So I don't know if that's convincing, Simon,
[00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:21.060]   but I guess that's my off the cuff review.
[00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:22.060]   I mean, Jesse, if you look at me,
[00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:23.860]   you see no one's ever gonna associate with me.
[00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:27.580]   You just look at me and say, you can't be a radical.
[00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:29.380]   You can't be avant-garde.
[00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:31.420]   You have a part in your hair.
[00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:33.020]   You know what I mean?
[00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:34.220]   So like, why even try?
[00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:35.060]   Why even try?
[00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:37.700]   So I was like, let's talk about how
[00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:40.420]   we need more systematic work assignment policies.
[00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:42.900]   No one ever associates me with the word
[00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:44.180]   intellectually cool.
[00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:47.940]   I mean, if I do like a beret
[00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:50.540]   and had a cigarette in a cigarette holder,
[00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:52.500]   see, then we might be playing with fire.
[00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:57.500]   And if I was like, here's the thing, here's the thing.
[00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:58.780]   I need an accent too.
[00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:00.300]   Here's the thing.
[00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:05.060]   You got to have another column on your Trello board
[00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:07.940]   for waiting to hear back.
[00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:12.940]   Waiting to hear back should be its own column.
[00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:18.220]   And then I just throw in some of the post-liberal stuff too.
[00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:23.220]   And do better, the Zoom.
[00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:26.900]   Zoom is the shackles of the bourgeois.
[00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:30.460]   Because French intellectuals are very cool.
[00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:35.460]   And we need to get rid of the capitalism.
[00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:36.300]   You do better.
[00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:41.300]   But also, you should use Calendly
[00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:44.420]   when setting up your meetings.
[00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:45.260]   Because it's less email.
[00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:47.500]   See, what I'm going to do, I could mix them together.
[00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:49.900]   Like the really avant-garde philosophical stuff.
[00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:55.900]   As Edward Said taught us well,
[00:27:55.900 --> 00:28:01.580]   you should only use email for short questions.
[00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:03.500]   And also do not other.
[00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:06.220]   So I'll mix in post-colonial theory
[00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:11.220]   plus my advice for scheduling deep work sessions.
[00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:14.540]   But see, no one would buy it from me.
[00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:15.380]   I'm not French.
[00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:16.580]   I don't have the right accent.
[00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:19.180]   I'm not like suitably angry.
[00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:20.820]   I have read all this stuff, by the way.
[00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:21.660]   I mean, I get it.
[00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:22.620]   I'm on a university campus.
[00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:23.460]   It's good stuff.
[00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:24.540]   I like the avant-garde.
[00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:25.740]   - The accent was solid.
[00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:26.580]   - It's solid?
[00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:28.780]   All right, do the rest of the episode that way.
[00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:32.460]   - Do the ad reads that way.
[00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:34.980]   - Yeah, as long as they're not mad at us enough.
[00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:35.820]   Yeah.
[00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:38.020]   Why does this company even exist?
[00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:41.700]   It's just a stooge of the capitalist.
[00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:45.540]   The only company that I think should exist
[00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:50.100]   is, I don't know what company,
[00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:51.660]   the Hedgehog Review,
[00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:55.180]   the only sponsor we have for the show.
[00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:57.460]   And we paid them money.
[00:28:57.460 --> 00:28:59.860]   If they're paying us,
[00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:02.540]   this is a capitalist exchange.
[00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:03.620]   It is dirty.
[00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:08.020]   No, so we paid them money to be on the show
[00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:10.420]   as Foucault taught us.
[00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:12.260]   As Foucault taught us.
[00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:15.460]   The power hierarchy that defines
[00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:17.420]   the modern podcast ad agency
[00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:22.420]   is itself a vestige of capitalist supremacy.
[00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:25.580]   And so we could do it.
[00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:26.420]   We could do it.
[00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:28.260]   I don't think, again,
[00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:29.460]   I've got a part in my haircut.
[00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:30.500]   I can't pull it off.
[00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:34.540]   I need a Shay t-shirt and shave my head maybe.
[00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:35.980]   I don't know.
[00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:39.460]   Or I'll just continue to be kind of a dork.
[00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:40.900]   It's worked okay so far.
[00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:41.740]   All right.
[00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:42.580]   - Having hair is a good thing.
[00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:43.420]   - Having hair is a good thing.
[00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:44.780]   That's right.
[00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:46.540]   All right, so Simon, there you go.
[00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:48.340]   Let's do another call here.
[00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:49.380]   I'm back to dork mode.
[00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:50.220]   Another call.
[00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:51.940]   - All right.
[00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:53.180]   That was a great bit there.
[00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:56.620]   Our next call is about basically
[00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:58.580]   talking about those Conor arguments,
[00:29:58.580 --> 00:29:59.500]   but in this case,
[00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:01.220]   it's authors that run Conor
[00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:03.780]   to your career capital theory.
[00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:04.620]   - Yeah.
[00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:06.220]   People are really out to get me today.
[00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:09.900]   - Hey Cal, my name's Donald
[00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:12.100]   and I'm thinking about transitioning my career
[00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:15.140]   as we move cities, my fiance and I.
[00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:16.740]   And so my question today is actually
[00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:21.020]   about how to have two conflicting ideas about something.
[00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:21.940]   How do we hold those?
[00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:23.460]   I know you talk a lot about
[00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:26.980]   making sure we're reading different authors
[00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:29.740]   and different perspectives on a theory
[00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:30.660]   or whatever that might be
[00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:32.260]   to make sure that you're getting both sides
[00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:34.620]   and letting those sit with you
[00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:37.660]   and kind of battle it out, so to speak.
[00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:40.380]   And I read "So Good They Can't Ignore You"
[00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:41.460]   pretty early on in my career
[00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:43.460]   and I am a big believer in it.
[00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:45.780]   And I'm 10 or 12 years into my career now
[00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:47.660]   and I've gained this capital,
[00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:51.780]   but I have this other passion that's kind of nagging at me.
[00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:54.100]   And from the career capital side,
[00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:56.100]   I know I shouldn't necessarily
[00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:57.460]   follow that passion right now,
[00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:00.140]   but I'm curious if you know of any authors,
[00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:03.980]   books or other people on this topic
[00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:06.940]   that might run counter to your career capital theory.
[00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:07.980]   I firmly believe in it,
[00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:10.580]   but I'm also trying to practice what we preach around here
[00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:13.820]   about making sure to have different opinions
[00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:17.540]   to allow to help me kind of make this decision.
[00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:18.700]   Would love any thoughts you have.
[00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:20.580]   And again, just really appreciate what you do.
[00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:21.980]   Thanks, Cal.
[00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:24.740]   - All right, well now I'm wishing he had told us
[00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:26.320]   what the passion was.
[00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:29.260]   Because that could be actually be pretty relevant
[00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:31.020]   for thinking about this.
[00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:32.660]   But I like your approach here,
[00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:33.500]   because what I preach,
[00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:37.900]   which is having differing smart opinions about things
[00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:39.300]   in your head at the same time
[00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:41.980]   gives you a more nuanced understanding of the world.
[00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:44.180]   I mean, we were just joking in the last caller,
[00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:46.300]   but we were talking about Alan Jacobs' essay
[00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:48.340]   and he had a different take on productivity than mine.
[00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:49.340]   We're kind of joking about it,
[00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:51.580]   but actually that collision.
[00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:53.640]   So my sort of dorkish New York article
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:57.100]   versus like Alan Jacobs' Hedgehog Review article
[00:31:57.100 --> 00:31:59.300]   crash those together.
[00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:00.580]   And what you come away with is not,
[00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:02.740]   oh, one exploded and this one is right.
[00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:04.940]   You have a more nuanced understanding of the topic,
[00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:05.780]   which I think is excellent.
[00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:07.740]   So if we're thinking about career capital theory,
[00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:11.780]   what are good things to push up against that?
[00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:13.340]   Well, again, let's clarify exactly
[00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:15.020]   what career capital theory is saying.
[00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:17.420]   What it's saying is that typically the things
[00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:20.920]   that make a good job good are rare and valuable.
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:22.220]   So you have to have something rare and valuable
[00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:24.260]   to offer in return.
[00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:26.100]   And in the professional context,
[00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:27.260]   it'll be rare and valuable skills.
[00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:28.780]   So get better at things that are valuable,
[00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:31.020]   then use those things as leverage to shape your career
[00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:31.860]   in ways that resonate.
[00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:34.980]   That's a pretty repeatable path
[00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:37.860]   towards feeling really good about your career.
[00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:39.980]   And there's other takes on this, obviously.
[00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:43.540]   Like the straw man take, which is popular in culture,
[00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:46.380]   but is rarely, I think,
[00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:48.260]   articulated in good books so simplicitly.
[00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:50.460]   The straw man alternative is just, no, no,
[00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:51.300]   follow your passion.
[00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:52.300]   You're inborn to do one thing.
[00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:53.300]   If you do that thing, you'll love it.
[00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:54.140]   If you don't, you won't.
[00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:55.200]   But that's a bit of a straw man,
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:59.180]   because I would say that the more important counterpoints
[00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:01.420]   to career capital theory would be a little bit more subtle.
[00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:03.500]   So one of the counterpoints you should try to encounter,
[00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:05.420]   and I think Wendell Berry, who we talked about
[00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:07.860]   at the beginning of the show, is a good example of this,
[00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:10.980]   is, and the Jacobs essay we just read,
[00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:13.420]   is the whole strain of thought that says,
[00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:14.900]   shaping your career shouldn't be
[00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:16.700]   the most important thing anyways.
[00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:19.340]   What matters is building a good life
[00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:21.260]   based on values that is important,
[00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:23.980]   and you might need some money in there so you have a job,
[00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:25.700]   but stop thinking so much about your job anyways,
[00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:29.020]   except for to the degree to that which it steps on
[00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:30.260]   other things that are important to you.
[00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:33.540]   This is like Berry leaving his teaching job in New York
[00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:38.060]   to go live in Kentucky, but there's any numbers of examples
[00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:43.060]   of books where you see people building a life of meaning
[00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:47.380]   off of focusing on values that maybe have
[00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:49.580]   very little to do with their work.
[00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:52.660]   So I mean, I can give you some specific suggestions here.
[00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:56.440]   Go back and read a classic, like Thomas Merton,
[00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:59.260]   with the seven-story mountain, I believe it's called,
[00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:00.580]   which is about him.
[00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:02.420]   It's a memoir, I'm actually reading it right now,
[00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:04.300]   it's one of my March books,
[00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:06.340]   but a memoir about how he also, like Berry,
[00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:09.380]   left life in New York as a writer,
[00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:11.900]   and eventually becoming a monk,
[00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:13.220]   and writing about the experience,
[00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:16.660]   and it was very inspirational to a lot of people,
[00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:21.020]   but he just downgraded the professional aspect of his life.
[00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:25.620]   Richard Rohr's book, R-O-H-R, I wanna get this right,
[00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:27.220]   falling, can you look this up, Jesse?
[00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:32.220]   Richard Rohr, Falling Up, Falling,
[00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:36.220]   it's falling something, Jesse's gonna look this up,
[00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:37.340]   but it's a book-- - Falling Upward.
[00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:40.460]   - Falling Upward, that's a book I read, Richard Rohr,
[00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:45.460]   R-O-H-R, he's also a Catholic, in a Catholic order,
[00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:48.460]   I think he might be a Franciscan.
[00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:52.700]   That's about how in the second half of life,
[00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:54.780]   building your life around service to others
[00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:56.880]   is the source of the deepest meaning.
[00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:59.420]   David Brooks read Richard Rohr,
[00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:01.340]   and then wrote basically his own version
[00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:03.140]   of Falling Upward, it's called The Second Mountain,
[00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:05.100]   which is, again, I would read The Second Mountain,
[00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:07.620]   I would throw that right against So Good They Can't Ignore You,
[00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:10.100]   they'll hit together, and sparks will fly,
[00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:11.820]   and something even better will emerge,
[00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:14.180]   so The Second Mountain is about how
[00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:16.940]   maybe the first half of your adult life
[00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:19.860]   is aimed towards what he calls resume values,
[00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:22.140]   building up your career, making it the way you like,
[00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:23.660]   but then the second half of your adult life
[00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:26.320]   is where you really focus on eulogy values,
[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:27.740]   and it's, again, service to others,
[00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:29.760]   connection to other people, you see David Brooks
[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:32.900]   struggling with building meaning beyond
[00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:34.820]   just his otherwise very successful career,
[00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:36.100]   so you read those type of books,
[00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:37.340]   and you get this counterpoint that says,
[00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:41.540]   yeah, whatever, right, like your work is what it is,
[00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:43.500]   but it's not gonna be at the core of a life well lived,
[00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:47.780]   so I think that's what you might wanna read,
[00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:49.020]   because my concern here, and again,
[00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:50.940]   I don't know what the passion is you're talking about,
[00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:54.100]   but if it's a professional passion,
[00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:55.840]   my concern here is that it's possible
[00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:59.500]   that you're heading towards this second mountain in life,
[00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:02.180]   this Richard Rohr falling upwards,
[00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:05.100]   and you're feeling that dissatisfaction,
[00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:08.300]   that hunger, a soul ache, so it's something quite deep,
[00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:10.000]   and you're saying, you're looking
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.700]   just within the professional lane,
[00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:14.160]   so maybe I need to change my job,
[00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:17.220]   and if my job was something that was more passionate about,
[00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:18.580]   I would get that back, but it's possible
[00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:21.140]   that things need to change as everything else in your life,
[00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:23.060]   so I think those books you're gonna find useful.
[00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:26.380]   I think also just my deep life philosophy in general,
[00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:29.600]   it's not contrary to So Good They Can't Ignore You,
[00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:31.880]   but it generalizes it and contains it,
[00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:34.560]   is my deep life philosophy, which again,
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:37.100]   there's a recorded a core idea video on this,
[00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:40.840]   so go to youtube.com/calendlyportmedia,
[00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:43.880]   go to the core ideas playlist, go to the deep life,
[00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:45.860]   the deep life core idea video,
[00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:47.980]   is it constrains that professional part
[00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:50.280]   to just one of four or five different areas
[00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:52.660]   that we call buckets that you focus on,
[00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:54.760]   and when you see the four or five different buckets
[00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:57.360]   of your life, you're then caring about how they interact
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:58.440]   and connect with each other,
[00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:00.900]   you're not just prioritizing one over the other,
[00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:03.160]   so you might find those exercises useful too,
[00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:07.080]   and again, they don't repudiate So Good They Can't Ignore You
[00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:10.240]   but they constrain it and put into a larger context,
[00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:14.640]   that's a good question, and that is what I'd recommend,
[00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:18.520]   I think you're gonna get some good feedback there,
[00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:20.920]   get some good pushback, and I'm glad you're seeking that.
[00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:23.600]   All right, do we have a caller now, Jesse,
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:26.320]   where they're like, I just wanted to tell you,
[00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:29.920]   you're brilliant and your work is 100% right,
[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:31.920]   and-- - They like your part.
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:33.160]   - And I like the part in your hair,
[00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:34.160]   and you don't look dorky,
[00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:35.800]   and I think you're cool like Che Guevara,
[00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:37.800]   can we just get one caller that says that?
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:40.840]   Jesse's shaking his head no.
[00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:45.880]   All right, what do we got instead?
[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:49.040]   - All right, next call is about your thoughts
[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:51.680]   on the future of a 40 hour work week
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:54.080]   in the eight hour work day.
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:59.640]   - Hey Cal, for knowledge work,
[00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:02.600]   what do you think of the standard eight hour work day,
[00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:05.440]   40 hour work week, and what's ideal,
[00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:08.320]   and do you think that this is likely to change at all
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:10.300]   in the next 10 years?
[00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:13.960]   - It's a good question,
[00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:17.200]   so I've thought and written some about this,
[00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:21.200]   I had a New Yorker piece in January,
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:22.520]   that was about slow productivity,
[00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:24.920]   and it actually opened talking about
[00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:26.680]   some of these ongoing discussions
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:28.640]   to shorten the official work week,
[00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:31.320]   and basically my take is,
[00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:33.120]   focusing on the number of hours we work,
[00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:35.460]   or the number of days we work,
[00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:39.360]   in this broader context of burnout and dissatisfaction,
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:43.680]   and a general reconfiguration of the working world,
[00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:46.760]   especially in knowledge work, I think it's a red herring.
[00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:49.440]   I don't think that is the problem that people have,
[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:51.200]   I don't think the problem that people really have
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:52.840]   with knowledge work right now,
[00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:57.040]   is that they have to work Friday,
[00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:58.520]   in addition to Monday through Thursday,
[00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:00.720]   I don't think it's that the day ends at five,
[00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:02.680]   versus four, versus three,
[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:06.080]   these are knobs you can tune on the margins,
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:11.080]   and though I am a believer in results oriented style of work,
[00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:13.120]   and I think having a lot of variety
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:15.680]   in how people configure their work days and work weeks,
[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:17.360]   is in general a nice thing to explore,
[00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:20.520]   it's not the solution on its own,
[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:22.680]   to the issues of dissatisfaction and burnout
[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:24.440]   that so many are facing.
[00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:25.760]   And my argument in that piece,
[00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:27.880]   and also an argument I lay out in a video,
[00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:30.640]   and again I'm really pitching these core idea videos today,
[00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:33.040]   because this is why I recorded them for exactly this purpose
[00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:35.000]   so I can reference my ideas easily,
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.120]   but if you read, watch my core idea video
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:39.320]   on slow productivity, I make this point,
[00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:40.780]   the real issue is overload.
[00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:43.920]   The thing that is burning people out,
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:45.760]   the thing that's causing a lot of dissatisfaction,
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:47.760]   or at least one of the many factors in knowledge work,
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:50.000]   is having more on your plate
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.640]   than you can easily imagine accomplishing,
[00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:54.520]   and having an incoming stream
[00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:56.700]   of ever more piling on top of that.
[00:39:56.700 --> 00:40:00.600]   So you enter the state
[00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:03.640]   where you have this overwhelming amount of obligations,
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:06.480]   and three different things happen.
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:10.720]   One, there is a mental short-circuiting that happens,
[00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:12.080]   there's a part of the human brain
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:15.480]   that is charged with making long-term plans for our goals,
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:16.920]   that thing short-circuits
[00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:19.160]   when you give it 75 different obligations
[00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:20.880]   and 700 unread emails.
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:23.960]   It can't figure out a plan for all of those things,
[00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:25.160]   and then it feels like it's failing
[00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:26.520]   to make plans that are things that are important,
[00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:28.920]   and you feel anxious and you feel overwhelmed.
[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:30.040]   We have a short-circuiting effect
[00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:32.720]   that directly makes us feel bad.
[00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:36.280]   Then we have a pragmatic negative impact,
[00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:37.940]   which is overhead spirals.
[00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:40.080]   Everything on your plate that you agree to do,
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:42.080]   be it a small thing or a major project,
[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:43.540]   brings with it a fixed amount
[00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:46.600]   of collaborative overhead that is required.
[00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:48.920]   Okay, to get this done, I have to talk to some people
[00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:51.080]   and keep people posted and go find some information
[00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:52.280]   I need to accomplish it.
[00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:55.680]   Now, that's all fine if you give me one thing to do.
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:58.040]   Yeah, I gotta find information and talk to some people
[00:40:58.040 --> 00:40:59.520]   and have some meetings where we can discuss
[00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:01.160]   how it's gonna happen.
[00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:03.280]   The problem is when you have more on your plate
[00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:04.120]   than you can handle,
[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:06.000]   when you're in a state of chronic overload,
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   each of those things brings with it
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.080]   its fixed amount of overhead.
[00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:13.360]   And if you have a huge amount of things on your plate
[00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:17.560]   that overhead alone takes up most of your schedule.
[00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:21.840]   Everyone experienced this who had a certain type
[00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:23.360]   of knowledge work job during the pandemic,
[00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:25.780]   experienced this when they found their calendars
[00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:27.420]   get completely full with Zoom meetings,
[00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:28.760]   back to back to back to back,
[00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:30.860]   and their inbox is completely overflowing.
[00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:35.200]   That is overhead spirals and overhead spiral.
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:37.140]   You have too much stuff on your plate,
[00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:38.440]   so the overhead takes all your time.
[00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:40.600]   And why it's a spiral is because now if all your time
[00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:42.700]   is spent servicing the overhead,
[00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:43.920]   you're making very little progress
[00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:45.800]   on the things that remain.
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:48.480]   So more things pile up and then you get more overhead
[00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:50.640]   that you have to service, more meetings, more emails,
[00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:53.040]   you get farther and farther behind.
[00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:58.040]   This is maddening, it's misery making.
[00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:02.440]   It's almost satirical sometimes how it feels,
[00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:04.760]   how much you're just in these meetings and doing emails.
[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:07.880]   So it's completely crushes the soul.
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:12.200]   And it ends up requiring you to try to fit work
[00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:13.860]   into early in the morning or in the evening
[00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:16.140]   or on the weekends 'cause it has to get done sometime.
[00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:18.700]   So now you're losing the time that you would ordinary spend
[00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:19.900]   to do other things that are important to you,
[00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:21.860]   and that is going to accelerate burnout as well.
[00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:23.060]   So that is happening as well.
[00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:25.220]   And then you just have the alienation from output
[00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:27.460]   because you have so little time to actually do the stuff
[00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:28.340]   that you're good at doing,
[00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:29.660]   the stuff that actually makes an impact.
[00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:31.100]   You're doing it in small bursts
[00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:33.420]   and you're doing it at night while all day you're on Zoom,
[00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:36.300]   and there's a real alienation from your productive potential.
[00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:38.540]   So chronic overload, having more on your plate
[00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:40.020]   than you can easily handle,
[00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:42.380]   creates these three horsemen
[00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:45.020]   of the knowledge worker burnout apocalypse.
[00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:49.220]   This is why we are predominantly feeling so bad
[00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:51.260]   is this overload that we're all feeling.
[00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:55.660]   And if you tell me you don't have to work on Friday,
[00:42:55.660 --> 00:42:56.980]   I was like, that doesn't help much
[00:42:56.980 --> 00:42:58.900]   because I still have all of these things.
[00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:00.060]   I'm short circuiting my brain.
[00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:02.040]   I've overhead spirals taking up all my time.
[00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:03.860]   I'm just gonna put work in that Friday anyways
[00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:05.220]   'cause when am I gonna get things done?
[00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:07.620]   It's not by itself gonna solve the problem.
[00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:08.840]   How are we gonna solve the problem
[00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:11.660]   is stop having so much stuff on people's plates.
[00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:15.380]   The work should get stopped at a central system
[00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:19.580]   from which you can pull when you have free cycles.
[00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:21.020]   When I'm done with what I'm working on now,
[00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:22.620]   I'll pull something else.
[00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:24.460]   You can't just let that damn burst
[00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:25.700]   and just throw it on everyone's plate
[00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:28.260]   with no constriction, with no restraint.
[00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:30.760]   I think that is really the much more important
[00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:33.140]   than reducing the work week or reducing the work day.
[00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:35.580]   Now, again, I think flexibility is critical.
[00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:37.420]   Reconfiguring your hours is critical,
[00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:40.600]   but we don't have a crisis of having too many work hours.
[00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:43.180]   And this is a very different way of thinking about this
[00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:45.780]   because in a industrial context,
[00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:50.240]   work hours was the main knob you had to turn
[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:52.520]   when trying to deal with the employee's
[00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:54.160]   subjective experience of work.
[00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:55.860]   If you worked on an assembly line,
[00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:58.840]   the main metric that seemed to matter
[00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:00.400]   was how much time do you have to spend
[00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:01.460]   working on that assembly line?
[00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:04.340]   So a union was gonna fight for less hours,
[00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:06.600]   which they successfully did in the early 20th century,
[00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:08.880]   and that's where the 40-hour work week came from.
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:11.640]   The context of knowledge work, the issue is different.
[00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:13.320]   It's not the number of hours so much
[00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:14.940]   as it is the number of things on our plate
[00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:17.320]   that's causing a lot of the troubles.
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:19.220]   So that's where I wanna make sure we have a lot of focus
[00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:20.440]   because if we don't solve that problem,
[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:21.600]   it doesn't matter what you say
[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:23.720]   about how many days you're supposed to work
[00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:25.880]   or how many hours you're supposed to work.
[00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:28.280]   We will be miserable till we solve that problem.
[00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:32.100]   Now, this brings us back to the first caller
[00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:34.160]   who was talking about the disagreement
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:36.700]   between me and Alan Jacobs in the Hedgehog Review.
[00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:41.840]   It is exactly this problem where my style solution shows up
[00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:43.160]   and I think has some merit
[00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:45.360]   because when I'm looking at this very pragmatic problem,
[00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:47.920]   I said, "We have to figure out how to re-engineer
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:51.440]   work systems so that you do not have too much stuff
[00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:53.040]   on your plate because it causes a lot of misery."
[00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:54.000]   This is a boring thing.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.820]   This is like in the industrial age,
[00:44:56.820 --> 00:44:59.360]   if in the late 19th century, earliest 20th century,
[00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:01.600]   if you're there saying, "We have to actually change
[00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:04.280]   the way we've configured these assembly lines
[00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:06.340]   because the wheels are moving by too fast
[00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:08.520]   and people are getting repetitive strain injuries."
[00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:11.020]   That's kind of a boring but pragmatic solution.
[00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:14.080]   Now, in that early 20th century context
[00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:17.160]   or the late 19th century, the sexy stuff would be,
[00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:21.080]   we have to rethink capitalism.
[00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:24.680]   What we need is to, we need to socialize the plants
[00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:27.040]   or we have to have a Marxist style revolution.
[00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:27.880]   That's the sexy stuff.
[00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:29.560]   That's big think theory.
[00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:31.780]   We got to rethink how we even allocate
[00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:34.440]   and make profit off of capital and alienation of labor.
[00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:36.220]   And that's the exciting stuff.
[00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:39.940]   The boring stuff was, we need to give more breaks
[00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:42.320]   to the workers and slow down the steering wheels.
[00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:44.980]   I'm like that boring guy today with knowledge work.
[00:45:44.980 --> 00:45:47.840]   The sexy stuff is these post-capitalist visions
[00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:50.400]   of re-imagining the role of work
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:52.860]   and rethinking what work means in our life
[00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:55.880]   and how much we have to do to support ourselves and et cetera.
[00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:57.200]   That's the sexy, interesting stuff.
[00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:59.240]   And I'm in here saying, "Yeah, but also we have to make sure
[00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:01.960]   that you can't have 50 tasks on your plate at the same time.
[00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:04.680]   And this is a workflow system problem.
[00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:06.720]   It's a productivity system problem.
[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:07.560]   It's not exciting.
[00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:08.600]   It's not sexy, but it's the stuff
[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:11.040]   that can actually make a difference right now
[00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:13.640]   while we're waiting for the overthrow of capitalism."
[00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:15.720]   I think that's a good question.
[00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:18.700]   That's where I'm putting my focus though,
[00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:20.880]   is in the short term,
[00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:23.280]   overload is one of the biggest problems
[00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:24.240]   that I think we could solve.
[00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:26.840]   And the reason why I think we can solve it by the way
[00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:29.560]   is it's not a...
[00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:33.880]   The relationship here is one of more win-win
[00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:35.280]   than other type of labor issues.
[00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:39.480]   So the chronic overload makes workers less productive
[00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:40.300]   in a lot of ways.
[00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:42.480]   Clearly, if you're in an overhead spiral,
[00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:45.460]   it limits the amount of good work you can produce.
[00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:47.900]   Clearly, if you're burnt out and leaving your job,
[00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:49.320]   that's bad for the employer.
[00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:52.760]   So pull-based systems,
[00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:53.740]   where you have a small number of things
[00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:54.580]   on your plate at a time,
[00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:55.800]   but you work on them really intensely
[00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:57.440]   and then pull in a new thing when you finish,
[00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:59.960]   well, probably actually from a company's perspective
[00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:01.720]   or an organization's perspective,
[00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:03.480]   more things will get done at higher quality.
[00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:05.400]   Their employers will be more happy, not burn out as much.
[00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:07.200]   I mean, it's a bit of a win-win situation.
[00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:08.160]   It's just complicated.
[00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:09.800]   So this is the nice thing about this
[00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:12.840]   versus other labor movements we've had in the past.
[00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:15.440]   This is not so much labor versus management.
[00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:18.380]   It's more like labor and management versus complexity.
[00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:22.040]   The way we work now is easy.
[00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:23.840]   The way I'm talking about is a pain.
[00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:25.600]   And things that are a pain take a long time to get right.
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:26.880]   Who wants to be the one that first wants
[00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:28.160]   to completely rethink their work?
[00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:29.200]   And what if it doesn't work?
[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:31.040]   And I've talked about this before.
[00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:32.840]   It took Henry Ford years to figure out
[00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:34.400]   how to make the assembly line profitable
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:35.480]   until then he looked stupid.
[00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:37.580]   So it's a whole complicated mess,
[00:47:37.580 --> 00:47:38.880]   but that's where I'm putting my focus.
[00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:40.620]   I like flexibility in work.
[00:47:40.620 --> 00:47:42.560]   I like to be able to control when my hours are
[00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:45.160]   to some degree great, but let's fix the overload problem.
[00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:48.100]   We're gonna get a huge immediate benefit.
[00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:51.180]   All right, so speaking about overload,
[00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:54.760]   let me talk about a couple sponsors here.
[00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:58.200]   Let's see our first sponsor is,
[00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:00.080]   oh no, it's Alan Jacobs.
[00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:01.560]   Shoot, sorry.
[00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:03.040]   Man, we keep doing that.
[00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:03.880]   Keep doing that.
[00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:04.700]   No, I'm joking.
[00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:06.120]   I like Alan, very, very smart, smarter than me.
[00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:07.920]   So read his stuff.
[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:10.300]   No, we got ExpressVPN is our sponsor here.
[00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:12.840]   We've talked about this before,
[00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:15.640]   how a VPN works, why you need a VPN.
[00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:18.880]   VPNs are gonna get you privacy and security online.
[00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:20.000]   And if you're gonna use a VPN,
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.800]   use the one I use, which is ExpressVPN.
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:25.560]   'Cause they have a lot of servers all around the world
[00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:27.600]   and very fast speeds.
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:28.880]   You won't even know it's turned on.
[00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:29.920]   It's a great VPN.
[00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:33.760]   But they sent me some notes about a particular usage
[00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:35.920]   of their VPN, which I've been messing around with
[00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:36.980]   and think is quite cool,
[00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:41.080]   which is if you connect to a VPN server in another country,
[00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:45.440]   you can access content that is only available
[00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:46.600]   in that country.
[00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:49.380]   I've been doing this recently to get access
[00:48:49.380 --> 00:48:51.240]   to the BBC player in the UK,
[00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:53.920]   connect to an ExpressVPN server in the UK.
[00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:57.840]   I can now stream that regionalized BBC coverage,
[00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:00.120]   which right now is my favorite coverage
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:01.560]   on the war in Ukraine.
[00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:02.960]   So it's been quite useful.
[00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:06.920]   So I think that's just a nice bonus feature you get
[00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:09.920]   out of using a service like ExpressVPN.
[00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:14.740]   They have servers in over a hundred countries,
[00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:17.820]   industry leading fast speed,
[00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:19.840]   very little buffering and lag, great service.
[00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:22.160]   And that's a cool thing you can do with it.
[00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:24.820]   So if you visit my special link right now
[00:49:24.820 --> 00:49:26.880]   at expressvpn.com/deep,
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:31.880]   you can get an extra three months of ExpressVPN for free.
[00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:33.980]   So support the show and watch what you want
[00:49:33.980 --> 00:49:38.800]   while also protecting yourself with ExpressVPN
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:43.800]   at expressvpn.com/deep.
[00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:48.120]   Also wanna talk about Athletic Greens,
[00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:53.120]   the preferred daily nutritional supplement of Jessie's mom.
[00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:58.120]   I believe that is now the official slogan.
[00:49:58.120 --> 00:49:59.320]   We're gonna have to have her now come back
[00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:01.400]   and do a review after she's tried it for a while.
[00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:02.240]   - A hundred percent.
[00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:04.600]   - Yeah, we're gonna get real endorsements,
[00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:05.440]   real endorsements.
[00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:06.360]   But I can give you my endorsement
[00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:09.160]   because I do use Athletic Greens AG1
[00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:13.320]   nutritional supplement powder every morning.
[00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:15.360]   75 high quality vitamins, minerals,
[00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:18.640]   and whole food source superfoods, probiotics,
[00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:21.720]   and adaptogens, incredibly high quality ingredients.
[00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:26.120]   They obsessively improve their ingredients year after year.
[00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:27.860]   You put it in the water, you shake it up,
[00:50:27.860 --> 00:50:29.220]   you add the vitamin D drops
[00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:30.600]   because those have to be in liquid form
[00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:33.520]   until the last minute, shake that, take it.
[00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:38.520]   And you can be assured that you have the things you need,
[00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:40.460]   the things your body craves.
[00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:42.040]   And I do my best to eat well,
[00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:43.160]   I do my best to eat clean,
[00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:44.660]   but I know I'm not hitting all the things
[00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:45.500]   at all times of the year.
[00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:49.660]   So Athletic Greens is my insurance,
[00:50:49.660 --> 00:50:53.560]   my nutritional insurance that I am getting what I need.
[00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:56.160]   So right now it is time to reclaim your health
[00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:59.320]   and arm your immune system with convenient daily nutrition,
[00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:01.320]   especially now that we are in the midst
[00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:03.680]   of flu and cold season.
[00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:06.560]   It's just one scoop in a cup of water every day, that's it.
[00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:09.520]   No need for a million different pills and supplements
[00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:12.760]   to look out for your health.
[00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:13.600]   To make it easy,
[00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:16.320]   Athletic Greens is going to give you a free one-year supply
[00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:18.520]   of immune-supporting vitamin D.
[00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:22.000]   You add that right into the daily drink.
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:23.520]   They'll also give you five free travel packs
[00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:25.440]   with your first purchase.
[00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:29.140]   All you have to do is visit athleticgreens.com/deep.
[00:51:29.140 --> 00:51:31.600]   Again, that is athleticgreens.com/deep
[00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:32.920]   to take ownership over your health
[00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:37.580]   and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance.
[00:51:37.580 --> 00:51:39.880]   All right.
[00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:42.960]   So where are we at here?
[00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:43.800]   I think we have time.
[00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:44.920]   Let's fit in one more call, Jesse,
[00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:46.600]   and then we'll call it a day
[00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:50.200]   so that we'll keep this episode svelte.
[00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:51.400]   - Sounds good.
[00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:53.880]   All right, the next question is about your reading habits.
[00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:56.560]   And a lot of people are interested in that sort of thing.
[00:51:56.560 --> 00:51:59.360]   And this has a twist, so we'll hear what it says.
[00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:00.620]   - Hi, Cal, this is Emily,
[00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:03.340]   and I'm a grad student in molecular biology.
[00:52:03.340 --> 00:52:04.460]   I have a problem with reading
[00:52:04.460 --> 00:52:06.120]   that I've never heard you discuss.
[00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:08.760]   I read obsessively, and I have since I was a child.
[00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:10.520]   I enjoy this, but if I'm not careful,
[00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:12.160]   it harms the rest of my life.
[00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:13.000]   I don't sleep enough.
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:14.320]   I neglect responsibilities.
[00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:15.700]   I even miss work.
[00:52:15.700 --> 00:52:17.720]   Even if I manage to put a book down halfway through,
[00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:20.600]   thoughts of it can distract me for hours.
[00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:22.660]   In order to focus on finishing my PhD,
[00:52:22.660 --> 00:52:25.200]   I've seriously restricted my reading for pleasure.
[00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:26.600]   This year, the majority of my reading
[00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:28.160]   has been either books I've read before
[00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:30.200]   or books that I find a bit dull,
[00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:32.520]   which allows me to stop reading when appropriate.
[00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:34.080]   On rare occasions, I'll take a Saturday
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:35.620]   to devour something new,
[00:52:35.620 --> 00:52:37.080]   but mostly I see this restriction
[00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:38.700]   as temporary but necessary.
[00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:41.560]   Your usual advice of carving out time
[00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:43.600]   for reading every day sounds dangerous for me,
[00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:45.200]   so I'm curious if you have any tips
[00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:47.600]   or alternate approaches to manage my experience.
[00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:48.420]   Thanks.
[00:52:48.420 --> 00:52:51.120]   - Well, Emily, it's a good question.
[00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:54.160]   Just as a brief aside before I get to your question,
[00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:56.480]   when we were having a little bit of a delay just there
[00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:57.360]   getting the call to work,
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:00.240]   it was reminding me, Jesse, of last week,
[00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:03.360]   the avalanche of technical errors
[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:06.920]   that the listener did not realize was occurring.
[00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:07.760]   - That was funny.
[00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:09.600]   I made a list, and I told several people about it
[00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:10.440]   over the weekend.
[00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:11.260]   It was funny.
[00:53:11.260 --> 00:53:12.840]   I made a list because thing after thing,
[00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:14.200]   we record these live,
[00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:16.240]   thing after thing was going wrong,
[00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:17.800]   and it was so many things going wrong
[00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:20.280]   that Jesse started writing them down.
[00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:22.000]   But let's see if I had this straight.
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.080]   I was asking you, so at some point,
[00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:26.480]   I was asking you about Blinkist, one of our sponsors,
[00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:28.560]   and you were trying to log in to Blinkist.
[00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:30.960]   - That was so funny.
[00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:33.120]   So you were asking me what Blinks I read,
[00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:34.360]   and you're like, "Log in to Blinkist
[00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:37.160]   "and tell me what you see on the homepage."
[00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:38.840]   So I go to Blinkist.com,
[00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:41.500]   but it's like, "Enter your login information."
[00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:44.820]   'Cause I logged in on another computer.
[00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:47.160]   So I had to go to my password document, look that up.
[00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:48.780]   But then as soon as that's happening,
[00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:50.420]   this laptop isn't great.
[00:53:50.420 --> 00:53:52.060]   Sometimes the browser's crashed.
[00:53:52.060 --> 00:53:52.960]   It crashed.
[00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:53.800]   You're still asking me.
[00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:55.660]   I'm trying to play it off by seeing--
[00:53:55.660 --> 00:53:57.740]   - And by the way, the browser is needed
[00:53:57.740 --> 00:53:59.060]   for playing the calls.
[00:53:59.060 --> 00:54:01.820]   So the browser crashing now has a big implication
[00:54:01.820 --> 00:54:04.180]   because now he can't play more calls.
[00:54:04.180 --> 00:54:05.460]   And I'm talking to him at this time.
[00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:06.860]   - Yeah, so I'm trying to play it off,
[00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:08.300]   tell you what Blinkist I was reading.
[00:54:08.300 --> 00:54:10.260]   I was trying to think about the one that I was reading,
[00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:13.580]   but I'm entering this so I could get it in.
[00:54:13.580 --> 00:54:15.140]   - Yeah, and then at some point,
[00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:16.900]   you're stuck in a captcha, right?
[00:54:16.900 --> 00:54:18.380]   - Yeah, oh yeah, forgot about that.
[00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:19.700]   - Vertical rivers.
[00:54:19.700 --> 00:54:20.860]   - So I get in there, like, yeah,
[00:54:20.860 --> 00:54:23.460]   "Identify 10 vertical rivers."
[00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:25.460]   I was telling my buddy who does online stuff,
[00:54:25.460 --> 00:54:27.780]   and he's like, "I had the same thing that day."
[00:54:27.780 --> 00:54:29.460]   - So all this is going on.
[00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:30.780]   He has to get the next question queued up.
[00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:32.380]   He's trying to talk to me on camera,
[00:54:32.380 --> 00:54:34.220]   and he has to identify vertical rivers
[00:54:34.220 --> 00:54:36.180]   from a large picture of,
[00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:40.300]   a large array of images of vertical rivers.
[00:54:40.300 --> 00:54:43.540]   So anyways, that's why we pay you $250,000 a month,
[00:54:43.540 --> 00:54:44.560]   because this is,
[00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:47.940]   that's why you get all that sweet, sweet
[00:54:47.940 --> 00:54:49.220]   athletic greens money,
[00:54:49.220 --> 00:54:51.620]   because it's a hard job.
[00:54:51.620 --> 00:54:52.500]   - And then when we came in,
[00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:53.860]   you were kind of in a rush,
[00:54:53.860 --> 00:54:55.700]   but I couldn't do anything 'cause the mouse had died.
[00:54:55.700 --> 00:54:57.340]   - Yeah, the mouse died,
[00:54:57.340 --> 00:54:59.700]   and the soundboard broke.
[00:54:59.700 --> 00:55:01.540]   Remember, the soundboard was giving static,
[00:55:01.540 --> 00:55:03.820]   like just a loud, large, loud static,
[00:55:03.820 --> 00:55:06.540]   and yeah, man, that was not our day.
[00:55:06.540 --> 00:55:07.380]   So we're doing pretty well.
[00:55:07.380 --> 00:55:09.580]   All we had was like one delayed call so far.
[00:55:09.580 --> 00:55:11.140]   So we're doing pretty well.
[00:55:11.140 --> 00:55:14.480]   All right, Emily, let's get to your question though.
[00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:15.660]   It's completely fine.
[00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:18.220]   What you're describing is completely fine.
[00:55:18.220 --> 00:55:20.780]   You're finding the types of books you're reading
[00:55:20.780 --> 00:55:22.220]   lead to compulsive reading,
[00:55:22.220 --> 00:55:24.500]   so you're doing less so that you can focus on other things.
[00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:25.340]   That's fine.
[00:55:25.340 --> 00:55:27.380]   Don't read every day,
[00:55:27.380 --> 00:55:29.900]   if it's creating that compulsion.
[00:55:29.900 --> 00:55:33.580]   And I think you've already landed on three solutions.
[00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:35.660]   One, titrating your reading to the situation.
[00:55:35.660 --> 00:55:37.940]   So you're up to your ears and working on a dissertation.
[00:55:37.940 --> 00:55:39.500]   So maybe you're reading less stuff
[00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:41.220]   that's unrelated to the dissertation.
[00:55:41.220 --> 00:55:42.340]   That's fine.
[00:55:42.340 --> 00:55:44.640]   Two, have a reading day.
[00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:46.260]   So if you like to do compulsive reading
[00:55:46.260 --> 00:55:47.300]   where you dive into something,
[00:55:47.300 --> 00:55:49.540]   you're like, yeah, I look forward to Saturdays,
[00:55:49.540 --> 00:55:51.900]   and I go somewhere cool, like a coffee shop to start,
[00:55:51.900 --> 00:55:53.380]   and then I go hiking and read,
[00:55:53.380 --> 00:55:54.900]   and I can devour a whole book,
[00:55:54.900 --> 00:55:58.380]   and it's part of a really enriching, meaningful ritual.
[00:55:58.380 --> 00:56:00.040]   I think that's great.
[00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:04.100]   And then three, be careful about your book selection.
[00:56:04.100 --> 00:56:05.980]   Right?
[00:56:05.980 --> 00:56:07.120]   Because reading is reading, reading is good.
[00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:08.640]   It's your mind having to engage
[00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:09.840]   with complex thought structures.
[00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:11.600]   So yeah, read the boringer books.
[00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:15.240]   If it's novels that really catch your attention,
[00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:17.940]   then like, okay, I'm going to read a long history
[00:56:17.940 --> 00:56:19.440]   of World War I or something like that,
[00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:21.600]   so that you can still maybe have some of this exercise.
[00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:24.220]   But to be very careful about what you choose,
[00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:26.580]   I think is fine.
[00:56:26.580 --> 00:56:29.680]   This is much more minor than what you're talking about,
[00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:34.640]   but I do not like, for example, apocalyptic fiction.
[00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:37.040]   My brain gets too into it and gets concerned.
[00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:38.920]   It presses anxiety buttons or this or that.
[00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:40.400]   I don't like that.
[00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:42.480]   So I just don't read those type of books.
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:44.800]   I'm not going to read World War Z.
[00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:47.660]   I don't want to read apocalyptic tales
[00:56:47.660 --> 00:56:52.360]   of the earth becoming uninhabitable and everyone died.
[00:56:52.360 --> 00:56:53.400]   Maybe it's just hitting a little bit
[00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:54.440]   too close to home these days.
[00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:56.000]   So I avoid those type of books.
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:58.280]   Julie was really pushing on me, like,
[00:56:58.280 --> 00:56:59.400]   oh, you should read Station Eleven.
[00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:01.600]   I was like, I can't read Station Eleven right now.
[00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:05.000]   I can't read a book about a viral pandemic
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:06.920]   that kills most of the people on earth.
[00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:08.360]   Like, I don't want to read that right now.
[00:57:08.360 --> 00:57:11.880]   Just like with the stuff going on in Europe right now,
[00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:14.440]   I'm not going to read, you know, On the Beach,
[00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:16.500]   Neville shoots On the Beach, for example.
[00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:18.520]   Though it's kind of a cool book.
[00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:19.880]   Have you heard of that book, Jesse?
[00:57:19.880 --> 00:57:20.720]   - No.
[00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:25.320]   - There's a nuclear war and it follows,
[00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:28.220]   there's a crew on a submarine.
[00:57:28.220 --> 00:57:29.640]   So like, they're alive, obviously,
[00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:31.040]   because they were underwater in a submarine
[00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:33.040]   and they're like going around trying to find,
[00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:34.640]   they end up in Australia,
[00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:36.000]   'cause like the whole world's been destroyed
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:37.760]   and they kind of end up in Australia
[00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:41.080]   because the nuclear winter cloud hasn't come there,
[00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:43.920]   but they know the nuclear winter cloud is on its way.
[00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:47.400]   And it's like, they're trying to just find civilization.
[00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:49.520]   I found the beginning of Seveneves too apocalyptic.
[00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:51.280]   I was like, oh, I had to get through that pretty quickly.
[00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:54.760]   I don't like that whole, the hard rain is coming.
[00:57:54.760 --> 00:57:57.680]   And I'll tell you the flaw in that,
[00:57:57.680 --> 00:58:01.460]   plot flaw is it was symbolic,
[00:58:01.460 --> 00:58:05.060]   but they had this orchestra playing
[00:58:05.060 --> 00:58:06.940]   in like Canterbury Cathedral
[00:58:06.940 --> 00:58:08.860]   as the hard rain was about to come.
[00:58:08.860 --> 00:58:10.500]   Like, we're going to play this concert
[00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:12.140]   and we're just going to die as we play it.
[00:58:12.140 --> 00:58:15.900]   So like, we go out like celebrating humanity's greatest art
[00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:17.660]   as the hard rain comes.
[00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:18.500]   I don't buy it.
[00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:20.260]   They're all going to be with their families, right?
[00:58:20.260 --> 00:58:21.740]   I don't think they're gonna be like, sorry, family.
[00:58:21.740 --> 00:58:24.580]   Like I'm going to spend my last time like rehearsing
[00:58:24.580 --> 00:58:26.440]   and playing in an orchestra with people.
[00:58:26.440 --> 00:58:27.340]   So I thought that was a flaw.
[00:58:27.340 --> 00:58:28.580]   But anyways, the point is Emily,
[00:58:28.580 --> 00:58:32.520]   I can't read apocalyptic fiction and it's small,
[00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:33.660]   but I don't read it.
[00:58:33.660 --> 00:58:35.940]   So read the stuff that's working for you right now.
[00:58:35.940 --> 00:58:37.900]   Titrate, absolutely.
[00:58:37.900 --> 00:58:39.620]   Have a reading day.
[00:58:39.620 --> 00:58:40.460]   All of that's good.
[00:58:40.460 --> 00:58:41.640]   You're working on dissertation.
[00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:42.940]   You don't have to worry about your brain
[00:58:42.940 --> 00:58:45.260]   not getting worked out right now, right?
[00:58:45.260 --> 00:58:47.520]   It's like when you're training for a marathon,
[00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:51.580]   it's okay to let your Peloton habit go wax for a while.
[00:58:51.580 --> 00:58:52.860]   You're getting enough of that.
[00:58:52.860 --> 00:58:55.660]   So do not think of my daily reading
[00:58:55.660 --> 00:58:59.260]   or this many books a month as gospel you have to follow.
[00:58:59.260 --> 00:59:01.680]   Build the thing that makes sense for you.
[00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:05.060]   All right, Jesse, well, we're hitting up on an hour.
[00:59:05.060 --> 00:59:07.980]   So I think this is a good place to call it.
[00:59:07.980 --> 00:59:11.940]   Thank you everyone who sent in their listener calls.
[00:59:11.940 --> 00:59:13.660]   As I always say, if you like what you heard,
