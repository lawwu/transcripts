[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   Good morning, Radicals. Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, especially Saturday morning Q&A with Joshua.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   Special on the road edition of Q&A this morning.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   Just sitting down here in the corner of Charlotte International Airport in Charlotte, North Carolina.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   Have a few minutes before connecting flight back to West Palm Beach.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   Been up in Canada for the last couple of days.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   And so if you hear a little bit of background noise like the beeping right there of the courtesy cart coming by,
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   it's because I'm recording this on the road in the airport at the moment.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   So quick intro here as we begin Saturday morning Q&A with Joshua.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   As I've been mentioning for a few days, from time to time here, I'm going to be doing these shows for you.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   We're just going to be fairly casual and me sitting down and sharing with you some of the feedback from the website
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   and also answering a little bit of your questions and providing a little bit of commentary on,
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   or clarification on some things on the show.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   The reasons I'm doing this, I'm not going to do this every week.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   I don't even know how long I'll do it, but I'm trying to accomplish a few things.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Number one, I get a ton of great feedback from many of you via email.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Very nice commentary, very nice compliments, many questions and requests for clarification.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   And that's really, really nice to have that nice email.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   However, my email is very, very large.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   I get at this point hundreds and hundreds of messages.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   And so in order to fix that system, I just kind of declare bankruptcy as most of us can do.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   But I don't want to just do that.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   In order to fix that system, one of the first things I want to do is reduce and eliminate much of the inflow of email.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   So rather than my spending money on hiring somebody to help me with it,
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   first thing you always want to do is eliminate a potential cost.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   So I'm seeking to eliminate some of the email.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   So my desire is that many of you who send me emails, I'd like to send you over to the blog
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   and have you comment on the show instead of corresponding via email.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   That way, my inflow of email will go down, and I'll be able to respond in a timely manner
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   to the communications that are actually personal in nature or that actually need some sort of response.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   So I encourage you, instead of sending me an email, if you have commentary or feedback about a specific show
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   or about a question of the show, I ask you to please go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   and comment on that specific show episode.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Quick note, some of you have refrained from doing that in the past,
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   primarily because the shows were not immediately on the website.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   In my current publishing schedule, the shows generally will show up first in the feed.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   So the feed is called the RSS feed. That's what your phone is accessing.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   And they'll show up immediately when you refresh the feed.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   The best way to get an immediate notification of my publishing a show,
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   if your phone or your app doesn't automatically update within 30 minutes or an hour or whatever
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   and put that as a notification for you, you can always just check my Twitter profile.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   I publish the shows when they publish live into the feed.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   I also publish them immediately into Twitter, so you can see that.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   My Twitter profile is twitter.com/JoshuaSheets, S-H-E-A-T-S.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   So that's a great way to keep in touch with that.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   And then my web developer, usually it's the same day, sometimes it's the next day,
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   but sometime later in the day, goes ahead and posts the new episode to radicalpersonalfinance.com.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   So in the past, sometimes that would be delayed several days.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   We fixed that problem and improved it, so it's usually the same day.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   But if you're Johnny on the spot and you listen to an episode
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   and then you want to go and make a comment and you don't see it there,
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   just come back later that day or the next day and it'll be there on the website.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   So the first goal that I have is to reduce the number of emails that I receive.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   And so that's why I'm doing some of these shows,
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   is to give you an incentive to go and comment on the show instead.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Number two is most of you are audio-only consumers.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   That's one of the funny things with a podcast is, yes, I have a website,
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   but unlike a blog, unlike a website where there's lots of written material,
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   the website exists primarily at this point to serve the podcast.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   And so my number one focus is always on the podcast.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   If I'm releasing to you audio files in the RSS feed that show up on your phone,
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   which is how the vast majority of your course listen to the show,
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   then how do I make sure that you get able to benefit from the insight
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   and commentary and questions of some of your fellow listeners?
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Many times there'll be very insightful comments, very helpful feedback,
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   very useful commentary and suggestions and tips from other listeners.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   And most of you are listening to me where just automatically you're on the road,
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   driving or in the gym working out, and you may not get the benefit of that.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   So I want to serve you with some of the ones that I find useful,
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   some of the feedback that I think is especially helpful,
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   some of the questions that I think you might be interested in.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   To be clear, I am not going to be sitting here and reading all the comments to you.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   But if I do find comments that have a particularly helpful piece of information,
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   if I find a comment that clarified something that I wasn't aware of
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   or made a good point that I've missed and forgotten a show,
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   I want to make sure that you get the benefit of that,
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   you the normal standard podcast listener, are able to gain from that insight.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   That's very important to me.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   So with that as a goal, I figure the best way for me to do that is to highlight the comments.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   That will help me to continue to crowdsource more information
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   to be able to take benefit or to benefit from more of the open source economy.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Remember, all of us are generally smarter than any of us,
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   and that's what I want to take advantage of.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   And then third and final, of course, is I do have a selfish motive in this,
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   is number one, it'll help to increase the more engagement that I get on the website.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   That helps me with all of my web page rankings, things like that,
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   which is helpful in the space of--excuse me, in the online space.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Also, the additional comments and engagement on my actual website at radicalpersonalfinance.com,
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   that helps all of the search rankings, et cetera.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   The search engines like to see shows getting commentary and feedback.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   All that search rankings kind of work out.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   So I do have some selfish motivations as well.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   So it's primarily to serve you. I think it'll be helpful.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   But I also do have my own selfish goals in that context.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   So today I'm just going to tackle just a few simple questions, feedback,
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   and commentary that came in from some of the recent shows of this year.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Now, the first couple of shows of the year about plans for 2017,
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   Motorhome Show has been fairly popular but not a lot of feedback on that.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   The biggest show so far of the year has been the one where I sat down, number 408,
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   where I did a show on budget categories for the new year that actually matter.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   There's evidently a deep hunger here among many of you for some of this information,
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   which I'm taking note of, and I'll try to serve that for you.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   So I want to give you just a couple of useful comments.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   First, Joe came in, and he mentioned--he said, "Thanks for the budgeting tips.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   I like the reimbursable expenses idea."
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   He says one thing that he does--I use a relationships category to allow for expenses
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   that aren't gifts but are primarily to invest in a relationship, such as travel,
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   babysitter costs, unwanted eating out, etc.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   Now, Joe, I think that's a great clarification.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   For example, if I sit down on my goals and I look at my goals--and this is just literally--
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   this week I've been thinking about it a lot, looking at my 2017 goals and just my priorities.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   One of my major goals and priorities is to make sure that my marriage is constantly increasing
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   in depth and quality, and that I'm continually seeking to romance my wife
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   and to build those feelings of romance.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   There's a phrase that I have always loved--I don't know if it was a book or something,
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   but Zig Ziggle used to use the phrase--I think he presented a course on it at some point--
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   called "Courtship after marriage."
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   Courtship after marriage.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   And I've always thought that was such a beautiful way to express a truth that was so important,
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   is the use of that word "courtship after marriage."
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   And I've noticed in marriages, my own included, it's so easy for people to spend all their time
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   focusing on building romance with their husband or wife before the marriage,
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   but then after the marriage they quickly will pull back and start to lose some of that desire.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   And this has affected me. I've done this too.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   And so it's only through recognizing that and focusing on it that we can make a change.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   And so the question for every husband or for every wife has to be on a continual basis,
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   "How do I make sure that my husband or wife knows that I love them?
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   How do I build these deep feelings of romance?"
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   It's very easy to neglect that, and give that a few years of neglect, love grows cold,
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   and all of a sudden people wind up and say, "Well, I don't love you anymore."
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   For me, I personally don't pay much attention to love as a feeling.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   I look at love as an action. It comes with feelings, but I look at love as an action.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   So when people say, "I fell in love with her," I never use that word.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   I don't believe in falling in love. I believe in loving.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   Loving is something that you can do. Falling in love is something that you're hopeless in,
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   and it can't do anything for you.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   And so people think that somehow they fall in love or fall out of love. It's nonsense.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   You choose to love, and then the feelings come.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   And so in a marriage, it's important that I continually choose to love my wife.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   And it's sometimes--that means cleaning the bathroom,
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   sometimes that means making sure that I'm taking care of the baby,
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   sometimes that means sending her out on a girl's night--
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   but it also means making sure that I'm kindling and constantly rekindling and stoking the feelings of romance.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   Well, that doesn't have to cost money, but sometimes it can cost money.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   Certainly, we can do that and have a nice evening at home,
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   and if money is very, very tight and we don't have the ability to do that,
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   then yes, we may sit at home and have a very nice romantic evening with zero cost.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   But sometimes spending money can be a great investment.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   One of the things I've been thinking about is the idea of learning something.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   One thing that can continually draw couples together is when they're learning new things together.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   Just this morning as I was sitting on the airplane, I was thinking about my own goals,
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   and I was thinking, "What can my wife and I be learning together?
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   What would be something that we would both thoroughly enjoy becoming involved in and learning?"
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   Because if we can invest some money there, that can help to enhance our marriage.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   Well, I'm willing to bring that on as an expense,
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   because my goal is not to spend the least amount of money possible.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   My goal is to maximize the fulfillment, maximize the use of the money.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   And as far as I'm concerned, investing in my relationship, the marriage, with my wife
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   is a very worthwhile investment and has possibly a far greater return
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   than any kind of mutual fund retirement investing could ever possibly have in terms of happiness.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   So it's good to break that under relationship categories, Joe emphasized here,
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   where you may be paying for travel, you may be paying babysitting costs, meals out,
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   classes of something new and something fun, and there should be a budget for that,
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   because that's one of those categories that can be very, very useful.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   So Joe, great comment and a great clarification of what you do on terms of relationships.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   A couple of you have asked for a breakout of the visualization of this topic.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   If I can get that done at some point, I'll try to do that, but I'm not committing to that.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   Otherwise you'd have to listen and take notes.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   I'm working on solutions.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   FYI, I know many of you would love to have transcripts of the shows, more detailed notes, etc.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   I'm working on solutions to that. I've tested it in the past.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   I've bought ten transcripts for shows in the past to see if it was helpful.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   But the reward in terms--I know that it would serve some of you better,
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   but the best that I can determine is that it would serve a few of you to some extent,
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   but the cost is tremendous.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   So I've chosen at this point in time to focus primarily even to the exclusion of things that,
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   yeah, it'd be nice to have on providing good quality, consistent audio instruction and help
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   and daily inspiration for you as compared to detailed notes, time-stamped show notes,
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   good transcripts, etc.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   If I can solve that problem at a cost that I'm willing to take in the future, I will do that.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   But for now, just recognize that I'm doing the best I can,
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   but I see my primary best use of my time and resources at the moment is by focusing intensively on the audio aspects of it.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   Next question here came in about setting up personal and business budgets,
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   especially with using YNAB.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   I described in that show my system of how I use one budget for personal, one budget for business.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   So Rio--as an answer to Rio's question on that--Rio, or anyone else who's listening who wants to do this personal and business,
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   if you just have an occasional business, a little side business, something like that,
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   it's perfectly acceptable to set up a small little budget within your personal budget and just use a category.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   So you could use a master category of business and then subcategories, just like YNAB or any budgeting software will allow you to do.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   So that's very, very simple.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   If you are a full-time entrepreneur or like me, where your business is your full-time thing,
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   and it's not a minor part of my financial life--it is my financial life--
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   I like to keep that entirely separate.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   And this is good for a couple of reasons.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   Number one, it's good to keep it entirely separate so that in the future,
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   when your business has grown to the point and you're outsourcing your bookkeeping and you're outsourcing your accounting--
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   because don't think that you should not do it forever--just at a certain stage where it's useful and helpful.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   You want to be able to have that in a separate system because as you grow as an entrepreneur,
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   you're not always going to be sitting down and entering transactions.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   You're going to be simply reviewing the reports from your bookkeeper,
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   and as your businesses grow, you're going to be reviewing reports from your bookkeeping team,
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   from your accounting team.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   At some point in time, you may just be sitting down and reviewing a summary report with your chief financial officer.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   That's the natural, normal growth of businesses.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   So it's good to keep it completely separate for that reason.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   It's also good to keep it separate, like I said, because of the mindset.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   It keeps me in a different mindset where I can adjust my categories.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   And it's helpful to me to have everything separate so that when I'm sitting down and reviewing budgets--
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   and let's say I'm talking about money with my wife--
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   that she doesn't have to worry with all of my business explanations, but our finances can be very simple.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   And we can just focus on the personal things, which are the things that are going to be integrated into the family.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   And we can talk about, are our personal expenditures aligned with our long-term goals?
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   Now, how to do it? In YNAB, it's very simple.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   You just create a new budget, and you can have as many budgets as you want concurrently.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   So you just have--and this is where often if you're setting up a new budget, you can just start a new budget.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   You can bring over the categories if you want to do that.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   But here, all you do is just use their budget function, click "Add a Budget," and then create a new one
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   that's going to be primarily focused on business.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   Finally, Guy asks on that show, "Did I understand you correctly about taxes?
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   Are you suggesting we enter our gross salary as YNAB income and categorize taxes down to our net salary
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   in order to track our actual tax expenses?"
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   So, Guy, this one is an interesting question because, although you may or may not be asking it, let me kind of clarify.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   So for me, I pay many taxes physically with a check.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   So I don't have an employer who withholds my income from my income taxes.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   I have to send a quarterly check to the IRS.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   So under that circumstance, it's very easy for me to include taxes as a budget item right here in my normal expenses.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   You will be doing the same thing.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   If you get to the end of the tax year and you owe a check for additional income taxes due to the IRS,
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   then you'll sit down and you'll write a check.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   So that's a very simple and easy--so you will have that listed as a category because that'll be an actual transaction that you enter into.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   However, many of you are aware that when I talk about income statements, I advocate tracking all income and all expenses, gross income included.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   Now, I believe this probably could be done in YNAB, and I don't think you're wrong if you choose to do that.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   However, I don't do that, and here's why.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   I reflect those expenses on my income statement.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   So I make an income statement, just like I talked about in the past shows on income statements.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   Go to RadicalPersonalFinance.com/archive, search "income statement," and you'll be able to find that.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   So I talk exclusively about that in terms of income statements when it comes to--that's where I factor in some of those annual expenses that you're not changing.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   For example, I would want on there the cost of employer-paid health insurance, but any contributory expenses that I have, group expenses,
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   income taxes that are withheld, FICA taxes, employment taxes, things like that.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   All of that would be factored in on my income statement.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   And the reason is that I do that on an annual basis where I'm just simply sitting down and creating that as a planning tool.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   So that's where I want all the income, your gross income, all of the income to be reflected there, and all of the expenses, including taxes.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   But for most of those things, you're not budgeting cash.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   Yes, once a year during open enrollment, you sit down and may sit down and look and try to say, "Well, maybe I'll adjust here.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   Maybe I'll adjust this insurance benefit, change this withholding, et cetera."
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   But that's not something that factors into your monthly budgeting.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   The whole point of a budgeting, using something like YNAB or your own spreadsheet, is to actually allocate where your money is going.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   You don't always have to do this.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   In the past budgeting shows, I've explained that you'll go through phases of budgeting.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   When you're in the beginning phase, very tight budgeting is very important.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   But then as your income grows and as the margin in your budget grows, at that point in time, it'll be much simpler for you to adjust.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   And you will have no need to budget as frequently, every single week sitting down and reconciling transactions.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   There you can just look at an overview.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   And that's, again, where your bookkeeping team or you will just simply pull up an annual report and see, "Okay, are we in line with things?"
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   But at this stage, when I'm talking about budgeting, I'm talking about budgeting the cash that you have.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   So the expenses should only be for the cash that you are actually spending.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   So I would leave off taxes, withholding taxes.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   I would leave off employment taxes, your Social Security and your Medicare taxes.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   I would only factor things in on this planning that you actually have to write a check for.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   So that is my answer to you.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   Next show was episode 409, "How to Get Yourself Put Six Feet Under, Dirt Cheap."
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   I was feeling very punny that day.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   If you read the title and descriptions, there are a number of puns.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   And so, unfortunately, this show wasn't very popular.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   I really thought it was fun, a great topic.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   But it wasn't particularly popular.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   But there were a couple of comments that I thought were helpful.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   Artem commented and said, "Joshua, you went way too quickly over an option of doing burial for free, which is to donate a body to science.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   I believe it is important to disclose that when a body is donated to science, many things may happen to it.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   For example, a body may be dumped in a field for a year in the open to study its decay.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   Or medical students may practice plastic surgeries on genitals, face, including sex change procedures.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   Source, Stiff, The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers by Mary Roach."
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   Artem, that is a great comment.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   And I actually had earmarked that book and added it to my reading list to read to be more aware of the actual feedback of it.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   And I frankly, I don't know anything about donating a body to science other than that is an option for free.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   And I had not even thought of those potential things that you said.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   Usually, when you think about donating a body to science, we think about organ donation.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   But, of course, organ donation would be different than actually donating the entire body.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   There are many people who may participate in organ donation whose bodies don't wind up, as you said, put out in a field to study the rate of decay for forensic science, things like that.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   So, that's an excellent point. I hadn't even thought of that.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   I appreciate your mentioning that.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   And then, obviously, I should have read or I need to follow up and read that book to educate myself on that.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   But at least here I can do this public service announcement for the audience.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   Ross comments and says, "Please do remember that funerals are for the living.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   It is a ritual that helps those you leave behind reflect, find peace, and gain closure.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   It's a good idea to get to know how your loved ones feel comfortable grieving and take that into consideration as well as you make plans."
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   Ross, that's a really great point.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   And I think I minimized that to a higher degree than I should have in that show.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   Funerals are indeed for the family that's living.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   And it's not just about your wishes.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   It's also about your family's need for closure.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   And I didn't think of addressing it in that way.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   So, I thought that was an excellent comment.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   One thing that does attract me very much to some of those green burial techniques and some of the things that I mentioned and highlighted in that show
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   is that I feel like actually caring for a loved one's body after death, preparing it for burial, etc., can be,
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   and based upon the testimonials of those who have done it, can be a very cathartic experience to bring closure.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   I think it's very helpful.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   Even just something as simple as not freaking out when somebody dies in the house and saying, "Immediately we've got to call them and get this body out of here."
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   It does a good, I think it does a good job of, well, I think it helps to have time to process.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   So, that is an excellent point.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   You may want to not have anything particularly helpful or important about your funeral,
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   but it may be very important for your family.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   So, let's skip through now.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   The next episode was 410, Dow 20,000.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   I haven't received any comments about that one.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   I hope it was useful to some of you.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   But I did on 411 where we talked about how to do your homework, how to check, monitor, and freeze your credit score for free.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   I did receive a couple of pieces of very helpful commentary from listeners.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   And the first one comes in from Hannah.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   And Hannah makes this point, talking about my suggestion to use the free website Credit Karma to help you track and improve your credit score.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   Hannah writes this, "Credit Karma uses the Vantage 3.0 credit score, not the FICO 8 credit score.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   What's the difference?
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   The Vantage score improves when you pay off collection items, but FICO 8 doesn't.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   Vantage also weights total outstanding credit more than the credit utilization ratio.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   The difference only matters when you're applying for a mortgage, since Fannie and Freddie use FICO 8.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   For other loans, banks use different scoring algorithms, often excluding stuff like medical collections items or weighing similar loans more highly than other loans.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   Finally, if you're worried about ID theft, I recommend looking into the Capital One Venture or Quicksilver cards.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   They offer ID resolution services as a perk, even if the ID theft isn't on the credit card itself."
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   So, Hannah, those are two very useful tips.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   One, I was not thinking about the difference in those scores, nor was I aware that Credit Karma was using the Vantage 3.0 as compared to the FICO 8.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   So that's a great tip to be aware of, and I now have informed you, the listening audience.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   In general, the things you're going to do for both are going to be the same.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   It doesn't sound like there's a big difference between those scores, and so improving one is probably going to be generally helpful,
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   and it's just a matter of paying off collection items.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   So if you're applying for a mortgage, and that's going to be through Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac,
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   you may recognize that the score is not going to improve just because you're cleaning off the collections item.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   That's the major point there.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   Also, the tip on ID theft, that's very helpful as well.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   So again, Capital One Venture or Quicksilver cards offer, as a component of the card, they offer ID resolution services.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   And again, in ID theft, much of the time, the biggest cost is the time required to do ID resolution.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   I have no idea what services they'll actually offer, how good they are, but I pass that along as a tip for you, the listener.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   Many of the credit cards offer these very useful perk benefits on the side.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   Again, tracking of the credit score or many of these additional options.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   That's why me personally, I'm not a hardliner, no credit cards, except for people who can't handle credit card debt,
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   because these benefits can be substantial.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   Warranty extensions are very, very useful.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   Purchase protection are very, very useful with credit cards.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   And so just read the perks and the benefits substantially,
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   and see if I'm not even getting into the question of mileage and mileage of points, et cetera.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   Guy asks this question, he says, "If I freeze the credit of my entire family, husband, wife, children,
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   is there still a need for ID theft protection? For example, Xander Insurance's ID theft product?"
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   Guy, I don't know, but I don't think so, at least not for most people.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   That's a question I've struggled with as I've looked at these different services.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   I just don't see the risk being significant enough if the credit is frozen,
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   and if you're continually monitoring the credit reports.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   Now, there might be something I don't know,
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   and I could be persuaded to think that these ID theft services can be useful to have.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   Frankly, for me, being in the place of a public figure, it's increasingly uncomfortable,
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   because I lose a very minor public figure, don't get me wrong.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   It's increasingly uncomfortable, because I lose ever-increasing amounts of privacy.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   For me, I think that exposes me, at least psychologically,
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   I don't know if it's an actual increasing risk or not,
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   but at least that exposes me psychologically to more risk.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   Having additional protection, or having the peace of mind of knowing,
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   for example, I know Xander specializes in having an ID theft resolution team,
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   maybe having that additional peace of mind can be very, very helpful for me.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   I'm open to that. I think it's very possible.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   However, I just don't know.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   I don't personally, at this point in time, own any of those ID theft products.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   I don't own LifeLock or Xander's product or any of those things.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   It seems to me that if you freeze your credit, and nobody can take out accounts in your name,
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   you have accounted for a substantial amount of the ID theft.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   Maybe if someone's using your social security number to file tax returns, etc.,
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   maybe that would be an additional problem. I just simply don't know.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   So if any of the rest of you have feedback on that,
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   feel free to comment on that show and answer Kevin's or answer Guy's question.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   A couple of other kind comments, Kevin.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   Comment, "It's the tip of the day. Don't start this process and then get sidetracked by making your family lunch.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   It's awesome to have your credit card credit report pooled,
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   only to have this website knock you off after 10 minutes of inactivity,
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   at which point your one free shot a year is used up,
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   leaving you to call these yahoos and sit on hold. My current position in life."
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   Cheers, Kevin. I think that's happened to me in years past with that website, too.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   So that's a useful tip.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   A couple of other comments here. 412, the Friday Q&A. No commentary on that.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   But on episode 413, which was my speech at Camp Mustache Southeast,
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   we did receive a couple of interesting comments.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   So first of all, actually just one question here.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   And the question comes in from James. He commented on the show.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   He said, "I'd like to comment here not on the substance of the body of the show,
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   which was great as always, but on the sponsors mentioned
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   and on Joshua's new policy of more frequent ads in general.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   I don't have anything against more sponsors in principle,
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   and I take Joshua at his word that a big part of his resistance was pride or vanity
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   more than a principled objection.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   I do think that if the sponsors are chosen carefully and vetted,
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   there doesn't have to be an ethical problem.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   However, I have noticed one thing in Joshua's ad read for Personal Capital
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   that raises a small flag.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   I agree that the Personal Capital dashboard is excellent, and I use it myself.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   But what Joshua neglected to mention is something that he's usually careful to mention
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   when discussing businesses outside of an advertising context, how they make their money.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   For instance, just the other day Joshua pointed out that Credit Karma
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   gets their revenue by commissions from recommended products.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   Well, Personal Capital makes their money by converting a certain number of their dashboard users
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   to clients of their money management service, sort of like a robo-advisor,
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   but with more customer service and personal attention.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   I don't think there's anything wrong with that business model,
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   but you have to be able to withstand a moderate pressure sales call,
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   or two or three in my case, not to be drawn into signing up for the 89 basis point service.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   I think Joshua has an obligation to mention this,
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   especially since there might be some listeners out there
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   that just aren't very good at resisting friendly and persistent sales pressure.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   I also wonder about the status of sponsors we don't hear about much anymore, like the book doctor.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   I assume we don't hear about him because he's not buying time,
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   and also because Joshua isn't working actively on a book anymore,
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   but a long-time listener is bound to wonder, and I do wonder,
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   what would Joshua do if he had a falling out with a former sponsor,
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   or discovered unethical behavior on their part?
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   Would he feel obliged to tell the audience, or obliged not to tell
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   because of the past business relationship with that sponsor?
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   These are the pitfalls, and I wonder what he has to say about them.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   So James, excellent questions, and a very thoughtful and cogent comment.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   I appreciate your making the time to answer.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   A couple of things. I've never done media before, before Radical Personal Finance,
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   and so in terms of actual experience, or knowing all of the industry inside tips
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   and information on what you're supposed to do and what you're not supposed to do,
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   I'm basically making it up as I go along.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   And my theory is that if I approach it just simply and treat people the way
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   that I want to be treated, and just simply approach things in an honest way,
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   where I just simply am honest with everyone involved,
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   speak about things the way that they are, and admit my mistakes when I make them,
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   I figure it'll all work out in the long run.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   And I think that's generally what I want from people.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   I don't expect people to be perfect. I don't know how to do that.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   But I do appreciate it when people are honest.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   And so that's the approach that I have used.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   Now, interestingly, there are many aspects of actually the business side
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   of negotiating things like sponsorships that it's not a matter of honest or not honest,
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   but it's a matter of how much information should I disclose,
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   how valuable and helpful is it, and why am I doing it.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   And that's something I don't know the answers all the time to.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   So just to kind of explain the things.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   First of all, with regard to personal capital, you do make an excellent point
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   that I should explain the personal capital business model.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   So for those who aren't aware, there are a number of free tracking services out there.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   Like I explained the other day, Credit Karma makes their money on selling a really great service
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   to understand your credit score.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   And then they make their revenue model is built upon earning commissions
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   upon the sale of financial products if those financial products are well suited to you.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   And so that would be why on Credit Karma they would recommend to you certain credit cards
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   based upon your credit score, your credit utilization.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   There will be ads you can click for mortgage application or car loans, etc.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   Because they have access to your credit information.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   Now, similarly, another website that does something similar would be the website Mint.com.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   Mint has a free budgeting service. It's very, very useful. Many people use it.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   The Mint business model is the same.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   They provide you with a free tool and in exchange for that, they offer you,
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   because they now have access to all of your transaction data,
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   they offer you additional products.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   They offer you credit cards. They offer you car loans.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   They offer you banking products.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   And if you choose to buy based upon clicking on one of those loans and signing up,
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   then they'll receive a commission. So that's the way it works.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   And in many ways, this is the fundamental basis of business.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   I'm offering you a free show, giving you a free show, and hoping that in time you'll buy my products.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   Whether that product is to use a sponsor that is sponsoring my show
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   or whether that product is something that I've created to sell to you, I'm doing the same thing.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   And much business works like this.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   This is, I guess, called the freemium model of advertising.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   So there are many businesses that work like this.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   Personal Capital does something similar.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   Personal Capital works exactly like James described.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   They offer a free dashboard and then they make their money off of a certain number of their clients
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   who are using their free dashboard who sign up for their personal advisory service.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   So, what is my relationship with them?
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   Well, Personal Capital doesn't... let me explain.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   There's two advertising models that are commonly used in advertising on media.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   And they're not always exclusive. They can be one or the other.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   The first is called, in the industry it's referred to as CPM.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   CPM stands for cost per mille or cost per thousand.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   And so the idea here is that based upon the size of your audience,
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   the size of your readership, the size of the... if you're a magazine, the size of your circulation,
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   if you're a blog, the number of page views, if you're a podcast, the number of listens that you get,
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   you get a certain rate, an advertising rate per thousand impressions, readers, listens, etc.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   That's called cost per thousand model.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   And under that model, the advertiser just simply shares the comment and the brand gets the benefit of it.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   The other basic model is called CPA model, cost per acquisition model.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   And this is done under more of like what you would be familiar with in the direct mail context,
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   where you're paid based upon the acquisition of an actual customer.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   And so under these types of relationships, there's a commission that's paid based upon somebody making a certain action.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   Whether that's clicking on a page, signing up for a product, completing a survey, doing something.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   It's the actual action that results in the payment of the fee.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   So these are the two basic models. They can be combined together.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   For example, you'll often hear... and that's why it's so important when you hear a host say their code.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   Let's say for me, when I say use the code Radical or use this tracking link,
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   it's often because... or not always on my show, they're one or the other at the moment.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   But it's often because there's a mixture of these.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   On the radio you hear, go to this company and type in a host's name.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   Type in Joshua at the top of the page.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   Well, that's partly so that the ad campaign can be tracked,
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   but it's also so that possibly there may be some performance pay that's included in the advertising contract with the host.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   That's the way that the business works.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   And it's helpful, and I think that's actually... the hybrid model is a great model
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   because it recognizes that the company is getting exposure just simply by people listening to it,
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   whether or not that someone actually follows through and uses the tracking link of the show host.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   So with regard to that approach, I have done a combination of these different things,
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   as I've tried to work this out.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   Now in the early time, I wasn't sure if I could do CPM.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   I wasn't sure if I would do CPA or what I would do.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   But each of the sponsors and the advertisers has been a different model.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   Going forward, I'm changing that is my intention.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   But each of them has been a different model.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   So for me, the personal capital, personal capital doesn't pay me a fee just simply for mentioning their name.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   That is a program that they have that's available to a lot of large personal finance bloggers,
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   a lot of large personal finance podcasters, etc.,
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   where if we mention personal capital and have a free referral, then we use that referral link.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   And if somebody with a certain amount of assets links their accounts under that link,
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   then we receive a commission.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   Now, is this ethical? I don't have a problem with it.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   It's a free service.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   And the challenge is just simply that I only get paid when someone with a certain size of asset links their account.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   I've received a couple of commissions, one or two, but it hasn't been a major focus for me.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   So that was why I haven't in the past done a lot of personal capital ads.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   I was just simply using that as -- well, in the past, because it didn't really excite me all that much.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   I figured it's a great service, but I didn't want to do that.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   So I didn't sit down and explain in the 60 seconds of ad.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   I didn't try to explain the business model and say, "I get paid when rich people link their assets."
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   I figured that I wasn't -- it was a free service.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   I didn't see any ethical conflict in it, etc.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   Now, if you need to be able to resist sales pressure, etc., that is a valid point.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   I didn't see it as being a particularly important thing when I started to do it.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   At the moment, all of the advertisers that I'm currently using and talking about on the show are all cost-per-action model.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   So I'm not receiving any standard, any significant direct payment for mentioning the name.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   However, I'm changing that.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   And so the reason that I'm doing the advertisers on this model now is, yes, partly, number one, so that I can have some additional income from advertising.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   But it also helps my show to sound different.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   Meaning that if I'm negotiating with a company for a CPM model, which is my intention, is to move all of my advertisers to CPM model.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   If I'm doing that, I want them to listen to my show and I want them to hear me doing ads for various companies.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   Now, they don't have to know what that model is.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   That's why, for example, if I do an ad for Audible, I could do that.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   Audible would be another one.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   I do that on one of my other podcasts.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   I just do an ad for Audible.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   I only get paid when somebody signs up for it.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   And anybody with a blog or anything can go and set that advertising relationship up.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   It's not individually chosen.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   I didn't negotiate with the CEO of Audible for this advertising deal.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   That's just a standard affiliate link model where anybody can go and sign up for it.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   But I'm doing that because I want the show to sound differently.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   I want there to be that ad space there in the show so that when new sponsors go and hear that, they're hearing that, yes, Josh was a serious, legitimate broadcaster.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   I can hear how he does ads, et cetera.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   So that's my primary purpose.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   So that's why I started doing the personal capital ads more.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   It was, yes, I hope a few of you, especially those of you with assets above the minimum--I don't know what the minimum is.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   I can't remember.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   It's 100 grand, something like that.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   I hope that a few of you who actually have assets go and sign up.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   That way I'll get whatever they pay me, a small commission for it.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   But the biggest reason that I'm doing these ads is because I need to change the way the show sounds.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   And I need to make sure that I improve my ability to do the ads well because there's a skill in doing the ads.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   So I'm trying to make them very relevant, very helpful.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   My goal is that the ads serve you just like the standard show serves you as well.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   So that's one of the major focuses and things that I'm working on.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   All of my--so to answer your second question of what happened to the book doctor and what would I do if I fell out of sorts with somebody, all of my past advertising--so they varied.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   Some of the advertisers are based upon a commission model.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   SoFi, that's based upon a commission model.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   If you go and refinance with SoFi, I get a commission--I can't remember what the number is.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   I get a commission that is based upon what type of loan that you closed and then you get money back.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   And so other companies, for example, Paladin.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   My deal with Paladin is that I get a commission whenever somebody goes and signs up through that link to request a financial advisor.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   It's a sliding scale that varies based upon the amount of assets that the person declares on the initial intake form.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   I only get paid when a valid lead goes through and after they check up that, yes, this is a valid lead and it gets passed on to a financial advisor, then I receive that commission.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   So these business models, they're designed to try to help to protect everyone involved.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   And so the idea--to explain that and also personal capital, the company needs to make money.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   So if Paladin, for example, is only getting people who don't have money, then they're probably not going to get a lot of great clients for their financial advisors.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   So therefore, everything falls apart.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   So the commission scale varies based upon the size of the client.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   And in that case, they have to verify the actual leads, make sure that, yes, this is a valid lead.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   So if somebody goes through and puts in fake client, fake@email.com, 555-5555, then that gets tossed out and I don't get paid for that.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   But it also has to be just paid based upon the commission of a lead because I think it would be unethical--or I don't think--I would not be comfortable if it were based upon somebody saying, yes, you come up and sign up as a specific financial advisor in that context.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   So some of the other advertisers work similarly.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   I'm going to everything into the CPM model.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   And that's where I've had advertisers like that in the past.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   My friend Patrick Snow, that relationship was a barter arrangement that I had set up with him where in exchange for some of his services, I bartered him advertising in exchange for some of his services.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   And this is something that I encourage those of you who are business owners to do.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   Look through your assets that you have and always see if there's something that you can provide that would be cheaper for you than actually spending actual money.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   So I paid him direct fees out of my checking account and then I bartered a discount in exchange for a certain number of ads.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   So that was just a certain number of ad reads.
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   Now, an example of another company would be something like Trade King.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   So in the past, I was doing ads with Trade King.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   The ads with Trade King were not based upon -- that was a CPM model where I would just get paid based upon a certain rate based upon the number of thousands of listeners, etc.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   And so I completed my contract with them.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   There was no problem.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   I could have gone and sought to renew the contract with them.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   And there was -- I could have done that.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   At that time, I was pulling back from advertising because I really wanted the Patreon model to work.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   I really didn't -- I just didn't enjoy doing the advertising.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   And so I said that I would do it a little bit differently.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   But -- so that I didn't renew the contract.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   But in that situation, I just kept an eye on the services just like same thing with Paladin.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   I keep an eye.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   And I ask you guys to email me.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   I've had various emails.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   Most of it's been positive.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   But I've had a couple of people who had experience with Paladin write me an email and say, "Well, you know, my guys weren't great."
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   Now, the challenge is for me, what do I do with that?
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   So the decision I've made is that I just pay attention.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   And if I feel like something is grossly problematic, then I'll deal with that.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   And the answer is yes.
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   I would say, "Hey, this is -- you need to be aware of it."
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   I would cancel the contract.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   If it were that serious, I would cancel the contract and probably refund the money to the advertiser.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   I think that would be the proper thing to do.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   Just thinking about it here.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   If I had a situation where all of a sudden I had made a mistake, I don't think it would necessarily be fair for me to keep their money.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   And then all of a sudden two weeks later do it.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   If it were two years later, that would be a totally different thing.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   But if it were just two weeks after the ad campaign starts, I find something out, I'd cancel the ad campaign, send them their money back, and tell you.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   Because that's why my allegiance and my loyalty has to be first to you, the listeners.
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   That's why trust is the first and foremost most important thing for me to maintain.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   So this advertising world is kind of a mixed up interesting world.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   But that's the reason behind it.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   I never was seeking to mislead on personal capital.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   I just thought it was a useful way.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   It helped me to run ads so I can bring ads back in to make sure that my show sounds different.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   And then my goal is in the future to remove and eliminate all of these CPA advertisers from the actual verbal part of the show and just to do CPM.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   Incidentally, if you're a podcast creator or you're struggling with that decision, something like that, I had wavered back and forth between it.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   There was a time where I had thought about not doing any CPM and just doing CPA.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   And the reason I wanted to do that was because I didn't want to be locked into a specific show publishing schedule.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   If I'm going to work on a CPM basis where I'm selling ads for a certain number per thousand, in that context, then I've got to produce the shows on schedule.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   I didn't have the commitment nor did I want to have the commitment of every single day I'm creating a show.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   I was just going with it as I could.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   And so the CPA allows me--forgive me for all the coughing here, airport recording.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   But this is hopefully those of you who are listening are just a friendly crowd.
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   Under the CPA model, I can create an ad and then when you act on it, no matter whether that's today or two years from now, I'll simply get paid based upon that action.
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   And so that is in many ways much more valuable because it just sits out there and then I haven't made an agreement with an advertiser where they're not expecting a certain number of mentions.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   Now because this year I've committed to going back to shows on a very consistent schedule, I'm moving back to the CPM model because that helps for the best cash flow.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   And frankly, I feel like most of the CPA people, they get a better deal than I should be giving them.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   They get way too discounted rates.
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   Very few people respond to the ads in that model.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   They're getting a lot of brand recognition for my promotion of them.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   They're getting some of the benefits of my credibility that goes with them.
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   And I feel like it's not a fair business model.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   I feel like I'm underpaid for that.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   And so that's one of the biggest reasons.
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   So that's a little insight into the world of advertising, a little peek behind the curtains to understand what this world of advertising is like.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   And hopefully that helps to continue my commentary of always being most loyal to you, the listeners, first.
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   When I've said that for years, I haven't--I meant it.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   I meant what I said.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   There are certainly things that are challenging to work through.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   Not everything is simple.
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   Not everything is cut and dry.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   But I meant it when I said my loyalty is first and foremost to you, which is why the patron program is so important.
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   That's why I insisted on that.
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   That's why I turned advertisers down for as long as I could justify it and say, "Well, I really want to do it differently.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   I want to do it the crowdsource model," just because I felt like it was so incredibly valuable.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   A little bit of insight for you there on the topic of advertising.
