[00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.600]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.040]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.960]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.320]   Today, my guest is Dr. David Sinclair,
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.960]   professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.700]   and co-director of the Paul F. Glenn Center
[00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.640]   for the Biology of Aging.
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.800]   Dr. Sinclair's work is focused on why we age
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.520]   and how to slow or reverse the effects of aging
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.740]   by focusing on the cellular and molecular pathways
[00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.080]   that exist in all cells of the body
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.200]   and that progress those cells over time
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.920]   from young cells to old cells.
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.300]   By elucidating the biology of cellular maturation and aging,
[00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.060]   Dr. Sinclair's group has figured out intervention points
[00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.760]   by which any of us, indeed all of us,
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.240]   can slow or reverse the effects of aging.
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.480]   What is unique about his work is that it focuses
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.760]   on behavioral interventions, nutritional interventions,
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.680]   as well as supplementation
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.920]   and prescription drug interventions
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.580]   that can help us all age more slowly
[00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.240]   and reverse the effects of aging in all tissues of the body.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.860]   Dr. Sinclair holds a unique and revolutionary view
[00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.340]   of the aging process,
[00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.560]   which is that aging is not the normal
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.580]   and natural consequence that we all will suffer,
[00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.780]   but rather that aging is a disease
[00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.800]   that can be slowed or halted.
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.420]   Dr. Sinclair continually publishes original research articles
[00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.680]   in the most prestigious
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.920]   and competitive scientific journals.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.740]   In addition to that, he's published a popular book
[00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.620]   that was a New York Times bestseller.
[00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.320]   The title of that book is "Lifespan,
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.720]   Why We Age and Why We Don't Have To."
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.440]   He is also very active in public-facing efforts
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.600]   to educate people on the biology of aging
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.740]   and slowing the aging process.
[00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.800]   Dr. Sinclair and I share a mutual interest and excitement
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.400]   in public education about science.
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.460]   And so I'm thrilled to share with you
[00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.800]   that we've partnered and Dr. David Sinclair
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.020]   is going to be launching the "Lifespan" podcast,
[00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.840]   which is all about the biology of aging
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.520]   and tools to intervene in the aging process.
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.040]   That podcast will launch Wednesday, January 5th.
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.580]   You can find it at the link in the show notes
[00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.080]   to this episode today.
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.680]   As well, you can subscribe to that podcast
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.680]   on YouTube, Apple, or Spotify,
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.280]   or anywhere that you get your podcasts.
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.600]   Again, the "Lifespan" podcast featuring Dr. David Sinclair
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.640]   begins Wednesday, January 5th, 2022.
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:23.580]   Be sure to check it out.
[00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.080]   You're going to learn a tremendous amount of information
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.720]   and you're going to learn both
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.920]   the mechanistic science behind aging,
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.960]   the mechanistic science behind reversing the aging process,
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.200]   and practical tools that you can apply
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.760]   in your everyday life.
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.640]   In today's episode, Dr. Sinclair and I talk about
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.480]   the biology of aging and tools to intervene in that process.
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.520]   And so you might view today's episode
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.500]   as a primer for the "Lifespan" podcast
[00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.040]   because we delve deep into the behavioral tools,
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.080]   nutritional aspects, supplementation aspects
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.480]   of the biology of aging.
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.900]   We also talk about David's important discoveries
[00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.960]   of the sirtuins, particular molecular components
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.200]   that influence what is called the epigenome.
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.920]   And if you don't know what the epigenome is,
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.880]   you will soon learn in today's episode.
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.320]   Coming away from today's episode,
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.240]   you will have in-depth knowledge about the biology of aging
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.020]   at the cellular, molecular,
[00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.320]   and what we call the circuit level,
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.800]   meaning how the different organs and tissues of the bodies
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.760]   age independently and how they influence
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.540]   the aging of each other.
[00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.500]   Today's episode gets into discussion
[00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.000]   about many aspects of aging and tools to combat aging
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.740]   that have not been discussed on any other podcasts
[00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.780]   or in the book "Lifespan."
[00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.620]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.400]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.420]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.900]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.460]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:43.480]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.240]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.120]   Our first sponsor is Roca.
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.380]   Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.540]   that are of the absolute highest quality.
[00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.000]   I've spent a lifetime working on the visual system.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.820]   I can tell you that the visual system has to contend
[00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.580]   with a number of different challenges,
[00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.260]   such as when you move from a bright area outside
[00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.140]   to an area where there are shadows,
[00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.340]   you have to adjust a number of things in your visual system
[00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.200]   so that you can still see things clearly.
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.860]   One problem with a lot of eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.360]   is they don't take that biological feature into account
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.860]   and you have to take off your glasses and put them back on
[00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.060]   depending on how bright or dim a given environment is.
[00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.060]   With Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses,
[00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.820]   you always see things with the utmost clarity.
[00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.380]   In addition, they're very lightweight
[00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.900]   and they won't slip off your face.
[00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.500]   In fact, they were designed to be worn
[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.820]   while biking or running and in various activities,
[00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.220]   but they also have a terrific aesthetic
[00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.900]   so you could wear them to dinner or work.
[00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.860]   I wear readers at night and when I drive
[00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.200]   and I wear the sunglasses for most of the day.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.640]   If you'd like to try Roca sunglasses or eyeglasses,
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.820]   you can go to roca.com, that's R-O-K-A.com

[00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.300]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.
[00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.060]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.780]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.300]   to help you better understand your body
[00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.380]   and help you reach your health goals.
[00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.240]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.380]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.460]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.140]   can only be assessed from a quality blood test.
[00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.840]   And now with the advent of modern DNA tests,
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.480]   you can also get a clear picture
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.320]   of what your biological age is
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.440]   and compare that to your chronological age.
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.800]   And obviously your biological age is the important one
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.040]   because it predicts how long you will live
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.960]   and it's the one that you can control.
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.360]   The great thing about Inside Tracker
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.280]   is that compared to a lot of other DNA tests
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.140]   and blood tests out there is that with Inside Tracker,
[00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:38.660]   you don't just get your numbers back
[00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.900]   to the levels of various hormones, metabolic factors,
[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.220]   blood lipids, et cetera,
[00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.800]   but it also offers clear directives to lifestyle factors,
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.160]   nutritional factors, and supplementation that you can use
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.080]   in order to get the numbers into the ranges
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.680]   that are best for you and for your health.
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.060]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,
[00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.880]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman

[00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.720]   Just use the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.400]   Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.380]   to get 25% off any of Inside Tracker's plans.
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.480]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Magic Spoon.
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.920]   Magic Spoon is a zero sugar, grain-free,
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.880]   keto-friendly cereal.
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.360]   I don't follow a strictly ketogenic diet.
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.600]   What works best for me is to eat according
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.900]   to my desire to be alert at certain times of day
[00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.560]   and to be sleepy at other times of day.
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.660]   So for me, that means fasting until about 11 a.m.
[00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.080]   or 12 noon most days.
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.560]   And then my lunch is typically a low carb, keto-ish lunch,
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.320]   maybe a small piece of grass-fed meat,
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.580]   some salad, something of that sort.
[00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:39.660]   And then in the afternoon,
[00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.880]   I might have a snack that's also keto-ish.
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.120]   And then at night is when I eat my carbohydrates,
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.260]   which for me helps me with the transition to sleep
[00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:48.960]   and allows me to get great deep sleep.
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.380]   That's what works for me.
[00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:51.980]   What that means is that in the afternoon,
[00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:53.780]   I'm craving a snack.
[00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:56.040]   And the snack for me is Magic Spoon.
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.420]   What I do lately is I put in some Bulgarian yogurt.
[00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:00.440]   Sometimes I just eat it straight.
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.080]   Each serving of Magic Spoon has zero grams of sugar,
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.760]   13 to 14 grams of protein,
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.600]   and only four grams of carbohydrates in each serving.
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.420]   So it really matches that low carb, keto-ish approach.
[00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:13.500]   There's only 140 calories per serving,
[00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.140]   and they have a variety of flavors,
[00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.560]   cocoa, fruity, peanut butter, frosted.
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.900]   I particularly like frosted 'cause it tastes like donuts.
[00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:22.560]   I try not to eat donuts, but I do love the frost.
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.920]   And as I mentioned before, I lately mix it with yogurt,
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:25.820]   put a little cinnamon on there.
[00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.880]   I'm getting hungry just talking about it now.
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.240]   If you want to try Magic Spoon,
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.760]   you can go to magicspoon.com/huberman

[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.520]   And now my conversation with Dr. David Sinclair.
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:46.360]   Thank you for coming.
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.440]   - Thanks for having me here.
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:48.600]   It's good to see you.
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:52.440]   - This is mate, by the way, that we're toasting at 11 AM.
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:56.760]   Unlike other podcasts, well, I don't drink alcohol,
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.980]   so I'm boring that way.
[00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:02.080]   But truly, thanks for being here.
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.840]   I have a ton of questions for you.
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:06.600]   We go way back in some sense,
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:10.640]   but that doesn't mean that I don't have many, many questions
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:15.640]   about aging longevity, lifespan, actionable protocols
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.600]   to increase how long we live, et cetera.
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:21.960]   And I just want to start off with a very simple question
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:24.080]   that I'm not even sure there's an answer to,
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:27.880]   but what is the difference between longevity,
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.460]   anti-aging and aging as a disease?
[00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:33.500]   Because I associate you with a statement,
[00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.580]   aging is a disease.
[00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:39.540]   - Right, well, so longevity is the more academic way
[00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:41.340]   we describe what we research.
[00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:43.620]   Anti-aging is kind of the same thing,
[00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:45.660]   but it's got a bad rap because it's been used
[00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:46.500]   by a whole bunch of people
[00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:48.300]   that don't know what they're talking about.
[00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:50.680]   So I really don't like that term anti-aging,
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.540]   but aging as a disease and longevity
[00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:56.620]   are perfectly valid ways to talk about this subject.
[00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:58.880]   So let's talk about aging as a disease.
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.800]   When I started my research,
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.980]   disease here at Harvard Medical School,
[00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:06.100]   it was considered if there's something
[00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:10.120]   that's wrong with you and it's a rare thing,
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:12.760]   has to be less than 50% of the population,
[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.200]   that's definitely a disease.
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.020]   And then people work their whole lives
[00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.340]   to try and cure that condition.
[00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:20.200]   And so I looked up what's the definition of aging
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.600]   and it says, well, it's a deterioration in health
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.360]   and sickness and you can die from it, typically you do.
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:28.720]   Something that sounds pretty much like a disease,
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:32.320]   but the caveat is that if more than half the population
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.860]   gets this condition, aging,
[00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.420]   it's put in a different bucket,
[00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:37.980]   which is first of all, that's outrageous
[00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:40.780]   'cause it's just a totally arbitrary cutoff.
[00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:41.620]   But think about this,
[00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:45.400]   that we're ignoring the major cause of all these diseases.
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:49.180]   Aging is 80 to 90% the cause of heart disease, Alzheimer's.
[00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:52.060]   If we didn't get old and our bodies stayed youthful,
[00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:53.380]   we would not get those diseases.
[00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:54.980]   And actually what we're showing in my labels,
[00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:59.140]   if you turn the clock back in tissues, those diseases go away.
[00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:00.620]   So aging is the problem.
[00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:04.120]   And instead through most of the last 200 years,
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.120]   we've been sticking band-aids on diseases
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.560]   that have already occurred because of aging,
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.300]   and then it's too late.
[00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:11.180]   So there are a couple of things.
[00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:12.520]   One is we want to slow aging down
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.260]   so we don't get those diseases.
[00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.860]   And when they do occur, don't just stick a band-aid on,
[00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:18.020]   reverse the age of the body
[00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:20.320]   and then the diseases will go away.
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.380]   - That clarifies a lot for me, thank you.
[00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:28.220]   Can we point to one specific general phenomenon in the body
[00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:30.020]   that underlies aging?
[00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:31.860]   - Yeah, well, that's contentious
[00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:34.740]   because scientists like to come up with new hypotheses.
[00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:37.220]   It's how they build their careers.
[00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:39.820]   But fortunately, during the 2000s,
[00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:43.460]   we settled on eight or nine major causes of aging.
[00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:44.460]   We called them hallmarks
[00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:47.200]   'cause causes was a little bit too strong.
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.420]   But these eight or nine causes,
[00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:50.420]   at least for the first time,
[00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:53.460]   allowed us to come around and talk together.
[00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:55.700]   And we put them on a pizza
[00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:59.060]   so everyone got an equal weighting, equal slices.
[00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:00.500]   And before that, by the way,
[00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.620]   we were trying to kill each other in the field.
[00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:03.740]   It was horrible.
[00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:05.340]   - Interesting that you guys work on aging
[00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:06.180]   and you're trying to kill each other.
[00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:07.020]   - Yeah, isn't it?
[00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:08.880]   Well, kill each other's careers.
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.620]   I mean, I like to think I was fairly generous,
[00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:11.940]   but I was one of the kids
[00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:14.040]   and the old guard really didn't like the new guard.
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.540]   We just came along in the 1990s and '90s
[00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:19.240]   and said free radicals don't do much.
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.520]   There were actually genes called longevity genes,
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:22.800]   and that caused a whole ruckus.
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:27.680]   And there was this competition for what never happened,
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:29.680]   which was a Nobel Prize for this.
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:31.480]   And it just led to a lot of competition.
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:32.600]   I would go to meetings
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.960]   and people would shout at each other and just backstab.
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.400]   It was horrible.
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:38.600]   But then fortunately in the 2000s,
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:41.820]   we rallied around this new map of aging
[00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:44.480]   with these causes or hallmarks.
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.820]   But I think that there's one slice of the pizza
[00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:48.860]   that is way larger than the others.
[00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:49.860]   And we can get to that,
[00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:52.120]   but that's the information in the cell
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:54.520]   that we call the epigenome.
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.240]   - Well, tell us a little bit more about the epigenome.
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:59.520]   Frame it for us, if you will,
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.600]   and then we'll get into ways
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:05.480]   that one can adjust the epigenome in positive ways.
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.680]   - Yeah, so in science, what I like to do,
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:10.120]   I'm a reductionist, is to boil it down.
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:14.100]   And I actually ended up boiling aging down to an equation,
[00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:17.760]   which is the loss of information due to entropy.
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:18.860]   It's a hard thing to overcome
[00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:21.380]   the second law of thermodynamics, that's fair.
[00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:24.320]   But this equation really represents the fact
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:27.440]   that I think aging is a loss of information
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:31.620]   in the same way that when you Xerox something,
[00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:33.500]   a thousand times you'll lose that information
[00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:35.360]   or you try to copy a cassette tape,
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:37.300]   or even if you send information across the internet,
[00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:39.340]   some of it will get lost.
[00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:41.040]   That's what I think is aging.
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.440]   And there are two types of information in the body.
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.420]   There is the genetic information, which is digital,
[00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:49.200]   ATCG, the chemical letters of DNA,
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.680]   but there's this other part of the information in the body
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.800]   that's just as important, it's essential in fact,
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:57.780]   and that's the systems that control
[00:12:57.780 --> 00:12:59.680]   which genes are switched on and off,
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:01.480]   in what cell, at what time,
[00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.820]   in response to what we eat, et cetera.
[00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:07.320]   And it turns out that 80% of our future longevity and health
[00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:08.840]   is controlled by this second part,
[00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:11.820]   the epigenetic information, the control systems.
[00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:15.700]   I liken the DNA to the music that's on a DVD
[00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:17.160]   or a compact disc, for the younger people,
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.200]   we used to use these things.
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:19.700]   - I recall. - Yeah.
[00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:21.480]   And then the epigenome is the reader that says,
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:25.660]   "Okay, in this cell, we need to play that set of songs.
[00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:26.500]   And in this other cell,
[00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:28.280]   we have to play a different set of songs."
[00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:31.660]   But over time, aging is the equivalent of scratching the CD
[00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:34.480]   and the DVD so that you're not playing the right songs
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.600]   and cells, when they don't hear the right songs,
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.160]   they get messed up and they don't function well.
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:43.320]   And that is what I'm saying is the main driver of aging.
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:46.260]   And these other hallmarks are largely manifestations
[00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:47.540]   of that process.
[00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:52.140]   - Can we go a little deeper into what these scratches are?
[00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:57.020]   Is it the way that the DNA are packed into a cell?
[00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:00.860]   Is it the way that they're spaced?
[00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:04.700]   What are the scratches that you're referring to?
[00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:06.200]   - So DNA is six foot long.
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:07.820]   So if you join your chromosomes together,
[00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:09.880]   you get about six foot per cell.
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:11.840]   So there's enough to go to the moon and back eight times
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:16.140]   in your body and it has to be wrapped up to exist inside us.
[00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:18.260]   But it's not just wrapped up willy-nilly.
[00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.340]   It's not just a bundle of string.
[00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:23.200]   It's wrapped up very carefully in ways that dictates
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:25.360]   which genes are switched on and off.
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:27.720]   And when we're developing in the embryo,
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:30.720]   the cell marks the DNA with chemicals that says,
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.780]   "Okay, this gene is for a nerve cell.
[00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:35.380]   You, you cell, will stay a nerve cell
[00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:37.620]   for the next hundred years, if you're lucky.
[00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:40.760]   Don't turn into a skin cell, that would be bad."
[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:43.480]   And those chemicals, there are many different types
[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:45.520]   of chemicals, but one's called methylation.
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:48.880]   Those little methyls will mark which songs get played
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.360]   for the rest of your life.
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:52.760]   And there are other marks that change daily.
[00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:55.280]   But in total, what we're saying is that the body
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:59.760]   controls the genome through the ability to mark the DNA
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:04.480]   and then compact some parts of it, silence those genes,
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:08.400]   don't read those genes, and open others, keep others open,
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:09.800]   that should stay open.
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:13.620]   And that pattern of genes that are silent and open,
[00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:17.000]   silent, open, is what dictates the cell's type,
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.320]   the cell's function.
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:21.160]   And then the scratches are the disruption of that.
[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.160]   So genes that were once silent,
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:28.520]   and you could say it's a gene that is involved in skin,
[00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:29.960]   it's starting to come on in the brain,
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:32.060]   shouldn't be there, but we see this happen,
[00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:34.420]   and vice versa, the gene might get shut off over time
[00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:38.440]   during aging, cells over time lose these structures,
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:41.700]   lose their identity, they forget what they're supposed to do,
[00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:43.280]   and we get diseases.
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:46.100]   We call that aging, and we can measure that.
[00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:48.560]   In fact, we can measure it in such a way that we can predict
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:49.980]   when somebody is going to die,
[00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:53.400]   based on the changes in those chemicals.
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:55.720]   - Are these changes the same sorts of changes
[00:15:55.720 --> 00:16:00.600]   that underlie the outward body surface manifestations
[00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:02.320]   of aging that most of us are familiar with?
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:04.400]   Graying of the hair, wrinkling of the skin,
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:07.020]   drooping of the face,
[00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:11.940]   walking around New York lately, it's amazing to me.
[00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:14.100]   There are certain people that seem to walk
[00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:15.500]   looking down at the sidewalk
[00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:19.740]   because their spine is essentially in a C shape, right?
[00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:21.260]   A hallmark, if you will,
[00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.760]   of aging that most of us are familiar with.
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:26.860]   Are these same sorts of DNA scratches associated with that?
[00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:29.080]   Or are we talking about people that potentially
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:32.160]   are going to look older, but simply live longer?
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.940]   - Well, it's actually, you are as old as you look,
[00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:36.720]   if you want to generalize.
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:39.260]   So let's start with centenarian families.
[00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:42.020]   These are families that tend to live over 100.
[00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:45.020]   When they're 70, they still look 50 or less.
[00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:47.540]   So it is a good indicator.
[00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:48.980]   It's not perfect because you can,
[00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:50.740]   like me, grow up in Australia
[00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:54.020]   and accelerate the aging of your skin,
[00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:55.540]   but in general, how you look.
[00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:57.460]   No one's ever dyed from gray hair,
[00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:59.360]   but overall you can get a sense
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:02.540]   just from the ability of skin to hold itself up,
[00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:04.640]   how thin it is, the number of wrinkles.
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:07.440]   That is actually, a great paper just came out
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:10.060]   that said that an AI system looking at the face
[00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:12.220]   could very accurately predict someone's age.
[00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:13.700]   - Very interesting.
[00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:16.900]   So I started off in developmental neurobiology.
[00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:19.500]   So one of the things that I learned early on
[00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:22.620]   that I still believe wholeheartedly
[00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:27.620]   is that development doesn't stop at age 12 or 15
[00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:30.700]   or even 25, that your entire life
[00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:33.320]   is one long developmental arc.
[00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:37.220]   So in thinking about different portions
[00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:38.760]   of that developmental arc,
[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:43.260]   the early portion of infancy and especially puberty
[00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:47.060]   seem like especially rapid stages of aging.
[00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:49.740]   And I know we normally look at babies and children
[00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:50.880]   and kids in puberty and we think,
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:53.860]   oh, they're so vital, they're so young.
[00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:58.140]   And yet the way you describe these changes in the epigenome
[00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:01.080]   and the way you have framed aging as a disease
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:06.080]   leads me to ask, are periods of immense vitality
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:11.340]   the same periods when we're aging faster?
[00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:15.060]   - Yes, yes, and this is something I've never talked about,
[00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:18.100]   at least not publicly, so this is a really good question.
[00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:20.300]   So those chemicals we can measure,
[00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:21.700]   it's also known as the Horvath clock,
[00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:22.900]   it's the biological clock,
[00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:25.300]   it's separate from your chronological age.
[00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:27.140]   So actually what I didn't mention is that
[00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:29.580]   when the AI looked at the faces of those people,
[00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:33.480]   they could predict their biological age, their internal age.
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:36.820]   So your skin represents the age of your organs as well.
[00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:38.560]   And the people that look after themselves,
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:40.500]   we can talk about how to do that later,
[00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:42.880]   but there are some people that are 10, 20 years younger
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:46.100]   than other people biologically.
[00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:48.480]   And it turns out if you measure that clock from birth
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:50.880]   or even before birth, if you look at animals,
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.380]   there's a massive increase in age
[00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:55.960]   based on that clock early in life.
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:58.480]   So you're right, so that's a really important point
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:00.460]   that you have accelerated aging
[00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:02.100]   during the first few years of life,
[00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:05.520]   and then it goes linear towards the rest of your life.
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.000]   But there's another interesting thing you brought up,
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.740]   which is that we're finding that the genes
[00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:11.040]   that get messed up, that get scratched,
[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:13.060]   that are leading to aging
[00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:15.520]   are those early developmental genes.
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:19.000]   They come on late in life and just mess up the system,
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.840]   and they seem to be particularly susceptible
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:22.480]   to those scratches.
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:24.240]   So what's causing the scratches?
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:25.920]   Well, we know of a couple of things in my lab,
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:30.160]   we figured out one is broken chromosomes, DNA damage,
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:32.300]   particularly cuts to the DNA breaks.
[00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:35.360]   So if you have an X-ray or a cosmic ray,
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:36.720]   or even if you go out in the sun
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:38.840]   and you'll get your broken chromosomes,
[00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:41.480]   that accelerates the unwinding
[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:44.380]   of those beautiful DNA loops that I mentioned.
[00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:47.860]   We can actually do this to a mouse.
[00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:50.160]   We can accelerate that process,
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:52.520]   and we get an old mouse, 50% older,
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:54.680]   and it has this bent spine kyphosis.
[00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:56.840]   It has gray hair, its organs are old.
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:59.960]   So we now can control aging in the forwards direction.
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.540]   The other thing that accelerates aging
[00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:05.160]   is massive cell damage or stress.
[00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:07.280]   So we pinched nerves,
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:09.100]   and we saw that their aging process
[00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:10.600]   was accelerated as well.
[00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:11.440]   - Incredible.
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:15.080]   Yeah, this is more of an anecdotal phenomenon.
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:16.760]   It is an anecdotal phenomenon,
[00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:20.240]   but this experience of in junior high school,
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.720]   you know, going home for a summer
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:24.560]   and you come back, high school in the US,
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:26.080]   usually starts eighth or ninth grade
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:28.480]   or grade eight or grade nine for your Canadians.
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:32.580]   And then some of the kids,
[00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:34.600]   like they grew beards over the summer,
[00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:37.800]   or they completely matured quickly over the summer.
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:39.540]   Do you think there's any reason to believe
[00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:42.900]   that rates of entry into and through puberty
[00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:47.280]   can predict overall rates of aging?
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:52.280]   In other words, if a kid is a slow burner, right?
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:57.040]   They basically acquire the traits of puberty
[00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:59.020]   slowly over many years.
[00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:01.800]   Can we make some course prediction
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:03.740]   that they are going to live a long time
[00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:05.740]   versus a kid that goes home for the summer
[00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:08.380]   and comes back a completely different organism
[00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:10.800]   or appearing to be a completely different organism?
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:12.700]   Like they basically age very quickly in the summer.
[00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:14.900]   Does that mean they're aging very quickly overall?
[00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:16.760]   - Well, yeah, I don't want to scare anybody.
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:17.820]   - Sure.
[00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:20.840]   - That there are studies that show
[00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:23.440]   that the slower you take to develop,
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:26.400]   it also is predictive of having a longer, healthier life.
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:30.100]   And it may have something to do with growth hormone.
[00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:32.660]   We know that growth hormone is pro-aging.
[00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:37.280]   Anyone who's taking growth hormone, pay attention.
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:38.240]   We know that- - Just look at someone
[00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:39.840]   who's taking growth hormone.
[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:42.960]   They often will acquire these characteristics of vitality,
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:44.760]   like improved smoothness of skin,
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:47.080]   but their whole body shape changes often.
[00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:49.160]   - Yeah, I mean, you'll feel better
[00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:50.240]   for a short amount of time.
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:51.080]   You'll build up muscle.
[00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:52.120]   You feel great.
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:54.680]   But it's like burning your candle at both ends.
[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:56.640]   Ultimately, if you want to live longer,
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:57.720]   you want less of that.
[00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:00.600]   And the animals that have been generated
[00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:03.160]   and mutants that have low growth hormone,
[00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:04.600]   sometimes these are dwarfs.
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:07.660]   They live the longest by far.
[00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:10.040]   A guy in my lab, Michael Bongkowski,
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:11.840]   he had the longest-lived mouse.
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:14.360]   A mouse typically lives about two and a bit years.
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:16.420]   He had a mouse that lived five years,
[00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:18.980]   and he gave it caloric restrictions for fasting
[00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:20.820]   combined with one of these dwarf mutations,
[00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:22.180]   low growth hormone.
[00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:23.920]   I think he called it Yoda.
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:27.580]   But you look at who lives the longest.
[00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:29.500]   It's the really small people.
[00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:31.460]   This is a bit anecdotal,
[00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:34.380]   but it sounds like it might be true,
[00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:36.140]   is that the people who played the Munchkins
[00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:37.280]   in "The Wizard of Oz,"
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:39.920]   many of them went on to live into their 90s and beyond.
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:41.760]   - Really? - Yeah.
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:42.600]   - Amazing.
[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.980]   - Oh, there are some Laurent dwarfs as well.
[00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:49.160]   There are dwarf mutations in South America,
[00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:50.380]   and they seem to be protected
[00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:52.200]   against many of the diseases of aging.
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:54.080]   You barely ever see heart disease or cancer
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:55.360]   in these families.
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:58.580]   - So I, having owned a very large dog breed,
[00:22:58.580 --> 00:22:59.600]   a Bulldog Mastiff,
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:03.120]   who lived a long life for a bulldog, 11 years,
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:07.520]   but there are many dogs that will live 12, 16 years
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:08.880]   that are smaller dogs.
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:10.840]   Can we say that there's a direct relationship
[00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:13.160]   between body size and longevity,
[00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:16.220]   or duration of life?
[00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:17.560]   - Well, there is,
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:19.220]   but that doesn't mean that you're a slave
[00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:21.620]   to your early epigenome,
[00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:23.220]   nor to your genome.
[00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:26.220]   The good news is that the epigenome can change.
[00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:29.140]   Those loops and structures can be modified
[00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:30.840]   by how you live your life.
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:33.560]   And so if you're born tall, and I wasn't,
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:36.480]   and I wished at the time I did grow,
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.840]   but no matter what size you are,
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:40.980]   you can have a bigger impact on your life
[00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:42.900]   than anything your genes give you.
[00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:45.920]   80% is epigenetic, not genetic.
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:48.220]   - So let's talk about some of the things that people can do.
[00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:51.400]   And I've kind of batched these into categories
[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:56.400]   rather than just diving right into actionable protocols.
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:01.580]   So the first one relates to food, blood sugar, insulin.
[00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:04.580]   This is something I hear a lot about,
[00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:06.340]   that fasting is good for us,
[00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:10.100]   but rarely do I hear why it's good for us.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.880]   One of the reasons I'm excited to talk to you today
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:15.640]   is because I want to drill into the details of this,
[00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:17.580]   because I think understanding the mechanism
[00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:19.860]   will allow people to make better choices
[00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:22.240]   and not simply to just decide
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:24.060]   whether or not they're going to fast or not fast,
[00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:25.600]   or how long they're going to fast,
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:26.500]   I think should be dictated
[00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:28.480]   by some understanding of the mechanism.
[00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:32.920]   So why is it that having elevated blood sugar,
[00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:36.600]   glucose, and insulin ages us more quickly,
[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:40.800]   and/or why is it that having periods of time each day
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:45.180]   or perhaps longer can extend our lifespan?
[00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:48.340]   - Well, let's start with what I think was a big mistake,
[00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:52.140]   was the idea that people should never be hungry.
[00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:53.100]   We live in a world now
[00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:55.440]   where there's at least three meals a day,
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:57.780]   and then we've got companies selling bars
[00:24:57.780 --> 00:24:59.860]   and snacks in between.
[00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:01.220]   So the feeling of hunger,
[00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:03.880]   some people never experience hunger in their whole lives.
[00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:05.900]   It's really, really bad for them.
[00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:10.700]   It was based, I believe, on the 20th century view
[00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:13.020]   that you don't want to stress out the pancreas,
[00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:16.540]   and you try to keep insulin levels pretty steady
[00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:19.380]   and not have this fluctuation.
[00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:23.420]   What we actually found, my colleagues and I,
[00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:25.780]   across this field of longevity,
[00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:28.200]   is that when you look at, first of all, animals,
[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:31.420]   whether it's a dog or a mouse or a monkey,
[00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:35.740]   the ones that live the longest, by far, 30% longer,
[00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:40.100]   and stay healthy, are the ones that don't eat all the time.
[00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:41.340]   It actually was first discovered
[00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:44.460]   back in the early 20th century, but people ignored it.
[00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:46.940]   And then it was rediscovered in the 1930s.
[00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:49.160]   Clive McKay did caloric restriction.
[00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:51.940]   He put cellulose in the food of rats
[00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:54.580]   so they couldn't get as many calories even though they ate,
[00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:57.100]   and those rats lived 30% longer.
[00:25:57.100 --> 00:26:00.660]   But then it went away, and then it came back in the 2000s
[00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:02.660]   in a big way when a couple of things happened.
[00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:05.520]   One is that my lab and others showed
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:08.820]   that there are longevity genes in the body
[00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:11.960]   that come on and protect us from aging and disease.
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:13.940]   The group of genes that I work on are called sirtuins.
[00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:15.420]   There's seven of them.
[00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:18.620]   And we showed in 2005 in a science paper
[00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:22.340]   that if you have low levels of insulin
[00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:25.780]   and another molecule called insulin-like growth factor,
[00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:28.780]   those low levels turn on the longevity genes.
[00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:32.120]   One of them that's really important is called SIRT1.
[00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:35.340]   But by having high levels of insulin all day,
[00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:39.220]   being fed means your longevity genes are not switched on.
[00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:40.300]   So you're falling apart.
[00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:42.500]   Your epigenome, your information
[00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:44.140]   that keeps your cells functioning over time
[00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:45.180]   just degrades quickly.
[00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:48.940]   Your clock is ticking faster by always being fed.
[00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:53.260]   The other thing that I think might be happening
[00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:54.860]   by always having food around
[00:26:54.860 --> 00:27:00.300]   is that it's not allowing the cell to have periods of rest
[00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:03.300]   and reestablish the epigenome.
[00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:06.680]   And so it also is accelerating in that direction.
[00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:09.080]   There's plenty of other reasons as well
[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:10.060]   that are not as profound,
[00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:14.260]   such as having low levels of glucose in your body
[00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:17.020]   will trigger your major muscles in your brain
[00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:19.660]   to become more sensitive to insulin
[00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:21.640]   and suck the glucose out of your bloodstream,
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:22.740]   which is very good.
[00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:25.540]   You don't want to have glucose flowing around too much.
[00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:27.900]   And that will ward off type 2 diabetes.
[00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:32.260]   - So hunger, of course, is associated with low blood glucose
[00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:34.100]   and low insulin.
[00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:35.180]   Do you think there's anything
[00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:38.060]   about the subjective experience of hunger itself
[00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:40.260]   that could be beneficial for longevity?
[00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:42.140]   - Yeah, I do.
[00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:46.740]   Though you get used to the feeling of not eating.
[00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:49.180]   So I'm kind of screwed that way.
[00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:50.100]   - It's like cold water.
[00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:51.460]   You eventually adapt.
[00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:53.980]   - You get used to it, unfortunately.
[00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:55.820]   But there are some studies that are being done
[00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:57.460]   at the National Institutes of Health
[00:27:57.460 --> 00:28:00.780]   that are able to simulate the effect of hunger,
[00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:02.420]   but still provide the calories.
[00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:04.720]   And it's looking like there's a small component
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:05.980]   that's due to hunger.
[00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:09.260]   But most of it actually is because you've got these periods
[00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:10.300]   of not being fed,
[00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:12.740]   and then the body turns on these defensive genes.
[00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:15.300]   There's a really interesting experiment
[00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:17.220]   that was published maybe a couple of years ago
[00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:20.060]   by Rafael de Carbo down at the NIH.
[00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:22.080]   What he did was he took over 10,000 mice
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:24.140]   and gave them different combinations
[00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:26.740]   of fat, carbohydrate, protein.
[00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:29.980]   And he was trying to figure out what was the best combination.
[00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:32.700]   And then he also cleverly had a group,
[00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:35.060]   well, two groups, one that was fed all the time
[00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:37.260]   or ate as much as they wanted.
[00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:40.500]   And the other group was only given food for an hour a day.
[00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:41.660]   And it turns out they ate roughly
[00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:43.060]   the same amount of calories.
[00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:46.700]   'Cause of course in an hour, they're stuffing their faces.
[00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:49.780]   It turns out it didn't matter what diet he gave them.
[00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:51.620]   It was only the group that ate within that window
[00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:53.940]   that lived longer and dramatically longer.
[00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:56.020]   So my conclusion is,
[00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:58.020]   and mice are very similar to us metabolically.
[00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:00.460]   I think that tells us that it's not as important
[00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:02.860]   what you eat, it's when you eat during the day.
[00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:06.220]   - What is the protocol that people can extrapolate
[00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:07.060]   from that?
[00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:09.100]   Or maybe I should just ask you,
[00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:12.340]   what is your protocol for when to eat
[00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:14.100]   and when to avoid food?
[00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:18.600]   Do you fast, do you ever fast longer than 24 hours?
[00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:19.500]   What do you do?
[00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:21.660]   And what do you think is a good jumping off place
[00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:23.940]   if people want to explore this as a protocol?
[00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:26.060]   - Well, if there's one thing I could say,
[00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:29.700]   if I would say definitely try to skip a meal a day,
[00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:30.740]   that's the best thing.
[00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:32.060]   - Does it matter which meal?
[00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:33.140]   Or are they essentially equivalent?
[00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:35.020]   - Well, as long as it's at the end
[00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:36.180]   or the beginning of the day,
[00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:38.660]   because then you add that to the sleep period
[00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:40.280]   where you're hopefully not eating.
[00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:41.700]   - I think that that's an excellent point.
[00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:43.040]   I realize it's a simple one,
[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:44.040]   but I think it's an excellent one.
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:46.160]   'Cause I think one of the things that people struggle
[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:49.620]   with the most is knowing when and how to initiate
[00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:51.820]   this so-called intermittent fasting.
[00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:54.140]   And the middle of the day obviously is not tacked
[00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:55.520]   to the sleep cycle in the same way.
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:59.020]   So it's much harder as well for many people.
[00:29:59.020 --> 00:29:59.920]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:01.600]   - Well, I'll tell you what I do.
[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:02.760]   I skip breakfast.
[00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:04.940]   I have a tiny bit of yogurt or olive oil
[00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:08.260]   because the supplements I have need to be dissolved in it.
[00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:09.700]   And then I go throughout the whole day
[00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:13.820]   as I'm doing right now here with this glass of water here.
[00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:15.900]   I'm just keeping myself filled with liquids.
[00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:17.360]   And so I don't feel hungry.
[00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:21.020]   Beware that the first two to three weeks
[00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:22.820]   when you try that, you will feel hungry.
[00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:26.180]   And you also have a habit of wanting to chew on something.
[00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:28.240]   There's a lot of physical parts to it,
[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:30.180]   but try to make it through the first three weeks
[00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:33.200]   and do without breakfast or do without dinner.
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:34.860]   And you'll get through it.
[00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:38.280]   And I did that for most of my life actually,
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:40.680]   mainly because I wasn't hungry in the morning.
[00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:42.400]   Some people are very hungry in the morning
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:45.180]   and they may wanna consider skipping dinner instead.
[00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:47.060]   But I will go throughout the whole day.
[00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:49.980]   I don't get the crashes of the high glucose
[00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:51.780]   and the low glucose.
[00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:53.700]   Anyone who goes, "Oh man, it's three o'clock.
[00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:55.180]   "I'm gonna need a sleep."
[00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:58.500]   If you do what I do, you will not experience that anymore.
[00:30:58.500 --> 00:30:59.720]   Because what my body does
[00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:02.880]   is it regulates blood sugar levels naturally.
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:05.080]   My liver is putting out glucose when it needs to,
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:06.540]   and it's very steady
[00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:08.260]   and gives me pure focus throughout the day.
[00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:10.060]   And I don't even have to think about lunch.
[00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:11.740]   I'm just powering through.
[00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:14.580]   At dinner, I love food as much as anybody.
[00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:18.980]   So I will eat a regular, pretty healthy meal.
[00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:20.620]   I'll try to eat mostly vegetables.
[00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:23.380]   I can eat some fish, some shrimp.
[00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:25.980]   I rarely will eat a steak.
[00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:29.300]   In fact, my microbiome is so adapted to my diet.
[00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:32.060]   Now, if I eat a steak, it will not get digested very well.
[00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:33.820]   I'll feel terrible.
[00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:35.740]   - If I don't eat a steak, I feel terrible.
[00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:36.980]   (laughs)
[00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:38.060]   Argentine lineage.
[00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:39.780]   Well, we can talk about that some other time.
[00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:40.980]   - Well, everybody's different.
[00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:42.220]   I mean, that's the other thing.
[00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:43.880]   What works for me may not be perfect for you.
[00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:46.680]   And we do have to measure things to know what's working.
[00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:48.820]   I rarely eat dessert.
[00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:53.140]   I gave up dessert and sugar when I turned 40.
[00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:55.580]   And occasionally, I'll steal a bit of dessert
[00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:57.860]   'cause it doesn't hurt if you steal it, right?
[00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:00.460]   But other than that, I avoid sugar,
[00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:03.340]   which includes simple carbohydrates,
[00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:05.020]   bread I try to avoid.
[00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:08.060]   I've actually noticed, this is just a side note.
[00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:10.260]   I used to get buildup of plaque pretty easily.
[00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:11.340]   And every time I went to the dentist,
[00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:12.260]   they'd have to scrape it off.
[00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:13.620]   And I even bought tools to scrape it off
[00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:15.780]   'cause it was driving me nuts.
[00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:17.020]   I don't get plaque anymore.
[00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:18.940]   And I think it's because of my diet.
[00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:20.380]   I don't have those sugars in my mouth
[00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:21.380]   that the bacteria feed on
[00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:24.100]   and then form the biofilm on the teeth.
[00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:25.660]   Much better breath, by the way.
[00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:28.420]   - That's a benefit.
[00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:31.540]   So do you ever fast longer than this?
[00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:35.220]   It sounds like if you go to bed,
[00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:36.820]   well, you tend to stay up late, I know,
[00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:39.620]   because I get texts from you at like two in the morning,
[00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:42.580]   my time, which means you're out very late
[00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:43.860]   and up early as well.
[00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:46.000]   But assuming that people go to sleep
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.240]   sometime around 11, 30, or 12, plus or minus an hour,
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:52.200]   and wake up sometime around 7 a.m.,
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:54.220]   plus or minus 90 minutes,
[00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:57.680]   you're eating more or less on a,
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:00.940]   it sounds like some like 20 hours of fasting,
[00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:03.220]   four hours of eating, or 16 hours of fasting,
[00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:05.980]   and eight hours of food intake, et cetera.
[00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:07.860]   But do you ever do longer fasts,
[00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:11.420]   like 48 hours or 72 hours or week-long fasts?
[00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:12.540]   - Occasionally I do.
[00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:14.340]   So my typical day,
[00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:16.360]   I would only eat within a two-hour window.
[00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:18.860]   Just usually I'm either eating out or-
[00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:20.180]   - So you're 22 too.
[00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:23.080]   - Yeah, yeah, but I love, well-
[00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:25.000]   - And if you exercise, do you feel like,
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:25.960]   then you just power through
[00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:27.820]   and maintain that fasted state?
[00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:29.240]   - Absolutely, I can exercise,
[00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:30.660]   and now my body's so used to it,
[00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:33.560]   I don't feel like I need food after exercising, I used to.
[00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:36.480]   But have I gone longer?
[00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:38.000]   Yes, but not very often.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.200]   I find it quite difficult to go more than 24 hours.
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:43.920]   But when I do it, maybe it's once a month,
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:45.240]   I'll go for two days.
[00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:48.120]   After two, and actually even better,
[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:50.020]   if you go for three days without eating,
[00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:55.020]   it kicks in even greater longevity benefits.
[00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:57.820]   So there's a system called the autophagy system,
[00:33:57.820 --> 00:34:01.660]   which digests old and misfolded proteins in the body.
[00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:02.940]   And there's a natural cleansing
[00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:04.880]   that happens when you're hungry.
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:06.760]   Macro-autophagy, its name is.
[00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:09.260]   But a good friend of mine, Anna Maria Cuervo,
[00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:11.200]   at Albert Einstein College of Medicine,
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:14.320]   discovered a deep cleanse called the chaperone-mediated
[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:18.060]   autophagy, which kicks in day two, day three,
[00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:21.680]   which really gets rid of the deep proteins.
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:24.520]   And what excites me is she just put out a big paper
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:28.900]   that said if you trigger this process in an old mouse,
[00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:31.160]   it lives 35% longer.
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:32.000]   - Wow.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:32.960]   - Yeah, so it's a big deal.
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:34.600]   If I could go longer, I would.
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:36.440]   But I just find that with my lifestyle,
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:41.240]   and I'm going always day 110%, I need to eat
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:42.920]   at least once a day, unfortunately.
[00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:44.100]   - One more practical question,
[00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:46.060]   then a mechanistic question related to this.
[00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:48.960]   The practical question is when you are fasting,
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:51.800]   regardless of how long, I know you're ingesting fluids
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:54.280]   like water and presumably some caffeine.
[00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:58.180]   I heard you had several or more espresso today,
[00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:00.620]   which is impressive.
[00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:04.800]   But are you also ingesting electrolytes?
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:06.520]   Like I know some people get lightheaded,
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:08.820]   they start to feel shaky when they fast,
[00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:11.480]   and that the addition of sodium to their water
[00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:14.880]   or potassium, magnesium is something that's becoming
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:16.080]   a little more in vogue now.
[00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:17.120]   Is that something that you do
[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:19.420]   or that you see a need for people to do?
[00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:22.500]   - Well, it makes sense, but I haven't had a need to do it.
[00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:26.040]   So I don't, I just, I drink tea during the day
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:29.480]   and coffee when I'm first awake and I don't get the shakes.
[00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:31.820]   So, you know, I don't fix what's not broken.
[00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:35.200]   And I do add things to my protocol
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:38.300]   that I think will improve me and avoid those things,
[00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:39.400]   of course, that won't.
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:42.320]   But yeah, because I don't have a need for it,
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:43.300]   I don't try it.
[00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:45.980]   But it does make sense, especially if you've had a big night
[00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:49.060]   the night before, you probably want to supplement with that.
[00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:52.040]   But I think there's fair amount of good stuff
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:54.420]   in tea and coffee as it is.
[00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:57.300]   - Okay, so then the mechanistic question is,
[00:35:57.300 --> 00:36:00.880]   you've told us that there's ample evidence
[00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:03.840]   that keeping your blood sugar low for a period of time,
[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:07.100]   each 24 hours, can help trigger some of these
[00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:11.360]   pro-longevity anti-aging mechanisms.
[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:13.900]   And that extending them out two or three days
[00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:16.880]   can trigger yet additional mechanisms
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:21.880]   of gobbling up of dead cells and things of that sort.
[00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:25.780]   How is it that blood glucose triggers these mechanisms?
[00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:27.340]   'Cause we've said, okay, remove glucose
[00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:29.120]   and things get better.
[00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:32.180]   You've talked before, maybe we could talk more now
[00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:33.740]   about some of the underlying cellular
[00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:36.140]   and genetic mechanisms, things like the sirtuins.
[00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:38.020]   But how are glucose and the sirtuins
[00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:40.980]   actually tethered to one another mechanistically?
[00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:43.220]   - Yeah, there's a really good question.
[00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:47.340]   That proves you're a scientist, or a world leading on.
[00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:51.540]   So what we now know is that these longevity pathways,
[00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:54.260]   we call them, these longevity genes, talk to each other.
[00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:55.900]   And we used to say, oh, my longevity gene's
[00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:58.160]   more important than yours, it was ridiculous.
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:36:59.080]   'Cause they're all talking to each other,
[00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:01.540]   you pull one lever and the other one moves.
[00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:03.260]   And the way to think of it is that there are systems
[00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:05.460]   set up to detect what you're eating.
[00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:10.460]   So the sirtuins will mainly respond to sugar and insulin.
[00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:13.900]   And then there's this other system called mTOR,
[00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:17.020]   which is sensing how much protein or amino acids
[00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:18.540]   are coming into your body.
[00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:20.240]   And they talk to each other, we can pull one
[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:22.500]   and affect the other and vice versa.
[00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:24.520]   But together, when you're fasting,
[00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:27.360]   you'll get the sirtuin activation,
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:28.780]   which is good for you.
[00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:31.660]   And you'll also, through lack of amino acids,
[00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:35.140]   particularly three of them, leucine, isoleucine, valine,
[00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:37.380]   the body will downregulate mTOR.
[00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:40.100]   And it's that up sirtuin, down mTOR,
[00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:42.580]   that is hugely beneficial and turns on
[00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:46.500]   all of the body's defenses, chewing up the old proteins,
[00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:49.180]   improving insulin sensitivity, giving us more energy,
[00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:51.540]   repairing cells, all of that.
[00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:53.120]   And so these two pathways, I think,
[00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:55.200]   are the most important for longevity.
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:57.860]   - So interesting, you mentioned leucine.
[00:37:57.860 --> 00:38:02.460]   Within the resistance training/bodybuilding/fitness
[00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:04.440]   community, leucine gets a lot of attention
[00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:06.540]   because there are longstanding debates
[00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:08.800]   about how much protein one needs per day
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:10.700]   and how much one can assimilate at each meal.
[00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:15.700]   It makes for many YouTube videos and not much else, frankly.
[00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:18.980]   However, it's clear that because of leucine's effects
[00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:22.540]   on the mTOR pathway, that there are many people,
[00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:24.980]   not just people in these particular fitness communities,
[00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:28.200]   that are actively trying to ingest more leucine
[00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:32.660]   on a regular basis in order to maximize their wellness
[00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:34.900]   and fitness, and in some cases, muscle growth,
[00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:36.740]   but also just wellness.
[00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:39.720]   But what I interpret your last statement to mean
[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:42.980]   is that leucine, because it triggers cellular growth,
[00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:47.980]   is actually pro-aging in some sense, is that right?
[00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:50.420]   - Well, it could be, that's what the evidence suggests.
[00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:52.260]   And again, it goes back to the debate,
[00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:55.320]   should you supplement with growth hormone or testosterone,
[00:38:55.320 --> 00:39:00.140]   all of these activities will give you immediate benefits.
[00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:04.380]   You'll bulk up more, you'll feel better immediately.
[00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:06.180]   But based on the research,
[00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:08.580]   it's at the expense of long-term health.
[00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:12.380]   So my view of longevity, the way I treat my body,
[00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:15.180]   is I don't burn both candles.
[00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:16.940]   I have one end of the candle lit.
[00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:19.020]   I'm very careful, I don't blow on it.
[00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:23.260]   But I also do enough exercise that I'm building up my muscle,
[00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:24.460]   but I'm not huge.
[00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:26.460]   Anyone who's seen me knows
[00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:29.300]   that I'm not a professional bodybuilder.
[00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:31.700]   But I tried to actually, here's the key,
[00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:34.400]   and I haven't said this publicly that I can remember,
[00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:37.660]   I pulse things so that I get periods of fasting,
[00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:40.480]   and then I eat, then I take a supplement,
[00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:44.040]   then I fast, then I exercise,
[00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:46.940]   and I'm taking the supplements and eating
[00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:50.940]   in the right timing to allow me to build up muscle sometimes.
[00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:55.340]   Because you can't just expect to take something constantly
[00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:57.580]   and do something constantly for it to work.
[00:39:57.580 --> 00:39:59.660]   And that's why it's taken me about 15 years
[00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:00.940]   to develop my protocol.
[00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:02.900]   And there's a lot of subtlety to it.
[00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:05.000]   - Yeah, it sounds like a very rational protocol.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.800]   Does the name Ori Hofmeckler mean anything to you?
[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:09.260]   - No. - Okay.
[00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:12.340]   Just briefly, I discovered Ori Hofmeckler
[00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:14.500]   about 15 years ago.
[00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:16.840]   He was in Israeli special forces.
[00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:19.100]   He's now got to be close to 70.
[00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:22.200]   Forgive me, Ori, if that number is inflated.
[00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:26.100]   He wrote a book called "The Warrior Diet,"
[00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:28.320]   which got very little attention at the time.
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:31.840]   But what he said was when he was in Israeli special forces,
[00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:34.300]   they rarely ate more than once per day,
[00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:36.700]   and sometimes once every second or third day.
[00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:38.460]   And this is a guy who maintains
[00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:41.400]   an incredible physical stature.
[00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:45.840]   You know, he's very lean, very strong, and very vital at,
[00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:48.040]   you know, I wouldn't say an advanced age,
[00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:49.060]   but he's getting up there,
[00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:51.500]   and he just seems to be getting better and better.
[00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:53.300]   Ori Hofmeckler was the person
[00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:55.780]   who essentially founded, if you will,
[00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:59.360]   although our ancestors founded, to be completely fair,
[00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:03.420]   the so-called intermittent fasting diet.
[00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:04.740]   He called it "The Warrior Diet,"
[00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:06.120]   and this book didn't get much attention.
[00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:08.700]   But one of the things that you just said
[00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:10.400]   really reminded me of Ori.
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:11.240]   I sat down with him.
[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:12.860]   I actually went to his home and sat down with him,
[00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:15.260]   and he said, "Fasting is wonderful,
[00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:18.140]   but these pulses where you nourish the body
[00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:20.880]   or even slightly overnourish the body,
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:23.180]   provided they aren't too frequent,
[00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:25.940]   have a tremendous effect on vitality."
[00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:28.120]   And so I want to use that as kind of a segue
[00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:33.120]   to address this issue of vitality versus longevity,
[00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:35.440]   because here you're telling me,
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:38.620]   and certainly the evidence supports that, you know,
[00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:40.580]   growth hormone will make you feel better and younger,
[00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:43.100]   taking testosterone or estrogen, we should probably say.
[00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:47.060]   There are women who take hormone therapies later in life,
[00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:49.860]   who take estrogen, they experience a strong increase
[00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:52.180]   in vitality if it's done correctly.
[00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:56.480]   But there is an effect of aging the body more rapidly.
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:59.380]   It's sort of a second puberty, if you will.
[00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:02.640]   But this idea of restriction and then pulsing,
[00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:04.700]   not necessarily feast and famine,
[00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:08.700]   but certainly famine and feast in lowercase letters,
[00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:10.960]   there really seems to be something about that.
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:13.920]   So at a cellular level,
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:16.900]   like we kind of go back to mTOR and the sirtuins,
[00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:20.480]   how do you think that the cells might be reacting
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:23.140]   to this kind of lowercase feast
[00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:28.080]   and uppercase famine type protocol?
[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:28.920]   - All right.
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:32.600]   Well, the pulsing, I think,
[00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:35.000]   is what you want to do is to get the cells
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:39.280]   to be perceiving adversity.
[00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:41.160]   'Cause our modern life, we're sitting around,
[00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:45.660]   we're eating too much, we're not exercising,
[00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:47.040]   our cells respond.
[00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:49.440]   They go, "Hey, everything's cool, no problem."
[00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:52.240]   And they become relaxed and they turn on their defenses
[00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:53.200]   and we age rapidly.
[00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:54.640]   We can see it in the clock.
[00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:56.740]   People who exercise and eat less
[00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:58.260]   have a slower ticking clock.
[00:42:58.260 --> 00:42:59.100]   It's a fact.
[00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:03.440]   But my protocol is different than most people's
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:05.500]   because I am pulsing it.
[00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:08.240]   Now, first of all, let's get to why did I even think
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:09.180]   that might be possible?
[00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:11.880]   'Cause I didn't read "The Warrior Diet."
[00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:15.680]   What I found in my research was that
[00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:18.220]   if we gave resveratrol, this red wine molecule
[00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:20.840]   that became well-known in the 2000s,
[00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:25.120]   if we gave it to mice their whole lifespan,
[00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:27.360]   they were protected against a high-fat diet,
[00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:29.000]   which we call the Western diet.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:30.840]   They had lean organs.
[00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:33.840]   They lived slightly longer, but not a lot.
[00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:37.880]   And if we gave them a high-fat diet without resveratrol,
[00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:40.520]   they actually lived a lot shorter.
[00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:43.420]   So resveratrol protected them against the high-fat diet.
[00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:44.820]   We gave it to them on a normal diet.
[00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:46.500]   They just ate it when they wanted
[00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:48.520]   and there wasn't much effect.
[00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:49.740]   This is what's not known,
[00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:51.780]   though it's in the supplemental data of the paper
[00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:53.140]   that nobody ever reads.
[00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:57.060]   The mice that were given resveratrol every second day
[00:43:57.060 --> 00:44:00.200]   on a normal diet lived dramatically longer
[00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:01.380]   than any other group.
[00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:05.020]   So people out there, you know, my critics say,
[00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:06.820]   "Oh, resveratrol didn't extend the lifespan
[00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:08.640]   "of mice on a normal diet.
[00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:10.500]   "Therefore, it's not aging.
[00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:12.720]   "It's just protecting against a high-fat diet."
[00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:15.200]   Well, look at the supplemental data, please.
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:17.880]   If you give it to the mice every other day,
[00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:19.940]   we had mice living over three years.
[00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:21.620]   - Wow, that's a long time.
[00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:25.660]   I have got many, many mice in my ownership
[00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:27.020]   at my lab at Stanford,
[00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:29.520]   and that's a very long life for a mouse.
[00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:30.580]   - It was by far.
[00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:33.940]   And so it was a long lifespan extension.
[00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:37.020]   And what that told me is that probably
[00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:40.340]   you don't wanna be taking a supplement every day.
[00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:42.160]   You can take it either every other day
[00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:43.740]   or give your body a rest.
[00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:45.500]   And I do the same with my meals.
[00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:46.740]   I rest during the day,
[00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:49.920]   and then I give a nutritious dinner to my body
[00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:50.900]   and then give it a rest.
[00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:51.980]   Same with exercise.
[00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:53.420]   And then I try to time it,
[00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:56.500]   'cause there are times when I'm taking the drug metformin,
[00:44:56.500 --> 00:44:58.420]   which mimics low energy.
[00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:00.100]   For those of you who don't know,
[00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:02.340]   metformin is a drug given to type 2 diabetics
[00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:04.420]   to bring down their blood sugar levels.
[00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:06.580]   But it's been found that looking at tens of thousands
[00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:08.460]   of veterans and others,
[00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:10.600]   that those two type 2 diabetics live longer
[00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:12.420]   than people that don't even get type 2 diabetes.
[00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:14.940]   So it's a longevity drug.
[00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:17.660]   Right now, you have to get it from your doctor in the US.
[00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:18.860]   In most other countries,
[00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:20.840]   you can just get it over the counter.
[00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:23.780]   And you're protected, it looks like,
[00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:26.740]   based on epidemiological data,
[00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:29.460]   cancer, heart disease, frailty.
[00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:32.500]   What else? Dementia.
[00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:34.620]   So I take metformin.
[00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:37.980]   - In addition, you take metformin and your fasting each day.
[00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:39.980]   So when do you take it relative to the fasting?
[00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:44.060]   - Yeah, I always take metformin in the morning,
[00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:46.460]   along with the resveratrol,
[00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:48.420]   because, for a number of reasons,
[00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:52.780]   but mainly because my body responds better,
[00:45:52.780 --> 00:45:55.440]   and I've been measuring my body for 12, 13 years.
[00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:59.640]   But here's the thing, if I'm going to exercise that day,
[00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:02.060]   I will skip the metformin.
[00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:04.460]   And a lot of people who do pay attention
[00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:06.220]   to this kind of thing
[00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:08.020]   think that they should stop taking metformin
[00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:09.520]   'cause they're never going to get muscle,
[00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:12.360]   or it's going to affect their ability to build up muscle.
[00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:14.380]   But that's not true.
[00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:16.680]   What metformin does to you,
[00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:20.580]   it actually just reduces your ability to have stamina,
[00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:23.480]   because it's inhibiting your body's ability to make energy.
[00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:26.740]   And so what happens is, when you're on metformin,
[00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:28.760]   you do fewer reps.
[00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:29.600]   But guess what?
[00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:32.460]   These muscles that you do build up on metformin
[00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:35.100]   have the same strength and have much lower inflammation
[00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:37.620]   and other markers of aging.
[00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:41.900]   You just won't have that extra 5% size of muscles.
[00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:44.800]   So if you want large muscles, don't take metformin,
[00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:48.020]   and you'll be fine during your exercise.
[00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:50.740]   But for me, I'm not trying to get giant.
[00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:51.660]   I want strong muscles,
[00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:53.900]   and I want to live longer and healthier.
[00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:56.820]   So I just try to time it
[00:46:56.820 --> 00:47:01.360]   so that I get the most reps out of my exercise regime.
[00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:04.860]   But sometimes in scientific literature,
[00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:06.720]   it's worth bringing this up.
[00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:09.200]   If there's a 5% difference in a graph,
[00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:13.440]   then either the press release or some reporter will say,
[00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:14.920]   "Oh my goodness, big difference.
[00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:17.840]   "5% can't take metformin during exercise."
[00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:19.020]   That's the headline.
[00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:21.540]   And then you go in and it's barely significant,
[00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:22.680]   and the graph is distorted
[00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:25.960]   because they've changed the axes to make it look bigger.
[00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:28.160]   And now it's become a myth
[00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:31.260]   that metformin greatly inhibits your ability to exercise,
[00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:32.800]   which is not true.
[00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:34.200]   But in an abundance of caution,
[00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:37.460]   I skip my metformin on days I'm going to exercise.
[00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:39.580]   And not only that, I'm one of the 20% of people
[00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:42.600]   that has a stomach sensitivity to it.
[00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:44.320]   So if I'm not feeling great that day,
[00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:45.540]   I don't take it either.
[00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:48.160]   - You mentioned metformin is available only by prescription
[00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:50.640]   from a doctor, at least in the US.
[00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:53.360]   Berberine is a substance that comes from tree bark,
[00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:56.260]   who I also learned about many years ago from Ori.
[00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:59.240]   He said, "If ever I'm going to overeat
[00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:02.640]   "like a Thanksgiving meal or something, I take berberine."
[00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:04.520]   Those were his words, and I tried it.
[00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:06.240]   And what's remarkable about berberine
[00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:09.560]   is that you can eat enormous quantities of food
[00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:12.380]   and not feel as if you've eaten enormous quantities of food.
[00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:14.740]   I'm not necessarily recommending people do this,
[00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:18.760]   but what I noticed was if I took berberine,
[00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:21.200]   which my understanding is it works very similarly
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:23.720]   to metformin, works on the AMPK pathway,
[00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:25.160]   the mTOR pathway, et cetera,
[00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:29.900]   that if I didn't ingest food in particular carbohydrates,
[00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:32.060]   I would feel a little dizzy and kind of get a headache,
[00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:34.280]   like almost hypoglycemic.
[00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:36.560]   What are your thoughts on berberine
[00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:38.840]   as an alternative to metformin?
[00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:41.060]   And are there any cautionary notes?
[00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:42.780]   I mean, obviously people should talk to their doctor
[00:48:42.780 --> 00:48:45.140]   before adding or subtracting anything from their life,
[00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:49.360]   including breath work or anything that comes up.
[00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:52.040]   But with all that set aside,
[00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:53.680]   what are your thoughts about berberine
[00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:57.760]   and timing of low blood sugar and these sorts of things?
[00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:58.600]   - Right.
[00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:00.440]   Well, before I had access to metformin,
[00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:01.800]   I was taking berberine.
[00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:04.180]   It's often known as the poor man's metformin.
[00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:06.840]   - He just called me poor.
[00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:08.560]   - Women can take it too.
[00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:11.440]   So the thing with berberine, and we've studied it in my lab,
[00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:15.080]   it is effective at boosting energetics in the body,
[00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:18.080]   just like AMPK and metformin does.
[00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:21.720]   And we've actually given it to rats and mice
[00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:23.080]   and seen that they are very healthy,
[00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:24.580]   especially on a high fat diet.
[00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:27.680]   So I think it's likely to be good.
[00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:29.680]   There are some human studies that exist,
[00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:31.420]   clinical trials showing that it increases
[00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:32.360]   insulin sensitivity.
[00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:33.480]   You have to take high doses.
[00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:34.760]   - Which is a good thing, right?
[00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:35.600]   - Yeah.
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:36.740]   - I think when people hear insulin sensitivity,
[00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:39.160]   sometimes people think, oh, well, that's bad, right?
[00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:41.200]   No, but you want your cells to be insulin sensitive.
[00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:43.480]   You don't want a lot of blood sugar floating around
[00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:45.480]   that can't be sequestered into cells.
[00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:46.320]   - Exactly.
[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:49.200]   - This is anti type two diabetes.
[00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:52.920]   And so that this berberine does have wonderful effects
[00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:56.480]   on the metabolism of animals and in some clinical trials
[00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:58.440]   on dozens of people it's been tested.
[00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:01.880]   Now there's one cautionary tale, which just came up,
[00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:04.480]   Matt Kaeberlein's lab published that berberine
[00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:06.100]   reduced the lifespan of worms.
[00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:10.200]   But I'm not sure worms trump human clinical trials
[00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:11.240]   at this point.
[00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:12.080]   So I would say-
[00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:13.920]   - Not in my opinion, but no disrespect
[00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:15.520]   to my C. Elegans colleagues,
[00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:17.320]   or rather my colleagues that work on C. Elegans.
[00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:18.160]   - Yeah.
[00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:20.200]   Well, what I like to do is to give all the information
[00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:21.960]   people can decide what they want.
[00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:24.280]   But I would say if based on the worm data,
[00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:26.000]   I wouldn't panic just yet.
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:29.440]   I think berberine has been shown to be really safe in humans.
[00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:31.000]   - You mentioned resveratrol.
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:33.240]   I think now would be a great time to talk a little bit
[00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:35.040]   about protocols for resveratrol,
[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:37.400]   grape seed extract, et cetera.
[00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:40.220]   Let's start with the obvious one that I know you get a lot,
[00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:45.040]   but for the record, can't I just drink red wine
[00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:47.960]   and get enough resveratrol, David?
[00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:48.880]   - You can try.
[00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:51.600]   You need to drink about 200 glasses a day.
[00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:52.440]   So I-
[00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:54.040]   - I'm sure it's been tried.
[00:50:54.040 --> 00:50:55.280]   - There are some.
[00:50:55.280 --> 00:51:00.040]   And I drink a glass of red wine a day if I get the chance.
[00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:02.240]   But any more than that, it's a lot of calories
[00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:04.120]   and your liver will get fatty and it's all bad.
[00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:08.180]   So realistically, you can only get the thousand milligrams
[00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:13.180]   that I take a day from a supplement that's pure.
[00:51:13.180 --> 00:51:14.920]   Now, there are a lot of people selling resveratrol.
[00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:19.080]   If it's not light gray or white in color, throw it away.
[00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:23.000]   The brown stuff has gone bad or is contaminated.
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:26.320]   And the contaminated stuff, beware, it'll cause diarrhea.
[00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:28.680]   But regular resveratrol should not do that.
[00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:31.600]   - So a thousand milligrams per day is what you do?
[00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:34.840]   - Yeah, and I have for about 15 years now.
[00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:38.400]   - And you ingest that with some fatty substance
[00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:40.760]   like olive oil or yogurt, is that right?
[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:41.600]   - Yeah, you have to.
[00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:45.240]   And other supplements, quercetin, curcumin,
[00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:46.280]   these are crunchy things.
[00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:48.020]   They're not gonna get through your gut.
[00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:49.520]   And I'm not just making this up.
[00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:53.040]   I always base my statements on human studies.
[00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:55.400]   So we've done a lot of studies on resveratrol
[00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:56.780]   as have others since.
[00:51:56.780 --> 00:51:59.360]   And we know that from, we found out early,
[00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:01.000]   I was one of the first people to take a high dose
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:02.360]   for resveratrol.
[00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:04.680]   And when we included it with food,
[00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:07.480]   the levels in my blood went up fivefold.
[00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:09.140]   And so you wanna have something in there.
[00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:10.120]   If you just drink it with water,
[00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:11.680]   it's not gonna get through.
[00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:13.960]   And unfortunately, some people have done clinical trials
[00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:16.020]   without even thinking that they might need
[00:52:16.020 --> 00:52:17.840]   to dissolve it in something.
[00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:20.260]   - So are you taking this all at once in the morning
[00:52:20.260 --> 00:52:21.840]   and chasing it with some olive oil?
[00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:24.620]   Or are you dissolving it in yogurt?
[00:52:24.620 --> 00:52:26.560]   What's the specific protocol?
[00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:31.560]   - Yeah, I've been improving, perfecting what I do.
[00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:34.980]   For about 10 years, I would take some Greek yogurt,
[00:52:34.980 --> 00:52:37.800]   couple of spoonfuls, put the resveratrol on there,
[00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:39.680]   mix it around, make sure it's dissolved,
[00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:41.740]   and put that in my mouth and swallow that.
[00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:42.960]   These days, what I like to do,
[00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:45.700]   because I've realized that olive oil,
[00:52:45.700 --> 00:52:47.840]   and particularly oleic acid,
[00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:50.420]   one of the monounsaturated fatty acids,
[00:52:50.420 --> 00:52:54.060]   is also an activator of the sirtuin defenses.
[00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:57.140]   So I'm trying to ingest more oleic acid.
[00:52:57.140 --> 00:52:58.800]   So I switched to olive oil.
[00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:01.000]   What I do is I put a couple of teaspoons of olive oil
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:04.080]   in a glass, mix around the resveratrol
[00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:07.120]   and maybe some quercetin, a similar molecule,
[00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:08.900]   make sure it's dissolved.
[00:53:08.900 --> 00:53:10.480]   I put a little bit of vinegar.
[00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:14.240]   And if I have a basil leaf, I'll put that in.
[00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:17.280]   And it's like drinking some salad dressing, and it's great.
[00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:18.120]   - Delicious.
[00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:22.800]   That raises a question that I want to ask
[00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:27.800]   before we get to NMN and NR and vitamin B3,
[00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:31.040]   which is, by doing that,
[00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:33.280]   do you think that it breaks your fast?
[00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:36.420]   And I want to just frame this question of breaking the fast
[00:53:36.420 --> 00:53:38.680]   in a more general scientific theme.
[00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:41.040]   And I'd love your thoughts on this.
[00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:42.920]   One of the questions I get asked all the time
[00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:46.160]   is does ingesting blank break the fast?
[00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:49.320]   Does eating this or drinking this, coffee,
[00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:51.580]   if I walk in the room and someone else is eating a cracker,
[00:53:51.580 --> 00:53:53.380]   does it break my fast?
[00:53:53.380 --> 00:53:55.000]   People get pretty extreme with this.
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.940]   My sense, and please tell me if I'm wrong,
[00:53:57.940 --> 00:54:00.580]   but my sense is that it depends on the context
[00:54:00.580 --> 00:54:02.180]   of what you did the night before,
[00:54:02.180 --> 00:54:04.820]   whether or not you're diabetic, lots of things.
[00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:07.940]   So for instance, if I eat an enormous meal at midnight,
[00:54:07.940 --> 00:54:11.260]   go to sleep, wake up at 6 a.m.,
[00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:14.240]   I could imagine that black coffee
[00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:15.680]   or coffee with a little bit of cream
[00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:17.640]   might quote unquote break my fast,
[00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:20.120]   but the body doesn't have a breaking the fast switch.
[00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:22.520]   The body only speaks in the language of glucose,
[00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:24.800]   AMPK, mTOR, et cetera.
[00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:28.560]   So do you worry that ingesting these calories
[00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:30.260]   is going to quote unquote break your fast?
[00:54:30.260 --> 00:54:33.120]   And more generally, how do you think about the issue
[00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:34.860]   of whether or not you're fasting enough
[00:54:34.860 --> 00:54:36.600]   to get these positive effects?
[00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:41.600]   Because not everybody can manage on just water or just tea,
[00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:44.620]   or we should say not everybody is willing to manage
[00:54:44.620 --> 00:54:47.440]   on just water or just tea for a certain part of the day.
[00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:49.320]   - Well, my first answer is not scientific.
[00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:50.760]   It's philosophical.
[00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:53.300]   If you don't enjoy life, what's the point?
[00:54:53.300 --> 00:54:56.260]   And so I'd like a cup of coffee in the morning,
[00:54:56.260 --> 00:54:59.780]   little bit of milk, spoonful of yogurt's not gonna kill me.
[00:54:59.780 --> 00:55:04.260]   Olive oil doesn't have protein or carbs in it, not many.
[00:55:04.260 --> 00:55:07.160]   And so I'm probably not affecting those longevity pathways
[00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:11.580]   negatively, but without that, first of all,
[00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:12.820]   I wouldn't enjoy my life as much.
[00:55:12.820 --> 00:55:15.240]   Second, well, the olive oil is not as great as the yogurt,
[00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:20.240]   but I'm trying to optimize and there's no perfect solution
[00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:21.660]   to what we're doing.
[00:55:21.660 --> 00:55:22.720]   And we're still learning.
[00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:24.820]   We don't know what's optimal for me,
[00:55:24.820 --> 00:55:26.520]   let alone everybody else.
[00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:27.460]   But I'm with you.
[00:55:27.460 --> 00:55:30.100]   I don't believe that taking a couple of spoonfuls
[00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:33.180]   of something, unless it's high fructose corn syrup
[00:55:33.180 --> 00:55:36.100]   is gonna hurt you because I've now got the rest of the day
[00:55:36.100 --> 00:55:39.440]   till about eight, 9 p.m. of not eating anything.
[00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:42.620]   And I forgive myself for that.
[00:55:42.620 --> 00:55:44.540]   And there's a really good point here.
[00:55:44.540 --> 00:55:46.500]   You and I were discussing this earlier.
[00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:52.640]   The point about doing this is that you try to do your best.
[00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:57.220]   If you go from regular living to don't eat the whole day,
[00:55:57.220 --> 00:56:00.300]   you're gonna fail, like quitting smoking cold turkey.
[00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:02.740]   It's easy to chew gum and stick the patch on
[00:56:02.740 --> 00:56:05.120]   'cause your body has to get used to all sorts of habits.
[00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:06.820]   And it's social, it's physical,
[00:56:06.820 --> 00:56:08.640]   putting stuff in your mouth, chewing,
[00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:10.660]   not just the low blood sugar levels.
[00:56:10.660 --> 00:56:12.100]   And your brain will fight it.
[00:56:12.100 --> 00:56:15.420]   Your limbic system is gonna go, hey, do it, do it, do it.
[00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:17.620]   And you're gonna have to fight it.
[00:56:17.620 --> 00:56:19.900]   But once you get through it, you'll be better.
[00:56:19.900 --> 00:56:22.060]   But you do it in stages.
[00:56:22.060 --> 00:56:25.220]   Do breakfast first, then do small lunch,
[00:56:25.220 --> 00:56:26.940]   and then eventually cut lunch out.
[00:56:26.940 --> 00:56:30.380]   Don't go cold turkey 'cause everyone knows it's a fact
[00:56:30.380 --> 00:56:33.940]   that if you try to do a strict diet right out of the gates,
[00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:35.560]   you'll almost always fail.
[00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:39.380]   - No, I think that captures the essence
[00:56:39.380 --> 00:56:42.940]   of fasting rationally and a rational approach
[00:56:42.940 --> 00:56:44.800]   to supplementation very well.
[00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:47.820]   Along the lines of supplementation,
[00:56:47.820 --> 00:56:52.540]   what about NMN, NRNB3 niacin?
[00:56:52.540 --> 00:56:57.380]   I want to know what you do.
[00:56:57.380 --> 00:56:59.640]   I also want to know what I should do.
[00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:02.640]   And I think most people want to know what they should do.
[00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:05.800]   I mean, these are molecules that impact the sirtuin pathway,
[00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:08.860]   impact the pathways that control aging
[00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:10.620]   or rates of aging in the epigenome.
[00:57:10.620 --> 00:57:12.880]   How do they do that?
[00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:14.560]   And how does one incorporate that
[00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:16.940]   into a supplementation protocol
[00:57:16.940 --> 00:57:18.160]   should they choose to do that?
[00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:19.240]   - All right.
[00:57:19.240 --> 00:57:21.540]   Well, disclaimer is that I don't recommend anything,
[00:57:21.540 --> 00:57:22.940]   but I talk about what I do.
[00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:25.160]   So a bit of scientific background.
[00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:27.760]   These sirtuin genes that we discovered first in yeast cells
[00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:31.020]   when I was at MIT and then in animals
[00:57:31.020 --> 00:57:33.320]   as I moved to Harvard in the 2000s.
[00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:35.360]   And one of my first postdocs,
[00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:37.740]   actually literally my first postdoc, Chaim Cohen,
[00:57:37.740 --> 00:57:41.260]   published a great paper just a couple of months ago
[00:57:41.260 --> 00:57:44.940]   and found that turning on the sirtuin 6 gene,
[00:57:44.940 --> 00:57:47.700]   remember the 7, number 6 gene is very potent.
[00:57:47.700 --> 00:57:50.040]   It extended the lifespan dramatically of mice
[00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:53.180]   that he engineered, both males and females, which is great.
[00:57:53.180 --> 00:57:55.320]   So what you want to do is,
[00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:58.560]   so naturally boost the activity of these sirtuins.
[00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:00.560]   They are genes, but they also make proteins.
[00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:03.440]   That's what genes typically make or encode.
[00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:04.960]   And then those proteins take care of the body
[00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:07.400]   in many different ways, as we've discussed.
[00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:09.120]   So how do you turn on these genes
[00:58:09.120 --> 00:58:11.560]   and make the proteins they make even more active?
[00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:12.600]   You want to rev up that system.
[00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:16.560]   So exercise will do it, fasting will do it.
[00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:17.780]   What about supplementation?
[00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:21.440]   Well, the first activator of the sirtuins that we discovered
[00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:23.840]   that acts on the enzyme to make it do a better job
[00:58:23.840 --> 00:58:27.520]   of cleaning up the body and protecting was resveratrol.
[00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:30.320]   We looked at thousands of different molecules,
[00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:32.040]   eventually tens of thousands.
[00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:35.840]   And the one that was the best was resveratrol in the dish.
[00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:38.360]   And then we gave it to little organisms, worms,
[00:58:38.360 --> 00:58:41.880]   and then flies and mice, eventually humans.
[00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:44.040]   And we saw that it activated that enzyme.
[00:58:44.040 --> 00:58:46.560]   So resveratrol is one way to activate it.
[00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:49.360]   You can think of it as the accelerator pedal on a car.
[00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:52.400]   It revs it up, but there's something else
[00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:56.100]   that the sirtuins need to work, and that's NAD.
[00:58:56.100 --> 00:58:57.880]   NAD is a really small molecule,
[00:58:57.880 --> 00:59:00.600]   little chemical in the body that we need for life.
[00:59:00.600 --> 00:59:03.280]   It's used by the body for chemical reactions,
[00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:04.840]   400 different reactions in the body,
[00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:07.320]   and without it, you're dead within seconds.
[00:59:07.320 --> 00:59:09.220]   You need NAD.
[00:59:09.220 --> 00:59:13.060]   The problem that we've seen is that NAD levels decline
[00:59:13.060 --> 00:59:16.960]   as you become obese, as you get older,
[00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:19.360]   if you don't ever get hungry.
[00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:22.700]   And the body not only doesn't make enough of it,
[00:59:22.700 --> 00:59:23.920]   it's chewing it up as well.
[00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:28.920]   There's an enzyme called CD38 that Eric Verdin over at UCSF
[00:59:28.920 --> 00:59:32.240]   showed chews up, oh, he's now at the Buck Institute
[00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:35.480]   in California, chews up NAD as you get older.
[00:59:35.480 --> 00:59:36.320]   So it's a double whammy.
[00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:38.520]   You don't make as much, you chew it up,
[00:59:38.520 --> 00:59:40.520]   which is really bad because what we've shown in my lab
[00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:43.240]   and so have others is that NAD levels are really important
[00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:47.220]   for keeping those sirtuin defenses at a youthful level.
[00:59:47.220 --> 00:59:48.760]   And you can give a lot of resveratrol,
[00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:50.360]   but if you don't have the fuel,
[00:59:50.360 --> 00:59:52.520]   you're basically accelerating a car
[00:59:52.520 --> 00:59:54.160]   that doesn't have enough gas.
[00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:55.760]   So you wanna do both, and that's what I do.
[00:59:55.760 --> 01:00:00.160]   I take a precursor to NAD called NMN,
[01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:05.160]   and the body uses that to make the NAD molecule in one step.
[01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:09.340]   And so I know from measuring dozens of human beings
[01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:13.480]   that if you take NMN for the time period that I do,
[01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:14.400]   I've been taking it for years,
[01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:16.320]   but if you take it for about two weeks,
[01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:19.500]   you'll double, on average, double your NAD levels
[01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:20.840]   in the blood, okay?
[01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:22.140]   That's not public information.
[01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:24.800]   That's from clinical trials that are not yet published
[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:26.660]   over the last two years.
[01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:29.160]   There are other ways to increase NAD levels
[01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:31.980]   in someone like me who's getting older, I'm 52 now.
[01:00:31.980 --> 01:00:36.760]   You can take NR, which is used to make NMN,
[01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:38.520]   which is used to make NAD.
[01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:44.420]   And both NMN and NR are sold by companies in the US.
[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:49.440]   NR lacks the phosphate.
[01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:52.040]   Phosphate's a small chemical the body needs.
[01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:54.240]   You've probably heard of the atom phosphorus.
[01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:58.000]   Let's go back one step.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.280]   How do you make NR?
[01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:02.680]   NR gets made from vitamin B3 often.
[01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:05.760]   You can also find it in milk and other foods.
[01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:06.760]   But sometimes people ask me,
[01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:08.440]   "Why don't you just take vitamin B3,
[01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:12.080]   "and won't that just force the body to make NAD?"
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:14.840]   And the answer is no, it doesn't work very well.
[01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:17.880]   We know this just by doing the experiment.
[01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:21.520]   But the reason I think is is that NAD is,
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:22.680]   I said it's a small molecule,
[01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:25.560]   but relative to vitamin B3, it's big.
[01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:27.560]   It's got those phosphates on there.
[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:28.840]   It's got a sugar.
[01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:33.440]   It's got the vitamin B attached.
[01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:35.680]   So you've got all these components that come together
[01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:40.160]   to make this very complicated little molecule called NAD.
[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:43.560]   And when you give NMN, it contains all three components
[01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:45.600]   that the body needs to make an AD.
[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:48.320]   If you give NR, or just vitamin B3,
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:50.080]   which is an even smaller molecule,
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:51.840]   the body has to find these other components
[01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:53.140]   from somewhere else.
[01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:55.140]   So where do you get phosphate?
[01:01:55.140 --> 01:01:58.520]   Well, body needs it for DNA, needs it for bones.
[01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:00.880]   So high doses of something
[01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:03.520]   that requires additional phosphate
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:05.460]   makes me a little concerned.
[01:02:05.460 --> 01:02:07.840]   And we have compared NMN and NR head to head
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:09.660]   in mouse studies.
[01:02:09.660 --> 01:02:11.880]   For instance, NMN we've shown
[01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:14.760]   in a cell paper a few years ago, makes mice run further.
[01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:16.280]   Old mice can run 50% further
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:18.220]   'cause they have better blood flow, better energy.
[01:02:18.220 --> 01:02:20.020]   NR at the same dose did not do that.
[01:02:20.020 --> 01:02:21.300]   In fact, it had no effect.
[01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:22.140]   - I see.
[01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:27.480]   Dosage-wise, if I were elect to take NMN in supplement form
[01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:32.480]   to increase my NAD levels and presumably slow my aging,
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:35.240]   how much NMN should I take?
[01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:37.680]   What's the protocol that you do?
[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:42.100]   And are the various forms that are out there,
[01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:43.720]   are some better or some worse?
[01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:47.560]   - Well, I'm always happy to tell you what I do
[01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:50.060]   and what my father does, my 82-year-old father.
[01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:52.980]   We take a gram of NMN every day.
[01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:56.040]   - So it's a gram of resveratrol and a gram of NMN.
[01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:56.880]   - Right.
[01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:58.040]   - Okay, 1,000 milligrams.
[01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:02.000]   - Now, another important point,
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.880]   which is I'm not the same as everybody else.
[01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:08.380]   I have a different microbiome, age, sex, right?
[01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:10.420]   And so I've been measuring myself.
[01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:12.500]   And so I know if something's,
[01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:14.720]   or I think I know if something's making me better or worse
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:17.900]   based on measuring 45 different things.
[01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:20.580]   So I just want people to be aware
[01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:25.060]   that what I do may not perfectly work at all for others.
[01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:26.840]   But I have studied, as I said,
[01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:31.840]   dozens of people who take NMN at a gram, sometimes two grams.
[01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:34.860]   And I know by looking at all those people
[01:03:34.860 --> 01:03:36.900]   that without any exceptions,
[01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:39.980]   that if you do what I do, your NAD levels go up
[01:03:39.980 --> 01:03:42.020]   by about twofold or more.
[01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:44.480]   And so I do that every day, the 1,000 milligrams.
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:45.840]   Now, people sell it.
[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:48.220]   Now, I never get into brands and all that.
[01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:52.100]   First of all, I don't have the time to measure products.
[01:03:52.100 --> 01:03:53.280]   I don't know.
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:55.000]   Though I should say, I do want to say,
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:59.300]   I'm working on a solution for people to know what works
[01:03:59.300 --> 01:04:02.320]   and what's real and what isn't, but I'm not there yet.
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:04.340]   And in the meantime, I would say,
[01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:06.540]   if you do want to buy this,
[01:04:06.540 --> 01:04:08.140]   let's say you want to buy NMN,
[01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:10.760]   look for a company that is well-established,
[01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:13.900]   that has high levels of quality control.
[01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:16.260]   Look for three letters, GMP,
[01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:19.140]   which is good manufacturing practices.
[01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:20.260]   And so that means they make it
[01:04:20.260 --> 01:04:22.280]   under a certain level of quality control.
[01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:25.500]   You're not going to find iron filings in there,
[01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:29.060]   and it probably has the stuff in it that they say it does.
[01:04:29.060 --> 01:04:32.580]   So that's all I can say right now.
[01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:34.980]   I'm working on something that's going to be much more helpful.
[01:04:34.980 --> 01:04:39.580]   But overall, make sure it's white, crystalline, NMN,
[01:04:39.580 --> 01:04:42.460]   and that to me, it tastes like burnt popcorn.
[01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:43.780]   - You crack open the capsules,
[01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:44.920]   and you'll take a little sample
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:46.780]   to make sure it tastes like burnt popcorn.
[01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:50.460]   - Well, when I'm making my capsules, I'll taste it,
[01:04:50.460 --> 01:04:53.560]   and I do a lot of quality control on the stuff that I take.
[01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:56.060]   - Do you take that gram all at once with the resveratrol,
[01:04:56.060 --> 01:04:58.580]   or do you take it spread throughout the day?
[01:04:58.580 --> 01:05:01.540]   - It's all in the morning for those things.
[01:05:01.540 --> 01:05:04.820]   So if I take metformin, it's NMN,
[01:05:04.820 --> 01:05:06.620]   and there is resveratrol all together.
[01:05:06.620 --> 01:05:08.380]   And there's a good reason for that.
[01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:10.400]   It's all scientific, I try to be.
[01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:13.780]   The levels of NAD go up in the morning
[01:05:13.780 --> 01:05:14.740]   in our bodies naturally.
[01:05:14.740 --> 01:05:16.400]   Our bodies actually have a cycle of NAD.
[01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:17.240]   It's not steady.
[01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:18.080]   - It's circadian.
[01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:18.900]   - It's circadian.
[01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:22.220]   In fact, NAD controls your clock.
[01:05:22.220 --> 01:05:24.220]   This was shown by Shin, MI, and colleagues
[01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:27.060]   in a nice science paper about a decade ago,
[01:05:27.060 --> 01:05:28.860]   that if you disrupt the NAD cycle,
[01:05:28.860 --> 01:05:33.020]   which is controlled by the sirtuin gene that we worked on,
[01:05:33.020 --> 01:05:35.860]   that is what's telling your body, oh, it's time to eat,
[01:05:35.860 --> 01:05:37.340]   it's time to go to sleep.
[01:05:37.340 --> 01:05:41.260]   And if you take the NMN late at night, for example,
[01:05:41.260 --> 01:05:43.320]   you can disrupt your circadian rhythms.
[01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:44.160]   - Interesting.
[01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:45.860]   - Conversely, when I travel
[01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:48.620]   and I want to reset my clock to the time zone,
[01:05:48.620 --> 01:05:53.620]   I will take a boost of NMN in the morning and I feel great.
[01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:56.520]   - Does this protocol for you,
[01:05:56.520 --> 01:06:00.140]   does it produce any immediate effects
[01:06:00.140 --> 01:06:01.940]   of increased energy, et cetera?
[01:06:01.940 --> 01:06:05.840]   You mentioned that one would, if it's right for them,
[01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:08.180]   would have to take it for at least two weeks
[01:06:08.180 --> 01:06:10.140]   to start to see the NAD levels increase.
[01:06:10.140 --> 01:06:13.580]   At that point, when NAD levels increase,
[01:06:13.580 --> 01:06:16.020]   could one possibly expect an increase
[01:06:16.020 --> 01:06:20.480]   in overall energy focus, et cetera?
[01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:21.980]   I realize we're not making promises here,
[01:06:21.980 --> 01:06:24.020]   but I'm just wondering whether or not the only measure
[01:06:24.020 --> 01:06:25.860]   of whether or not this protocol is working
[01:06:25.860 --> 01:06:30.820]   is whether or not you die at age blank or blank plus 20.
[01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:33.900]   And of course, once you're dead,
[01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:36.580]   you can't really know if you would have lived longer
[01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:38.580]   if you'd done something differently and vice versa.
[01:06:38.580 --> 01:06:39.420]   - Sure.
[01:06:39.420 --> 01:06:41.220]   Well, there was a study, again by Shin Amai,
[01:06:41.220 --> 01:06:43.920]   my good friend at Washington University in St. Louis,
[01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:46.660]   that showed that it improves,
[01:06:46.660 --> 01:06:50.460]   remember, this insulin sensitivity, which is a good thing.
[01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:52.160]   But you can't know your insulin sensitivity
[01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:53.860]   unless you're measuring a glucose,
[01:06:53.860 --> 01:06:55.140]   have a glucose monitor on your arm.
[01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:56.340]   - Do you have one on right now?
[01:06:56.340 --> 01:06:57.780]   - No.
[01:06:57.780 --> 01:06:58.740]   No, I used to.
[01:06:58.740 --> 01:06:59.560]   I learned a lot.
[01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:01.060]   Last time I saw you had this thing.
[01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:04.220]   It looks like a small leech, not a large leech,
[01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:06.220]   and it was measuring your blood glucose.
[01:07:06.220 --> 01:07:07.340]   - They're very informative
[01:07:07.340 --> 01:07:09.520]   because you learn what your body reacts to
[01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:11.420]   and grapes were really bad.
[01:07:11.420 --> 01:07:14.120]   Rhonda Patrick agrees with that.
[01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:18.220]   But the issue was what?
[01:07:18.220 --> 01:07:19.660]   Where were we, Andrew?
[01:07:19.660 --> 01:07:20.580]   - The issue was whether or not
[01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:22.900]   you can expect any immediate effects
[01:07:22.900 --> 01:07:26.500]   on energy, vitality, focus, just even subjective.
[01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:28.080]   - So what do you feel is the question?
[01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:29.660]   - And anecdotally,
[01:07:29.660 --> 01:07:31.020]   'cause I've been taking this for a long time,
[01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:33.140]   if I don't take it, I start to feel 50 years old.
[01:07:33.140 --> 01:07:33.980]   It's horrible.
[01:07:33.980 --> 01:07:35.800]   I can't think straight.
[01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:38.900]   It may be placebo, but who knows?
[01:07:38.900 --> 01:07:41.500]   But what we're doing now are very careful clinical trials.
[01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:43.340]   We've done the safety for two years,
[01:07:43.340 --> 01:07:45.740]   and we're now treating elderly patients
[01:07:45.740 --> 01:07:49.100]   at Harvard Medical School with some wonderful colleagues.
[01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:51.380]   And those people are actually going to be,
[01:07:51.380 --> 01:07:53.780]   and currently in MRIs,
[01:07:53.780 --> 01:07:57.660]   so you can measure the energetics and the NAD levels
[01:07:57.660 --> 01:08:00.840]   in their legs as they exercise in real time.
[01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:03.440]   And that will tell us if what we see in the mice,
[01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:05.820]   this increased endurance, actually works.
[01:08:05.820 --> 01:08:07.860]   In the meantime, it's fun to talk about anecdotes.
[01:08:07.860 --> 01:08:10.500]   I have a number of athlete friends,
[01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:12.700]   some of which have increased their,
[01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:15.820]   lowered their time in marathons, for example.
[01:08:15.820 --> 01:08:18.860]   There's a good friend of ours in our circle
[01:08:18.860 --> 01:08:21.820]   that is winning marathons at age 50 now,
[01:08:21.820 --> 01:08:24.580]   and he attributes that to the protocol that he's on.
[01:08:24.580 --> 01:08:25.420]   - Interesting.
[01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:26.860]   I haven't started taking NMN,
[01:08:26.860 --> 01:08:30.100]   but I'm planning to do that when my next birthday arrives,
[01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:31.400]   which is in a couple months.
[01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:34.280]   But I do experiments on my sister and have for years,
[01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:37.300]   I have a sister who's three years older than I am
[01:08:37.300 --> 01:08:40.160]   who is very enthusiastic about these protocols.
[01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:43.080]   And I'll tell you that after reading your book,
[01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:45.000]   I started purchasing for her
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.200]   and giving her an NMN supplement.
[01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:50.140]   And she claims, and I believe her,
[01:08:50.140 --> 01:08:51.640]   she has a quite sensitive system
[01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:52.940]   and she's very tuned into it.
[01:08:52.940 --> 01:08:56.400]   She feels far and away better when she takes it
[01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:57.660]   as opposed to when she doesn't.
[01:08:57.660 --> 01:09:01.200]   And I've done the control experiment of removing her supply
[01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:03.360]   and then giving it back to her and this kind of thing.
[01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:06.000]   So that's my other laboratory.
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:10.100]   This is what younger brothers do to older sisters.
[01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:12.600]   I have a question about something that if it has no relevance
[01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:16.100]   we can just treat it as a speed bump and then move right on.
[01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:18.820]   And the artificial sweeteners, these things that,
[01:09:18.820 --> 01:09:23.020]   or I should say non-glucose increasing sweeteners.
[01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:26.060]   So you've got stevia, which is a plant basically,
[01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:29.140]   and then you've got sucralose and aspartame
[01:09:29.140 --> 01:09:30.620]   and all these things.
[01:09:30.620 --> 01:09:33.300]   There is some evidence that I know we're both aware of,
[01:09:33.300 --> 01:09:35.380]   they've been published in quite reputable journals
[01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:38.660]   showing that they can disrupt the gut microbiome
[01:09:38.660 --> 01:09:40.580]   in certain cases, in particular saccharin,
[01:09:40.580 --> 01:09:42.840]   the one that basically nobody uses anymore.
[01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:45.500]   And it's questionable as to whether or not stevia
[01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:47.020]   has the same negative effects, et cetera.
[01:09:47.020 --> 01:09:48.160]   That's not what this is about.
[01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:51.860]   But in terms of the sensation of,
[01:09:51.860 --> 01:09:53.900]   or the perception of sweet taste,
[01:09:55.060 --> 01:09:59.880]   is that itself a possible detriment to these pro-longevity,
[01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:04.300]   forgive me for using the term, the pathways?
[01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:07.200]   If I were to drink a Diet Coke during a fast,
[01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:08.620]   am I somehow disrupting this?
[01:10:08.620 --> 01:10:09.500]   And I'm asking this question
[01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:11.660]   because I get asked this question a lot.
[01:10:11.660 --> 01:10:13.800]   - Well, there may be small effects.
[01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:16.500]   I don't think they're worth worrying about.
[01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:19.140]   Joe Rogan laughed at me 'cause I was drinking a Diet Coke
[01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:21.500]   during the first interview I did with him.
[01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:23.340]   I will drink Diet Coke.
[01:10:23.340 --> 01:10:25.000]   I've read the scientific literature
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:26.800]   and again, it's this 5% thing
[01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:29.300]   that I think is blown out of proportion.
[01:10:29.300 --> 01:10:31.180]   If I was to put a number on it,
[01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:36.180]   I would say if eating a high sugary meal
[01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:39.980]   or drinking a sugar-filled soda,
[01:10:39.980 --> 01:10:42.260]   what is that, 30 grams of sugar,
[01:10:42.260 --> 01:10:45.940]   let's say that's a 10 out of 10 bad for you.
[01:10:45.940 --> 01:10:47.880]   A Diet Coke might be a one.
[01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:50.940]   And if I'm, you know, which am I gonna do?
[01:10:50.940 --> 01:10:54.140]   I could have a 10 or a one or go without in my life.
[01:10:54.140 --> 01:10:56.160]   I'll do the one on occasion.
[01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:58.220]   I try to avoid them
[01:10:58.220 --> 01:11:00.760]   because I don't like the ones as much.
[01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:02.360]   But you can't say that sucralose
[01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:05.280]   is equivalent to drinking a sugary soda.
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:07.360]   There's just no comparison.
[01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:09.640]   And I think, what is it, stevia.
[01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:11.280]   I do use stevia whenever I can
[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:15.060]   because it's a naturally sourced product
[01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:16.920]   and I haven't seen any good evidence yet
[01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:18.680]   that it's bad for you.
[01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:20.940]   But I think a lot of this is overblown
[01:11:20.940 --> 01:11:24.300]   and a lot of it's the media trying to give equal weight
[01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:25.340]   to stories.
[01:11:25.340 --> 01:11:27.180]   As you know, as a scientist,
[01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:29.680]   it can be frustrating when something's a 10
[01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:31.980]   and something's a one and they're equated.
[01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:34.580]   - How do I say this respectfully?
[01:11:34.580 --> 01:11:37.660]   I think if science journalists were required
[01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:42.500]   to post their credentials alongside their name,
[01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:44.500]   people would take the articles
[01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:46.740]   with an additional grain of salt, right?
[01:11:46.740 --> 01:11:47.580]   I mean, in other words,
[01:11:47.580 --> 01:11:50.940]   I think that the science media is mainly generated
[01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:52.360]   around two specific goals.
[01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:55.260]   One is to make people very, very afraid
[01:11:55.260 --> 01:11:56.860]   or get people very, very excited.
[01:11:56.860 --> 01:11:59.240]   And oftentimes the get people excited part
[01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:00.400]   is sponsored content.
[01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:01.860]   And I think that's overlooked.
[01:12:01.860 --> 01:12:04.160]   In any case, thank you for that.
[01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:07.620]   I want to talk about iron and iron load.
[01:12:07.620 --> 01:12:09.900]   We were talking earlier about ferritin
[01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:13.280]   and of course women, men straight.
[01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:16.460]   And so their iron needs are greater
[01:12:16.460 --> 01:12:19.060]   than people, men that don't menstruate
[01:12:19.060 --> 01:12:20.660]   or women that don't menstruate.
[01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:22.980]   I don't think we can get right down
[01:12:22.980 --> 01:12:24.860]   into how much iron somebody needs
[01:12:24.860 --> 01:12:26.420]   because it will vary person to person.
[01:12:26.420 --> 01:12:29.620]   But I was surprised to learn that iron
[01:12:29.620 --> 01:12:33.660]   is actually going to accelerate the aging process
[01:12:33.660 --> 01:12:35.160]   in various contexts.
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:39.860]   - Well, this is a new finding out of Spain.
[01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:43.980]   Manuel Serrano's lab has found that excess iron
[01:12:43.980 --> 01:12:47.780]   will increase the number of senescent cells in the body.
[01:12:47.780 --> 01:12:49.840]   And senescent cells are these zombie cells
[01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:52.260]   that accumulate as you get older and they sit there
[01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:54.380]   and they cause inflammation mainly
[01:12:54.380 --> 01:12:56.500]   and also can cause cancer.
[01:12:56.500 --> 01:12:58.620]   And it's found that if you get rid of these cells
[01:12:58.620 --> 01:13:02.100]   or never accumulate them, you stay younger.
[01:13:02.100 --> 01:13:05.380]   In animals and there's some really interesting studies
[01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:07.220]   out of Mayo Clinic in humans as well.
[01:13:07.220 --> 01:13:13.500]   So iron is a pro-senescent metal.
[01:13:13.660 --> 01:13:17.100]   And so what I think is that if you're taking excess iron
[01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:19.580]   as a supplement, you're probably accelerating
[01:13:19.580 --> 01:13:21.060]   your aging process.
[01:13:21.060 --> 01:13:22.820]   The other thing that I found really interesting
[01:13:22.820 --> 01:13:24.420]   is I've looked at hundreds of thousands
[01:13:24.420 --> 01:13:29.220]   of people's metabolism and their blood biomarkers.
[01:13:29.220 --> 01:13:32.240]   I was one of the first people inside Tracker
[01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:37.240]   as a board member and I'm still a scientific lead guy.
[01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:39.860]   So I can look anonymously at hundreds of thousands
[01:13:39.860 --> 01:13:41.320]   of people's blood work.
[01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:44.420]   And we also know how fit they are, how old they are.
[01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:47.000]   Some of them are marathon runners,
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.820]   some of them are CrossFit.
[01:13:49.820 --> 01:13:52.040]   And there's a signature of health
[01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:54.940]   that actually is different than your average person.
[01:13:54.940 --> 01:13:58.040]   Now, I'm not gonna say bad things about MDs
[01:13:58.040 --> 01:14:00.340]   'cause a lot of my best friends are MDs
[01:14:00.340 --> 01:14:03.340]   and I work with them at Harvard Medical School.
[01:14:03.340 --> 01:14:06.840]   The issue though is that with MD training,
[01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:09.900]   it's there's a scale of what's normal.
[01:14:09.900 --> 01:14:11.980]   And if you're out of that normal range,
[01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:12.980]   something must be wrong.
[01:14:12.980 --> 01:14:15.240]   That's the paradigm that they work under.
[01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:17.280]   But first of all, everybody's different
[01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:18.920]   and you wanna know their baseline and track people
[01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:21.700]   over years to know what's normal for them.
[01:14:21.700 --> 01:14:23.060]   And what I find, for example,
[01:14:23.060 --> 01:14:26.600]   is people who are really healthy and live the way I do
[01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:31.600]   and have a diet that's fairly vegetarian, but not strict,
[01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:35.220]   still have slightly low hemoglobin levels,
[01:14:35.220 --> 01:14:38.080]   slightly low iron, slightly low ferritin,
[01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:39.600]   but we have super amounts of energy.
[01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:43.700]   We're not anemic and we're getting along with great in life.
[01:14:43.700 --> 01:14:46.260]   But a doctor who just looks at that might say,
[01:14:46.260 --> 01:14:48.580]   oh, we need to give you more iron, right?
[01:14:48.580 --> 01:14:50.420]   So what I'm getting at is an example
[01:14:50.420 --> 01:14:53.340]   of we need to personalize medicine
[01:14:53.340 --> 01:14:55.580]   and look at people over the long run
[01:14:55.580 --> 01:15:00.120]   to know what works for them and what's healthy for them,
[01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:02.040]   and not just work towards the average human,
[01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:04.700]   but work towards what's optimal for human.
[01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:06.340]   - I love that answer.
[01:15:06.340 --> 01:15:08.460]   You mentioned tracking and tracking over time,
[01:15:08.460 --> 01:15:10.840]   and this is a really interesting area
[01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:13.960]   that I know you have been focused on for a long time.
[01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:17.060]   I've been getting blood work done about every six months,
[01:15:17.060 --> 01:15:19.880]   frankly, since I was in college, I just got, I like data,
[01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:22.980]   and I got interested in supplementation and exercise
[01:15:22.980 --> 01:15:24.260]   'cause it made me feel better,
[01:15:24.260 --> 01:15:27.020]   but I also wanna know what was going on under the hood.
[01:15:27.020 --> 01:15:28.780]   So you get numbers back.
[01:15:28.780 --> 01:15:30.340]   You get this hormone, that hormone,
[01:15:30.340 --> 01:15:33.820]   this blood glucose measure, et cetera.
[01:15:33.820 --> 01:15:35.820]   How do you make sense of the data?
[01:15:35.820 --> 01:15:38.260]   I mean, what Inside Tracker is doing aside,
[01:15:38.260 --> 01:15:40.320]   how do you personally make sense of the data
[01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:42.660]   in ways that might differ from the way
[01:15:42.660 --> 01:15:45.140]   that a standard MD might look at one of these charts?
[01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:46.900]   Because the standard practice is to say,
[01:15:46.900 --> 01:15:49.320]   is it red, yellow, or green, right?
[01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:52.220]   Is it basically too high or too low?
[01:15:52.220 --> 01:15:56.200]   Is it somewhere close to the margins or are you okay?
[01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:57.900]   Are you in these ranges?
[01:15:57.900 --> 01:16:00.280]   Are there any things that you pay attention to
[01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:02.820]   that you think are particularly interesting
[01:16:02.820 --> 01:16:04.280]   for people to just take note of?
[01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:05.220]   I mean, we're not asking you
[01:16:05.220 --> 01:16:06.920]   to go against anybody's physician.
[01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:07.760]   - Cool.
[01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:11.620]   - But what sorts of things should people
[01:16:11.620 --> 01:16:13.080]   start to educate themselves about
[01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:15.520]   in terms of what these molecules are on their charts
[01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:17.720]   if they choose to get them and what do you look at?
[01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:19.000]   - Yeah.
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.660]   Well, there's a lot there.
[01:16:20.660 --> 01:16:23.840]   The first is that you should be tracking things
[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:25.400]   because one measurement isn't enough.
[01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:27.000]   These things vary and over time.
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.440]   And if you can have a decade or more of data,
[01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:33.760]   it's super informative as you know well know,
[01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:36.020]   as you know.
[01:16:36.020 --> 01:16:38.940]   So the physician, interestingly, my physician,
[01:16:38.940 --> 01:16:40.420]   let's take him as an example.
[01:16:40.420 --> 01:16:46.020]   So he sees me, he says, how are you feeling?
[01:16:46.020 --> 01:16:47.160]   I'm feeling great.
[01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:48.300]   Okay, see you next year.
[01:16:48.300 --> 01:16:49.260]   That's craziness.
[01:16:49.260 --> 01:16:51.000]   Anyway, so I say, okay, stop.
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:52.840]   Let's talk a little bit about-
[01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:53.880]   - Let me educate you.
[01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:55.680]   That's what David tells his physician.
[01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:58.180]   I imagine that the like 12-year-old David Sinclair
[01:16:58.180 --> 01:16:59.680]   says to his physician, listen,
[01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:01.080]   let's have a different discussion.
[01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:01.920]   Is that how it works?
[01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:02.740]   - It is.
[01:17:02.740 --> 01:17:06.120]   - Okay, he finds me pretty annoying as does my dentist.
[01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:08.040]   But so I said, stop, hang on.
[01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:09.760]   I've got this data.
[01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:11.100]   I've got the inside tracker data.
[01:17:11.100 --> 01:17:13.060]   So I pull that up on the screen
[01:17:13.060 --> 01:17:16.960]   and I'm showing him the changes in my cholesterol,
[01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:20.960]   in my CRP, which is inflammatory marker, as you know.
[01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:21.800]   And we're going through it
[01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:23.360]   and you can see things change over time
[01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:25.840]   and I've corrected them as they go slightly out
[01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:27.760]   of the optimal range for me,
[01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:30.000]   which is different than what he would do, of course.
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:33.140]   But what was funny is that he says, this is great.
[01:17:33.140 --> 01:17:36.280]   I love this data, but I'm not allowed to get this
[01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:39.900]   because of course the insurance companies won't pay for it.
[01:17:39.900 --> 01:17:41.900]   So again, you can pay out of pocket.
[01:17:41.900 --> 01:17:43.140]   It's not super expensive.
[01:17:43.140 --> 01:17:48.140]   I would say if you save a bit of money on a coffee,
[01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:50.300]   you can afford this kind of stuff.
[01:17:50.300 --> 01:17:53.580]   But the main point is that doctors do like this data.
[01:17:53.580 --> 01:17:55.840]   It's just that they're unable to spend the money
[01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:58.060]   on every one of their patients to get it.
[01:17:58.060 --> 01:18:00.340]   - Is there a code word that someone can use
[01:18:00.340 --> 01:18:01.940]   with their physician that will trigger
[01:18:01.940 --> 01:18:03.520]   a comprehensive blood test?
[01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:06.000]   I keep trying to figure out what's the code
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.420]   that one needs to ask or tell their doctor,
[01:18:08.420 --> 01:18:12.060]   like I'm feeling blank so that they get a full blood panel.
[01:18:12.060 --> 01:18:13.660]   Well, do you have to be hemorrhaging
[01:18:13.660 --> 01:18:16.060]   from the gut or something?
[01:18:16.060 --> 01:18:18.620]   - Well, I usually use the WTH method,
[01:18:18.620 --> 01:18:19.880]   which is what the hell?
[01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:22.400]   And then he says, okay, we'll do it.
[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:24.100]   - 'Cause I think a lot of people out there are thinking,
[01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:26.780]   look, I'd love to have blood work repeatedly over time,
[01:18:26.780 --> 01:18:29.360]   but that's hard to get for financial reasons,
[01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:30.540]   but also a lot of people just don't know
[01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:32.660]   how to approach the conversation.
[01:18:32.660 --> 01:18:33.500]   And this is one of the things
[01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:36.000]   that I hope that we can educate people on,
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:39.380]   that they deserve to know what's going on inside their body
[01:18:39.380 --> 01:18:42.440]   and that it makes a doctor's visit worthwhile
[01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:46.060]   and that you don't have to feign illness in order to do it.
[01:18:46.060 --> 01:18:47.860]   - Right, yeah, and a lot of people do.
[01:18:47.860 --> 01:18:49.940]   So I would say if you can afford these tests,
[01:18:49.940 --> 01:18:52.020]   there are an increasing number of companies
[01:18:52.020 --> 01:18:53.980]   that offer these tests.
[01:18:53.980 --> 01:18:55.900]   Insight Tracker is one of them.
[01:18:55.900 --> 01:18:59.700]   And you just do it a couple of times a year at a minimum,
[01:18:59.700 --> 01:19:01.800]   and then you can share that with your doctor.
[01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:05.060]   If you can't afford that, then I would say to your doctor,
[01:19:05.060 --> 01:19:09.440]   here are the main ones that Andrew and David do.
[01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:10.420]   - Yeah, they must.
[01:19:10.420 --> 01:19:13.220]   - And there's an email that is something like,
[01:19:13.220 --> 01:19:16.620]   or a phone number rather, it's 555-5555.
[01:19:16.620 --> 01:19:17.900]   I think if they have any complaints,
[01:19:17.900 --> 01:19:19.940]   they can just call that number.
[01:19:19.940 --> 01:19:22.840]   David will pick up on East Coast business hours,
[01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:24.940]   and I'll pick up outside of those hours.
[01:19:24.940 --> 01:19:26.840]   But there were some main ones, I would say.
[01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:29.260]   Your blood sugar levels, you want to do your HbA1c,
[01:19:29.260 --> 01:19:32.260]   which is your average glucose levels over the month.
[01:19:32.260 --> 01:19:35.100]   There's CRP, which I mentioned for inflammation.
[01:19:35.100 --> 01:19:37.020]   - Let's talk about C-reactive protein for a second,
[01:19:37.020 --> 01:19:40.740]   'cause I think it's been shown to be an early marker
[01:19:40.740 --> 01:19:43.500]   of macular degeneration, of heart disease,
[01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:45.360]   of a variety of different things.
[01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:48.940]   CRP is something that we don't hear enough about, I think.
[01:19:48.940 --> 01:19:51.680]   Maybe, what do you know about CRP that I don't?
[01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:53.340]   I'm guessing a lot, but wow.
[01:19:53.340 --> 01:19:55.460]   - Well, it was originally picked up as something
[01:19:55.460 --> 01:19:57.020]   that was associated with heart disease
[01:19:57.020 --> 01:19:59.420]   in the Framingham study, I believe.
[01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:03.540]   It is the best marker for cardiovascular inflammation,
[01:20:03.540 --> 01:20:07.260]   and also we use it as a predictor of longevity.
[01:20:07.260 --> 01:20:12.180]   And its levels go up with mortality.
[01:20:12.180 --> 01:20:14.660]   And so this is an association, but there's enough data
[01:20:14.660 --> 01:20:17.600]   that I would say if you have high levels of CRP,
[01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:20.420]   you need to get your levels down quickly.
[01:20:20.420 --> 01:20:23.140]   And the levels usually go up with age.
[01:20:23.140 --> 01:20:24.580]   And with levels of inflammation.
[01:20:24.580 --> 01:20:28.040]   So the ways to get it down would be to switch the diet,
[01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:30.280]   eat less, try to eat more vegetables,
[01:20:30.280 --> 01:20:31.580]   you'll find it will come down.
[01:20:31.580 --> 01:20:33.720]   There are also drugs that can do it.
[01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:37.260]   Anti-inflammatories can do it as well.
[01:20:37.260 --> 01:20:40.020]   But CRP is, it's actually HCRP.
[01:20:40.020 --> 01:20:41.900]   There's a high-sensitive or HSCRP.
[01:20:41.900 --> 01:20:43.300]   Your doctor will know.
[01:20:43.300 --> 01:20:44.260]   Get one of those readings,
[01:20:44.260 --> 01:20:47.220]   'cause if you've got normal blood sugar levels,
[01:20:47.220 --> 01:20:50.300]   your doctor, or fasting blood sugar levels,
[01:20:50.300 --> 01:20:52.020]   your doctor might say you're fine.
[01:20:52.020 --> 01:20:54.020]   But a lot of people have normal blood sugar,
[01:20:54.020 --> 01:20:58.500]   but have high CRP, which is just as bad for you long-term,
[01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:01.080]   and can predict a future heart attack.
[01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:02.360]   - On the lines of heart attack,
[01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:05.100]   I want your thoughts on cholesterol,
[01:21:05.100 --> 01:21:07.660]   and serum cholesterol, and dietary cholesterol.
[01:21:07.660 --> 01:21:09.920]   I cannot for the life of me
[01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:12.080]   get my arms around this literature.
[01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:16.080]   And even if I ignore all the essentially nonsense
[01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:19.240]   that's out there in various social media groups
[01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:22.700]   saying cholesterol is the worst thing in the world,
[01:21:22.700 --> 01:21:26.060]   or cholesterol is not, or dietary cholesterol
[01:21:26.060 --> 01:21:28.540]   has nothing to do with serum cholesterol
[01:21:28.540 --> 01:21:29.800]   and nothing to do with longevity,
[01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:34.800]   I can't seem to sort through the very basic data
[01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:37.340]   that essentially ask,
[01:21:37.340 --> 01:21:43.060]   is having high levels of LDL going to kill me earlier?
[01:21:43.060 --> 01:21:47.180]   Should I be striving to always reduce LDL and increase HDL?
[01:21:47.180 --> 01:21:48.640]   Is that a reasonable goal?
[01:21:48.640 --> 01:21:52.020]   And if so, is dietary cholesterol
[01:21:52.020 --> 01:21:53.500]   the primary determinant of that?
[01:21:53.500 --> 01:21:56.640]   And just as a final point about this,
[01:21:56.640 --> 01:21:59.780]   I am aware of quite good data that shows that anorexics,
[01:21:59.780 --> 01:22:02.860]   people that essentially eat no food unless you force them to,
[01:22:02.860 --> 01:22:06.900]   can often have very high LDL.
[01:22:06.900 --> 01:22:10.340]   So their dietary cholesterol is essentially zero,
[01:22:10.340 --> 01:22:12.260]   and so they're manufacturing a lot of their own.
[01:22:12.260 --> 01:22:15.860]   So realize this isn't your primary area of expertise,
[01:22:15.860 --> 01:22:17.420]   but you're a smart guy.
[01:22:17.420 --> 01:22:19.720]   You think about this kind of stuff a lot.
[01:22:19.720 --> 01:22:22.100]   What do you think is going on with the cholesterol literature
[01:22:22.100 --> 01:22:24.620]   and will we ever get to the bottom of this
[01:22:24.620 --> 01:22:26.420]   as a scientific and medical community?
[01:22:26.420 --> 01:22:29.180]   Because to me, it is rather perplexing.
[01:22:29.180 --> 01:22:34.600]   - It is, but you can get through the politics.
[01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:35.940]   I know a fair bit about cholesterol
[01:22:35.940 --> 01:22:39.060]   'cause it's in my family history,
[01:22:39.060 --> 01:22:41.580]   and I was headed for an early death.
[01:22:41.580 --> 01:22:43.400]   My grandmother had a stroke at 30.
[01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:46.820]   That's how bad I am in terms of my genetics.
[01:22:46.820 --> 01:22:48.020]   So I went on a statin,
[01:22:48.020 --> 01:22:49.260]   and I know there's a lot of people
[01:22:49.260 --> 01:22:51.380]   who say that statins long-term are bad.
[01:22:51.380 --> 01:22:54.300]   It might, it's associated with Alzheimer's disease.
[01:22:54.300 --> 01:23:00.420]   I've been taking a statin since I was 29,
[01:23:00.420 --> 01:23:02.740]   and that's 'cause I forced my same doctor
[01:23:02.740 --> 01:23:04.320]   to give me the statin.
[01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:06.100]   The conversation was something like this.
[01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:08.340]   You're too young to be on a statin.
[01:23:08.340 --> 01:23:10.180]   I said, what, you want me to have a heart attack
[01:23:10.180 --> 01:23:11.400]   before you give me something?
[01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:12.240]   Give it to me now.
[01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:13.940]   So 29, I've been on a statin,
[01:23:13.940 --> 01:23:16.780]   and my cholesterol was way up beyond 300,
[01:23:16.780 --> 01:23:18.100]   which is a massive, massive,
[01:23:18.100 --> 01:23:20.580]   basically my blood was creamy to look at.
[01:23:20.580 --> 01:23:24.620]   So I've now got my cholesterol down to low, low levels
[01:23:24.620 --> 01:23:25.980]   to what would it be?
[01:23:25.980 --> 01:23:28.140]   You could check on my inside tracker,
[01:23:28.140 --> 01:23:30.500]   but so my ratio of HDL to LDL,
[01:23:30.500 --> 01:23:33.100]   which you want to be less than five, is now two,
[01:23:33.100 --> 01:23:36.300]   and the LDL is below 100, so it's all good.
[01:23:36.300 --> 01:23:39.300]   And I've measured my cardiovascular health with an MRI.
[01:23:39.300 --> 01:23:41.340]   I've got a movie of my heart beating.
[01:23:41.340 --> 01:23:43.400]   I've still got a heart of a 20-year-old.
[01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:45.380]   So that's working.
[01:23:45.380 --> 01:23:46.780]   I'm willing to forego the risk
[01:23:46.780 --> 01:23:48.660]   that the statin is causing problems later
[01:23:48.660 --> 01:23:51.740]   because of my family history, but other people,
[01:23:51.740 --> 01:23:56.740]   I would say be aware that statins aren't perfect drugs.
[01:23:56.740 --> 01:23:58.380]   There are some interesting new ones.
[01:23:58.380 --> 01:24:00.780]   There's one called the PSK-9 inhibitor,
[01:24:00.780 --> 01:24:04.360]   which is I think fortnightly, every two weeks, injection.
[01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:08.040]   That blocks the release of LDL from the liver.
[01:24:08.040 --> 01:24:13.220]   And then that seems to be great for lowering cholesterol,
[01:24:13.220 --> 01:24:17.340]   but also has other benefits that might be pro-longevity.
[01:24:17.340 --> 01:24:20.340]   And there were some people that I was just talking to
[01:24:20.340 --> 01:24:21.860]   are on the cutting edge of this,
[01:24:21.860 --> 01:24:23.900]   and their doctors are trying them on this drug
[01:24:23.900 --> 01:24:25.760]   instead of the statin.
[01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:28.260]   So you could talk to your doctor about that.
[01:24:28.260 --> 01:24:32.740]   - Do you avoid dietary cholesterol for that reason also?
[01:24:32.740 --> 01:24:34.040]   Red meat, butter.
[01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:35.300]   I mean, I happen to love butter.
[01:24:35.300 --> 01:24:36.980]   I love red meat.
[01:24:36.980 --> 01:24:39.720]   I realize there's some people who don't.
[01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:40.920]   My cholesterol is a little bit high,
[01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:43.460]   but I'm working to bring that down a bit,
[01:24:43.460 --> 01:24:46.660]   although not by altering my food intake yet.
[01:24:46.660 --> 01:24:49.340]   But what do you think is the relationship
[01:24:49.340 --> 01:24:51.740]   between dietary cholesterol and serum cholesterol?
[01:24:51.740 --> 01:24:53.480]   And what's going on with the liver?
[01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:57.500]   Why are anorexics, why is their serum cholesterol so high
[01:24:57.500 --> 01:24:58.440]   when they're eating nothing?
[01:24:58.440 --> 01:25:00.160]   - Yeah, well, there've been a number of papers
[01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:02.040]   over the years that have been ignored.
[01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:06.260]   And our friend Peter Atiyah brought to my attention recently
[01:25:06.260 --> 01:25:09.140]   a new study that I think definitively said
[01:25:09.140 --> 01:25:12.460]   that dietary cholesterol has almost zero impact
[01:25:12.460 --> 01:25:13.800]   on blood cholesterol levels.
[01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:14.640]   - Good.
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:17.200]   - Yeah, so I'm annoyed,
[01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:19.240]   'cause I've been avoiding eggs and butter
[01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:22.140]   for most of my life, and I didn't have to.
[01:25:22.140 --> 01:25:26.260]   - So I have eggs plenty of time, or at least in your case.
[01:25:26.260 --> 01:25:28.640]   - Yeah, yeah, so that's the thing.
[01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:31.680]   You can eat these foods that were once banned,
[01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:34.620]   because it's very difficult to take cholesterol up
[01:25:34.620 --> 01:25:36.140]   into the body from the gut,
[01:25:36.140 --> 01:25:38.440]   and most of it's being synthesized in the body.
[01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:41.160]   - Wow, I'm just pausing there for a second,
[01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:45.920]   because I think that it's what we've been told,
[01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:49.840]   six meals a day, eat a lot of grains and fruits
[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:54.840]   and this kind of thing, avoid cholesterol.
[01:25:54.840 --> 01:25:58.880]   I mean, basically everything we learned in the '80s and '90s
[01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:01.940]   and early 2000s is getting flipped on its head now.
[01:26:01.940 --> 01:26:07.840]   But, and I think this is a very strong caveat
[01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:09.380]   that's important to mention.
[01:26:09.380 --> 01:26:14.000]   Amino acids, in particular the amino acids
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:17.200]   that come from animal products, right?
[01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:21.240]   Seem to have some pro-aging effect on them, right?
[01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:24.720]   At least the way that I've heard you describe your diet.
[01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:27.840]   And I'm somebody who enjoys meat, I like it.
[01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:31.160]   But, so I'm by no means a vegan at all.
[01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:34.800]   But I've heard you say you eat mostly plants,
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.160]   but a little bit of fish or chicken
[01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:40.640]   or something of that sort, or eggs or...
[01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:43.520]   But is that specifically to avoid
[01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:45.160]   excessive amino acid intake?
[01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:46.960]   Or is it something specific about plants
[01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:50.080]   that excites you with respect to...
[01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:52.100]   I mean, vegetables are delicious too.
[01:26:52.100 --> 01:26:52.940]   But what is it?
[01:26:52.940 --> 01:26:54.060]   Is it something great about plants?
[01:26:54.060 --> 01:26:55.500]   Or is it something bad about...
[01:26:55.500 --> 01:26:56.440]   When I think of meat,
[01:26:56.440 --> 01:26:59.400]   I guess the biologist in me thinks amino acids, right?
[01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:01.760]   I don't think top sirloin, I think amino acid.
[01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:03.300]   No, I think top sirloin as I'm eating it,
[01:27:03.300 --> 01:27:05.760]   but really what they are are amino acids,
[01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:07.220]   including leucine.
[01:27:07.220 --> 01:27:08.400]   - Yeah.
[01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:10.680]   Well, there are two good things about plants
[01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:13.800]   and neither of them is taste for me.
[01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:15.680]   I would eat steak all the time if I could.
[01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:18.480]   I did when I was a kid, I'm an Australian.
[01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:19.740]   But plants have two benefits.
[01:27:19.740 --> 01:27:22.800]   One is that they're highly nutritious
[01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:26.520]   and they'll give you a lot of the vitamins
[01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:28.060]   and nutrients that I need.
[01:27:28.060 --> 01:27:29.300]   I don't take a multivitamin.
[01:27:29.300 --> 01:27:32.200]   I don't want to have the excess iron in my body.
[01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:34.160]   So there's that high density nutrition.
[01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:37.660]   So those dark leaves, if it's a spinach salad, great.
[01:27:37.660 --> 01:27:41.360]   Second is that there is what's called
[01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:44.360]   xenohormatic molecules in plants.
[01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:46.960]   That term xenohormesis is a term
[01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:51.160]   that I came up with my friend Conrad Howitz,
[01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:54.680]   which means stressed plants make molecules
[01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:56.220]   that benefit your health.
[01:27:56.220 --> 01:27:57.120]   I'll break it down.
[01:27:57.120 --> 01:27:59.820]   Xeno means between species and hormesis
[01:27:59.820 --> 01:28:01.160]   is the term whatever doesn't kill you
[01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:03.900]   makes you stronger and live longer.
[01:28:03.900 --> 01:28:07.600]   And the idea is that when plants are stressed out,
[01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:09.600]   think of a grapevine that's dried out
[01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:11.180]   and they're starting to harvest the grapes,
[01:28:11.180 --> 01:28:13.160]   which is typically how it's done.
[01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:14.520]   They are full with resveratrol
[01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:17.920]   because resveratrol is a plant defense molecule
[01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:19.800]   that I think is made to activate
[01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:21.480]   those sirtuin genes in a plant.
[01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:24.200]   So plants have sirtuins just like we do.
[01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:27.000]   But by purifying or at least concentrating
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:30.920]   in a light proof bottle and keeping it out of the air,
[01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:33.600]   we stabilize the xenohormatic molecule
[01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:36.900]   or it's a cocktail, not just one, there's others in wine.
[01:28:36.900 --> 01:28:39.680]   We then ingest those and get the benefits
[01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:41.200]   of activating our own defenses
[01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:43.540]   because our food was getting stressed out.
[01:28:43.540 --> 01:28:45.580]   And by stressed, I don't mean psychologically stressed,
[01:28:45.580 --> 01:28:47.460]   I mean biologically stressed.
[01:28:47.460 --> 01:28:49.520]   And so I try to eat plants
[01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:51.800]   that have gone through a bit of stress.
[01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:53.120]   They might be brightly colored,
[01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:56.160]   they've had too much sun or got nibbled on by a caterpillar.
[01:28:56.160 --> 01:29:00.360]   So you go to places where it's organic or it's fresh, local,
[01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:01.860]   and those are the plants that aren't perfect
[01:29:01.860 --> 01:29:03.200]   and they probably have high concentrations
[01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:04.040]   of these molecules.
[01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:06.640]   And in addition, I also buy the supplements
[01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:08.640]   to make sure I'm getting enough of those as well.
[01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:09.920]   - Which supplements mimic that?
[01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:11.080]   - Well, so resveratrol will,
[01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:13.480]   there's another one called chrysitin or chrysitin,
[01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:14.600]   some people call it,
[01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:18.480]   which you find in trace amounts in apples and onions.
[01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:20.720]   And we also showed back in 2003
[01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:23.240]   that it activates sirtuins as well.
[01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:25.720]   But others have 20 years later found
[01:29:25.720 --> 01:29:28.520]   that it kills senescent cells
[01:29:28.520 --> 01:29:30.680]   or helps kill senescent cells.
[01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:33.520]   So it's a double whammy with that molecule.
[01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:35.560]   - And are you actively picking out the peaches
[01:29:35.560 --> 01:29:38.700]   that look like they were nibbled on by a caterpillar?
[01:29:38.700 --> 01:29:43.320]   - No, but I don't worry if they've been banged up a bit.
[01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:45.260]   - What's the story with antioxidants?
[01:29:45.260 --> 01:29:46.940]   Are they of any value whatsoever?
[01:29:46.940 --> 01:29:50.300]   Because the way that you described them at the beginning
[01:29:50.300 --> 01:29:51.880]   and what I've heard recently
[01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:56.160]   is that they are not all the rage for anti-aging.
[01:29:56.160 --> 01:29:58.820]   What are they doing that's useful?
[01:29:58.820 --> 01:30:02.200]   Should we be seeking out antioxidants anyway
[01:30:02.200 --> 01:30:04.600]   for other cellular health purposes?
[01:30:04.600 --> 01:30:06.700]   - Well, yeah, antioxidants are not going to hurt you
[01:30:06.700 --> 01:30:08.360]   unless you take mega doses.
[01:30:08.360 --> 01:30:12.100]   We do need some oxidants for our immune system.
[01:30:12.100 --> 01:30:14.200]   And there's even what's called mitohormesis,
[01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:16.240]   which is your mitochondria power packs
[01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:18.540]   need to have a little bit of these free radicals
[01:30:18.540 --> 01:30:19.860]   to be able to function.
[01:30:19.860 --> 01:30:23.520]   So you don't want to overdose on these antioxidants,
[01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:26.800]   vitamin C, vitamin E, don't overdo it.
[01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:28.520]   - You don't take a multivitamin, correct?
[01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:29.800]   - Right.
[01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:31.860]   - I think I'm going to stop after this conversation
[01:30:31.860 --> 01:30:33.100]   'cause I've always just taken one
[01:30:33.100 --> 01:30:34.640]   for the kind of insurance purpose,
[01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:38.480]   which is a stupid purpose, not actual insurance,
[01:30:38.480 --> 01:30:40.520]   but just thinking, oh, you know,
[01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:42.880]   I'll top off on my ACBD.
[01:30:42.880 --> 01:30:45.160]   - Right, and I'll pee out what I don't need.
[01:30:45.160 --> 01:30:46.640]   - Right, but that never bothered me.
[01:30:46.640 --> 01:30:48.440]   The whole expensive pee thing never got,
[01:30:48.440 --> 01:30:50.620]   that argument never got me
[01:30:50.620 --> 01:30:53.760]   because a good vitamin is not that expensive.
[01:30:53.760 --> 01:30:56.400]   I just figured better safe than sorry,
[01:30:56.400 --> 01:30:58.840]   but it may be that it's detrimental.
[01:30:58.840 --> 01:31:00.760]   - Well, it can in the case of iron,
[01:31:00.760 --> 01:31:02.700]   as we discussed in the antioxidants.
[01:31:02.700 --> 01:31:07.640]   So when I came into the aging field in the early 1990s,
[01:31:07.640 --> 01:31:09.120]   it was all about antioxidants.
[01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:12.540]   And we thought that enzymes by the name of catalase
[01:31:12.540 --> 01:31:13.880]   and superoxide dismutase
[01:31:13.880 --> 01:31:16.500]   were going to be the key to longevity.
[01:31:16.500 --> 01:31:18.940]   It turns out that it's largely been a failure
[01:31:18.940 --> 01:31:23.800]   that giving animals and humans antioxidants
[01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:27.500]   haven't had the longevity benefits that we dreamed of.
[01:31:27.500 --> 01:31:31.440]   And the main reason is that there's a lot more going on
[01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:33.080]   than just free radical damage.
[01:31:33.080 --> 01:31:35.720]   The epigenome gets disrupted.
[01:31:35.720 --> 01:31:37.480]   We've got these proteins misfolding.
[01:31:37.480 --> 01:31:42.080]   So the problem really has been that we didn't realize
[01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:45.560]   that you need to turn on the body's natural defenses
[01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:47.880]   against that plus a whole host of other things
[01:31:47.880 --> 01:31:50.120]   to get the true benefits.
[01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:51.360]   But I'm not going to say it's a problem
[01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:53.920]   taking an antioxidant drink.
[01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:56.000]   Pomegranate juice for one is full of good stuff,
[01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.540]   including xenohormatic molecules.
[01:31:58.540 --> 01:32:00.880]   But resveratrol is a good case in point,
[01:32:00.880 --> 01:32:03.360]   which is when I worked on resveratrol
[01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:05.080]   as a longevity molecule,
[01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:07.920]   first we showed it in yeast and worms and flies and mice.
[01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:11.640]   Before that, it was thought that resveratrol
[01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:13.760]   was good for your heart in red wine
[01:32:13.760 --> 01:32:16.740]   when you drink red wine because it's an antioxidant.
[01:32:16.740 --> 01:32:18.880]   So then we showed that it extended the lifespan
[01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:23.880]   of yeast cells through this genetic pathway, the sirtuins.
[01:32:23.880 --> 01:32:28.440]   And we then tested whether resveratrol,
[01:32:28.440 --> 01:32:31.880]   if we changed one atom to make it not an antioxidant,
[01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:33.640]   guess what, it still worked fine.
[01:32:33.640 --> 01:32:35.500]   So it wasn't its antioxidant activity
[01:32:35.500 --> 01:32:36.560]   that was extending lifespan.
[01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:38.980]   It was its ability to turn on the yeast's defenses
[01:32:38.980 --> 01:32:40.140]   against aging.
[01:32:40.140 --> 01:32:42.760]   Conversely, when we gave the yeast antioxidants,
[01:32:42.760 --> 01:32:44.520]   they looked shorter.
[01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:46.880]   So yeah, that was the beginning of my transformation
[01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:49.040]   into thinking, turn on the body's defenses,
[01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:50.800]   don't give it the antioxidants.
[01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:53.200]   - This is an opportunity for me to say
[01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:55.660]   something that I've been wanting to say for a long time,
[01:32:55.660 --> 01:32:58.640]   which is that what's so wonderful about science
[01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:01.520]   is that because the goal is mechanism,
[01:33:01.520 --> 01:33:04.320]   you can really start to understand, as you just described,
[01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:08.440]   what actually mediates a process is very different
[01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:10.020]   than what modulates a process.
[01:33:10.020 --> 01:33:12.160]   I mean, if a fire alarm goes off in the building right now,
[01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:13.980]   it's going to modulate our attention.
[01:33:13.980 --> 01:33:16.440]   That doesn't mean that it controls our attention.
[01:33:16.440 --> 01:33:18.320]   It's not mechanistically relevant.
[01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:20.160]   And so I think this thing about antioxidants
[01:33:20.160 --> 01:33:22.440]   is one of these cases, it sounds like,
[01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:24.840]   where it's in the right ballpark,
[01:33:24.840 --> 01:33:27.720]   but until one really unveils the mechanism as you have,
[01:33:27.720 --> 01:33:32.720]   you can be, one can or a field can be badly wrong
[01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:34.480]   for a very long period of time.
[01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:38.040]   It sounds like the sirtuins and really getting down
[01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:41.400]   to the guts of the machinery of what causes cells to age
[01:33:41.400 --> 01:33:43.400]   is really what it's about.
[01:33:43.400 --> 01:33:48.000]   Zooming way out, what are the behavioral tools
[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:49.720]   that one can start to think about
[01:33:49.720 --> 01:33:52.420]   in terms of ways to modulate these,
[01:33:52.420 --> 01:33:55.120]   basically the way that DNA is being expressed
[01:33:55.120 --> 01:33:56.460]   and functioning?
[01:33:56.460 --> 01:34:00.680]   I've heard you talk before about hormesis of other sorts,
[01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:01.960]   cold exposure.
[01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:03.460]   We talked about fasting.
[01:34:03.460 --> 01:34:05.560]   We talked about exercise in broad terms,
[01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:10.560]   but what about any evidence, if it exists,
[01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:14.320]   as to whether or not aerobic training versus weight training,
[01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:16.060]   these sorts of things?
[01:34:16.060 --> 01:34:17.600]   In other words, what are the sorts of things
[01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:21.320]   that people can do to improve the sirtuin pathway?
[01:34:21.320 --> 01:34:23.260]   And I realize that they're caveats.
[01:34:23.260 --> 01:34:25.440]   We can't go directly from a behavior to sirtuins,
[01:34:25.440 --> 01:34:28.400]   but in the general theme, what can people do?
[01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:29.340]   What do you do?
[01:34:29.340 --> 01:34:30.180]   - Right.
[01:34:30.180 --> 01:34:33.640]   Well, we know that aerobic exercise in mice and rats
[01:34:33.640 --> 01:34:37.000]   raises their NAD levels and their levels of,
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.880]   one of the genes goes up to actually number one
[01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:41.200]   and number three.
[01:34:41.200 --> 01:34:44.960]   What we don't know yet is what type of exercise
[01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:47.600]   is optimal to get them to change.
[01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:49.220]   We will learn, we're doing work.
[01:34:49.220 --> 01:34:50.840]   Now it's revealed that we're doing work
[01:34:50.840 --> 01:34:52.580]   with the military in the US
[01:34:52.580 --> 01:34:55.040]   to try and understand that kind of thing.
[01:34:55.040 --> 01:34:57.200]   And I'll always tell you and the public,
[01:34:57.200 --> 01:35:00.380]   when I don't know something, I'm not gonna extrapolate.
[01:35:00.380 --> 01:35:02.120]   But what do I do?
[01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:05.120]   I base my exercise on the scientific literature,
[01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:08.800]   which has shown that maintaining muscle mass
[01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:10.880]   is very important for a number of reasons.
[01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:12.760]   The two main ones are,
[01:35:12.760 --> 01:35:14.280]   you wanna maintain your hormone levels.
[01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:17.080]   I'm an older male losing my testosterone
[01:35:17.080 --> 01:35:18.900]   and muscle mass over time.
[01:35:18.900 --> 01:35:23.220]   And by exercising, I will maintain that and have.
[01:35:23.220 --> 01:35:26.080]   In fact, I probably haven't had a body like this
[01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:26.920]   since I was 20.
[01:35:26.920 --> 01:35:30.320]   So that's one of the benefits of having this lifestyle.
[01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:31.160]   - Sorry to interrupt you.
[01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:33.560]   You know, we did an episode on hormones
[01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:35.500]   and there are data in humans that show
[01:35:35.500 --> 01:35:39.940]   that there are some males in their 80s and 90s
[01:35:39.940 --> 01:35:41.860]   where their testosterone is equivalent
[01:35:41.860 --> 01:35:44.580]   to the average of 25 and 30 year olds.
[01:35:44.580 --> 01:35:45.860]   I can get you that information.
[01:35:45.860 --> 01:35:48.300]   It is really impressive studies.
[01:35:48.300 --> 01:35:51.180]   Unfortunately, they didn't include a lot of information
[01:35:51.180 --> 01:35:52.820]   about the lifestyle factors, et cetera.
[01:35:52.820 --> 01:35:55.660]   But this idea that testosterone goes down with age,
[01:35:55.660 --> 01:35:59.660]   it might be the trend,
[01:35:59.660 --> 01:36:02.380]   but it's not necessarily a prerequisite.
[01:36:03.860 --> 01:36:06.580]   - Right, I believe in naturally increasing
[01:36:06.580 --> 01:36:08.060]   and maintaining these hormone levels.
[01:36:08.060 --> 01:36:10.700]   And I've been measuring them for a long time.
[01:36:10.700 --> 01:36:11.780]   And I could see for me,
[01:36:11.780 --> 01:36:14.100]   my testosterone levels were steadily,
[01:36:14.100 --> 01:36:15.140]   levels were going down.
[01:36:15.140 --> 01:36:18.100]   - And then you got tenure and they went back up again.
[01:36:18.100 --> 01:36:23.100]   - No, I actually became complacent and it was the worst.
[01:36:23.100 --> 01:36:26.660]   Actually, my age changed in the wrong direction after that
[01:36:26.660 --> 01:36:30.120]   'cause I was relaxed and not worried about the future.
[01:36:30.120 --> 01:36:33.140]   But then I got serious and I actually,
[01:36:33.140 --> 01:36:35.180]   according to the inside track algorithm,
[01:36:35.180 --> 01:36:40.180]   got my age down from 58 to 31 in a matter of months.
[01:36:40.180 --> 01:36:41.820]   That was a big drop.
[01:36:41.820 --> 01:36:43.420]   And I've been getting steadily younger
[01:36:43.420 --> 01:36:44.660]   over the last 10 years,
[01:36:44.660 --> 01:36:46.500]   according to that measurement, the blood tests.
[01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:47.420]   - What about estrogen?
[01:36:47.420 --> 01:36:50.760]   Because women are different in the sense that they do,
[01:36:50.760 --> 01:36:56.020]   the number of eggs and the ovaries change over time, right?
[01:36:56.020 --> 01:36:58.900]   Do you think that they can maintain estrogen levels
[01:36:58.900 --> 01:37:01.620]   over longer periods of time
[01:37:01.620 --> 01:37:03.300]   using some of these same protocols?
[01:37:03.300 --> 01:37:06.600]   - Well, yeah, I get into trouble from a certain university
[01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:08.920]   when I talk about this too much.
[01:37:08.920 --> 01:37:10.220]   - About estrogen?
[01:37:10.220 --> 01:37:14.540]   - Just about fertility and long story.
[01:37:14.540 --> 01:37:18.740]   I don't want to get too much into the anecdotes,
[01:37:18.740 --> 01:37:19.740]   but I'll tell you the science,
[01:37:19.740 --> 01:37:24.520]   which is that if you take a mouse
[01:37:24.520 --> 01:37:27.700]   and put it on fasting or caloric restriction
[01:37:27.700 --> 01:37:31.780]   for up until the point where it should be infertile,
[01:37:31.780 --> 01:37:33.460]   so that's about it at a year of age,
[01:37:33.460 --> 01:37:35.180]   a mouse gets infertile, a female mouse.
[01:37:35.180 --> 01:37:38.140]   - Due to fasting or simply to aging?
[01:37:38.140 --> 01:37:39.920]   - Due to aging, due to aging.
[01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:42.800]   The fasting, it's not an extreme fast,
[01:37:42.800 --> 01:37:44.720]   it's just less calories.
[01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:47.320]   Then you put them back on a regular food
[01:37:47.320 --> 01:37:49.220]   and they become fertile again
[01:37:49.220 --> 01:37:51.500]   for many, many months afterwards.
[01:37:51.500 --> 01:37:55.100]   So the effect on slowing down aging
[01:37:55.100 --> 01:37:57.020]   is also on the reproductive system.
[01:37:57.020 --> 01:37:58.060]   - Interesting.
[01:37:58.060 --> 01:38:00.240]   - And so I wouldn't say to any woman,
[01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:02.660]   I wouldn't think that they should become super skinny
[01:38:02.660 --> 01:38:04.160]   to try and preserve fertility.
[01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:05.500]   That's not what I'm saying.
[01:38:05.500 --> 01:38:07.220]   But these pathways that we work on,
[01:38:07.220 --> 01:38:10.420]   these sirtuins are known to delay infertility
[01:38:10.420 --> 01:38:12.140]   in female animals.
[01:38:12.140 --> 01:38:15.140]   Case in point, I'm one of the lead authors on a paper
[01:38:15.140 --> 01:38:16.660]   where we used NMN.
[01:38:16.660 --> 01:38:18.740]   Remember, this is the gas, the fuel,
[01:38:18.740 --> 01:38:20.420]   the petrol for the sirtuins.
[01:38:20.420 --> 01:38:26.340]   We gave old mice, one group of mice was 16 months old.
[01:38:27.260 --> 01:38:30.300]   Remember, they came in fertile at 12.
[01:38:30.300 --> 01:38:34.820]   Gave them NMN, and I think it was only six weeks later,
[01:38:34.820 --> 01:38:37.420]   they had offspring.
[01:38:37.420 --> 01:38:38.740]   They became fertile again,
[01:38:38.740 --> 01:38:42.020]   which goes against biology, a textbook biology,
[01:38:42.020 --> 01:38:45.380]   which is that female mammals run out of eggs.
[01:38:45.380 --> 01:38:47.420]   Turns out that's not true.
[01:38:47.420 --> 01:38:50.500]   You can rejuvenate the female reproductive system
[01:38:50.500 --> 01:38:53.300]   and even get them to come out of mouseopause,
[01:38:53.300 --> 01:38:54.660]   as we call it.
[01:38:54.660 --> 01:38:57.540]   So that's a whole new paradigm in biology as well.
[01:38:57.540 --> 01:38:58.780]   - That's super interesting.
[01:38:58.780 --> 01:38:59.620]   Sorry to interrupt you,
[01:38:59.620 --> 01:39:02.300]   but I'm reminded of a set of studies
[01:39:02.300 --> 01:39:04.540]   that were done by your former colleagues,
[01:39:04.540 --> 01:39:05.380]   'cause they're no longer there,
[01:39:05.380 --> 01:39:06.820]   David Hubel and Torrance and Wiesel,
[01:39:06.820 --> 01:39:08.200]   my scientific great-grandparents,
[01:39:08.200 --> 01:39:10.160]   won the Nobel Prize for discovering
[01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:11.980]   what are called critical periods,
[01:39:11.980 --> 01:39:13.380]   this phase of early development
[01:39:13.380 --> 01:39:16.080]   when the brain is extremely plastic.
[01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:18.300]   And a big part of their work was to show
[01:39:18.300 --> 01:39:20.880]   that after a certain point, the critical period shuts down.
[01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:22.420]   Essentially, the brain can't change,
[01:39:22.420 --> 01:39:24.700]   or not nearly as much.
[01:39:24.700 --> 01:39:25.860]   And then people came along later
[01:39:25.860 --> 01:39:27.100]   and showed that you could open up
[01:39:27.100 --> 01:39:29.580]   these critical periods again, but very briefly,
[01:39:29.580 --> 01:39:34.180]   and it takes a very specific stimulus, essentially,
[01:39:34.180 --> 01:39:36.400]   high degrees of focus, et cetera.
[01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:40.340]   However, there's a well-known phenomenon in this literature
[01:39:40.340 --> 01:39:44.380]   where if you take an animal, and to some degree,
[01:39:44.380 --> 01:39:46.900]   this has been shown in humans as well,
[01:39:46.900 --> 01:39:49.860]   and you let them pass through the critical period,
[01:39:49.860 --> 01:39:52.760]   but then you essentially sensory deprive them.
[01:39:52.760 --> 01:39:56.220]   You take away experience, you close both eyes.
[01:39:56.220 --> 01:39:58.980]   You essentially reopen the critical period.
[01:39:58.980 --> 01:40:01.220]   So it seems like, and I couldn't help but mention this,
[01:40:01.220 --> 01:40:03.560]   that there's this parallel between what we're talking about
[01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:05.980]   here with fertility and neuroplasticity where,
[01:40:05.980 --> 01:40:09.180]   yes, there's a timer where certain things are available
[01:40:09.180 --> 01:40:10.980]   to the organism early in life,
[01:40:10.980 --> 01:40:12.520]   and then they tend to taper off.
[01:40:12.520 --> 01:40:14.680]   It's not an open and shut, but they taper off.
[01:40:14.680 --> 01:40:18.140]   But then a deprivation can actually reactivate
[01:40:18.140 --> 01:40:21.220]   the availability of that process.
[01:40:21.220 --> 01:40:22.820]   Forgive me, I just couldn't help but mention it,
[01:40:22.820 --> 01:40:26.460]   but to me, both of those things are associated with youth,
[01:40:26.460 --> 01:40:28.260]   fertility and neuroplasticity.
[01:40:28.260 --> 01:40:30.620]   And so I think that it'd be so interesting,
[01:40:30.620 --> 01:40:32.080]   I'd love to collaborate with you on this,
[01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:35.020]   to explore how neuroplasticity might actually be regulated
[01:40:35.020 --> 01:40:37.480]   by these things like the sirtuins.
[01:40:37.480 --> 01:40:40.780]   - Right, and the sirtuins do control memory
[01:40:40.780 --> 01:40:41.940]   in neurons as well.
[01:40:41.940 --> 01:40:44.220]   So what I think is really interesting
[01:40:44.220 --> 01:40:46.760]   is that what we're learning from work
[01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:48.180]   that you and your colleagues have done
[01:40:48.180 --> 01:40:49.760]   and in my life as well,
[01:40:49.760 --> 01:40:52.840]   is that the body has remarkable powers of healing
[01:40:52.840 --> 01:40:56.820]   and recovering from illness and injury.
[01:40:56.820 --> 01:40:58.880]   And what we once thought was a one-way street
[01:40:58.880 --> 01:41:01.120]   and you just can't repair,
[01:41:01.120 --> 01:41:04.580]   you can't get over these diseases, you can reset the system.
[01:41:04.580 --> 01:41:06.920]   And the body can really get rejuvenated in ways
[01:41:06.920 --> 01:41:08.400]   that in the future we'll wonder,
[01:41:08.400 --> 01:41:10.440]   why didn't we work on this earlier?
[01:41:10.440 --> 01:41:13.560]   The future of humanity is more like us
[01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:15.080]   walking around like Deadpool.
[01:41:15.080 --> 01:41:18.080]   We'll probably be cleaner and we won't smell as badly,
[01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:21.080]   but Deadpool, if you don't know,
[01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:22.520]   can get injured and just recover.
[01:41:22.520 --> 01:41:24.800]   It's very hard to injure this guy
[01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:26.720]   and we're gonna be the same.
[01:41:26.720 --> 01:41:28.840]   There are many species, you cut off the limb,
[01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:29.680]   the limb grows back.
[01:41:29.680 --> 01:41:31.280]   - Salamanders, yeah.
[01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:33.960]   - We are now learning how to tap into that system.
[01:41:33.960 --> 01:41:35.360]   And in part, what we're doing
[01:41:35.360 --> 01:41:38.160]   is reversing the age of those cells
[01:41:38.160 --> 01:41:41.160]   and telling them how to read the genes correctly again,
[01:41:41.160 --> 01:41:43.840]   reversing the age of that epigenome.
[01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:46.920]   And when you do that, the cells, the brain, for instance,
[01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:50.120]   the skin, we did the optic nerve.
[01:41:50.120 --> 01:41:51.800]   - Now let's talk about those results for a second.
[01:41:51.800 --> 01:41:53.040]   Then I want to make sure that we return
[01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:54.720]   to some of these behavioral protocols.
[01:41:54.720 --> 01:41:56.800]   You had this amazing paper at the end of last year,
[01:41:56.800 --> 01:42:00.100]   cover article, full article in Nature,
[01:42:00.100 --> 01:42:03.240]   showing that essentially a small menu
[01:42:03.240 --> 01:42:05.440]   of transcription factors,
[01:42:05.440 --> 01:42:07.820]   which control gene expression, et cetera,
[01:42:07.820 --> 01:42:11.800]   could essentially reverse the age of neurons in the eye
[01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:14.940]   and rescue those cells against damage,
[01:42:14.940 --> 01:42:18.760]   essentially allow blind mice to see again
[01:42:18.760 --> 01:42:21.560]   and offset degeneration of these retinal cells.
[01:42:21.560 --> 01:42:26.560]   Incredible paper and such a boon to the field.
[01:42:26.560 --> 01:42:30.100]   Where does that stand now in terms of human clinical trials?
[01:42:30.100 --> 01:42:32.660]   I mean, what are you envisioning
[01:42:32.660 --> 01:42:35.240]   in terms of the trajectory of those data
[01:42:35.240 --> 01:42:38.640]   from mice into humans someday?
[01:42:38.640 --> 01:42:43.480]   - Right. Well, to get to the point immediately,
[01:42:43.480 --> 01:42:48.480]   we're going to be testing the treatment on monkeys,
[01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:50.800]   just for safety reasons.
[01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:55.160]   And then the first patient should be done sometime in 2022,
[01:42:55.160 --> 01:42:58.560]   early 2023, and we're going to try to recover blindness.
[01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:00.320]   - This involves making an injection
[01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:02.680]   of a virus into the eye, right?
[01:43:02.680 --> 01:43:05.280]   Right now, there's no way that I am aware of
[01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:06.980]   to manipulate these transcription factors
[01:43:06.980 --> 01:43:08.720]   through a pill or some other.
[01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:10.480]   - That's what we're working on in my lab
[01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:11.760]   at Harvard right now.
[01:43:11.760 --> 01:43:13.480]   So it will be- - Pill-based modulation
[01:43:13.480 --> 01:43:15.000]   of transcription factors. - It will be a proper pill
[01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:16.960]   and the whole body gets rejuvenated by 20 years.
[01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:18.440]   That's what we're aiming for.
[01:43:18.440 --> 01:43:23.100]   Now we do it with gene therapy in the eye and other places.
[01:43:23.100 --> 01:43:25.760]   So in the eye, yes, it's single injection.
[01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:29.160]   The genes go into the retina and we can turn it on
[01:43:29.160 --> 01:43:31.240]   with a drug called doxycycline.
[01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:34.680]   And we do that in the mice for four to eight weeks.
[01:43:34.680 --> 01:43:36.160]   Then the eye gets younger.
[01:43:36.160 --> 01:43:38.620]   We can measure that 'cause we can measure the clock.
[01:43:38.620 --> 01:43:41.780]   And then the vision comes back in those mice.
[01:43:41.780 --> 01:43:44.860]   And I don't see any reason why it shouldn't work in people
[01:43:44.860 --> 01:43:47.500]   because it's the same structures and mechanisms
[01:43:47.500 --> 01:43:49.860]   that are on in the human as well.
[01:43:49.860 --> 01:43:51.520]   Now these- - And it's one injection.
[01:43:51.520 --> 01:43:53.580]   As you mentioned, injections into the eye,
[01:43:53.580 --> 01:43:55.060]   obviously nobody should do this
[01:43:55.060 --> 01:43:57.040]   outside of an ophthalmology clinic.
[01:43:57.040 --> 01:44:00.080]   And they're definitely by an ophthalmologist.
[01:44:00.080 --> 01:44:03.660]   But the injections into the eye are painless
[01:44:03.660 --> 01:44:05.460]   if done correctly by the right person.
[01:44:05.460 --> 01:44:07.380]   It sounds dreadful, but it's actually,
[01:44:07.380 --> 01:44:09.260]   I've seen it done hundreds of times.
[01:44:09.260 --> 01:44:13.200]   I've done it thousands of times and it's not to myself,
[01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:14.720]   but to other creatures.
[01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:15.840]   And there's a way of doing this
[01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:17.540]   that's completely painless to the person.
[01:44:17.540 --> 01:44:18.380]   - Oh, there are a few.
[01:44:18.380 --> 01:44:20.260]   It's a tiny, tiny needle too.
[01:44:20.260 --> 01:44:21.300]   But the great thing about this
[01:44:21.300 --> 01:44:22.820]   is that it's a one-time treatment.
[01:44:22.820 --> 01:44:24.260]   Those genes go into the back of the eye
[01:44:24.260 --> 01:44:27.460]   and stay there forever.
[01:44:27.460 --> 01:44:29.840]   And you can just turn them on whenever you want.
[01:44:29.840 --> 01:44:32.380]   So what we've found is you can turn them on in the mice,
[01:44:32.380 --> 01:44:35.420]   they get their vision back, and then you turn it off again.
[01:44:35.420 --> 01:44:39.540]   And so far, many months out, the benefit has remained.
[01:44:39.540 --> 01:44:42.220]   But if it does decline, we'll just turn it back on
[01:44:42.220 --> 01:44:45.140]   and reset the system, rinse and repeat.
[01:44:45.140 --> 01:44:46.340]   So one day, what's exciting
[01:44:46.340 --> 01:44:49.340]   is that we could potentially do this across the entire body
[01:44:49.340 --> 01:44:53.480]   and just take this antibiotic every five years
[01:44:53.480 --> 01:44:55.520]   and go back time and time again.
[01:44:55.520 --> 01:44:57.580]   - In thinking about the body
[01:44:57.580 --> 01:44:58.860]   and what's going on under the hood,
[01:44:58.860 --> 01:45:02.820]   I'm amazed still that there isn't a simple,
[01:45:02.820 --> 01:45:04.640]   affordable technology that would allow me
[01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:05.760]   to just look into my body
[01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:08.260]   and see whether or not there are any tumors growing anywhere.
[01:45:08.260 --> 01:45:10.780]   I mean, it's not that hard to look into the body.
[01:45:10.780 --> 01:45:12.160]   I mean, that the technology exists.
[01:45:12.160 --> 01:45:14.580]   Why hasn't anybody created an at-home
[01:45:14.580 --> 01:45:16.680]   or pseudo at-home solution,
[01:45:16.680 --> 01:45:19.740]   like a clinic where you can go and pay 50 bucks or 100 bucks
[01:45:19.740 --> 01:45:21.340]   and see if you have any tumors growing in your body?
[01:45:21.340 --> 01:45:22.940]   - Yeah, it's still expensive.
[01:45:22.940 --> 01:45:26.360]   You can get your doctor to try to get you in.
[01:45:26.360 --> 01:45:28.380]   There's some companies that offer blood tests
[01:45:28.380 --> 01:45:31.580]   that look at circulating DNA that'll measure it.
[01:45:31.580 --> 01:45:32.420]   We're getting there.
[01:45:32.420 --> 01:45:34.020]   We're still probably five to 10 years away
[01:45:34.020 --> 01:45:35.580]   from being really cheap.
[01:45:35.580 --> 01:45:40.460]   You can do things like a colon cancer test at home.
[01:45:40.460 --> 01:45:42.660]   I think it's a hundred and something dollars.
[01:45:42.660 --> 01:45:46.160]   You ship off your shit, excuse my language,
[01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:47.620]   and they measure it.
[01:45:47.620 --> 01:45:50.400]   And they tell you if you've got colon cancer
[01:45:50.400 --> 01:45:51.980]   with high probability.
[01:45:51.980 --> 01:45:54.000]   I did that during the pandemic
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.240]   because I didn't want to get a colonoscopy.
[01:45:56.240 --> 01:45:58.860]   - Is it more accurate or as accurate as a colonoscopy?
[01:45:58.860 --> 01:46:01.000]   - I believe it's close to being as accurate.
[01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.240]   The downside is that during a colonoscopy,
[01:46:03.240 --> 01:46:06.580]   they can pinch off the polyps that are looking dangerous,
[01:46:06.580 --> 01:46:08.740]   whereas this obviously isn't that.
[01:46:08.740 --> 01:46:10.440]   But it's certainly easier to do.
[01:46:10.440 --> 01:46:12.940]   And my father, who's Australian,
[01:46:12.940 --> 01:46:14.820]   tells me that it's free for Australians.
[01:46:14.820 --> 01:46:17.160]   They get this test routinely.
[01:46:17.160 --> 01:46:19.020]   - Interesting.
[01:46:19.020 --> 01:46:22.660]   I want to return to the topic that I took us away from,
[01:46:22.660 --> 01:46:25.780]   so I apologize, which is behavioral protocols.
[01:46:25.780 --> 01:46:28.320]   Do you regularly do the cold shower thing,
[01:46:28.320 --> 01:46:29.960]   ice baths, cold water swims?
[01:46:29.960 --> 01:46:31.440]   Are you into that whole biz?
[01:46:32.220 --> 01:46:34.320]   - (laughs)
[01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:37.040]   Well, you do know that I've done it at least once
[01:46:37.040 --> 01:46:38.000]   'cause we did it together.
[01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:38.840]   - That's right.
[01:46:38.840 --> 01:46:40.760]   Not the same bath, just to be very clear.
[01:46:40.760 --> 01:46:42.760]   Same sauna, different ice bath.
[01:46:42.760 --> 01:46:44.520]   The idea of Sinclair and Huberman
[01:46:44.520 --> 01:46:46.340]   taking an ice bath together is,
[01:46:46.340 --> 01:46:48.040]   it might warm some people's hearts,
[01:46:48.040 --> 01:46:50.480]   but just to be very clear,
[01:46:50.480 --> 01:46:53.740]   same ice bath, different times.
[01:46:53.740 --> 01:46:54.580]   - Yeah.
[01:46:54.580 --> 01:46:56.160]   Thank you for clarifying.
[01:46:56.160 --> 01:46:58.600]   I don't do them regularly.
[01:46:58.600 --> 01:47:01.340]   I do try to sleep cool.
[01:47:01.340 --> 01:47:04.040]   I sleep better anyway.
[01:47:04.040 --> 01:47:07.280]   I try to dress without a lot of warm clothes.
[01:47:07.280 --> 01:47:09.480]   I'm here in a t-shirt and it's middle of summer,
[01:47:09.480 --> 01:47:12.080]   but in winter, I'll try to wear a t-shirt too.
[01:47:12.080 --> 01:47:14.920]   - So you're challenging your system to thermoregulate.
[01:47:14.920 --> 01:47:16.000]   - Right, right.
[01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.920]   I've got this hypothesis with Ray Cronus.
[01:47:18.920 --> 01:47:21.500]   We published what's called the metabolic winter hypothesis,
[01:47:21.500 --> 01:47:24.760]   which is, tens of thousands of years ago,
[01:47:24.760 --> 01:47:27.080]   we were either hungry or cold or both,
[01:47:27.080 --> 01:47:29.080]   and we rarely experienced that now.
[01:47:29.080 --> 01:47:32.640]   And so we try to give ourselves the metabolic winter.
[01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:33.760]   And part of the problem, I think,
[01:47:33.760 --> 01:47:37.000]   with the obesity epidemic is that we're never cold.
[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:38.960]   And cold, when you're cold, you have to burn energy.
[01:47:38.960 --> 01:47:40.600]   It may be only slightly.
[01:47:40.600 --> 01:47:42.880]   But over the whole night, if you're a little bit cool,
[01:47:42.880 --> 01:47:44.300]   you'll actually expend more energy.
[01:47:44.300 --> 01:47:45.760]   So I try to do that.
[01:47:45.760 --> 01:47:48.360]   But I'm not a big fan of cold showers.
[01:47:48.360 --> 01:47:52.040]   The sauna, I don't have access to my gym as much as I did.
[01:47:52.040 --> 01:47:53.280]   But I do want to get back into it.
[01:47:53.280 --> 01:47:55.800]   I used to do it regularly with my son,
[01:47:55.800 --> 01:47:57.520]   and I posted on Instagram once
[01:47:57.520 --> 01:47:59.120]   that he could stay in there for 15 minutes,
[01:47:59.120 --> 01:48:01.800]   and I could only stay in for about three.
[01:48:01.800 --> 01:48:02.940]   Anyway, long story short,
[01:48:02.940 --> 01:48:06.000]   I try to compensate with changes in my diet and exercise
[01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:07.440]   until I get back into it.
[01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:10.360]   - You reminded me of something that I meant to ask earlier,
[01:48:10.360 --> 01:48:14.240]   that obesity reduces NAD levels and accelerates aging.
[01:48:14.240 --> 01:48:16.200]   How?
[01:48:16.200 --> 01:48:21.200]   I mean, okay, so again, this is the scientist in us.
[01:48:21.200 --> 01:48:24.340]   So someone's carrying a lot of excess adipose tissues,
[01:48:24.340 --> 01:48:27.060]   subcutaneous and visceral fat.
[01:48:27.060 --> 01:48:31.860]   But why should that reduce NAD in any ways
[01:48:31.860 --> 01:48:34.760]   that are independent of effects on glucose and insulin?
[01:48:34.760 --> 01:48:38.200]   Is there something direct about white adipose tissue?
[01:48:38.200 --> 01:48:40.320]   And the reason I ask this
[01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:43.160]   is not simply to dig into mechanism alone,
[01:48:43.160 --> 01:48:45.100]   but I think there are really interesting data now
[01:48:45.100 --> 01:48:47.440]   that fat actually gets neural innervation.
[01:48:47.440 --> 01:48:51.760]   I mean, it's not just stored fuel.
[01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:54.940]   It's stored fuel that's acting as an endocrine organ,
[01:48:54.940 --> 01:48:55.780]   essentially.
[01:48:55.780 --> 01:49:00.520]   So yeah, why would being fat make people age faster?
[01:49:00.520 --> 01:49:04.640]   - Yeah, that's a question that is so obvious,
[01:49:04.640 --> 01:49:06.220]   but so few people ask it.
[01:49:06.220 --> 01:49:08.540]   That's what makes you a good scientist.
[01:49:08.540 --> 01:49:09.780]   And so that we don't know,
[01:49:09.780 --> 01:49:11.380]   but I'll give you my best answer,
[01:49:11.380 --> 01:49:15.740]   which is that obesity comes along with a lot of problems
[01:49:15.740 --> 01:49:20.060]   that include a lot of senescent cells in fat.
[01:49:20.060 --> 01:49:24.320]   If you stain old fat for senescent cells, it lights up.
[01:49:24.320 --> 01:49:26.520]   And when you kill off those cells,
[01:49:26.520 --> 01:49:29.820]   at least in mice and maybe in humans it looks like,
[01:49:29.820 --> 01:49:32.100]   the fat is less toxic to the body
[01:49:32.100 --> 01:49:33.700]   'cause those senescent cells in the fat
[01:49:33.700 --> 01:49:35.980]   are secreting these inflammatory molecules
[01:49:35.980 --> 01:49:38.860]   that will accelerate aging as we now know.
[01:49:38.860 --> 01:49:41.900]   You talk about the sirtuins and NAD.
[01:49:41.900 --> 01:49:47.720]   So if we just look philosophically at why this would be,
[01:49:47.720 --> 01:49:49.940]   the sirtuins only like to come on
[01:49:49.940 --> 01:49:54.940]   or get activated when the body is under adversity.
[01:49:54.940 --> 01:49:59.740]   And if a cell is surrounded by fat or contains a lot of fat,
[01:49:59.740 --> 01:50:02.180]   it's gonna think times are good, doesn't need to switch on.
[01:50:02.180 --> 01:50:05.100]   So that's the evolutionary argument.
[01:50:05.100 --> 01:50:07.300]   Mechanistically, we don't know,
[01:50:07.300 --> 01:50:08.520]   but it could have something to do
[01:50:08.520 --> 01:50:10.380]   with the response to glucose,
[01:50:10.380 --> 01:50:13.340]   which then responds to the sirtuin gene.
[01:50:13.340 --> 01:50:15.180]   But that hasn't been worked out very well.
[01:50:15.180 --> 01:50:16.340]   - And is there any evidence
[01:50:16.340 --> 01:50:17.940]   that leptin, this hormone from fat,
[01:50:17.940 --> 01:50:21.300]   can actually interact with the sirtuin pathway?
[01:50:21.300 --> 01:50:23.620]   - I don't recall seeing that.
[01:50:23.620 --> 01:50:25.240]   - Maybe I could do a sabbatical in your lab
[01:50:25.240 --> 01:50:26.900]   and that'd be a fun one.
[01:50:26.900 --> 01:50:27.740]   - Definitely.
[01:50:27.740 --> 01:50:29.200]   - Because leptin during development
[01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:31.160]   is what triggers the permission
[01:50:31.160 --> 01:50:33.820]   for the hypothalamus to enter puberty, right?
[01:50:33.820 --> 01:50:34.660]   - Yeah.
[01:50:34.660 --> 01:50:36.620]   - This is why kids that eat a lot when they're young
[01:50:36.620 --> 01:50:38.900]   and get overweight will also start to go
[01:50:38.900 --> 01:50:40.340]   and undergo puberty more quickly,
[01:50:40.340 --> 01:50:43.280]   although they have reproductive issues later.
[01:50:43.280 --> 01:50:46.140]   - Well, yeah, we should study the hypothalamus together
[01:50:46.140 --> 01:50:50.220]   because the hypothalamus can control the aging of the body.
[01:50:50.220 --> 01:50:52.300]   - The most interesting part of the brain.
[01:50:52.300 --> 01:50:53.140]   - For sure.
[01:50:53.140 --> 01:50:53.960]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:50:53.960 --> 01:50:55.540]   - If you turn on the sirtuin gene,
[01:50:55.540 --> 01:50:57.940]   the sirtuin gene that we work on in the hypothalamus,
[01:50:57.940 --> 01:50:59.820]   it actually will extend lifespan.
[01:50:59.820 --> 01:51:02.340]   Also, it's been shown by Dongxin Cai
[01:51:02.340 --> 01:51:04.060]   at Albert Einstein College of Medicine
[01:51:04.060 --> 01:51:06.100]   that if you inhibit inflammation
[01:51:06.100 --> 01:51:08.180]   in the hypothalamus in a mouse,
[01:51:08.180 --> 01:51:11.900]   it will increase or maintain the expression
[01:51:11.900 --> 01:51:13.380]   of what's called GnRH,
[01:51:13.380 --> 01:51:16.580]   which is the hormone that he found actually controls
[01:51:16.580 --> 01:51:18.540]   longevity in the mouse in part.
[01:51:18.540 --> 01:51:21.260]   And so keeping inflammation down in the hypothalamus
[01:51:21.260 --> 01:51:23.860]   is sufficient to extend the lifespan of animals.
[01:51:23.860 --> 01:51:27.760]   And I reviewed that paper for Nature about seven years ago.
[01:51:27.760 --> 01:51:29.260]   And that was the first demonstration
[01:51:29.260 --> 01:51:32.360]   that the hypothalamus is one of the leading regulators
[01:51:32.360 --> 01:51:33.460]   of the body's age.
[01:51:33.460 --> 01:51:34.440]   - I find this fascinating.
[01:51:34.440 --> 01:51:37.100]   GnRH, for those of you that don't know,
[01:51:37.100 --> 01:51:39.220]   actually comes from neurons in the hypothalamus
[01:51:39.220 --> 01:51:42.260]   that then literally reach down into the pituitary
[01:51:42.260 --> 01:51:43.660]   and trigger the release of all the things
[01:51:43.660 --> 01:51:45.260]   that control fertility,
[01:51:45.260 --> 01:51:48.660]   luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, et cetera.
[01:51:48.660 --> 01:51:50.180]   It's such a powerful set of neurons,
[01:51:50.180 --> 01:51:51.940]   and it's never really been clear
[01:51:51.940 --> 01:51:55.740]   what at a behavioral level triggers the release of GnRH.
[01:51:55.740 --> 01:51:57.540]   There's all the stories about pheromones
[01:51:57.540 --> 01:51:59.320]   and timers and puberty, et cetera,
[01:51:59.320 --> 01:52:02.420]   but environmental conditions and dietary conditions
[01:52:02.420 --> 01:52:05.020]   and behaviors that can control GnRH release,
[01:52:05.020 --> 01:52:10.020]   I think is an incredible area for exploration.
[01:52:10.140 --> 01:52:12.460]   I'd love to do that sabbatical, by the way.
[01:52:12.460 --> 01:52:16.200]   I have a couple seemingly random questions,
[01:52:16.200 --> 01:52:17.380]   but I can't help but ask,
[01:52:17.380 --> 01:52:20.140]   because one thing I like to do is forage the internet
[01:52:20.140 --> 01:52:23.640]   for practices that at least more than a few people are doing
[01:52:23.640 --> 01:52:26.400]   and then wonder whether or not there's any basis for it.
[01:52:26.400 --> 01:52:31.540]   You mentioned methylation as a detrimental process,
[01:52:31.540 --> 01:52:33.820]   the way it disrupts the epigenome,
[01:52:33.820 --> 01:52:36.540]   the CD reader, so to speak.
[01:52:36.540 --> 01:52:40.320]   There are people out there who are ingesting methylene blue.
[01:52:40.320 --> 01:52:41.540]   And when I was a kid,
[01:52:41.540 --> 01:52:44.580]   I used methylene blue to clean my fish tank.
[01:52:44.580 --> 01:52:45.840]   And I love fish tanks.
[01:52:45.840 --> 01:52:47.700]   I know you're into aquaria also.
[01:52:47.700 --> 01:52:50.940]   A different podcast episode, talk about aquaria,
[01:52:50.940 --> 01:52:55.940]   but why in the world would people ingest methylene blue?
[01:52:55.940 --> 01:52:58.320]   Meaning, is their logic correct?
[01:52:58.320 --> 01:53:01.180]   And/or is that a dangerous practice?
[01:53:01.180 --> 01:53:04.160]   I'm not sure I'd want to ingest methylene blue.
[01:53:04.160 --> 01:53:06.460]   Sounds like a bad thing to do.
[01:53:06.460 --> 01:53:07.640]   - It stains your body.
[01:53:07.640 --> 01:53:09.720]   You've seen these people turn blue.
[01:53:09.720 --> 01:53:13.400]   - Yeah, there was someone in my lab as a postdoc
[01:53:13.400 --> 01:53:16.380]   was using it to study a completely different process
[01:53:16.380 --> 01:53:17.560]   related to the blood-brain barrier
[01:53:17.560 --> 01:53:20.460]   and used to inject into animals and they would turn blue.
[01:53:20.460 --> 01:53:22.960]   But then again, people ingest colloid silver.
[01:53:22.960 --> 01:53:23.800]   You know, they'll put in there.
[01:53:23.800 --> 01:53:25.840]   There's this, please, people don't do this.
[01:53:25.840 --> 01:53:30.100]   Or if you do, just don't tell me 'cause I won't like it.
[01:53:30.100 --> 01:53:32.220]   People put it in their eyes.
[01:53:32.220 --> 01:53:34.520]   And some people actually stain their skin.
[01:53:34.520 --> 01:53:37.300]   They actually become kind of this silver, purple,
[01:53:37.300 --> 01:53:39.620]   brown color if they do it excessively.
[01:53:39.620 --> 01:53:42.040]   I mean, there's a lot of crazy stuff out there.
[01:53:42.040 --> 01:53:44.380]   But what do you think they're thinking
[01:53:44.380 --> 01:53:45.580]   with this methylene blue thing?
[01:53:45.580 --> 01:53:48.020]   Or should we just get them to a good psychiatrist?
[01:53:48.020 --> 01:53:51.740]   - I don't know for sure.
[01:53:51.740 --> 01:53:53.880]   I think methylene blue was found to extend the lifespan
[01:53:53.880 --> 01:53:56.760]   of some lower organism and that's where it came from.
[01:53:56.760 --> 01:53:58.200]   My recollection with the-
[01:53:58.200 --> 01:53:59.780]   - This is on lower organisms.
[01:53:59.780 --> 01:54:02.420]   - Yes, smaller organisms.
[01:54:02.420 --> 01:54:04.380]   I think doesn't, do you remember, Andrew,
[01:54:04.380 --> 01:54:07.680]   does it interrupt or interfere with mitochondrial activity?
[01:54:07.680 --> 01:54:09.740]   And that's why we're doing it.
[01:54:09.740 --> 01:54:13.020]   Yeah, we need to look this up and post it.
[01:54:13.020 --> 01:54:14.440]   We'll get to the bottom of this.
[01:54:14.440 --> 01:54:17.420]   But those methyls, let's talk about those.
[01:54:17.420 --> 01:54:18.780]   Those methyls have to be placed
[01:54:18.780 --> 01:54:21.260]   on the right part of the genome.
[01:54:21.260 --> 01:54:23.340]   They get attached to the right genes and the wrong genes.
[01:54:23.340 --> 01:54:26.060]   And if you have a lot of methylation,
[01:54:26.060 --> 01:54:28.660]   it's going to mess up the epigenome.
[01:54:28.660 --> 01:54:32.300]   Smoking will do that, lack of exercise, all that good stuff.
[01:54:32.300 --> 01:54:34.820]   So what you actually want to do is you want to measure it
[01:54:34.820 --> 01:54:38.240]   and make sure what you're doing with your body is working.
[01:54:38.240 --> 01:54:40.000]   How do you know that if you do this
[01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:41.960]   or that is actually helping?
[01:54:41.960 --> 01:54:43.640]   And so you can test your age.
[01:54:43.640 --> 01:54:45.820]   I could take a swab from your mouth
[01:54:45.820 --> 01:54:48.180]   and tell you how old you are biologically.
[01:54:48.180 --> 01:54:50.380]   And then we could work on trying to bring that down.
[01:54:50.380 --> 01:54:53.420]   And actually there are anecdotes now
[01:54:53.420 --> 01:54:56.220]   that people are reversing their age by a decade or more
[01:54:57.140 --> 01:55:00.340]   just by doing some of the things that we've talked about
[01:55:00.340 --> 01:55:02.240]   and some other cutting edge stuff
[01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:04.600]   that I'm going to write about.
[01:55:04.600 --> 01:55:07.340]   But yeah, but you have to measure stuff.
[01:55:07.340 --> 01:55:10.620]   That's, I didn't want to forget to bring that up.
[01:55:10.620 --> 01:55:11.980]   I'm measuring stuff all the time.
[01:55:11.980 --> 01:55:14.100]   I have blood tests like you.
[01:55:14.100 --> 01:55:16.500]   I've got this monitor that's stuck to my chest right now
[01:55:16.500 --> 01:55:18.980]   that's measuring myself a thousand times a second.
[01:55:18.980 --> 01:55:20.660]   And I measure my biological age.
[01:55:20.660 --> 01:55:22.860]   - What's it measuring a thousand times a second?
[01:55:22.860 --> 01:55:24.060]   A huge host of things?
[01:55:24.060 --> 01:55:24.900]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:55:24.900 --> 01:55:26.680]   So this little device is stuck here
[01:55:26.680 --> 01:55:29.500]   and it's for two weeks that you just recharge it
[01:55:29.500 --> 01:55:30.800]   or send it back and get a new one.
[01:55:30.800 --> 01:55:33.360]   It's got a body temperature movement,
[01:55:33.360 --> 01:55:34.620]   heart rate variability.
[01:55:34.620 --> 01:55:36.340]   It's an FDA approved device.
[01:55:36.340 --> 01:55:37.180]   It's not a toy.
[01:55:37.180 --> 01:55:40.540]   It's not one of these recreational things.
[01:55:40.540 --> 01:55:42.480]   It also listens to my voice.
[01:55:42.480 --> 01:55:44.780]   Eventually it'll tell me if I need a psychiatrist
[01:55:44.780 --> 01:55:46.420]   or if I'm depressed.
[01:55:46.420 --> 01:55:49.680]   It will tell me how I sleep, obviously.
[01:55:49.680 --> 01:55:51.060]   But when you put all that data together
[01:55:51.060 --> 01:55:53.260]   and it's individualized and anonymized,
[01:55:54.380 --> 01:55:56.920]   it can now tell my doctor in real time
[01:55:56.920 --> 01:55:59.360]   if I've got a cold that needs an antibiotic
[01:55:59.360 --> 01:56:01.120]   or it's just a virus,
[01:56:01.120 --> 01:56:06.120]   if I am suffering from COVID-19
[01:56:06.120 --> 01:56:09.800]   or even if I'm gonna have a heart attack next week.
[01:56:09.800 --> 01:56:11.000]   And so these little devices
[01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.320]   are going to be with us all the time
[01:56:13.320 --> 01:56:14.880]   instead of going to your doctor once a year,
[01:56:14.880 --> 01:56:16.040]   which is ludicrous.
[01:56:16.040 --> 01:56:19.880]   - I have to ask you about x-rays.
[01:56:19.880 --> 01:56:22.280]   'Cause every time I go through the scanner at the airport,
[01:56:22.280 --> 01:56:24.820]   I think Sinclair would never do this.
[01:56:24.820 --> 01:56:27.860]   And the argument I heard you give about this before
[01:56:27.860 --> 01:56:29.080]   was a really excellent one,
[01:56:29.080 --> 01:56:33.820]   which is that it's a low level amount of radiation
[01:56:33.820 --> 01:56:35.160]   going through at the airport,
[01:56:35.160 --> 01:56:37.000]   but the argument is always,
[01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:38.700]   well, it's just as much as on the plane.
[01:56:38.700 --> 01:56:42.180]   And your argument, your counter argument, I should say was,
[01:56:42.180 --> 01:56:45.080]   well, then why would I want to do both, right?
[01:56:45.080 --> 01:56:47.160]   So when you go to the airport,
[01:56:47.160 --> 01:56:48.560]   assuming you're not running late
[01:56:48.560 --> 01:56:50.580]   and you have to go through the standard line,
[01:56:50.580 --> 01:56:52.240]   what do you say to them?
[01:56:52.240 --> 01:56:54.160]   And do you say, "I'm David Sinclair,"
[01:56:54.160 --> 01:56:56.840]   and then they shuttle you to your own line?
[01:56:56.840 --> 01:56:57.680]   What do you say?
[01:56:57.680 --> 01:56:59.400]   You do say, "I don't like this thing."
[01:56:59.400 --> 01:57:01.580]   Do you have to give them a reason?
[01:57:01.580 --> 01:57:02.420]   - No, you don't.
[01:57:02.420 --> 01:57:04.440]   You can say, "I don't want this,"
[01:57:04.440 --> 01:57:05.360]   and they'll get annoyed
[01:57:05.360 --> 01:57:08.260]   'cause it's hard for them to pat you down.
[01:57:08.260 --> 01:57:09.760]   But you get a pat down and you're done.
[01:57:09.760 --> 01:57:12.480]   As long as you're not in a hurry, it's fine.
[01:57:12.480 --> 01:57:14.840]   If you want to pay for the TSA Pre in America
[01:57:14.840 --> 01:57:17.320]   or the way to get around those scanners, you can do that.
[01:57:17.320 --> 01:57:20.080]   So I travel a lot, so it's worth it anyway.
[01:57:20.080 --> 01:57:21.640]   But I just go through the metal detector.
[01:57:21.640 --> 01:57:22.880]   I don't get scanned.
[01:57:22.880 --> 01:57:26.440]   - And the metal detector doesn't have the same problem.
[01:57:26.440 --> 01:57:28.400]   And what about x-rays at the dentist?
[01:57:28.400 --> 01:57:29.240]   - Yeah.
[01:57:29.240 --> 01:57:31.200]   Well, one x-ray is not going to kill you.
[01:57:31.200 --> 01:57:32.360]   Two is not going to kill you.
[01:57:32.360 --> 01:57:33.680]   But I'd rather- - Three will kill you.
[01:57:33.680 --> 01:57:35.280]   No, I'm just kidding.
[01:57:35.280 --> 01:57:38.040]   - I try to limit it because it's cumulative.
[01:57:38.040 --> 01:57:42.280]   And I went for six years without having a dental x-ray.
[01:57:42.280 --> 01:57:45.080]   And then my last visit, I just gave up.
[01:57:45.080 --> 01:57:47.400]   I was tired of arguing with my dentist.
[01:57:47.400 --> 01:57:50.100]   So they gave me one, but they've got lead coats on
[01:57:50.100 --> 01:57:52.360]   and they put lead all over your body.
[01:57:52.360 --> 01:57:54.400]   That's telling you something right there.
[01:57:54.400 --> 01:57:58.440]   And funnily enough, my teeth hadn't changed.
[01:57:58.440 --> 01:58:00.260]   Now, you could balance that by saying,
[01:58:00.260 --> 01:58:02.440]   well, one x-ray, two x-rays, three x-rays
[01:58:02.440 --> 01:58:04.640]   is worth it if I have cavities.
[01:58:04.640 --> 01:58:05.480]   And that's true.
[01:58:05.480 --> 01:58:07.260]   You want to know what's in there.
[01:58:07.260 --> 01:58:11.600]   But doing it regularly, for me, I don't think was worth it
[01:58:11.600 --> 01:58:13.140]   because my teeth were in perfect health
[01:58:13.140 --> 01:58:16.220]   and have always been, don't have any cavities,
[01:58:16.220 --> 01:58:17.700]   didn't have braces, they're fine.
[01:58:17.700 --> 01:58:18.840]   So stop scanning me.
[01:58:18.840 --> 01:58:20.600]   I mean, I know you have to pay for the machine,
[01:58:20.600 --> 01:58:22.420]   but do I have a choice?
[01:58:22.420 --> 01:58:24.800]   Yes, so stop pressuring me.
[01:58:24.800 --> 01:58:26.940]   - You know, who shared your sentiments about x-rays
[01:58:26.940 --> 01:58:28.600]   and the dentist in general,
[01:58:28.600 --> 01:58:30.720]   my apologies to the dentists out there,
[01:58:30.720 --> 01:58:32.880]   was the great physicist, Richard Feynman.
[01:58:32.880 --> 01:58:36.500]   This is a story about him that's not especially well known,
[01:58:36.500 --> 01:58:41.500]   but he had very serious health concerns about x-rays
[01:58:41.500 --> 01:58:44.180]   because he understood the physics
[01:58:44.180 --> 01:58:45.560]   and he understood enough biology
[01:58:45.560 --> 01:58:49.740]   that he was actually quite vocal about his dislike
[01:58:49.740 --> 01:58:52.720]   of dental technology and its dangers.
[01:58:52.720 --> 01:58:54.520]   And he talked about some of that.
[01:58:54.520 --> 01:58:58.600]   People can find that on the internet if they like.
[01:58:58.600 --> 01:59:02.680]   Speaking of people who are like Feynman,
[01:59:02.680 --> 01:59:06.140]   who've been engaged in public discourse about science,
[01:59:06.140 --> 01:59:07.920]   one of the things that I appreciate about you,
[01:59:07.920 --> 01:59:10.760]   in fact, the way that you and I initially came
[01:59:10.760 --> 01:59:12.480]   to know one another is through
[01:59:12.480 --> 01:59:15.840]   your public health education efforts.
[01:59:15.840 --> 01:59:19.320]   So obviously we're doing this podcast,
[01:59:19.320 --> 01:59:20.880]   you've done the Joe Rogan podcast,
[01:59:20.880 --> 01:59:23.640]   Lex Friedman's podcast, excuse me, Lex,
[01:59:23.640 --> 01:59:24.660]   I'm still adjusting that,
[01:59:24.660 --> 01:59:28.860]   Lex Friedman podcast and many other podcasts,
[01:59:28.860 --> 01:59:30.360]   you've written an amazing book.
[01:59:30.360 --> 01:59:33.140]   What are you thinking these days
[01:59:33.140 --> 01:59:35.760]   in terms of what the world needs
[01:59:35.760 --> 01:59:39.480]   in terms of education from scientists,
[01:59:39.480 --> 01:59:43.160]   education from MDs, education in general
[01:59:43.160 --> 01:59:44.320]   as it relates to these things?
[01:59:44.320 --> 01:59:47.240]   Because I think if nothing else,
[01:59:47.240 --> 01:59:50.640]   2020 revealed to us that there's a gap,
[01:59:50.640 --> 01:59:52.480]   there's a gap in understanding
[01:59:52.480 --> 01:59:54.360]   and that the scientists too are guilty
[01:59:54.360 --> 01:59:57.960]   of not knowing what to do with all the information
[01:59:57.960 --> 01:59:59.960]   that's out there on PubMed or elsewhere.
[01:59:59.960 --> 02:00:03.240]   What are you thinking for yourself?
[02:00:03.240 --> 02:00:04.880]   And in general, I'd like to just know,
[02:00:04.880 --> 02:00:06.360]   what do you think the world needs there?
[02:00:06.360 --> 02:00:09.680]   Maybe we can recruit some more public educators.
[02:00:09.680 --> 02:00:12.880]   - Yeah, well, we've gone from a time
[02:00:12.880 --> 02:00:16.780]   when you and I were in college and young professors,
[02:00:16.780 --> 02:00:20.000]   where the only way to get our voice out to the public
[02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.100]   was either through a newspaper
[02:00:22.100 --> 02:00:24.740]   or a very short radio interview,
[02:00:24.740 --> 02:00:27.800]   which for me was extremely frustrating
[02:00:27.800 --> 02:00:31.060]   'cause particularly the newspapers and my topic,
[02:00:31.060 --> 02:00:32.760]   every time was twisted into something
[02:00:32.760 --> 02:00:34.520]   that was not just embarrassing,
[02:00:34.520 --> 02:00:37.380]   but Harvard University used to bring me into the back office
[02:00:37.380 --> 02:00:39.040]   and slap my wrist. - Frankenstein.
[02:00:39.040 --> 02:00:40.560]   - How did you say such a thing?
[02:00:40.560 --> 02:00:42.940]   We're all gonna live 200, I didn't say that.
[02:00:42.940 --> 02:00:45.600]   So we're now also in a world
[02:00:45.600 --> 02:00:47.640]   where we're overwhelmed with information
[02:00:47.640 --> 02:00:49.800]   and most of it is wrong
[02:00:49.800 --> 02:00:52.180]   and anyone can pretend to be an expert.
[02:00:52.180 --> 02:00:56.760]   So we've gone from early days to now, the future,
[02:00:56.760 --> 02:00:58.800]   and we're experiencing it right now,
[02:00:58.800 --> 02:01:01.320]   thanks to guys like you, people like you,
[02:01:01.320 --> 02:01:03.600]   is that the experts, some experts,
[02:01:03.600 --> 02:01:07.560]   a small number who are brilliant and good communicators,
[02:01:07.560 --> 02:01:09.400]   are talking directly to the public.
[02:01:09.400 --> 02:01:12.200]   This has never been able to be possible
[02:01:12.200 --> 02:01:15.520]   until this time right now.
[02:01:15.520 --> 02:01:19.540]   So another five years from now, and certainly by 10 years,
[02:01:19.540 --> 02:01:23.200]   I would hope that there are trusted sources of information
[02:01:23.200 --> 02:01:28.200]   of people who can not just communicate the ideas directly,
[02:01:28.200 --> 02:01:31.760]   but are able to talk about things that are going on
[02:01:31.760 --> 02:01:33.760]   that aren't even published yet to say,
[02:01:33.760 --> 02:01:35.700]   here's what's really going on
[02:01:35.700 --> 02:01:38.000]   and this is what the future looks like,
[02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:39.600]   but this is somebody like yourself
[02:01:39.600 --> 02:01:42.960]   who spent their whole life studying a particular topic
[02:01:42.960 --> 02:01:45.360]   and knows what they're talking about.
[02:01:45.360 --> 02:01:46.920]   And this is also something
[02:01:46.920 --> 02:01:49.520]   that I think most people don't know,
[02:01:49.520 --> 02:01:53.300]   that we scientists, if we tell a lie, we burst into flames.
[02:01:53.300 --> 02:01:56.960]   We absolutely cannot tell something that's untrue
[02:01:56.960 --> 02:01:59.880]   and to the best of our knowledge, we say it as it is,
[02:01:59.880 --> 02:02:02.040]   because if we don't, we're beaten up
[02:02:02.040 --> 02:02:04.480]   or we kicked out of the university.
[02:02:04.480 --> 02:02:06.760]   So the people who survive to our age,
[02:02:06.760 --> 02:02:07.800]   and I'm a little older than you,
[02:02:07.800 --> 02:02:09.420]   so I've survived a bit longer.
[02:02:09.420 --> 02:02:11.120]   - But a lot younger inside.
[02:02:11.120 --> 02:02:12.760]   - No, but we have to measure you with my-
[02:02:12.760 --> 02:02:14.960]   - Yeah, we need to see, I probably need a little help,
[02:02:14.960 --> 02:02:15.920]   but hopefully not too much.
[02:02:15.920 --> 02:02:19.480]   - We'll measure that and we'll work on your eating.
[02:02:19.480 --> 02:02:23.000]   But this is really, really important is that finally,
[02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.420]   people like you are allowed by our universities
[02:02:25.420 --> 02:02:26.960]   to talk to the public.
[02:02:26.960 --> 02:02:30.720]   I used to do it with a real threat to my survival.
[02:02:30.720 --> 02:02:32.640]   People would look at me, oh, he's a salesman,
[02:02:32.640 --> 02:02:33.760]   he's promoting this and that.
[02:02:33.760 --> 02:02:35.460]   It was seen as a real negative.
[02:02:35.460 --> 02:02:36.740]   But finally, I think we're in a world
[02:02:36.740 --> 02:02:38.620]   where it's not negative anymore.
[02:02:38.620 --> 02:02:42.360]   And the pandemic showed that we needed voices of reason,
[02:02:42.360 --> 02:02:45.480]   voices of fact that you could trust.
[02:02:45.480 --> 02:02:48.560]   And you can see the popularity of your podcast
[02:02:48.560 --> 02:02:52.120]   shows that the public, they're desperate for facts
[02:02:52.120 --> 02:02:52.960]   that they can trust
[02:02:52.960 --> 02:02:55.760]   'cause they don't know what to believe anymore.
[02:02:55.760 --> 02:02:59.520]   - Well, I am being completely honest when I say this,
[02:02:59.520 --> 02:03:01.280]   that I followed your lead.
[02:03:01.280 --> 02:03:04.760]   I saw you on the Joe Rogan podcast and my jaw dropped.
[02:03:04.760 --> 02:03:07.280]   I was like, this is amazing.
[02:03:07.280 --> 02:03:10.040]   Because he had had other good scientists on before,
[02:03:10.040 --> 02:03:13.080]   but you're a tenured professor, Harvard genetics,
[02:03:13.080 --> 02:03:14.720]   department of genetics.
[02:03:14.720 --> 02:03:16.480]   And for those of you who don't know,
[02:03:16.480 --> 02:03:20.440]   there's Harvard and of course, Harvard Medical School,
[02:03:20.440 --> 02:03:22.540]   and they're both excellent, of course,
[02:03:23.640 --> 02:03:26.400]   but these are the top, top tiers of academia.
[02:03:26.400 --> 02:03:27.920]   And I certainly understand what it takes
[02:03:27.920 --> 02:03:30.720]   to get there and survive there and to thrive there.
[02:03:30.720 --> 02:03:32.360]   It's like a game of pinball.
[02:03:32.360 --> 02:03:34.520]   You never win, you just get to,
[02:03:34.520 --> 02:03:36.640]   if you're doing really well, you get to keep playing.
[02:03:36.640 --> 02:03:38.640]   That's the truth in academia.
[02:03:38.640 --> 02:03:40.960]   And if you're not, you stop playing basically.
[02:03:40.960 --> 02:03:45.080]   But when I saw you explain what you were doing
[02:03:45.080 --> 02:03:47.040]   in a way that was accessible to people
[02:03:47.040 --> 02:03:49.680]   and also talking about possible protocols
[02:03:49.680 --> 02:03:51.320]   that they might explore for themselves
[02:03:51.320 --> 02:03:53.840]   to see if those were right for them,
[02:03:53.840 --> 02:03:57.080]   I was just dazzled and excited.
[02:03:57.080 --> 02:03:59.400]   And I made every effort to get in contact with you
[02:03:59.400 --> 02:04:02.240]   and the rest is history.
[02:04:02.240 --> 02:04:05.640]   But I think what's really exciting to me these days
[02:04:05.640 --> 02:04:08.320]   is because of 2020 and everything that's happened
[02:04:08.320 --> 02:04:12.240]   and it continues to happen, there's a thirst for knowledge.
[02:04:12.240 --> 02:04:15.380]   There's also this direct to the public route
[02:04:15.380 --> 02:04:16.640]   that you mentioned.
[02:04:16.640 --> 02:04:20.860]   And I think there's also an openness,
[02:04:20.860 --> 02:04:21.720]   I'd love your thoughts on this,
[02:04:21.720 --> 02:04:24.500]   but it seems to me that there's an openness
[02:04:24.500 --> 02:04:28.800]   from the general public about health practices,
[02:04:28.800 --> 02:04:30.720]   that there are actually things that people can do
[02:04:30.720 --> 02:04:34.480]   to control their stress level, to control their sleep,
[02:04:34.480 --> 02:04:36.440]   to control their cholesterol,
[02:04:36.440 --> 02:04:39.020]   if that's what they need to do, maybe they don't,
[02:04:39.020 --> 02:04:41.800]   and to even control their lifespan,
[02:04:41.800 --> 02:04:43.780]   which I think is remarkable.
[02:04:43.780 --> 02:04:47.060]   And I know I speak on behalf of so many people
[02:04:47.060 --> 02:04:48.640]   when I just, I want to say thank you.
[02:04:48.640 --> 02:04:51.300]   You've truly changed the course of my life.
[02:04:51.300 --> 02:04:53.240]   I would not be sitting here doing this
[02:04:53.240 --> 02:04:55.300]   were it not for your example.
[02:04:55.300 --> 02:04:58.740]   And I always say, Sinclair, many people have written books,
[02:04:58.740 --> 02:05:01.180]   many academics have written books as you have,
[02:05:01.180 --> 02:05:02.700]   but in terms of doing podcasts
[02:05:02.700 --> 02:05:04.380]   and really getting out there with your message
[02:05:04.380 --> 02:05:07.100]   in a way that I have to assume raised your cortisol level
[02:05:07.100 --> 02:05:08.820]   and heart rate just a little bit,
[02:05:08.820 --> 02:05:11.360]   but you did it nonetheless.
[02:05:12.580 --> 02:05:14.660]   You know, you were truly first man in,
[02:05:14.660 --> 02:05:17.220]   and that deserves a nod,
[02:05:17.220 --> 02:05:19.840]   and I have a great debt of gratitude to you for that.
[02:05:19.840 --> 02:05:20.940]   So thank you so much.
[02:05:20.940 --> 02:05:23.300]   - Thanks, Andrew, you've become a good friend,
[02:05:23.300 --> 02:05:25.260]   and I'm super proud of what you've done
[02:05:25.260 --> 02:05:27.260]   and I know what you will do.
[02:05:27.260 --> 02:05:30.380]   - So in addition to your book and your presence
[02:05:30.380 --> 02:05:32.740]   on social media, Instagram and Twitter,
[02:05:32.740 --> 02:05:34.640]   and appearances on podcasts,
[02:05:34.640 --> 02:05:37.820]   recently I've noticed that you've opened up
[02:05:37.820 --> 02:05:42.820]   a sort of an email/website that people can access, excuse me,
[02:05:42.820 --> 02:05:45.660]   to get some information about their own health
[02:05:45.660 --> 02:05:46.780]   and rates of aging.
[02:05:46.780 --> 02:05:49.420]   Tell us about that and what's being measured
[02:05:49.420 --> 02:05:53.140]   and what is this test that you've been working on
[02:05:53.140 --> 02:05:56.500]   secretly and now soon not so secretly?
[02:05:56.500 --> 02:06:00.400]   - Yeah, well, what I want is a credit score for the body
[02:06:00.400 --> 02:06:03.660]   to make it easy for people to follow their health.
[02:06:03.660 --> 02:06:05.020]   And there is a number,
[02:06:05.020 --> 02:06:06.900]   there's a biological age that you can measure.
[02:06:06.900 --> 02:06:08.900]   Unfortunately, the test is many hundreds of dollars
[02:06:08.900 --> 02:06:10.940]   right now, but in my lab,
[02:06:10.940 --> 02:06:13.740]   we've been able to bring that down a lot.
[02:06:13.740 --> 02:06:15.420]   And so I want to democratize this test
[02:06:15.420 --> 02:06:18.080]   so that everybody has access to a score for their health
[02:06:18.080 --> 02:06:22.060]   that can predict not just their future health
[02:06:22.060 --> 02:06:24.740]   and time of death, but to change it.
[02:06:24.740 --> 02:06:27.660]   And I'm building a system that will point people
[02:06:27.660 --> 02:06:29.500]   in the right direction and give them discounts
[02:06:29.500 --> 02:06:31.780]   for certain things that will improve
[02:06:31.780 --> 02:06:33.540]   not just their health now,
[02:06:33.540 --> 02:06:35.660]   but 10, 20, 30 years into the future.
[02:06:35.660 --> 02:06:38.660]   And we can measure that and very cheaply keep measuring it
[02:06:38.660 --> 02:06:40.420]   to know that you're on the right track.
[02:06:40.420 --> 02:06:41.500]   'Cause if you don't measure something,
[02:06:41.500 --> 02:06:42.860]   you can't optimize it.
[02:06:42.860 --> 02:06:44.640]   And so this is the biological age test.
[02:06:44.640 --> 02:06:45.480]   We've developed it.
[02:06:45.480 --> 02:06:47.660]   It's a simple mouth swab.
[02:06:47.660 --> 02:06:48.980]   We're rolling it out.
[02:06:48.980 --> 02:06:51.020]   We're building the system right now.
[02:06:51.020 --> 02:06:52.080]   And there is a signup sheet
[02:06:52.080 --> 02:06:54.340]   'cause a lot of people want to get in line.
[02:06:54.340 --> 02:06:56.060]   Go to drsinclair.com.
[02:06:56.060 --> 02:06:58.780]   You can get on that and you'll be one of the first people
[02:06:58.780 --> 02:07:01.460]   in the world to get this test and see what we're doing.
[02:07:01.460 --> 02:07:03.220]   - Fantastic.
[02:07:03.220 --> 02:07:08.020]   Will people be celebrating their biological age birthdays?
[02:07:08.020 --> 02:07:10.660]   In other words, if I'm minus, like if I could imagine,
[02:07:10.660 --> 02:07:12.620]   so I'm 45 right now, soon to be 46.
[02:07:12.620 --> 02:07:15.860]   But if I were to be so lucky as to get my biological age
[02:07:15.860 --> 02:07:20.360]   to 35 within 12 months, maybe can help me do that.
[02:07:20.360 --> 02:07:23.920]   Do I get to celebrate a negative birthday?
[02:07:23.920 --> 02:07:24.760]   - Absolutely.
[02:07:24.760 --> 02:07:28.060]   And my plan is that those people who take their age back
[02:07:28.060 --> 02:07:30.820]   a year or more, we think we can go back 20 years.
[02:07:30.820 --> 02:07:33.240]   Eventually, they'll get a birthday card from me
[02:07:33.240 --> 02:07:35.780]   and it's a negative birthday card.
[02:07:35.780 --> 02:07:36.660]   - I love it.
[02:07:36.660 --> 02:07:39.480]   And probably very little actual birthday cake
[02:07:39.480 --> 02:07:41.320]   being ingested, but who cares?
[02:07:41.320 --> 02:07:42.820]   'Cause you're living that much longer.
[02:07:42.820 --> 02:07:43.660]   - Well, it's full of stevia.
[02:07:43.660 --> 02:07:45.080]   That'll be fine.
[02:07:45.080 --> 02:07:47.500]   - And thank you for talking to us today.
[02:07:47.500 --> 02:07:52.500]   I realized I took us down deep into the guts of mechanism
[02:07:52.500 --> 02:07:55.900]   and as well, talking about global protocols,
[02:07:55.900 --> 02:07:59.220]   everything from what one can do and take if they choose,
[02:07:59.220 --> 02:08:02.260]   that's right for them, to how to think about
[02:08:02.260 --> 02:08:05.180]   this whole process that we talk about
[02:08:05.180 --> 02:08:06.780]   when we talk about lifespan.
[02:08:06.780 --> 02:08:10.020]   As always, incredibly illuminating.
[02:08:10.020 --> 02:08:11.100]   Thank you, David.
[02:08:11.100 --> 02:08:12.560]   - Thanks, Andrew.
[02:08:12.560 --> 02:08:14.520]   - Thank you for joining me for my conversation
[02:08:14.520 --> 02:08:16.320]   with Dr. David Sinclair.

[02:09:04.260 --> 02:09:06.420]   And there you can support the podcast
[02:09:06.420 --> 02:09:08.020]   at any level that you like.
[02:09:08.020 --> 02:09:10.260]   Today and in many other previous episodes
[02:09:10.260 --> 02:09:12.920]   of the Huberman Lab podcast, we discuss supplements.
[02:09:12.920 --> 02:09:16.140]   While supplements aren't necessary or right for everybody,
[02:09:16.140 --> 02:09:18.900]   many people derive tremendous benefit from supplements.
[02:09:18.900 --> 02:09:22.120]   For that reason, we partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,
[02:09:22.120 --> 02:09:25.040]   because Thorne supplements are the absolute highest quality
[02:09:25.040 --> 02:09:27.140]   and the absolute highest precision,
[02:09:27.140 --> 02:09:29.000]   meaning what you see listed on the bottle
[02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:30.320]   is what's actually in the bottle,
[02:09:30.320 --> 02:09:32.880]   which is not the case for many supplement companies
[02:09:32.880 --> 02:09:33.720]   out there.
[02:09:33.720 --> 02:09:36.120]   Thorne is one of the partners of the Mayo Clinic
[02:09:36.120 --> 02:09:37.400]   and all the major sports teams.
[02:09:37.400 --> 02:09:40.700]   And so they really are very trusted, very highest quality.
[02:09:40.700 --> 02:09:42.940]   If you want to see the supplements that I personally take,
[02:09:42.940 --> 02:09:46.800]   you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman.
[02:09:46.800 --> 02:09:48.440]   And there you'll see the supplements that I take.
[02:09:48.440 --> 02:09:50.920]   You can get 20% off any of those supplements.
[02:09:50.920 --> 02:09:53.080]   And if you navigate deeper into the Thorne site
[02:09:53.080 --> 02:09:55.280]   through that portal, you'll also get 20% off
[02:09:55.280 --> 02:09:57.160]   any of the other supplements that Thorne makes.
[02:09:57.160 --> 02:10:02.160]   So again, it's thorne.com/u/huberman
[02:10:02.160 --> 02:10:05.600]   to get 20% off any of the supplements that Thorne makes.
[02:10:05.600 --> 02:10:07.840]   Also take note that the Lifespan podcast
[02:10:07.840 --> 02:10:10.080]   featuring Dr. David Sinclair as a host
[02:10:10.080 --> 02:10:11.920]   launches Wednesday, January 5th.
[02:10:11.920 --> 02:10:13.560]   You can find the first episode here
[02:10:13.560 --> 02:10:15.400]   on the Huberman Lab podcast channel.
[02:10:15.400 --> 02:10:17.760]   They also have their own independent channel.
[02:10:17.760 --> 02:10:19.860]   You can find the link to that channel in the show notes.
[02:10:19.860 --> 02:10:21.640]   So please go there, subscribe on YouTube,
[02:10:21.640 --> 02:10:23.520]   also on Apple and Spotify.
[02:10:23.520 --> 02:10:25.760]   I've seen these episodes, they are phenomenal,
[02:10:25.760 --> 02:10:27.920]   and you're going to learn a tremendous amount
[02:10:27.920 --> 02:10:30.560]   about aging and how to slow and reverse aging
[02:10:30.560 --> 02:10:33.840]   from the world expert himself, Dr. David Sinclair.
[02:10:33.840 --> 02:10:35.960]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:10:35.960 --> 02:10:37.800]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:10:37.800 --> 02:10:40.380]   [upbeat music]
[02:10:40.380 --> 02:10:42.960]   (upbeat music)
