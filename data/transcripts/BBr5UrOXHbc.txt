[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.240]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:13.560]   the book of the prophet Isaiah in chapter 5 and verse 21, the 21st verse in the 5th
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.120]   chapter of the book of the prophet Isaiah.
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:27.200]   Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes and prudent in their own sight.
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:36.160]   Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes and prudent in their own sight.
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:44.880]   We are looking here at the fifth woe which is pronounced by the prophet Isaiah upon his
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:53.800]   contemporaries some 800 years before the birth of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.920]   We have been seeing Sunday night after Sunday night, this is the sixth Sunday evening we
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:04.040]   have been considering this great chapter, this message delivered by the prophet to his
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:13.400]   contemporaries in their condition and position of trial and trouble and much evil appearing
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.760]   upon the horizon.
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.560]   These prophets were men raised up by God to address the nation, to call it to stop for
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.200]   a moment and to consider its ways, ere it was too late.
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.160]   And in these prophecies, which all of them really are saying exactly the same thing,
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.240]   we have the mind of God, not only upon the condition of the children of Israel at that
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:43.880]   particular juncture in their long and checkered history, but we have the mind of God upon
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:52.360]   the whole state and condition of the human race at all times, in all places, but in particular
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:59.080]   at certain eras and epochs, when, as we were seeing last Sunday night, sin seems to overreach
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.080]   itself.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:07.880]   And we are in a state and condition that presages calamity and awful punishment.
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.360]   Now the method of the apostle I have been indicating to you is this.
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.720]   He starts off with a general statement.
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.040]   This is quite the common practice.
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.640]   It is a very convenient formula, a very convenient way for presenting the truth.
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.280]   He presents, first of all, the whole case.
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:31.360]   And then he comes back and he illustrates the general case in certain specific particulars.
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.280]   Now I am at pains to point out the importance of doing these two things Sunday after Sunday.
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.720]   The general is never enough.
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.000]   The general is of vital importance.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.600]   Many people miss the wood because of the trees.
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.200]   So you must start with the general.
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.560]   You must understand the whole position, but then you have got to see it also in particular
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.560]   cases.
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.440]   This is important for this reason, that sin has so affected us all, that while we may
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:06.120]   see the position in general, we do not always see it in detail.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.520]   We can see it in other people, but not in ourselves.
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.800]   And when the message is pointed in particular at us and our position, we resent it.
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.320]   We will accept it about all the others, but not about our own.
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.800]   Well, that is the reason for dealing with the particulars.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.440]   We have got to bring it down to each one of us.
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.000]   It is not enough for us to say there is something wrong with men.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.120]   We must be clear as to what is wrong with men.
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:35.920]   And we must see how this general condition manifests itself in us in its various particulars.
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.840]   Now we have been seeing Sunday by Sunday how extraordinarily contemporary this chapter
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:42.840]   is.
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.080]   No one who has been here these Sunday nights can have failed to realize that the Prophet
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.040]   might very well be writing to Great Britain today.
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.480]   The very things that are most obvious and common in the life of this nation are the
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.640]   things that we find before us in this chapter.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:06.640]   We have seen that he puts his finger specifically upon materialism.
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:12.960]   Woe unto them that join house to house, living for the things of this world, materialism.
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.960]   We have seen that he also denounces and pronounces his woe upon the pleasure mania that is such
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:23.520]   a characteristic, so obvious and evident of the life of today.
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.400]   And then we have seen how he pronounces woe upon this kind of abandon with respect to
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.880]   sin, all shame forgotten.
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:37.000]   Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cause of vanity and sin as it were with a cart rook.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:44.440]   The open, unashamed, blatant, boastful sinning that is characteristic of this age.
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.920]   And the defiance of God, let him do his worst, they say.
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:54.480]   And then last week we saw this terrible confusion.
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.360]   Woe unto them that call evil good and good evil, that put darkness for light and light
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.560]   for darkness, that put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter.
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:09.960]   And overturning of all the recognized canons of judgment in almost every single department
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:16.400]   of life, most serious of course of all when you come to the realm of morals and of conduct
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.400]   and of behavior.
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.560]   The attitude which says, "Evil be thou my good."
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.440]   Not merely that men are immoral or even amoral.
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:34.080]   Perverted, twisted, everything upside down, gloring in evil, loving the darkness, hating
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.800]   the light.
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.680]   And now we come to this further one.
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.680]   What is this?
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.360]   Well, woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes and prudent in their own sight.
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.360]   What's this?
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.200]   Well, we've got a word for it today.
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.080]   This is what is called humanism.
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.240]   Humanism.
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:57.960]   Now once more, this point that I'm making comes out, I think, very strikingly.
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:58.960]   Humanism.
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.200]   That's the great creed of today.
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.360]   One of the most popular beliefs in this country.
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.760]   This belief in humanism.
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:15.040]   Now the relevance of all this in general and in the particulars to our state and condition
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:20.200]   today is something that really should cause us to pause for a moment because it indicates
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.600]   certain things so very clearly.
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:28.680]   The first thing that it indicates is this, that the Bible is a strangely contemporary
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.400]   book.
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:31.960]   People think the Bible's out of date.
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:32.960]   That's why they don't read it.
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.520]   They say, "What's the Bible got to tell us about life today?"
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.920]   Well, my dear friend, if you only read your Bible, you'll find that it tells you all about
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:41.920]   today.
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:46.040]   It's a strangely contemporary book.
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:50.040]   If you want the best descriptions of life as it is being lived at the present time,
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.040]   go to the Bible.
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.120]   There you'll find it.
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.360]   It indicates that to us.
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.680]   It shows us that this is no ordinary book.
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:01.600]   And you see, the Bible itself gives us the explanation of that very thing.
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:08.920]   It tells us that men's essential trouble is always the same.
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:12.360]   In other words, as the Bible puts it in the book of Ecclesiastes, there is nothing new
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:16.320]   under the sun, nothing at all.
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:25.400]   There is nothing that is so futile as this curious boast of modernity.
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:29.480]   Of all the boasts, it is the emptiest.
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:34.560]   There is nothing from the intellectual standpoint which is really so ridiculous as for people
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:40.000]   to think that modern life is something absolutely new, and that we look back at people who lived
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   before us.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.720]   What did they know about life?
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.840]   How we've advanced, what we've discovered, our way of thinking, our way of living.
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:51.280]   My dear friend, it's happened so many times before.
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.360]   It's all in the Bible.
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.840]   There's nothing new under the sun, nothing at all.
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.840]   I've often put it like this.
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:07.400]   Modern man with all his cleverness is incapable of inventing a new sin.
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:12.640]   There is nothing being done in the worst haunts of vice in the city of London tonight, but
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.880]   that you find it somewhere in the Bible.
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:20.960]   Nothing new under the sun, and this boast and claim of modernity, and that we are not
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.760]   Christians because we are up to date.
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:29.760]   It is, I say, the most futile and the most foolish claim that a man can ever make.
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:34.240]   I can understand a man saying that he's not a Christian, that he doesn't accept the message,
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:39.160]   but he mustn't say that he's in that position because he lives in the twentieth century,
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:40.480]   because there's nothing new about that.
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:44.400]   People have been rejecting it throughout the centuries, and for exactly the same reasons,
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.000]   as we shall proceed to show.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:54.720]   No, I say that this astounding chapter alone shows us these things very clearly.
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:09:00.360]   The contemporary character of the Word of God, and the fact that there is nothing which
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:03.720]   is new under the sun.
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:09.240]   Modernity is a most important matter, and if you study it, you'll see, as you get shown
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:15.020]   here so plainly, that it goes round in cycles.
[00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:17.000]   We think that we are advancing, but we're not.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.560]   We're always going round in a cycle.
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.080]   You get it, of course, in fashions.
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.080]   Everybody knows that.
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:27.960]   I was reading the other day of a man in the newspaper who'd kept a suit a number of years,
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.360]   and had been ashamed to wear it for a number of years, but now it's the fashionable thing
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:34.760]   to wear, and so on, with ladies' clothing in particular.
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:38.440]   Keep your things long enough, you'll soon be in the fashion, my friend.
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:39.560]   There's no difficulty about this.
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:42.160]   It all goes round and round in cycles.
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:47.080]   And this is not only true about clothing, it's equally true about thinking.
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:51.760]   There are these cycles in the matter of thought, even, and in all the realms of expression
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:52.760]   in life.
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.840]   Man goes round and round in cycles.
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.080]   Man's never very original.
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.000]   He has to go on repeating himself.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.360]   Now, the Bible brings that out, I say, in a most amazing manner.
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:08.560]   Well, now then, here we are looking at this great characteristic of the modern world.
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:09.560]   Humanism.
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:11.440]   What does humanism mean?
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:15.960]   Well, I really cannot give a better definition of it than my text tonight.
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:22.000]   "Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight."
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   What is humanism?
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.360]   Well, the word tells us, doesn't it?
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:31.720]   Humanism is the belief in humanity, if you like, without God.
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.080]   It's a belief in man.
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:37.120]   It's an interest in man.
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.720]   It banishes God.
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:41.280]   Man is sufficient in and of himself.
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:45.360]   That is the very essence of humanism.
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:48.160]   Its whole interest is upon man.
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:53.880]   Man is the centre of the universe, and there is nothing bigger and nothing greater than
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:54.920]   man.
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.280]   That is the essence of what is meant by humanism.
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:59.480]   Now, there are two main forms of this.
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:03.520]   I'm not going to keep you with that, but I must just mention them to you.
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:08.960]   And the two main forms that are most evident at the present time are these.
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:12.360]   There is what is called classical humanism.
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:18.000]   Classical humanism simply means this, that for your guidance in life, your understanding
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:25.280]   of life, you don't go to the Bible, but you go back to Greek literature, Greek philosophy,
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:28.000]   Greek drama, Greek poetry.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.880]   That's classical humanism.
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:33.560]   And the classical humanist is a man who studies these great Greek authors.
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.480]   Now, don't misunderstand me.
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.400]   I'm not here to say a word against them.
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:40.880]   They were truly great men.
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:46.040]   But you see, humanism says there's nothing beyond.
[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:49.360]   And that if you want wisdom, that's where you go.
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.360]   Classical humanism.
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:57.640]   In other words, that you go back to the mind and the thinking and the meditation of these
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:00.280]   giant brains of the past.
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:05.080]   And you consider and grapple with and try to understand what they thought and what they
[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:07.600]   laid down, and you try to put it into practice.
[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:13.160]   And that that is the way whereby you can live a good and an harmonious life in this present
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:14.160]   world.
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:15.160]   That's humanism.
[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:21.360]   And then the other form that humanism takes, of course, is what is called scientific humanism.
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.960]   And this is the more popular of the two at the present time.
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:28.840]   Incidentally, there's quite an entertaining fight going on between the two, as you know.
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:33.240]   Two great professors in Cambridge are having a public quarrel over this, and it's most
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.240]   interesting.
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.840]   Professor Leavis and Professor Sir Charles Snow, C.P.
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:38.840]   Snow.
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:40.240]   These two cultures, as they talk about.
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:41.240]   Well, there they are.
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.240]   There's the classical.
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:45.720]   You see, the poetic, the philosophic, and so on.
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:50.660]   And on the other side, there is this scientific outlook, scientific approach, and the feeling
[00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:55.800]   that the answer to the problems is not going to come from Greek philosophy or poetry so
[00:12:55.800 --> 00:13:01.240]   much as from a scientific understanding of the whole universe, men included.
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:03.620]   And this is more modern.
[00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:08.680]   This claims that it's new and recent, because the discoveries are recent, at least comparatively
[00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:15.160]   recently, all going back very little more than some 500 years at the maximum.
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.000]   Scientific humanism.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.840]   So you delve into the mysteries of the universe, and you discover these things scientifically,
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:25.240]   and there you've got your whole scheme with respect to life.
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.960]   Well, now, then, those are the two main forms.
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:35.480]   Now, we must examine this because we are told here, "Woe unto them that are humanists."
[00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:39.560]   But let's be clear about this.
[00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:46.320]   It is no part of the case for the Christian gospel to say anything derogatory of the intellect.
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:50.800]   Indeed, that's the very opposite of the gospel.
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:54.760]   The gospel places great value upon the intellect.
[00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:59.640]   Let nobody think that what is meant by my text tonight is that there is no value in
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:04.600]   a man having a brain or ability to use it or understanding or the power of reason and
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:05.600]   so on.
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:06.600]   It isn't that.
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:08.520]   There is nothing wrong with the intellect.
[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:12.120]   There is nothing wrong with wisdom per se.
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:18.800]   Indeed, the Bible would tell us that the highest gift that God has given to man in the realm
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:23.600]   of gifts—I'm not talking about man's soul and spirit, but his actual gifts—that
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:29.600]   the highest of all the gifts is mind, is reason, is understanding.
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:35.800]   That's the wonderful thing about a man, that he can contemplate even himself.
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:37.160]   He can analyze himself.
[00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:38.840]   He can look on at himself.
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:39.840]   He can evaluate himself.
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.200]   He can criticize himself.
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:51.240]   This power of looking at yourself objectively and of reason, it's a tremendous gift given,
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:56.920]   according to the Bible, by God to man, so that there is nothing derogatory that must
[00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:01.480]   be said about the intellect or about reason or about mind.
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:08.000]   Let me say once more, I'm interested and somewhat amused when certain people seem to
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.920]   visit here occasionally and write an account of what they found happening here, and they
[00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:15.480]   seem to suggest that I tax my congregations.
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:18.560]   What they mean by that is that I make you think too much.
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:22.600]   I'm grateful for the compliment.
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.680]   It's a part of my belief concerning this gospel.
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:27.480]   I'm not here to tell stories.
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:32.160]   I never remember them to start with, but I'm not here to tell stories.
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:38.920]   I'm not here to entertain you, but I am here to reason with you for the reason that I'm
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:47.080]   just giving, that God has given men a mind, and man is meant to use it.
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:53.360]   It's the greatest gift of God to man—mind, reason, understanding.
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:57.240]   Thus I'm going to show you the whole trouble in the world tonight is due to the fact that
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:58.840]   man's mind has gone wrong.
[00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:00.920]   He doesn't know how to use it properly.
[00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:05.880]   Well, very well, then, what is the attitude of the Bible with regard to humanism?
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:10.240]   Well, it's this, that while there is everything that is right about the mind and the reason
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:18.720]   and the understanding, what is wrong is that man should put his final confidence in it,
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:24.120]   that men should be so proud of it that he begins to worship it, that man thinks that
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:29.960]   it's sufficient in and of itself, that he needs nothing beyond it, that man begins to
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:36.640]   boast of it and to claim that with his mind and his reason he can encompass the entire
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:37.640]   cosmos.
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:38.640]   That's what's wrong.
[00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:40.920]   You see, the text puts it so perfectly.
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:43.600]   "Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes."
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:45.000]   They put themselves up on a pedestal.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   "Look at me," they say.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.440]   "Am I not wonderful?
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:52.640]   Wise in their own eyes and prudent in their own sight."
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:57.000]   There's nothing wrong in being wise, but if you're wise in your own eyes, oh, you're
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.560]   in a very dangerous condition.
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:05.040]   It's excellent to be prudent, but if you're prudent in your own sight, well, then you
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:09.440]   come under the condemnation that is delivered by the prophet at this particular point.
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:12.960]   Well, now, then, I trust that that is clear.
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:17.360]   Far from saying that there is no value in intellect, I am going to use what little I
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:22.240]   have as much as I can this evening, and I'm going to ask you to do the same thing.
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:27.800]   Now, then, why is a woe pronounced from this?
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:33.200]   Why does God pronounce a woe upon those who are wise in their own eyes, who worship their
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.920]   brains and intellects and understanding?
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:37.340]   Humanists.
[00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:40.760]   Why does he pronounce a woe upon them?
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:49.120]   The first answer to that question is this, that this is the very essence of man's trouble
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:51.600]   and problem.
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:57.320]   This is the main cause of all the ills of the human race tonight.
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:01.940]   Now, it's a very interesting thing, this.
[00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:08.080]   You read the Bible from beginning to end, and you will find that it says that this was
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:14.200]   man's original trouble, and that it has been his trouble ever since.
[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:19.040]   The temptation that first came to man was this, "Hath God said?"
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:21.840]   In other words, is God trying to keep you down?
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:26.740]   Is God trying to stand between you and the knowledge of good and evil?
[00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:29.000]   Is God trying to withhold something from you?
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.080]   "Here," says the devil, "because he knows that if you eat of that fruit, you'll become
[00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:34.080]   as gods yourselves.
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:35.080]   You'll have understanding.
[00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:36.080]   You'll know everything.
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:38.320]   You'll be equal to God."
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:45.600]   That was man's first sin, and it has been the cause of all his subsequent troubles.
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:51.000]   You'll find all that described in the third chapter of the book of Genesis.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.840]   But now, let me give it to you in the New Testament form.
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:58.080]   There it is, running right through the Old Testament, but now let's have a look at it
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:59.080]   in the New Testament.
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:03.840]   Listen to the Apostle Paul, for instance, in the second half of his first chapter of
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:06.920]   the epistle to the Romans.
[00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:12.040]   He puts this very plainly and very clearly.
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:17.640]   He's describing why man has become what he is, and he says this is the cause of the trouble.
[00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:23.080]   "Because that when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful, but
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:29.160]   became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened, professing themselves
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:30.480]   to be wise.
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:37.080]   They became fools, but professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, and changed
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:41.440]   the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible men, and to
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:44.520]   birds and four-footed beasts, and creeping things.
[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:47.800]   Wherefore God also gave them up."
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:53.080]   There it is, "professing themselves to be wise, they became fools."
[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:58.200]   And then he puts it in the form of a bit of advice in chapter 12, and we probably all
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:59.200]   need it, don't we?
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.680]   Here it is in Romans 12, 16.
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:08.160]   "Be of the same mind, one toward another, mind not high things, but condescend to men
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:09.680]   of low estate.
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:14.800]   Be not wise in your own conceits."
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:19.480]   Same thing, same thing, wise in your own conceits.
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:23.600]   Trusting to your own wisdom, your own knowledge, your own cleverness, your own intellect, and
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:26.800]   feeling that you're so wonderful that you need no help at all.
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:30.720]   Well then, of course, it's still clearer before us in that passage which I read to
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:35.400]   you at the beginning after the first epistle of Paul to the Corinthians in the first chapter,
[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:39.280]   beginning at verse 17 and going on to the end of the third chapter, indeed right into
[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:40.640]   the fourth chapter.
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:43.440]   Here's the whole problem.
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:50.120]   This gospel and the wisdom of the wise, the Greeks, philosophers, dismissing it, foolish.
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:54.320]   Well, because they're trusting to their own intellects and their own understanding.
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:58.520]   It's always been the great trouble.
[00:20:58.520 --> 00:20:59.520]   The Bible's full of this.
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:03.560]   "No kind of person was more condemned by our Lord than the Pharisees."
[00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:05.120]   What was the trouble with the Pharisees?
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:08.040]   The trouble with the Pharisees was their conceit.
[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:09.640]   They thought they were all right.
[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:11.640]   They thought they were very wise.
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:13.720]   They thought they were doing everything perfectly.
[00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:16.000]   They were trusting to themselves that they were righteous.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   That's it.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   It's the same idea.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   They didn't need any help, and they resented the teaching of this upstart as they regarded
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   him.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   Who was he to teach them?
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.280]   He was the pride of intellect.
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:28.320]   It was the central trouble with the Pharisees.
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:31.760]   It was a manifestation of a curious kind of humanism.
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:36.120]   And then that case of the rich fool that I read to you out of the twelfth chapter of
[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:38.040]   Luke's gospel, also at the beginning.
[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:40.520]   Now, it's exactly the same thing.
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:47.320]   And so I say the case put forward in the Bible is this, that this is, in a sense, the ultimate
[00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:49.760]   sin.
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:55.440]   This is the thing that leads to all the other things.
[00:21:55.440 --> 00:22:02.280]   Man glorying in himself, glorying especially in his intellect and in his mind.
[00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:04.640]   You noticed how the apostle worked it out there.
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:09.760]   And you see, this is how it becomes the ultimate sin.
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:15.760]   It is man misappropriating God's greatest gift to him.
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:20.440]   God complimented man by making him in his own image, and he gave them this astounding
[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:21.440]   gift.
[00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:27.560]   This is the very thing that he uses against God for himself, and so brings himself down.
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:29.600]   It is the ultimate sin.
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:35.040]   Pride of intellect is the greatest trouble in the world at this present moment.
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:38.600]   Ultimately, it leads to all the other sins.
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:40.600]   Man's confidence in himself.
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:44.280]   Now then, why, I ask, is the woe pronounced upon this?
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:47.080]   Well, here are some further answers.
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:53.480]   Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes and prudent in their own sight.
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:54.480]   Why?
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:58.000]   Well, because they believe a lie.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.880]   Because they believe something that isn't true.
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:04.920]   They think they're wise, they think they're prudent, but they're not.
[00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:12.640]   Now this surely is one of the most amazing and astonishing things in the world this evening.
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:17.400]   Modern man is proud of himself, proud of his intellect, proud of his mind, proud of his
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:18.960]   understanding, proud of his wisdom.
[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:21.440]   He's superior to all who've ever gone before him.
[00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:24.520]   Now this is the thing, the problem that I put to you.
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:33.400]   How can it be the case that modern man can feel like that about himself with his world
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:36.560]   as it is at this moment?
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:38.800]   Have you ever thought about that?
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:43.600]   Man has never been so proud of his wisdom, his knowledge, his intellect, of himself than
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:44.600]   he is now.
[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:50.840]   Now, with the world as it is tonight, man's glorying in himself with his world as it is.
[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:54.520]   I say this is amazing.
[00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:58.640]   You know what the Bible says is the explanation?
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:04.560]   It says man glories in his wisdom and in his prudence because he's a fool.
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:06.800]   He's a fool.
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:10.960]   Any man who glories in his own wisdom is proclaiming that he's a fool.
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:13.720]   The wiser the man, the more humble he is.
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:16.680]   The greater a man's knowledge, the humbler he is.
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:19.640]   It's the men who have a smattering of knowledge who are always difficult.
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:24.680]   The man who rarely has great knowledge, he knows enough to know what he doesn't know.
[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:28.160]   A little learning is a dangerous thing.
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:33.400]   And so the Bible says that the man who doesn't believe in God and who isn't a Christian,
[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:37.320]   it says the ultimate truth about that man is that he's a fool.
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:42.160]   The Bible has got many terms which it uses about the sinner.
[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:45.080]   But this is the one it uses most frequently.
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:48.240]   The sinner is a fool.
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:52.640]   Our Lord put it in a word there in that parable I read to you just now about that rich fool.
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:53.960]   Here's a man bursting.
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:55.400]   "Salt, take thine ease.
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:58.280]   Eat, drink, and be many thou as much goods laid up for many he has."
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:24:59.280]   Congratulating himself.
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:00.280]   "God," saith unto him, "thou fool."
[00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:10.200]   The man who thought he was so clever is nothing but a fool.
[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:11.200]   He thought he was so wise.
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:12.200]   "I'm all right, Jack."
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:13.200]   That's it.
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:14.200]   That's the modern way of putting it.
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:15.200]   "I'm all right.
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:16.200]   Much goods laid up for many here.
[00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:17.200]   I've been so clever.
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:18.200]   I've used my mind.
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:21.200]   Oh, what a clever fellow I am."
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.800]   "Thou fool.
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:26.200]   This night thy soul shall be required of thee.
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:29.240]   Then whose are these things which thou hast provided?"
[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:30.760]   He's a fool.
[00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:36.760]   But here I say is this astonishing fact that man, with his world as it is, is proud of
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:41.640]   himself, his intellect, his understanding, and his achievements.
[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:45.600]   And the Bible pronounces woe upon it because it's a lie.
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:48.800]   "How do you prove that it's a lie?" says someone.
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:53.040]   "Well, I can do it, unfortunately, far too easily.
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:59.440]   I say that a man who's wise in his own eyes and prudent in his own sight is a man who's
[00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:05.040]   to be condemned because he condemns himself.
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:06.840]   He's a living lie.
[00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:10.800]   He claims he's wise, but how does he live?
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:11.800]   How do you test wisdom?
[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:14.920]   How do you test intellect and understanding?
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:18.160]   It isn't a matter, you know, of reading books and being able to give answers.
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:20.000]   That's the big mistake people make.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.240]   No, no, the way to test a man is this.
[00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:26.200]   Not what does he know, but has he the power to apply it?
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:29.000]   Does he understand it sufficiently to put it into practice?
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   I've known many men who were excellent examinees, but they were useless afterwards.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.360]   I've known men as medical students who could do well in an exam always, but clinically,
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:42.200]   face to face with a patient, they were useless.
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:46.760]   I knew men who used to learn things off by heart, and they could recite it like parrots,
[00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:48.320]   and therefore pass all exams.
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:53.200]   But when you put a patient right in front of them, they had no idea how to apply it.
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:55.040]   That's wisdom.
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:59.600]   The wise man is not merely the man who's got knowledge.
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:01.440]   You can get gramophone records to do that.
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:03.680]   They're now making machines that can do that.
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:04.680]   Quite right.
[00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:07.400]   In order to show that that isn't wisdom.
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:12.480]   Wisdom is the power of appropriating, of assimilating.
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:18.160]   The thing becomes part of you when it comes out as points of view and action and practice.
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:22.520]   So you judge a man's wisdom not merely by the number of books he's read and the books
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:23.920]   that he can quote and recite.
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:29.640]   No, no, you judge him by the way in which he lives.
[00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:34.160]   And what's it matter though, men may gain the whole world of knowledge and lose his
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:37.240]   own soul.
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:40.440]   What about mankind individually tonight?
[00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:42.720]   How are the wise men living?
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:44.400]   People who can tell us all about life.
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:47.120]   How many times have they passed through the divorce court, some of them?
[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:50.120]   Great philosophers, you read their records.
[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:54.040]   Never take a man's book alone, find out something about him.
[00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:56.720]   It's so easy to write books.
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:58.240]   Very much easier than it is to live.
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:00.920]   Yes, it's easier to preach than it is to live.
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:03.320]   But that's the test of wisdom.
[00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:08.320]   And I'm not interested in a man's claim to great knowledge and wisdom and perspicuity
[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:10.800]   and prudence and all these things.
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:15.120]   If he's failing in his life, if he's a drunkard, if he's an adulterer, if you can't trust
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:18.520]   him, what's the value of it?
[00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:21.440]   He says he's wise, but he's not, he's a fool.
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:25.520]   He's deceiving himself, he's deluding himself, and what about it all collectively?
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:30.280]   And the world is proud of its learning, but look at it.
[00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:33.480]   I go on saying this, and I'm going on to say it.
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:37.840]   While modern man is proud of himself and his intellect and his wisdom and his prudence,
[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:42.640]   I'm going to remind him that with all his wisdom and his prudence, he's already had
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:47.000]   two world wars in this one century.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.320]   And he's blasted more people to destruction in this one century than has ever happened
[00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:52.320]   before.
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:55.280]   That's your modern man with his wisdom and his prudence.
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:58.680]   That's what he does in practice.
[00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:07.480]   And here he is tonight, arguing about these missiles and these bombs and means of destruction
[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:14.960]   and this tension and insecurity and uncertainty and quarrelling and discord and moral muddle.
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.960]   And man boasts about his wisdom.
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:24.920]   He's wise in his own eyes and prudent in his own sight, with his world amiss.
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:28.680]   His world a kind of carnage before his very eyes.
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:31.320]   It's a lie.
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:33.600]   And that's why it is condemned in the Bible.
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:37.280]   It's boasting, it's talk, it's bigness with nothing behind it.
[00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:40.960]   It's simply profession, but there's no practice.
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:42.800]   But I can demonstrate it in another way.
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:46.320]   Man I say shows that he's not wise by the way in which he lives.
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:54.040]   But I can prove that he's not wise in another respect, and that is his failure even to understand.
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:57.200]   And he likes to think that though he's not a perfect saint, as he puts it, he's got a
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.560]   great understanding.
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:00.480]   But does he understand?
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:01.480]   Wise in his own eyes.
[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:02.480]   Very well.
[00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:05.480]   What's your view of yourself?
[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:06.480]   What is man?
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:08.640]   Do you understand man?
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:10.720]   Do you understand yourself?
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:16.280]   Does modern man really understand himself?
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:19.000]   Does he understand the meaning of life?
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.920]   What is life?
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:25.160]   What is this modern man who is so proud of his wisdom and of his prudence?
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:27.200]   What does he really tell us about life?
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:28.520]   What is life according to him?
[00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:30.320]   Is it a big thing or a little thing?
[00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:32.440]   Is it a grand thing or something ignoble?
[00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:33.440]   What is it?
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:34.440]   Where is his understanding?
[00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:38.920]   Where does he show his prudence and his wisdom?
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:40.840]   What is the whole meaning of the world?
[00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:42.680]   What is history?
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:44.120]   Is there any design in it all?
[00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:45.360]   Is there a purpose in it all?
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:51.320]   Or is it all just a bag of nonsense and anything may happen, pointless, purposeless, just blundering
[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:56.760]   along in any direction and nobody knows where nor what nor how?
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:59.280]   Where's the wisdom in all this?
[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:02.000]   What does man know about the most important things?
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:07.200]   I know he knows a great deal about electricity and about the atom and power and all these
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:08.720]   through scientific matter.
[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:13.000]   All right, I'm not here to criticize it, but when you're talking about wisdom, I say what
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.120]   I want is how to live.
[00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:16.120]   What is it all about?
[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:17.480]   How can I be a man?
[00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:19.240]   How can I find happiness and peace?
[00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:23.280]   How can I live in a manner that I'll not be ashamed of myself at the end of my journey?
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:24.280]   That's wisdom.
[00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:25.280]   That's prudence.
[00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:31.080]   And what does modern man know about this?
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:39.800]   But not only that, he doesn't seem to know anything about the cause of his problems.
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:47.240]   These people who've been wise in their own eyes and prudent in their own sight for the
[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:51.880]   last hundred years have been prophesying wonderful things for us in this century.
[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:56.120]   We were going to solve all our problems once you educated people, once you gave them good
[00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:58.680]   houses, better salary, everything was going to be solved.
[00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:02.920]   The Victorian thinkers, the philosophers, the poets, the politicians, the agnostics,
[00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:03.920]   they all said this.
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:09.060]   "The trouble with man is that he's too poor, and while you've got poverty, you'll get crime.
[00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:12.760]   If only men are given a decent wage, if only they're given houses, if only they're educated,
[00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:15.240]   they'll stop doing all this, they'll live wonderful lives."
[00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:17.200]   Well, we've done all that, haven't we?
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:19.640]   But the problem's greater than ever.
[00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:21.840]   You see, man doesn't understand his problem.
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:22.840]   Where is this wisdom?
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:24.520]   Where is this prudence?
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:26.880]   He doesn't understand his problem.
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:29.440]   Unless he's able to cure his problem.
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:35.920]   Now, I'm told that I mustn't criticize these modern dramatists and novelists and so on.
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:41.320]   I'm told that they've all got a moral intent, that they're all moralists, and that they're
[00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:42.720]   all trying to improve.
[00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:45.920]   Well, what's their method of improvement?
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:49.440]   Their method of trying to improve is simply to describe.
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:52.580]   But you know you don't solve a problem by describing it.
[00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:55.640]   You don't improve a situation simply by painting it.
[00:32:55.640 --> 00:33:00.200]   The business of the moralist is to solve the problem, is to get us out of the predicament.
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:03.320]   We don't need any more description.
[00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:04.400]   We know all about it.
[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:05.680]   The Bible's full of that.
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:09.680]   There's no need for anybody to write a book to tell us how men sin.
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:13.920]   It's all here, and not only is it all here, anybody who's lived at all, he knows something
[00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:14.920]   about it.
[00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:19.160]   You don't need to get novels and films and dramas and all these things simply telling
[00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:20.760]   you how people do things.
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:22.120]   We know all about it.
[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:25.600]   What we want to know is how to get out of it, how to stop it, how to be stopped.
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:29.160]   You may be delivered, but you get nothing from them but description.
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:31.640]   "Oh, I'm told it's very realistic."
[00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:35.720]   "Oh, all right, but it doesn't make any difference."
[00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:39.120]   What did you think of a doctor who, the next time you're taken desperately ill, simply
[00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:43.160]   comes to you and gives you a report and an account of your temperature and your pulse
[00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:47.860]   rate and your respiration rate and the color of your skin and the state of your pupils
[00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:48.860]   and so on?
[00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:52.640]   He describes your condition to you and says, "That's your condition.
[00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:54.760]   Very serious, very bad."
[00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:55.760]   And then goes home.
[00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:59.400]   "Well, all right, my friends, all right.
[00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:01.680]   I'm glad that you can see it."
[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:04.840]   But you see, that's exactly what our humanists are telling us today.
[00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:05.840]   I'll grant them this.
[00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:08.480]   They're experts at description.
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:13.840]   They can tell us and analyze the condition for us, but they leave it there.
[00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:14.840]   There you are.
[00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:15.840]   They say, "That's your condition.
[00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:17.320]   Get out of it if you can."
[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:18.800]   They have nothing to give you.
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:19.800]   Why?
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:23.320]   Well, because there is nothing higher than men, and it's men who's failed.
[00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:26.120]   The description has told us that.
[00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:33.000]   Very well, then, I say that this is something that the Bible pronounces a woe upon because
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:40.560]   it's a lie, because it isn't true, because the man who's so proud of his wisdom and
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:43.040]   his prudence hasn't got it.
[00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:48.180]   And he proves that he hasn't got it in the various ways that I have indicated to you.
[00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:53.440]   But come, let me give you a second reason why the Bible pronounces a woe on this kind
[00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:58.580]   of person, and this is much more serious.
[00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:03.500]   It pronounces a woe upon it not only because it's a lie, but because of that which it
[00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:07.060]   produces.
[00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:13.620]   It denounces it because of that to which it leads.
[00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:17.740]   This is worse than what I've been talking about.
[00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:19.180]   This is really the serious thing.
[00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:20.180]   Well, what is it?
[00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:23.380]   Well, first and foremost, pride itself.
[00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:27.740]   Pride is the greatest of all sins.
[00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:33.500]   Pride is more prolific in causing trouble than anything else in the world tonight.
[00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:35.220]   Pride.
[00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:37.900]   It's the ugliest of the sins.
[00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:44.180]   Pride and ambition, what havoc pride has caused in the long history of the human race, and
[00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:48.980]   this is nothing but pride of intellect.
[00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:53.900]   It leads to despising all who've gone before, and modern man is very fond of doing that.
[00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:56.700]   Nobody's known anything until he arrived on the scene.
[00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:57.740]   Despises his forefathers.
[00:35:57.740 --> 00:35:59.900]   You get it in every realm and department.
[00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:02.980]   They dismiss all previous books, all previous knowledge.
[00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:03.980]   Everything's out of date.
[00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:04.980]   Nothing's of any value.
[00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:10.780]   Indeed, there are foolish men occupying Christian pulpits who really are saying this in effect,
[00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:16.780]   but nobody really could understand the Bible until this generation with our modern knowledge.
[00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:22.440]   They dismiss 19 centuries of Christian exposition and Christian learning.
[00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:24.940]   That in itself is enough to put them out of court.
[00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:28.300]   Their colossal conceit and pride.
[00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:29.300]   It's ugly.
[00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:30.700]   Let me use a strong word.
[00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:35.820]   It is stinking pride, and God hates it.
[00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:42.540]   He sees a man standing up and inflating himself, and he pronounces his will upon it.
[00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:48.100]   And then you see it leads to self-confidence and to self-satisfaction.
[00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:52.940]   Our Lord has painted the perfect picture of this in his parable of the Pharisee and the
[00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:55.180]   publican that went up into the temple to pray.
[00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:58.820]   Look at that Pharisee going right to the front.
[00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:01.460]   Here's a man who's pleased with himself.
[00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:05.260]   Here's a man who's got a mind and a brain, and here's a man who's thought, and he thanks
[00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:07.620]   God that he is what he is.
[00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:08.620]   He doesn't need any help.
[00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:09.620]   He doesn't ask for anything.
[00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:10.620]   Why?
[00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:12.140]   Well, because he's got everything.
[00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:13.940]   He can do everything himself.
[00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:19.820]   That is of all men the kind of man that Christ denounced most bitterly.
[00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:27.180]   "Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!"
[00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:29.820]   That's what he says about them.
[00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:36.460]   And there is nothing more terrible in the sight of God than self-confidence.
[00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:40.680]   But you see, what makes this self-confidence such a terrible thing is that it always leads
[00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:43.780]   to rebellion against God.
[00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:48.100]   I reminded you at the beginning that that was the cause of the original sin.
[00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:51.860]   The devil came and he said, "Hath God said?"
[00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:54.340]   God's trying to hold you down, and they believed him.
[00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:55.980]   And they began to feel a hatred of God.
[00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:57.220]   They said, "We don't need him.
[00:37:57.220 --> 00:37:59.580]   If only we get this knowledge, we can go on without him.
[00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:01.140]   We'll decide then not God."
[00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:05.500]   So they put themselves up, and man's been on that pedestal ever since.
[00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:06.500]   Rebellion against God.
[00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:08.780]   This is the essence of humanism.
[00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:12.340]   The humanist is a man who says, "I don't believe in God, and I'll tell you why.
[00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:14.260]   I don't need him.
[00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:16.380]   I can carry on perfectly well without him.
[00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:17.380]   There is no God."
[00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:22.660]   "The fool hath said in his heart," says the 14th Psalm, first verse, "The fool hath said
[00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:27.660]   in his heart, 'There is no God.'"
[00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:30.500]   But you know, I know many people who think that nobody had ever said that until this
[00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:31.500]   century.
[00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:36.500]   "The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'"
[00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:38.180]   That's a humanist.
[00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:42.900]   No, David says that in Psalm 14 and in the first verse.
[00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:44.100]   It was true at that time.
[00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:47.260]   That was a thousand years before Christ was born.
[00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:51.420]   Nearly three thousand years ago, there were men who were saying, "There is no God."
[00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:54.020]   And David says, "Yes, the fool says that."
[00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:56.340]   That's the humanist.
[00:38:56.340 --> 00:38:57.500]   He doesn't believe in God.
[00:38:57.500 --> 00:38:58.500]   Why?
[00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:01.220]   Well, because there's no need of God.
[00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:06.540]   What does a man need God for who is wise in his own eyes and prudent in his own sight?
[00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:10.980]   If he understands everything and can manage himself and everything, well, you don't need
[00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:11.980]   a God.
[00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:15.340]   And that's been the increasing position of the human race for the last hundred years.
[00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:18.620]   Knowledge growing and advancing, developments, scientific knowledge.
[00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:19.620]   We're all so advanced.
[00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:23.420]   "Well, of course," they say, "there may have been a time when people needed God, but not
[00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:24.420]   now.
[00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:25.420]   And the same with all classes.
[00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:26.420]   Everybody's got enough now.
[00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:30.900]   We've got the money, we're getting better wages, we can get all we want and we can read, and
[00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:31.900]   we are men of knowledge.
[00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:32.900]   We are prudent.
[00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:37.340]   We don't need God."
[00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:40.260]   And that is the whole condition of the human race tonight.
[00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:43.260]   It is a rebellion against God.
[00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:47.260]   The carnal mind is enmity against God.
[00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:50.340]   Is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.
[00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:55.500]   And that is always an immediate consequence of this rebellion against God.
[00:39:55.500 --> 00:40:02.020]   The moment a man thinks he's wise and rebels against God, you know what happens?
[00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:05.220]   He begins to go wrong morally.
[00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:09.460]   The thing is very subtle.
[00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:15.700]   Because man in his folly doesn't realize that his real objection to God is that he's got
[00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:22.820]   to obey him, that God is a God of justice and of righteousness and of holiness.
[00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:26.660]   And the Bible tells us that God made man in his own image and he meant him to live in
[00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:29.820]   a some sort of manner like God himself.
[00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:33.020]   But man doesn't want to live like that.
[00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:38.620]   Man doesn't want to live an upright and a pure and a disciplined life and a holy life.
[00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:41.460]   He wants to give reign to his passions and his lusts.
[00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:45.380]   Desire, that's the thing, forbidden fruit, of course.
[00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:48.100]   The illicit, ah, this is love, of course.
[00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:50.340]   People don't understand, but this is true love, this.
[00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:53.180]   I thought I was in love before, but this is love.
[00:40:53.180 --> 00:40:54.180]   I've got it now.
[00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:55.180]   I thought I had, but I haven't.
[00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:56.180]   Ah, I've got it now.
[00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:57.180]   This is love.
[00:40:57.180 --> 00:40:58.180]   Let them do what they like.
[00:40:58.180 --> 00:40:59.180]   Let them commit adultery.
[00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:00.180]   This is love.
[00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:01.180]   Don't talk about law.
[00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:02.180]   Don't bring in your morality.
[00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:03.180]   That's legalism.
[00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:04.180]   Love.
[00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:10.420]   The answer is, of course, it's nothing but lust.
[00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:15.500]   And man, to suit his own lusts and his own convenience, tries to work out a philosophy.
[00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:17.460]   And in his philosophy, there's nothing higher than men.
[00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:18.460]   There's no gods.
[00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:21.180]   He's got nothing to fear, and all is well with him.
[00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:25.020]   But there has never been humanism without a moral decline.
[00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:29.580]   Now the humanists, I know, they claim to be very moral, and in their own personal lives,
[00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:31.400]   many of them are very moral people.
[00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:33.060]   But this is what I'm saying.
[00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:37.820]   The teaching of the Bible is that in every period when humanism has been in the ascendant,
[00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:41.180]   their morality has gone down, invariably.
[00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:44.860]   Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, says Paul.
[00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:45.860]   And then what happened?
[00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:49.480]   Well, then, you see, the moral declension came in.
[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:53.580]   They changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible
[00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:57.180]   men and to birds and four-footed beasts and creeping things.
[00:41:57.180 --> 00:42:02.180]   Wherefore, God also gave them up to uncleanness, through the lusts of their own hearts, to
[00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:05.100]   dishonor their own bodies between themselves.
[00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:09.980]   Who changed the truth of God into a lie and worshipped and served the creature more than
[00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:14.340]   the Creator, who is blessed forever for this cause.
[00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:18.260]   God gave them up into vile affections.
[00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:23.540]   For even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature.
[00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:28.540]   This is all the consequence of being wise in their own eyes.
[00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:31.920]   Thinking themselves to be wise, they became fools.
[00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:34.540]   Thinking themselves to be wise, this is where they came to.
[00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:36.100]   Now this is a fact of history.
[00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:47.420]   Some of your great Greek philosophers were moral perverts, high idealists writing their
[00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:54.580]   blueprints of utopia, and yet guilty of the foulest vices.
[00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:59.980]   It always happens, and on the description goes in that second half of the first chapter
[00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:02.300]   of the epistle to the Romans.
[00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:07.140]   The moral consequences always follow, and that is why God pronounces woe upon it.
[00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:13.740]   When man sets himself up as the final authority, he always descends into the abyss, invariably.
[00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:14.740]   Why?
[00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:18.860]   Well, because, as I have already explained to you, he cannot extricate himself.
[00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:19.860]   He cannot deliver himself.
[00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:21.260]   He has not got the power.
[00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:27.140]   Which leads me to my last point, which is this.
[00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:35.980]   God pronounces woe upon this pride of intellect, this confidence in human understanding, because
[00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:43.580]   it is the thing of everything else that causes a man to refuse God's way of salvation.
[00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:46.060]   This is the most calamitous thing of all.
[00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:50.540]   Here is man in his awful plight, in his terrible predicament.
[00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:53.220]   He tries to extricate himself.
[00:43:53.220 --> 00:43:55.860]   He perfects his educational systems.
[00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:59.300]   He multiplies his cultural media.
[00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:03.540]   Never has man been so busy in trying to put himself right as he has been in the last hundred
[00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:06.020]   years, and especially in this present century.
[00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:11.020]   Man has exhausted almost every conceivable effort, yet in spite of it all we see what
[00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:15.260]   is happening to the situation.
[00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:22.260]   And yet in this very situation, when the gospel of Christ is offered to him which can deliver
[00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:25.740]   him and set him free and save him, he refuses it.
[00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:26.740]   Why?
[00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:30.780]   Because he feels he is sufficient, because he thinks he is wise, because he thinks he
[00:44:30.780 --> 00:44:33.780]   is prudent, because he still thinks he can do it.
[00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:35.380]   Why doesn't he read history?
[00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:38.300]   Why doesn't he read his own books?
[00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:43.980]   History proves that man cannot deliver himself, try as he will, with all his might and man.
[00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:53.620]   All your great civilizations have gone down, and the present civilization is going down.
[00:44:53.620 --> 00:44:58.020]   But man still refuses the offer of the gospel.
[00:44:58.020 --> 00:45:01.660]   He still spurns the voice divine.
[00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:08.020]   He still laughs at Christ and ridicules the cross, and spits into the face of God, and
[00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:09.900]   says he doesn't need him.
[00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:12.220]   This pride, this is the thing.
[00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:13.860]   That's the trouble with man.
[00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:15.900]   It is his pride of intellect.
[00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:18.020]   He says, "I won't believe unless I can understand."
[00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:19.780]   He wants to understand God.
[00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:22.980]   He thinks he is so big that he can measure God himself.
[00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:24.700]   He can measure infinity.
[00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:31.580]   Pride of understanding, prudence, pride of intellect.
[00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:38.180]   And so man is under the wrath and the woe of God finally, because he refuses God's
[00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:39.180]   offer.
[00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:44.580]   God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believeth in
[00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:50.420]   him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
[00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:55.180]   For God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through
[00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:57.100]   him might be saved.
[00:45:57.100 --> 00:46:05.020]   He that believeth on him is not condemned, but he that believeth not is condemned already,
[00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:09.500]   because he believeth not in the name of the only begotten son of God.
[00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:17.220]   And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men love darkness
[00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:22.340]   rather than light because their deeds are evil.
[00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:24.580]   God pronounces the world.
[00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:28.180]   And I see this calamity coming upon this present generation.
[00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:33.900]   Here is man today, more than ever, standing up, pride in his own wisdom, wise in his own
[00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:39.740]   eyes and prudent in his own sight, saying he doesn't need God, saying he can order
[00:46:39.740 --> 00:46:45.980]   his own affairs, saying he can perfect his world, standing up and saying all this, refusing
[00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:51.460]   the gospel, ridiculing it, blaspheming it.
[00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:57.020]   And like that rich fool turning to himself and congratulating himself and saying, "So,
[00:46:57.020 --> 00:47:00.140]   thou hast much good laid up for many yards.
[00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:03.820]   Take thine easy drink and be merry.
[00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:04.820]   It's a good world.
[00:47:04.820 --> 00:47:05.820]   You're having a good time.
[00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:08.140]   Never had it better," whatever the phrase is.
[00:47:08.140 --> 00:47:09.820]   And here he is congratulating himself.
[00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:11.180]   The universe is.
[00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:24.340]   But God said, "Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee."
[00:47:24.340 --> 00:47:29.780]   And what if some of these great leading scientists today are right, and this universe hasn't
[00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:32.140]   got another ten years to go?
[00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:33.140]   What then?
[00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:34.140]   Where's your wisdom?
[00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:35.140]   Where's your learning?
[00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:36.140]   Where's your knowledge?
[00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:37.140]   Where's your understanding?
[00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:38.140]   Where's it all?
[00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:39.140]   When will you know?
[00:47:39.140 --> 00:47:41.140]   When will you understand?
[00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:42.140]   Where's it all?
[00:47:42.140 --> 00:47:48.420]   When God says, "Now, this night, you've got to go out of this world.
[00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:49.420]   You've got to die."
[00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:54.820]   Whether of a virus infection or an atomic bomb, it doesn't matter, but you've got to
[00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:55.820]   die.
[00:47:55.820 --> 00:47:58.540]   "This night thy soul shall be required of thee."
[00:47:58.540 --> 00:47:59.540]   What then, my friend?
[00:47:59.540 --> 00:48:00.540]   Where's your wisdom?
[00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:01.540]   Where's your learning?
[00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:02.540]   Where's your understanding?
[00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:03.540]   Do you know where you're going?
[00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:05.660]   Do you know what happens to you after death?
[00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:08.540]   Can you tell me what happens in that great unknown beyond?
[00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:09.540]   Here is wisdom.
[00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:10.540]   What am I?
[00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:11.540]   How do I live?
[00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:12.740]   How do I die?
[00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:13.740]   What happens to me afterwards?
[00:48:13.740 --> 00:48:14.740]   Where's your wisdom?
[00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:15.740]   Where's your knowledge?
[00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:16.740]   What are you boasting of?
[00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:21.660]   You've got nothing.
[00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:24.420]   Nothing at all.
[00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:29.920]   And God pronounces his woe upon it, and he does so in a very terrifying manner.
[00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:34.340]   Let me just read to you a few verses before I close out of the book of Revelation, which
[00:48:34.340 --> 00:48:39.100]   is the last book in the Bible, and the book which tells us of this day that is coming,
[00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:45.020]   when God will arise and say, "This night, this is what will happen."
[00:48:45.020 --> 00:48:49.980]   Let me read in the 18th chapter of Revelation, beginning at verse 18, "And the great men
[00:48:49.980 --> 00:48:55.220]   of the earth, we are told, cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, this great city,
[00:48:55.220 --> 00:48:58.940]   Babylon, civilisation.
[00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:04.460]   They cried, saying, 'What city is like unto this great city?'
[00:49:04.460 --> 00:49:09.900]   And they cast dust on their heads and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, 'Alas, alas,
[00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:15.180]   that great city wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her
[00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:18.300]   costliness, for in one hour she is made desolate.
[00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:23.060]   Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets, for God hath avenged
[00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:24.060]   you on her.'
[00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:28.300]   And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and cast it into the sea,
[00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:34.180]   saying, 'Thus with violence shall that great city, Babylon, be thrown down and shall be
[00:49:34.180 --> 00:49:36.380]   found no more at all.
[00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:41.180]   And the voice of harpers and musicians and of pipers and trumpeters shall be heard no
[00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:42.820]   more at all in thee.
[00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:46.800]   And no craftsman whatsoever crafty be shall be found any more in thee.
[00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:49.700]   And the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee.
[00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:52.900]   And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee.
[00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:56.940]   And the voice of the bridegroom and the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee.
[00:49:56.940 --> 00:50:02.300]   For thy merchants were the great men of the earth, and by thy sorceries were all nations
[00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:03.300]   deceived.
[00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:08.300]   And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints and of all that were slain upon
[00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:09.300]   the earth.'
[00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:14.460]   This Babylon of civilization is going to be destroyed in an hour when God arises.
[00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:23.060]   'Woe unto you that are wise in your own eyes and prudent in your own sight.'
[00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:25.060]   Is that the last word?
[00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:28.100]   Thank God it isn't.
[00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:32.100]   But that's the last word about humanism.
[00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:39.660]   It's wrong essentially, it's a fraud, it's a lie, it's deceit, it's a failure, it can
[00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:46.300]   do nothing, and it defies God and blasphemes him and is calling down wrath upon itself.
[00:50:46.300 --> 00:50:50.900]   But thank God it isn't the last word.
[00:50:50.900 --> 00:51:00.500]   In spite of this insanity of men, in spite of the fact that man is such a fool, a blind
[00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:08.420]   fool, God has mercy upon him.
[00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:11.100]   There is an answer to it all.
[00:51:11.100 --> 00:51:12.100]   You know what it is?
[00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:13.100]   Here it is.
[00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:20.860]   The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.
[00:51:20.860 --> 00:51:21.860]   That's the thing.
[00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:25.700]   Man has got to be awakened, he's got to realize it.
[00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:30.460]   He's got to see what I've been trying to say, that he's a fool, that he's a failure, that
[00:51:30.460 --> 00:51:35.340]   it's going to lead to a fatal end.
[00:51:35.340 --> 00:51:37.340]   And he's got to submit.
[00:51:37.340 --> 00:51:43.940]   'If any man willeth to be wise in this world,' says the apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 3.18,
[00:51:43.940 --> 00:51:51.620]   'if any man willeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be made
[00:51:51.620 --> 00:51:52.620]   wise.'
[00:51:52.620 --> 00:52:01.500]   Man's wisdom leads to nothing, but oh, there is this wisdom from God.
[00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:08.620]   We preach Christ crucified unto the Jews a stumbling block, and unto the Greeks foolishness,
[00:52:08.620 --> 00:52:15.340]   and unto us which have saved Christ, the power of God, and the wisdom of God.
[00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:20.060]   When the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching
[00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:22.180]   to save them that believe.
[00:52:22.180 --> 00:52:28.260]   When men had completely failed, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman made under the law,
[00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:34.140]   to redeem them that are under the law what is necessary.
[00:52:34.140 --> 00:52:36.500]   Well there it is.
[00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:41.540]   'If any man willeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, let him admit he knows
[00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:47.020]   nothing, let him become a barbarian, let him be dismissed by the Greeks as a barbarian,
[00:52:47.020 --> 00:52:50.940]   as a fool, let the wise men all laugh at him and say he's got a religious complex, or that
[00:52:50.940 --> 00:52:57.400]   he's gone soft or something like that, let him become a fool, that he may be made wise,
[00:52:57.400 --> 00:53:02.180]   that God may make him wise, that God may give him wisdom, and it's all in Christ.'
[00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:09.700]   And Christ himself, you see, put it like this, 'Except he be converted and become as little
[00:53:09.700 --> 00:53:16.380]   children, he shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven.
[00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:21.900]   Woe unto him that is wise in his own eyes.'
[00:53:21.900 --> 00:53:22.980]   What can he do?
[00:53:22.980 --> 00:53:28.020]   Let him become as a little child, let him admit he knows nothing, let him say, 'I'm
[00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:29.940]   but a child, I thought I knew.
[00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:33.220]   I was just fooling myself, I was drunk on my own intellect, but when it comes to the
[00:53:33.220 --> 00:53:35.180]   point I don't know anything about myself.
[00:53:35.180 --> 00:53:38.860]   I don't understand life, I don't understand the world, I can't do anything about it, I
[00:53:38.860 --> 00:53:42.900]   can't control myself, I can't improve the world, I see everything going wrong, I'm a
[00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:45.300]   fool, I'm a child, I know nothing.'
[00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:51.580]   Oh blessed men who comes to that position, 'Except he be converted and become as little
[00:53:51.580 --> 00:53:58.340]   children, he shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of God.'
[00:53:58.340 --> 00:54:03.660]   How can I get this wisdom that you have, says the learned, self-confident Nicodemus to Christ?
[00:54:03.660 --> 00:54:12.620]   This was the answer, 'Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born again, he
[00:54:12.620 --> 00:54:15.860]   cannot see the kingdom of God.
[00:54:15.860 --> 00:54:22.260]   He doesn't need an addition to his great knowledge and his great brain, he needs a new nature.
[00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:23.980]   He needs to be born again.
[00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:27.500]   He can't do anything, no man can do anything, but God can.
[00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:32.620]   There is a new birth, to be born of water, to be born of the Spirit, to repent and have
[00:54:32.620 --> 00:54:37.220]   the operation of God on you, when he gives you a new mind, a new understanding, a new
[00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:45.420]   heart, a new love, a new desire, God's wisdom in Christ.'
[00:54:45.420 --> 00:54:48.580]   That is the way to solve the problem.
[00:54:48.580 --> 00:54:52.980]   This is heavenly wisdom, this is divine wisdom.
[00:54:52.980 --> 00:54:57.220]   And it is still being offered to men and women tonight, in spite of all the arrogance and
[00:54:57.220 --> 00:55:03.660]   the pride and the conceit and the foolish self-confidence.
[00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:10.300]   The moment a man realizes the folly of it all and goes to God and admits it and confesses
[00:55:10.300 --> 00:55:16.220]   it and says, 'I'm a fool, I've been a fool in my mind and in my conceit, I don't know,
[00:55:16.220 --> 00:55:21.100]   and I'm vile, I'm unworthy, I'm sinful, the Bible's true in what it says about me.
[00:55:21.100 --> 00:55:24.380]   God, have mercy upon me, can you?'
[00:55:24.380 --> 00:55:31.740]   Well, God will give the answer, 'I can, of course I can.
[00:55:31.740 --> 00:55:36.980]   I sent my only begotten Son into the world to redeem people like you.
[00:55:36.980 --> 00:55:40.180]   You've become as a little child.
[00:55:40.180 --> 00:55:45.100]   So I offer to you in Christ my Son, who bore you as sins in his own body on the tree, I
[00:55:45.100 --> 00:55:49.580]   offer you free forgiveness, I tell you I'll blot out all your sins as if you'd never committed
[00:55:49.580 --> 00:55:50.580]   a sin in your life.
[00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:54.580]   I'll make you a new man, I'll give you a new start, I'll give you a new power, I'll open
[00:55:54.580 --> 00:55:58.540]   your mind, I'll give you an understanding of my own scheme, I'll open to you the very
[00:55:58.540 --> 00:56:01.900]   gate of heaven and you'll begin to look even into eternity itself.
[00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:05.860]   I'll make you wise.'
[00:56:05.860 --> 00:56:17.420]   If any man willeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool that he may be made
[00:56:17.420 --> 00:56:19.360]   wise.
[00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:32.100]   My dear friends, face the facts, repent, believe the gospel concerning Jesus Christ, God's
[00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:41.220]   wisdom, God's way of saving us out of the predicament into which our foolish pride has
[00:56:41.220 --> 00:56:42.220]   brought us.
[00:56:42.220 --> 00:56:50.660]   Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved.
[00:56:50.660 --> 00:56:59.180]   Sight, healing, riches of the mind, yea, all I need in thee to find.
[00:56:59.180 --> 00:57:06.860]   O Lamb of God, I come, say that I am.
[00:57:06.860 --> 00:57:10.780]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
