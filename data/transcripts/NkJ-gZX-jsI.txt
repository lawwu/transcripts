[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.180]   most people would like to be a millionaire or beyond.
[00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.400]   And they actually realize that you probably need less money
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.480]   to live a very satisfied life.
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.480]   That's why in the book I've talked about
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.640]   like the freedom number, 'cause you realize
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.860]   that number is actually a lot less than you think.
[00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.800]   What I've recognized though is that most people
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.200]   think it's this big, scary thing.
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.120]   What's crazy about entrepreneurship,
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.300]   you don't need a certificate.
[00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.480]   (laughs)
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.560]   Everyone has permission.
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.480]   We create this big, scary monster of,
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.840]   well, I've gotta be a talkative person,
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.480]   or I've gotta go be on Twitter,
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.560]   or I've gotta go sell, and that's just not the case.
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.200]   You can create a business, it could be a flower shop,
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.540]   and then keep your day job as well,
[00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.080]   so at AppSumo, where I work, we have this lady, Amy,
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.160]   she has a flower shop and a hair salon,
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.760]   and she's also our head of customer support.
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:38.880]   You have Nick Christensen,
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.080]   who has a teeth whitening clinic up in Dallas,
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.920]   and he leads our growth team.
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.640]   And so it doesn't mean you have to quit your day job.
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:46.760]   Ideally, maybe have both,
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.120]   but at least have that option available to you.
