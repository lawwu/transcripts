[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.480]   We have an email from Sarah in Fort Wayne, Indiana. She writes, "Hi Pastor John, in
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.480]   the previous episode, 'How Far is Too Far Before Marriage?'" which was episode 73,
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.680]   "you answered questions about sexual boundaries before marriage. I'd also like
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.640]   to know how far is too far emotionally and spiritually before marriage. I've
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.400]   heard from several people that praying together and reading scripture together
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.080]   can be dangerous to do as a couple before marriage. What are your thoughts?"
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:40.440]   Physical sexual intercourse is the natural, appropriate, longed-for completion
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:47.680]   and consummation of emotional and spiritual union. I'm starting with that
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:56.640]   conviction. That's why it is so wounding and tragic for men and women to have
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.040]   purely physical one-night stands or experimental sexual encounters or serial
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:12.360]   relationships. Women are made to long for the man she gives herself to to know her
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:23.440]   and love her for who she is more than merely her body. A woman feels used and
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:32.240]   abused, even in marriage I would say, if she believes this intercourse is just
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:43.360]   this man's animal appetite rather than the suitable consummation of a profound
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:52.880]   affection bonding, a soul bonding, a personal bonding. And men are made by God
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:00.480]   to wield their strength gently and harness their appetites and make them
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:07.760]   serve higher and greater things, like deep love for this woman as a
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:18.400]   person and a rich union of souls and minds. So sexual union is meant to be the
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:27.480]   completion, the climax, the consummation of personal, emotional, spiritual union. It
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.280]   should be an event in the body. The sexual intercourse should be an event in
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:39.720]   the body that corresponds to an event in the soul, in the heart, in the mind. It
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.080]   doesn't become less physical. I don't give the impression that I'm
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.280]   over-spiritualizing sexual intercourse, but I believe with all my heart. I've
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.080]   experienced, I think I could warrant it from the nature of human beings
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.120]   and from aspects of one fleshness in the Bible. It doesn't become less
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:02.880]   physical when you think of it this way. I would say it becomes more physical by
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.960]   being an organic connection with the totality of personhood. That's the goal,
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.920]   which is why adultery and fornication and one-night stands and serial
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.720]   relationships are just so heartbreaking and tragic and damaging and wounding to
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.520]   the souls of men and women. So now here's the question. What are the
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:27.080]   implications of that for soul bonding before marriage? That's what the
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.840]   question is as I understand it. Here's my answer. A man especially
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.720]   needs to stay awake to what's happening emotionally and spiritually and
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:43.740]   personally in the relationship. Don't take yourself, man or a woman, into a
[00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.920]   depth of spiritual emotional bonding that will not consummate in marriage and
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:56.560]   sexual union. Be alert that every step deeper into emotional and spiritual
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:02.440]   union with a woman's soul is a step toward physical union, that is towards
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:10.000]   marriage. Don't take her there. Don't go with her there if this is not moving
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:17.040]   towards marriage relationship. It will deeply wound her and you if you
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.320]   awaken depths of oneness with each other emotionally and then try to just walk
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:29.200]   away, walk away from it. Those depths are meant to lead somewhere, namely sexual
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:37.840]   intercourse in marriage. So that's why I think, Tony, casual dating, serial dating
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:44.560]   is either frustratingly superficial or emotionally painful as each one is
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.800]   awakened and then the heart is dropped and the thing is broken. So my
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:55.000]   advice is once you're on a path of sharing your soul with a future soul
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:02.400]   mate and both are realistically moving toward marriage and the consummation in
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:09.880]   sexual intercourse, that's where you're heading, a growing soul union towards
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:14.680]   sexual relations in marriage, I don't think there are any emotional or
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:21.960]   spiritual limits for the engaged couple. In fact, I think it would be a sign
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:29.280]   of danger if either said during engagement, "There are things about me or
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:35.920]   emotions that I experience that I can't let you know now." That I think would be a
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:42.960]   sign of mistrust and a sign of hiddenness which should give them pause.
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:48.400]   But here's the thing that needs stressing. I am distinguishing the
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:54.920]   physical display of emotion from the emotion itself, and the guideline then
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:03.920]   would be don't awaken in each other desires for union beyond what you can
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:09.160]   control. This is different from hiding things. You're not hiding anything. This
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:18.200]   is a wise, mature, sober judgment about locations and situations that you know
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:23.200]   are too explosive for you and your emotions because they could destroy your
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:28.960]   restraints and then defile the very purity of the gift that you both want to
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:35.520]   give each other on your wedding night. So my answer is no, I don't think there are
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:45.120]   emotional, spiritual limits, provided a couple is on their way in growing
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:53.560]   commitment toward a wedding and a physical union, and they know the limits
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:58.720]   of where they can go with themselves before the emotion takes control and
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:03.280]   forces them into bed with each other. Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for
