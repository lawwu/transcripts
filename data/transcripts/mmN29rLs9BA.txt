[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.620]   If you think about the difference between a leader and a manager, a manager is someone who typically delegates responsibility and authority.
[00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:25.700]   A leader is effective at synthesizing multiple people's points of view and creates an opportunity, defines a vision, defines an objective that is the synthesis of all the people that report to him and for whom he is responsible or she.
[00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:36.380]   And I think what we've seen in California in particular, and really across leadership positions or governing positions across the country during this pandemic, is a failure of leadership.
[00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:44.140]   Because when times are predictable, if A, then B, it is easy to manage and it is easy to look successful.
[00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.180]   I delegate down to the person who knows best and they are responsible for the outcome and they do it well.
[00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.760]   Great. All I'm doing is pointing to the right person to run something.
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.960]   The pandemic is difficult and it is unpredictable.
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:02.280]   It requires the synthesis of economic information, social information, and health information.
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:10.620]   And more often than not, a person who typically acts like a manager points to the person they think should be in charge under the circumstance to make a decision.
[00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.540]   And that person is not equipped to synthesize the economic and social ramifications of the decision.
[00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:24.600]   So what we have seen during the pandemic is most often people in a governing position have pointed to the health officer or the medical person and said, you make the decision.
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.940]   And that person does not.
[00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.760]   And that person does not necessarily account for the social and economic ramifications of the decision they're making.
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.820]   A health person knows how to save lives.
[00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.260]   The best way to save lives is shut everything down.
[00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:49.380]   And so the test of leadership during this pandemic has been a test of synthesis and recommending an action that's associated with the understanding of the social, economic, and health implications of what's going on.
[00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.780]   And that's really where so many governing bodies and individuals have fallen apart during this pandemic.
[00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.720]   So I'm going to stop there.
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:55.820]   Thank you.
[00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.920]   Thank you.
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.340]   It's an inability to do that effectively.
[00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.080]   And I think that is what is needed going forward.
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.920]   It is a moment of test, it is a moment of truth about the difference between a manager
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.920]   and a leader.
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.840]   And we're seeing across the nation who is what.
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.040]   And I think it is highlighting why some folks may not be best suited to do this.
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.740]   The second thing I'll say, and I know I'm on a little bit of a diatribe, but the second
[00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.640]   thing I'll say is career po--
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.320]   We've been waiting for your diatribe, by the way, it took 19 episodes, go.
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.480]   Career politicians, I think, simply should not exist.
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.900]   If you go back to the origins of this country, right, having your place in government, and
[00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.520]   we talked about this over email, having your place in government was meant to be something
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.200]   that everyone was supposed to take their turn doing.
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.140]   And the people that were sitting in political seats, it was supposed to be the merchant
[00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.860]   and the local farmer and the banker, and we were all supposed to take our turn representing
[00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.640]   our communities, representing our people in government.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.520]   And what we've seen is people who have made a career out of being a politician.
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.300]   And the result of that is that they're not going to be the same people that they were
[00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.300]   before.
[00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.860]   And the reason for that is that their job depends on them getting reelected.
[00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.680]   In order to remain in their career, they have to get reelected.
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.100]   And they ultimately end up making trade offs that don't necessarily represent the best
[00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.820]   long term interests of their community.
[00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.180]   And this is broadly true across nations across centuries.
[00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.920]   But it's particularly acute in the United States where we've seen such wealth creation
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.860]   over the last 250 years.
[00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.840]   And what's happened is when you have career politicians sitting in these seats for so
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.280]   long in an environment of severe wealth creation, you end up having governments that are ineffective
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.280]   and creating systems that are not effective.
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.360]   And so you have these people that fail us.
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.440]   And here we are.
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.940]   And what we need is to have someone go in that's not dependent on the traditional folks
[00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.260]   that get people elected and fund elections and result in reelections.
[00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.520]   We need someone that can go in as an outsider and make a change.
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.240]   And so my advocacy for what's needed in California, and I think nationally, and that's a longer
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.720]   conversation is to find those types of folks to come in and lead and be politicians that
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.340]   can take a leadership role, synthesize information and not be worried about the reelection cycle
[00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.260]   and not have anything to lose.
[00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.540]   related to a career in politics.
