[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.040]   All right, a question here from Monkey Mind.
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:08.640]   Hi, Cal.
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.480]   What do you suggest to people who pick up
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.040]   habits and suggestions you give but not stick to them
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.440]   for more than a few days?
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.040]   I tell them they're losers.
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:28.040]   I tell them they need to give up and just watch TikTok videos.
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.000]   No, here's the thing.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.520]   You're probably bringing it on too much at a time.
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.160]   It's probably unrealistic.
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.160]   And your mind is probably not on board
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.440]   with all the different things you're doing.
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.240]   So if you have all these big plans,
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.700]   there's a deeper part of your mind--
[00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.640]   the planned evaluation center-- that's probably saying,
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.520]   I don't know, Monkey Mind.
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.240]   This stuff is not all going to work.
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.040]   This is too much.
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.840]   And we're not going to do it.
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.800]   So you kind of overloaded that planning.
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.800]   So what I usually tell people is the foundation--
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.160]   the foundation to any of these type of professional style
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.840]   habits is daily metric tracking.
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.800]   That's the one thing you have to do.
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.400]   It takes seven seconds at the end of each day,
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.840]   or you can do it each morning.
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.800]   And you have some metrics you track, and you always do it.
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.400]   That's the thing you have to commit to.
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.360]   It's why my time block planner has this metric planning
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.840]   section on every daily page is you do that.
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.960]   Now, these metrics then can point towards the habits
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.420]   you're trying to do through the day,
[00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.160]   and you keep track of it with the metrics.
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.240]   Did I time block plan?
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.240]   Check.
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.240]   Did I do my whatever, my morning deep work session?
[00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.740]   Check.
[00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.240]   Did I do my exercise section?
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.720]   Check.
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:38.880]   How many chapters did I read?
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.680]   Whatever you're tracking, and you track it there.
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.720]   The key thing is you track it even if it's zero, even
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:44.440]   if it's no.
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.120]   And even if it's again and again, no, I didn't do this,
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.560]   I didn't do this, I didn't do this, that's fine.
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.960]   But you're tracking.
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.560]   Here's what actually happened.
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.560]   That's the foundation for any consistent habit formation
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.100]   when it comes to professional habits.
[00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.840]   Then you begin to experiment with, OK,
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.840]   what is the right first step collection of habits
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.840]   that my metric tracking, I eventually actually
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.960]   start positively marking those things down
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:08.880]   on a consistent basis.
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:09.800]   And you start small.
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.440]   All I want to do is a good morning planning session.
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.900]   And I'll give a check if I do that.
[00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:16.740]   OK, I'm doing that.
[00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:17.640]   I'm doing that.
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.120]   All right.
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.560]   Now all I want to do is time block plan my day.
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.840]   Let me check if I'm doing that.
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.560]   So then you slowly start seeing what works and what doesn't.
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.880]   If you try something and you have
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.800]   the evidence in your metric tracking, you're not doing it,
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.600]   you pull it back, let me try something else.
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.440]   You slowly build up these habits.
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.960]   But you have to have that foundation of I'm
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.920]   keeping tabs on a record every day of what I did or didn't do.
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.700]   Your mind knows it's being tracked.
[00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.960]   It's embarrassed if you blow things off that you could do.
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.080]   That is the foundation.
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.760]   So do the metric tracking even if you're
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.260]   embarrassed by what you're tracking.
[00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.480]   Slowly and experimentally add things into your life.
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.280]   Once something sticks, move on to something else.
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.240]   Give this a year of work and you'll
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.720]   come out on the other side with a pretty good set
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.720]   of carefully tested habits that work really
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.220]   well for you and your situation that you consistently follow.
[00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.160]   But it takes work and you can't do that work
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.440]   without tracking metrics.
