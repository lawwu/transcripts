[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.520]   Paul's epistle to the Philippians in the third chapter and the third verse.
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:17.320]   The third verse and the third chapter of Paul's epistle to the Philippians.
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:29.280]   "For we are the circumcision which worship God in the Spirit and rejoice in Christ Jesus
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:35.440]   and have no confidence in the flesh."
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.520]   Now in that statement we have one of the many summaries which are to be found scattered
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:49.400]   about so freely in the various epistles of this great apostle of what is the essential
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.880]   nature of Christianity.
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:58.800]   Or if you prefer it, we have there one of the many definitions which he gives us of
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.000]   what it means to be a Christian.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.200]   And that is the subject to which I would call your attention this evening.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.060]   What is a Christian?
[00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.000]   Someone may say, "Well, you often raised that question before.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.360]   You often dealt with that question.
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.760]   Do you still come back to that?
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.520]   Why don't you go on to deal with the applications of Christianity?
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.280]   Certainly," says someone in a world such as this is this evening, "this is no time
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.600]   to be raising that old question."
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.560]   As to what it is and what it means exactly to be a Christian, well, nevertheless, as
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:50.760]   I say, I propose to direct your attention and to call your attention to that very question.
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:58.040]   And I would give as my reasons for doing so the same reasons which the apostle gives here
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.440]   in doing it in the case of these Philippians.
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.760]   Now, let's remember that the apostle here was writing to Christian people.
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.280]   He's writing to the members of the church at Philippi.
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.840]   They're Christians.
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.280]   Well, you may say, and they probably very well said, many of them, "Why does he write
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.680]   to us about what it is to be a Christian again?
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.680]   We are Christians.
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.760]   We are in the church.
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:29.400]   What need is there to write to us about these preliminary matters, these primary questions,
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.160]   these fundamental matters?"
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.720]   And the apostle, anticipating that there might be some in Philippi who would have such notions
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:46.800]   and ideas in their minds, says this to them, "Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord.
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:57.480]   To write the same things to you, to me indeed, is not grievous, but for you it is safe."
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.720]   In other words, he's got two reasons for repeating what he's already told.
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.960]   He's got two explanations of why he comes back to something concerning which he's spoken
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:15.440]   to them so many times and concerning which he had even written to them before.
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.360]   Now you notice what the two reasons are.
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:24.280]   I hold them before you because, as I say, they're the two reasons that I would venture
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:30.000]   not being fit to be accounted in the same world as this mighty man of God.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.880]   But I can use the same reasons.
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.560]   The first is, he says, "To me it is not grievous."
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.520]   You can translate that if you like like this.
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.680]   "To write the same things to you, to me indeed, is not irksome."
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.040]   I don't find it difficult at all.
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.800]   It's not a difficult task for me, says the apostle, to write to you again about the same
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:51.800]   things.
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:52.800]   Why not?
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:58.060]   Oh, I'll tell you why, because he rather liked writing about them.
[00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.960]   You don't get tired of repeating something that you like, do you?
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.160]   If you like a piece of music, you want to hear it and hear it and hear it.
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.120]   If you want a praise, a person will.
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.120]   Nobody can stop you.
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.280]   You keep on saying the same thing all along.
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.160]   We've all known that in our experience.
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.480]   When we become interested in somebody, everybody's got to hear about it.
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.880]   And we're always talking about it.
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.200]   Well, it isn't irksome for us.
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.440]   We rather like doing it.
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.000]   And the apostle says, "To write the same things to you, to me indeed, is not grievous."
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.820]   He says, "I'm very happy in doing it."
[00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:35.520]   This man never tired of mentioning the blessed name of the Son of God.
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:42.400]   He never tired of talking about the cross and the resurrection and the glorious salvation
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.480]   and justification by faith.
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.480]   He reveled in it.
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.140]   This was his great theme.
[00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.120]   He was never happier than when he was handing these mighty matters.
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.920]   It's not irksome to me, he says.
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.200]   I rather like doing this sort of thing, so I'm going to do it again.
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.200]   Well, that's one reason.
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:04.040]   How sweet the name of Jesus sounds in a believer's ear.
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:09.160]   My friend, if you are beginning to get tired of hearing the elements of the Christian faith,
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.160]   you better examine yourself.
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.820]   There's something wrong with you.
[00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.560]   If you are one of those people who says, "Oh, I was converted years ago, and of course I'm
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.680]   not interested in the gospel message any longer.
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.680]   It's got nothing to say to me."
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:19.680]   Hasn't it?
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.720]   It's become irksome, has it?
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.640]   You feel like staying at home Sunday night, perhaps.
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.260]   You say, "Of course, I know all about that."
[00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:28.260]   Is that your attitude?
[00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.720]   There are many people like that in the church today.
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.120]   I'm not speaking to you now, I'm speaking to those who don't come Sunday nights.
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.160]   But there are many Christians like that, they only go on Sunday mornings.
[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.200]   Only Sunday mornings, you see, they know all about it.
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.200]   I don't understand them.
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:47.040]   It's a terrible thing when a man doesn't delight to hear the gospel being preached again, and
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:52.840]   the way of salvation being expounded, and the glories of the Lord being held forth.
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.080]   See, the apostle never got tired of it, he goes on repeating it.
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.420]   Not grievous to him, not irksome.
[00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:03.840]   Beware lest you ever get tired of this.
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.680]   It's a terrible state to get into that.
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.580]   Thank God we are met together to consider it once more this evening.
[00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.000]   But let me go on to his second reason.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.240]   It's more important in a sense.
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:20.640]   He says, "To me it's not grievous indeed, but for you it is safe.
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.120]   It's the only safe thing as far as you are concerned.
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.160]   I must do it because of my concern," he says, "for you."
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.360]   Now what's he mean by that?
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.860]   Well, the context tells us exactly what he means.
[00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:37.900]   You see, there were certain people in the early church who were going round the churches
[00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.180]   which had been established by Paul, not by them.
[00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:46.980]   He was the great evangelist, and the churches had come into being as a result of his preaching.
[00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:50.180]   These people had gone creeping in afterwards.
[00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.060]   And this is the sort of thing they were saying.
[00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:58.120]   These people, he says, "Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision."
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:03.120]   Now that's a bit of sarcasm, that word, concision.
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.660]   They called themselves the Circumcision Party.
[00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:11.600]   He says, "They're not the Circumcision Party, they're the concision."
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.960]   That's sarcasm.
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.020]   He's dismissing them with ridicule.
[00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.020]   But what was their teaching?
[00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:18.760]   Well, you see, their teaching was this.
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:25.520]   They said, "Oh yes, of course, the Apostle Paul, a great preacher, he's all right, but
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:29.720]   doesn't give you the full gospel, doesn't tell you everything."
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.040]   He says, "He tells you to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and you're saved."
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:39.360]   Well, of course, you've got to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, but you've got to be
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.360]   circumcised as well.
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:45.000]   They said, "We are Jews, we are God's people."
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.200]   And he was one of them, but he's forgotten his own background and he's been leaving out
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.440]   this which is so vital.
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:54.640]   "You can't become a true Christian," they said, "you can't be truly blessed of God,
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:08:00.840]   unless in addition to believing in the Lord Jesus Christ, you submit yourselves, you Gentiles."
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:02.600]   These were Gentile people, you see.
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:06.120]   He said, "You've got to submit yourself to circumcision, you've got to, as it were, become
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:10.800]   a Jew, and you've got to come back into this law and observe it in certain respects."
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:15.880]   Now then, this circumcision party, as they call themselves, the "con-cision," the "dogs"
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:23.200]   as he describes them, they have been troubling the churches, and they've been causing great
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.200]   confusion.
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:28.960]   Those of you who are familiar with this man's writings will know that he deals with the
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.480]   same theme exactly in the epistle to the Galatians.
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.120]   That was the whole trouble there.
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:37.720]   The churches were in a state of confusion because of this other teaching.
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:42.680]   And the apostle says that he's got to deal with this matter again because of the danger
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:53.240]   to the souls of these people from this wrong and false and erroneous teaching.
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:56.920]   Is the position different today?
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:00.840]   Would anybody like to say that there's no confusion at the present time as to what it
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:04.200]   is that really makes a man a Christian?
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:10.000]   Sure, there is more confusion about that very question this evening than about anything
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.920]   else whatsoever.
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.920]   Look at the Christian church as a whole, and this is what you find, isn't it?
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:21.840]   You find people in the name of Christ saying things that are diametrically opposed.
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.760]   There are those who say that Christ alone is enough.
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:28.240]   There are those who say you have to add the Virgin Mary, and there are others who add
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.400]   this and that and the other.
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.120]   They can't all be right.
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:42.200]   So it is essential that we should be absolutely clear about this thing because of the confusion,
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:47.120]   because of the doubt that has been cast upon the authority of the Scripture, upon the very
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:51.800]   person of Christ himself, the meaning of his death upon the cross, whether he literally
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:56.800]   did rise in the body the morning of the third day, whether the Holy Spirit is a person,
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.280]   and so on and so forth.
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:01.400]   All these matters are in question.
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.880]   So the apostle says, "I've got to do it."
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:07.560]   It's the only safe thing for you.
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:10.640]   But then that means something else, doesn't it?
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:14.760]   Somebody may say, "But what's it all matter?
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.000]   What's it matter what I believe?
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.120]   Why should I be bothered about the thing at all?"
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.760]   Now there's the serious question.
[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:25.920]   There are many who are saying that today.
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:29.400]   They say at a time like this, with communism threatening everybody, what's it matter except
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:32.200]   that we stand together and say we are Christian?
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.200]   Why do you go and divide amongst yourselves?
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.800]   Why do you say that you must believe this and you mustn't believe that?
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:41.280]   They say, "Surely at a time like this it's enough that we should just say that we are
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.280]   Christian."
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:45.600]   Well, you see, the apostle wouldn't accept that argument.
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:48.080]   He says it does matter.
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.680]   For you it is safe.
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:11:02.240]   He means this, that the whole safety of ourselves in time and in eternity depends upon the fact
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:04.880]   that we are Christians.
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:07.080]   That's the whole New Testament message.
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.680]   It proclaims it everywhere.
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:14.160]   Neither is there salvation in any other, for there is none other name under him given
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:19.160]   amongst men whereby we must be saved.
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:23.160]   That's why this is important, my dear friends.
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.600]   In the midst of life we are in death.
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.080]   We are in a tragic world.
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.880]   We are in a world that is so full of uncertainty.
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:33.160]   We don't know what tomorrow is going to bring forth.
[00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:34.640]   That's the sort of world we are living in.
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:39.820]   And the apostle says there's only one place of safety.
[00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:42.240]   It is to be in Christ.
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:45.160]   It is to be a true Christian.
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:50.360]   He says I'm doing it not only because it's not irksome to me and because I like doing
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:51.880]   it and because I enjoy it.
[00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:56.960]   I'm doing it, he says, because I'm concerned about the safety of you as souls, about your
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:59.200]   eternal and immortal destiny.
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:05.160]   Now that is the reason and the only reason for preaching the gospel at any time.
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:10.400]   God knows I'm not here to interest and to entertain people.
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:16.960]   I'm here, my dear friend, because I believe that we all have got a soul which is immortal,
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:24.560]   that death is not the end, that after a man dies his soul goes on and it stands before
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:31.680]   God in judgment and it is sent on to an eternal destiny either of joy indescribable or of
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:35.000]   misery indescribable.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   That's why I preach.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   It's safe.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.660]   It's the only place of safety.
[00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:43.820]   The alternative to being a Christian is to go to perdition.
[00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:48.720]   You see, it's not just a question of having a good idea, of believing something that's
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:49.720]   nice.
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.600]   It's not that you take up other interests in life.
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.800]   This is quite unique.
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:57.840]   May or you may not take an interest in politics.
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:02.160]   You may or you may not take an interest in art and in music and a thousand and one other
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:03.160]   matters.
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:06.080]   It's all right, it doesn't matter whether you do, it doesn't matter if you don't.
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:11.000]   But you see, that's not true of this matter.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:19.200]   This is the one question that decides a man's life and fate not only in this world but in
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:22.720]   the world to come.
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:25.360]   Eternal destiny, that's what this determines.
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.360]   It's safe.
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:28.360]   You see, the apostle says, "I'm bound to write to you again.
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:29.520]   I've told you this many times.
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:30.520]   I must come back to it.
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:31.520]   You're being confused.
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:32.520]   Some of you are being shaken.
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:34.400]   I can't let you be like that, Sisko.
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:35.400]   It's safe for you.
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:36.760]   At last, I must get you clear."
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:41.800]   So he puts it once more in this perfectly plain way, and that's my only reason for
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.160]   holding it before you tonight.
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:49.840]   The one thing that matters for every one of us at this second is, "Am I a Christian or
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:50.840]   am I not?
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:52.840]   If I'm a Christian, I'm safe.
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:57.640]   If I'm not, I'm in the most alarming position possible.
[00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.440]   And the sooner the better I get out of it."
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:01.440]   Very well.
[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:09.200]   Here I say the apostle gives us, therefore, once more a definition of what it means to
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:14.440]   be a Christian.
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:18.740]   You notice the implication, don't you?
[00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:22.480]   Christianity can be defined.
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.840]   Christianity must be defined.
[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:29.800]   Now, I know that when I say that I'm saying something that is utterly unpopular at the
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:32.040]   present time.
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:35.840]   The whole idea today is, "Can't define it."
[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:37.480]   You needn't even try to define it.
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:42.280]   You see, you mustn't become one of those legalistic negative people who says, "Everybody
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:46.280]   must agree with what you say, and if they don't cross their T's and dot their I's,
[00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:49.920]   if you do that, you're wrong, and you test them on this and that."
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:50.920]   That's the mood today, you see?
[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:55.440]   It doesn't matter what a man believes, as long as he lives a good life, as long as he
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.320]   wants to be a Christian, and so on.
[00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:59.040]   No one else is born.
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:03.680]   You see, this circumcision party called themselves Christians.
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:05.640]   That was the whole danger.
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:07.280]   They were not just Jews.
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:10.360]   They were Jews who claimed to be Christians.
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.120]   That was the whole subtlety of the thing.
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:14.000]   They didn't deny the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.960]   They added on this thing.
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:22.000]   So the apostle says, "We've got to be clear about it."
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.960]   And he says, "I'm going to give you another definition of it."
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:25.920]   And he does so in three points.
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:27.420]   He's got three tests.
[00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:36.080]   He says, "We are the circumcision already, of whom these one, two, three things are true."
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:39.480]   No.
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:47.160]   The implication I'm arguing is that Christianity can be defined.
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:50.440]   Christianity must be defined.
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:55.560]   Why the Church herself has believed this throughout the centuries, at every time when she's really
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:59.180]   been a living and a vital Church.
[00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:01.800]   The New Testament is full of these definitions.
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:03.760]   It's an argumentative book.
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:06.440]   It's full of what is called the polemical element.
[00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:09.500]   There was never a greater debater in this world than the apostle Paul.
[00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:11.680]   He's always having to fight against false teaching.
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:16.000]   He doesn't hesitate to do so, and he makes statements like this, as you remember in writing
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.300]   to the Galatians.
[00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:21.600]   He says, "Though we are an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:25.320]   which we have preached, let him be accursed."
[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:26.720]   What a statement to make.
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:31.600]   "Let a man be accursed," says Paul, "who doesn't agree with me."
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:38.040]   Now, he's saying there that Christianity can be defined, and must be defined.
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:42.360]   And I'm reminding you that the Church in all her great epochs has always said the same
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:43.880]   thing.
[00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:44.880]   The thing, of course, is laughable.
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:51.080]   There are many people in the world tonight, and in certain branches of the Church, they
[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:55.160]   say that you can't define Christianity, and then they get up in their service on Sunday
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.640]   and recite together the Apostles' Creed.
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:58.640]   What's that?
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:03.080]   A definition, a series of definitions of Christianity.
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:04.680]   You see the inconsistencies.
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:09.480]   Then they get up later on and they recite the Nicene Creed, or the Athanasian Creed.
[00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:10.480]   What are they?
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:11.480]   Definitions.
[00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:13.960]   Christianity being defined.
[00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:17.960]   Statements that it is this and it isn't that, and that this alone is right and that that
[00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:23.000]   is wrong, and you must avoid that as the plague.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.800]   And at the great period of the Protestant Reformation, the first thing they did was
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:31.080]   to draw up their Confessions of Faith.
[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:32.080]   Why?
[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:36.960]   Well, it had to be defined, you see, as against Rome and against other false teachings.
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:39.160]   So they all produced their Confessions of Faith.
[00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:47.880]   The Church of England drew up—can you believe this?—in this present age, thirty-nine articles
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:55.080]  —literally thirty-nine points of definition—saying what was wrong and what's right.
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:58.120]   But you see, all that's being denied today, and we are told that we're being narrow
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:02.280]   and legalistic and impossible and so on, if we insist upon this and that.
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:05.720]   My dear friends, if you are in that position, you're going back upon the whole teaching
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:13.720]   of the Bible and upon the whole glorious phases of the life of the Christian Church.
[00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:21.200]   The Trinity can be defined in terms, in propositions, and here the Apostle gives us three.
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:26.080]   Now then, let's have a look at them together.
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:29.680]   What is it that makes a man a Christian?
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:39.680]   He says the first thing is this, "We are the circumcision which worship God in or by
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:40.680]   the Spirit."
[00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:44.040]   What's he mean by that?
[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:50.840]   Well, let's try and analyze it briefly.
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:56.780]   You can translate it if you like this, "We are the circumcision whose worship is spiritual."
[00:18:56.780 --> 00:19:00.920]   We are the circumcision who worship God by the Spirit or in the Spirit, it doesn't
[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:01.920]   matter which.
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:02.920]   What's it imply?
[00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:04.720]   Well, here are some of the things it implies.
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:09.040]   You can't be a Christian, obviously, without believing in God.
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:13.760]   You hear me say to somebody, "Isn't that perfectly obvious?"
[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:16.360]   No, it isn't.
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:20.480]   There are many people today who regard themselves as Christians who don't believe in God.
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:23.760]   But you say, "That's impossible."
[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:27.440]   It is impossible, actually, of course, but it doesn't seem to be impossible to certain
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:34.400]   people, because they tell us that there are Christians who don't believe in God and
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:39.280]   that they hope to meet them in heaven.
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:44.080]   No man can go to heaven unless he's a Christian, and yet they say they hope to meet atheists
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:45.080]   there.
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:49.000]   An atheist doesn't believe in God.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.880]   So according to that, you see, you can be a Christian without believing in God, but
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:54.800]   not according to the Apostle Paul.
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:56.320]   Now what I mean is this.
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:20:03.360]   There are many people who really believe in nothing but in goodness.
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:05.880]   They believe in doing good.
[00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:07.400]   They believe in good principles.
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:13.000]   There's a great deal of this at the present time, and it's passing as Christianity.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.120]   Certain noble ideas, certain beautiful thoughts, desires within to make the world a better
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:23.320]   place and to do good and to withstand the menace of an atheistic communism, that's
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:28.160]   regarded as Christianity.
[00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:32.920]   I remember reading a book by a man some twenty years, or perhaps twenty-five years by now,
[00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:36.360]   which had a most arresting title, and it was a very wonderful book.
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:40.760]   The title was Religion Without God.
[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:43.640]   It seemed paradoxical, it seemed impossible.
[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:45.160]   You can't have religion without God.
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:47.760]   The men proved that you can.
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:52.080]   There are some people who worship religion instead of worshipping God.
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:55.480]   They're worshipping goodness, they're worshipping beauty, they're worshipping
[00:20:55.480 --> 00:21:00.560]   truth, they're worshipping good actions, noble ideas, uplift, moral uplift.
[00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:03.400]   There's a great deal of this in the world tonight.
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:09.360]   It calls itself Christianity, but it's nothing but what some of them call positive thinking,
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:11.960]   some form of psychological treatment for people.
[00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:13.440]   It's nothing but that.
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.400]   God really doesn't come in at all.
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:18.040]   But most of the apostles say, "You can't be a Christian.
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:23.240]   You can't belong to the people of God, the true circumcision, unless you believe in
[00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:24.240]   God."
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:27.320]   It's obviously the starting point.
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:28.640]   I needn't stay with this.
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:32.660]   I'm sure this is of no concern to anybody in this congregation.
[00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:35.400]   But I do ask you, my friend, to think again very seriously.
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.240]   Make sure of it.
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:41.460]   Are you worshipping God or worshipping religion?
[00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:45.440]   You can be religious without worshipping God.
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:48.000]   There are people who just go on round and round.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.640]   They don't stop to think what they're doing.
[00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:51.200]   They don't think of God.
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:54.280]   They don't know about God and their relationship to him.
[00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:56.840]   They're interested in religion.
[00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:59.440]   But you can have a religion without God.
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:03.560]   But more, and this is the thing the apostle emphasizes, because all these people claim
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:04.560]   to believe in God.
[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:10.200]   No, he says, over and above believing, you must worship.
[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.880]   Worship God.
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:15.320]   We are the circumcision which worship God in the spirit.
[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:22.840]   In other words, he says, there are two ways in which people think they worship God.
[00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:27.000]   And here now he's dealing directly with these false teachers who were troubling the
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.560]   church at Philippi.
[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:34.040]   You see, these people were trying to get these Philippians, these Gentiles who believed in
[00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:40.360]   Christ, they were trying to get them back to, or to feist upon them, the Old Testament
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:48.080]   Jewish way of worshipping God, which involved, of course, the temple, and the sacrifices
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:53.200]   and the offerings and everything that belonged to that cultus.
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:58.000]   And they said that you can't be a true worshipper unless you do that.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.120]   Very well, it's to counter that that the apostle writes in this way.
[00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:09.600]   But the point I'm emphasizing now is this, that in addition to believing in God, the
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:13.680]   Christian is a man who is concerned about worshipping God.
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:15.760]   What's that?
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:22.240]   Well, you see, you can believe in God and certain ideas that you think can be deduced
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:26.480]   from the Bible, but you never really worship God at all.
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:27.760]   You're just doing good.
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:29.840]   You're doing things every way.
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:38.160]   You've never any thought of getting into the presence of God and worshipping and praising
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:39.160]   him.
[00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:42.040]   Now, it includes public worship as well as private.
[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:45.560]   There are many people today who say, "We never attend a place of worship.
[00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:46.840]   Of course, we always believe in God."
[00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:50.440]   Haven't you seen that on some of these television and wireless programs?
[00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:53.080]   People have said, and they say to this man, "Of course, I never go to church."
[00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:56.600]   Well, the man says, the investigator says, "Well, do you believe in God?"
[00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:58.120]   "Of course, I believe in God.
[00:23:58.120 --> 00:23:59.640]   I always believed in God."
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:02.520]   "But you never go to a place of worship?"
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:03.520]   "No, no, I never go to a place of worship.
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:06.480]   But God is to be worshipped, my friends."
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:11.960]   And the true Christian, says the apostle, is a man who is very concerned about worshipping
[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:13.600]   God.
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:15.760]   He goes out of his way to worship God.
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:18.080]   He wants to worship God with his fellows.
[00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:19.560]   He's seeking to know him.
[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:20.960]   He's seeking to serve him.
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:23.560]   He's seeking to please him.
[00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:29.560]   As he pays his respects to anything or anyone which he likes and admires, above all, he
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:31.520]   wants to do this with God.
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:34.440]   He's a worshipper.
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:38.400]   You can't be a Christian without being a worshipper.
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:41.280]   The Bible is again full of that.
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:45.600]   The author of the epistle to the Hebrews warns the people against neglecting the assembling
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:47.560]   of themselves together.
[00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:51.160]   You know, this sort of private religion, there's no such thing.
[00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:56.200]   The moment a man believes in God and knows that God is his Father and he is in a right
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:25:00.320]   relationship to him, he's anxious to be with all others who are in the same position.
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:02.600]   He's anxious for others to come into that position.
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:05.560]   So he joins with others in public acts of worship.
[00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:11.240]   The church has been ordained by God.
[00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:16.960]   They're never true and genuine who tell us that they're worshippers of God, but they
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:18.960]   worship God on their own.
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:25.520]   I remember a lady once talking to me about thirty years ago, and she posed as an ultra-spiritual
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:33.600]   person, and she said to me, "You know, I rarely can only worship God when I go into
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:37.680]   a church on my own."
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:42.120]   I said, "I doubt very much whether you've ever worshipped God.
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:44.520]   True worshippers like to do it together.
[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:50.320]   'Come,' they say, 'let us go together into the house of God.'
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:54.920]   The psalms are full of it, everything's full of it, nature teaches the same thing, birds
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:56.560]   of a feather flock together.
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:26:01.960]   If you find you can't worship with others, there's something wrong with you."
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:08.280]   God has ordained the church, the body of Christ, and we worship him together.
[00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:09.280]   Worship.
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:11.280]   But here's the vital question.
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:13.280]   How do we worship him?
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:20.000]   Now says Paul, the true circumcision are those who worship God in the Spirit, by the Spirit.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:25.080]   He's contrasting that, you see, with what these Judaizers, this circumcision party,
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:26.080]   was teaching these people.
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:31.520]   They said, "If you really want to worship God, come back to the temple."
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:35.360]   You see, as people became converted, they left the temple, and they'd meet in their
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:36.360]   little groups.
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:38.360]   "Come back to the temple, come back to the synagogue."
[00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:39.360]   That was the teaching.
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:47.760]   "You must follow our form, our ritual, and all our cultures, so that we must be very
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:50.320]   careful with this first test."
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:51.920]   How does one worship God?
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:54.120]   How does the Christian worship God?
[00:26:54.120 --> 00:27:00.280]   Well, negatively, says Paul, his worship is never merely formal.
[00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:04.640]   It's never merely external.
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:09.360]   It isn't confined to certain buildings and certain places and to certain times.
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:14.240]   Oh, there's a great illustration of this in the fourth chapter of John's Gospel,
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:15.240]   Our Lord's Conversation.
[00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:20.680]   You remember the woman of Samaria, she was a Samaritan, and you remember what she said.
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:25.020]   She said, "You say, you Jews, that we should worship at Jerusalem.
[00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:27.960]   We say that you should worship in this mountain."
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:30.760]   And she was ready to have an argument and a debate about it.
[00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:34.960]   "The only place you can worship is in this mountain, and you Jews say, 'No, you've
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:35.960]   got to go up to Jerusalem.'"
[00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:39.600]   And you remember Our Lord's answer.
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:45.400]   "The time is coming," he says, "and now is when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem
[00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:47.560]   shall ye worship the Father.
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:54.400]   God is Spirit, and they that worship him must worship him in Spirit, and in truth, worshipping
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:58.200]   God in the Spirit," says the Apostle, "in exactly the same way."
[00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:02.280]   In other words, you see, it's not something formal, it's not something external, it's
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:06.840]   not something mechanical, it's not something that is confined to places and to days and
[00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:07.840]   seasons.
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:12.880]   It's not something that one does out of habit or custom or duty.
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:15.520]   Let me put it bluntly like this.
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:22.040]   Truly worship is not just a parade service, which a man does because it's a part of doing
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:23.040]   his duty.
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:28.920]   He doesn't really want to do it, doesn't get much out of it, but it's the thing to
[00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:29.920]   do.
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:37.760]   It's a part of the social round that you go to church on Sunday morning.
[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:41.280]   That's not worship, my friends.
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:44.840]   There's no life in it, there's no heart in it.
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:50.600]   It's all a matter of buildings, places, forms, ceremonies, rituals.
[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:56.280]   It's cold, it's lifeless, it's impersonal.
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:59.000]   They don't stop to think what they're doing, they don't think at all.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.840]   It all passes over their heads, as it were.
[00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:03.160]   They hear sounds, but they don't engage.
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:06.040]   There's no living communion, there's no worship.
[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:10.760]   It's that other type, that false thing, the thing that these people were trying to feist
[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:13.400]   upon the members of the church at Philippi.
[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:16.480]   That's not the way the Christian worships his Paul.
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:17.840]   How does he worship them?
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:24.040]   Oh, he worships God in the spirit or by the spirit.
[00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:25.040]   Watch this.
[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:26.680]   Here's the test.
[00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:29.720]   It's personal.
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:38.840]   It's based upon a real desire for God, a desire to know God, a desire to speak to God.
[00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:44.640]   It's something which is thoughtful, something concentrated, something which is living, something
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:49.720]   which is vital, something which has warmth and a glow in it, a man's personality is in
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:50.720]   it.
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:55.920]   He desires this, he longs to be in communion with God and to know him and to praise him.
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:58.720]   He wants to know him and his presence.
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:05.040]   That's worshiping in the spirit.
[00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:07.600]   Do we worship God in the spirit?
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:12.600]   Haven't you often found yourself doing this?
[00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:18.040]   "God, have mercy upon me, I've done it thousands of times myself.
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:22.600]   I've literally at the end of the day got on my knees by the side of a bed and I've said
[00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:27.440]   my prayers without thinking at all as to what I was saying."
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:31.440]   I've repeated it mechanically with my mind elsewhere.
[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:34.000]   Haven't we all done that?
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.800]   That's not worship.
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:40.040]   That's going through the fall.
[00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:44.520]   And it's a terrible possibility that because we've been brought up to these things that
[00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:46.800]   we may just go and do them, we think we've worshipped God.
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:49.480]   But have we really thought about God?
[00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:51.200]   Have we thought about his being?
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:53.840]   Have we thought about our relationship to him?
[00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:56.040]   Have we really desired him?
[00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:57.720]   Have we really sought him?
[00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:00.000]   Have we felt ourselves moved?
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   Have we been conscious?
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.120]   That's worshipping in the spirit.
[00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:05.800]   You can do it anywhere.
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:10.720]   You mustn't have a necessity of a certain kind of building, certain form, ritual, ceremony.
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:11.720]   No, no.
[00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:12.720]   It's out of the heart.
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:13.720]   It's a spiritual thing.
[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:18.720]   It's the heart of men crying out for the living God and speaking to him.
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:20.000]   That's spiritual worship.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:26.160]   We worship God in the spirit.
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:30.520]   You can't be a Christian unless you worship God like that.
[00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:35.000]   You can be good, you can be moral, you can be religious.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:43.040]   But the true circumcision is that which worships God in or by the spirit.
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:49.840]   You're active, you're personal, you're involved, you're desiring.
[00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:53.920]   It's the biggest thing in your life.
[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:56.880]   Let me hurry to the second thing.
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:00.200]   And here I deliberately change the order of the apostle, and I'll give you my reason
[00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:01.200]   for doing it.
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:05.520]   I take secondly and have no confidence in the flesh.
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:06.880]   Why did the apostle put it third?
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:09.360]   You say, "If you are now putting it second, I'll tell you."
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:12.440]   He does it for the sake of the particular argument he's got here.
[00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:16.880]   He's going on, you see, to say, "Though I might also have confidence in the flesh."
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:19.400]   It's a very good thing sometimes to end on a negative.
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:22.080]   You put your positive first, then you end with your negative.
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:25.000]   I want to end with a positive tonight.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   So I take this second.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.800]   He has no confidence in the flesh.
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:32.200]   Here's the second characteristic of the Christian.
[00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:34.840]   What's it mean?
[00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:38.200]   It means this.
[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:49.680]   That in this whole matter of our relationship to God, we have no confidence whatsoever in
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:50.680]   the flesh.
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:52.880]   What does he mean by the flesh?
[00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:55.680]   Well, he goes on to tell us.
[00:32:55.680 --> 00:33:03.960]   In my relationship to God as a Christian, I must have no confidence at all in my nationality.
[00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:10.480]   "Though I might also have confidence in the flesh, if any other men thinketh he hath
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:14.920]   whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more circumcised the eighth day of the stock of
[00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:15.920]   Israel."
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:20.000]   There you are, a Jew.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.840]   And that was the whole tragedy of the Jews.
[00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:26.200]   They relied upon the fact that they were Jews.
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:28.560]   They said, "Because we are Jews, we are God's people.
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:31.360]   All the others are dogs, they're outsiders, those Gentiles.
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:33.360]   They're beyond the pale, they're barbarians.
[00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:35.920]   No, no, we are God's people.
[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:36.920]   Because, why?
[00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:39.920]   Well, because I'm born a Jew, because I'm an Israelite.
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:42.760]   Born an Israelite of this particular tribe.
[00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:45.320]   Why that's the thing that makes me a Christian."
[00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:49.640]   Oh, I mustn't insult your intelligence.
[00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:54.720]   I don't believe there's anybody in this building who thinks he or she is a Christian,
[00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:59.440]   simply because you happen to have been born in this country.
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:01.720]   That doesn't make you Christian, does it?
[00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:03.280]   People used to think that, you know.
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:06.320]   They used to talk about Christian countries, Christian nations.
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:08.160]   It's laughable to do that today.
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:11.680]   Ninety percent of the people of this country don't even pretend to be Christians.
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:13.640]   You don't have a Christian country, therefore.
[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:15.720]   Thank God, that's gone.
[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:16.720]   That isn't what does it.
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:20.320]   I'm not a Christian because I'm born in Great Britain.
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:23.200]   And I wouldn't have been not a Christian because I happen to have been born in Japan.
[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:25.480]   It's got nothing to do with it.
[00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:31.240]   You can be a heathen in Britain as you can be anywhere else in the world.
[00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:32.240]   Then what about birth?
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:42.280]   Are not all the children of those who are Christians automatically Christians?
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:45.240]   The answer of the Bible everywhere is no.
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:47.320]   But there are many who believe that.
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:50.200]   They believe that the children of Christians are all Christians.
[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:54.440]   How they can believe it in the light of the evidence to the contrary, I can't imagine.
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:56.320]   There's much evidence of that in the Bible.
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:35:00.680]   You get a saintly father producing a most profligate son, and yet they go on believing
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:01.680]   it.
[00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:03.040]   I trust nobody believes that.
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:07.600]   You may have had the most saintly parents and forebears.
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:10.920]   It doesn't guarantee anything about you, my friend.
[00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:11.920]   Thank God for this.
[00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:14.480]   We are not saved in families.
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:17.760]   You can't ride into heaven on the back of a saintly father or mother.
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:21.200]   The great God Almighty, he wants to deal with you.
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:23.720]   He deals with us one by one, doesn't matter who we are.
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:24.720]   He gives us that dignity.
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:27.320]   I've got to meet him for myself.
[00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:28.320]   Nobody can do it for me.
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:31.680]   There's no such thing as being a Christian by proxy.
[00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:40.040]   Birth, parentage don't help at this point, and I must have no confidence in them.
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:42.520]   The church is full of this, of course.
[00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:47.760]   Titles and positions pass from father to son, and down it goes.
[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:51.280]   People are given positions in the church simply because they happen to be so and so.
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:53.640]   It's a denial of the gospel.
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:58.200]   It's the flesh.
[00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:05.800]   Circumcision, or to put that in its modern form, christening.
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:09.560]   Am I made a Christian by the fact that I'm christened?
[00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:14.920]   The answer to the Bible is no, no more than a man who was an Israelite was made an Israelite
[00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:17.920]   indeed by being circumcised.
[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:24.320]   Circumcision says Paul at the end of Romans 2 is not that in the flesh, but in the heart.
[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:27.640]   And if you're not circumcised in the heart, it doesn't matter what's true about your
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:29.600]   flesh, it's equally true here.
[00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:34.840]   You can be christened and be a heathen, and there are many such.
[00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:37.360]   That's the flesh.
[00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:38.440]   Nobody can do this for you.
[00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:41.520]   I would add to that, baptism, even adult baptism.
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:44.440]   That doesn't guarantee that you're a Christian.
[00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:49.120]   You see, that's that full sacramental teaching that really belongs to Rome, that something
[00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:50.820]   done to you makes you a Christian.
[00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:54.840]   Something done by men, that's the flesh, it doesn't make you a Christian.
[00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:57.120]   No confidence in the flesh.
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:58.760]   Church membership.
[00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:02.200]   I was received into the church when I was fifteen, sixteen.
[00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:05.160]   My parents and the minister agreed together that I was fit to be a member.
[00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:10.720]   I was received, incidentally I myself was received like that at the age of fourteen,
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:14.440]   and I knew nothing about it, nothing at all.
[00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:17.160]   I don't rely on my church membership.
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:19.160]   That's the flesh.
[00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:20.720]   That's not the spirit.
[00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:23.680]   Well, what about my life?
[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:27.040]   Don't I make myself a Christian by living a good life?
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:28.600]   Isn't that sufficient?
[00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:31.720]   Isn't that the way to do it?
[00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:33.320]   What about all my good deeds?
[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:34.920]   What about the sins I haven't committed?
[00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:38.840]   Of course, I can see quite clearly there are certain people who are obviously not Christians.
[00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:42.080]   See that man rolling down the street, night after night, drunk.
[00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:46.560]   Look at that poor fallen woman, obviously not a Christian, living, earning her money
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:50.360]   by this illicit manner, obviously not a Christian.
[00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:51.840]   But I've never done those things.
[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:52.840]   I've lived a good life.
[00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:53.840]   I've done good.
[00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:54.840]   I've helped others.
[00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:56.240]   I protest against injustices.
[00:37:56.240 --> 00:38:01.000]   I'm full of Christian action.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   The answer to the Bible is that the Christian has no confidence in the flesh.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.880]   None at all.
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:09.280]   It doesn't matter what he's done.
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:13.760]   This apostle here says it in the most glorious way that it's been ever said, "Yea, doubtless
[00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:22.040]   and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord,
[00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:25.760]   for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and to count them but done."
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:26.760]   What's he including?
[00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:31.560]   He's including this, concerning zeal, persecuting the church, touching the righteousness which
[00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:32.560]   is in the Lord.
[00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:33.560]   Blameless!
[00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:34.560]   But it's done.
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:35.560]   It's refuse.
[00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:36.560]   It's nothing.
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:45.840]   He has no confidence in the flesh.
[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:46.840]   None at all.
[00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:56.600]   My dear friend, I don't apologize for pausing to ask you the question.
[00:38:56.600 --> 00:39:02.160]   What are you relying on in your relationship to God at this moment?
[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:05.520]   What are you going to say to God when you stand before him?
[00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:09.360]   This is the question I always ask people in order to determine whether they're Christian
[00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:10.360]   or not.
[00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:16.040]   I say to them, let me repeat it, I've said this before, I say it again.
[00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:19.360]   When people come to me and they're not quite clear as to whether they're Christian or not,
[00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:22.560]   they come to me and say, "Now look here, I'm unhappy about this, I'm not clear.
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:25.520]   I'd like to know whether I am a Christian or not."
[00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:29.840]   Well, I say, this is how we answer the question.
[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:39.240]   If you had to die tonight, you've got to die sometime, what if you had to die tonight and
[00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:46.760]   find yourself standing in the presence of God, what would you say?
[00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:48.120]   And they begin to answer me.
[00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:53.920]   They say, "Well, I've always tried to live a good life.
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:56.920]   I've tried my best not to sin.
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:40:01.560]   I've asked God to forgive me when I have sinned.
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:05.480]   I've done my best to improve the lot of men in the world and to make the world a better
[00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:06.480]   place."
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:08.680]   And so on and so forth.
[00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:09.680]   And I say, "Is that all?"
[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:10.680]   "Yes."
[00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:15.080]   I say, "Well, what are you really relying on then to satisfy God?"
[00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:20.720]   And you see, the answer is, they're relying on what they've done and what they are.
[00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:25.560]   And that is nothing but confidence in the flesh.
[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:31.480]   It's confidence in yourself, confidence in what you are, the nice person you are, confidence
[00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:37.320]   in the good you've done, confidence in the sin that you haven't committed, as it were,
[00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:40.400]   confidence in all that you've achieved.
[00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:41.760]   Never done anybody any harm.
[00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:42.760]   I don't care what you say.
[00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:48.880]   Anything that you tell me about yourself at this point, I'm sorry, my dear friend, but
[00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:51.060]   you're out.
[00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:58.080]   The Christian has no confidence whatsoever in the flesh.
[00:40:58.080 --> 00:40:59.880]   None at all.
[00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:04.800]   If ever a man had had a right to be confident in the flesh, as he says here, it was this
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:05.800]   apostle Paul.
[00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:12.280]   Here was a man who, it seems to us, had every reason for bursting of what he'd been and
[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:13.280]   done.
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:15.000]   He says, "It's refuse and done.
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.200]   I have no confidence in the flesh."
[00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:22.080]   And we must have no confidence in the flesh when we are face to face with God.
[00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:24.880]   You mustn't mention any one of these things I've been talking about.
[00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:28.240]   You must realize that though you've been born and brought up in this country, you're in
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:32.320]   the identical position of a man brought up in the heart of Africa who's never heard of
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:35.860]   a Bible and who can't read or write.
[00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:39.800]   You must realize that though you've always tried to live a good life in the sight of
[00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:45.600]   God, you are no different from the most utter profligate sinner, the greatest wester that
[00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:47.920]   the world knows this evening.
[00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:50.920]   None at all.
[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:53.360]   There is none righteous, no, not one.
[00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:58.200]   All have sinned and have come short of the glory of God.
[00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:03.040]   The whole world lieth guilty before God.
[00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:04.880]   Are you still standing on your feet?
[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:07.040]   Are you still relying on anything in yourself?
[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:09.960]   If you are, you're not a Christian.
[00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:10.960]   It's quite definite.
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:14.080]   It's the apostle's teaching, and he's an inspired apostle.
[00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:16.160]   It's the teaching of the whole of the New Testament.
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:19.200]   Why, if this isn't true, the Son of God need never have come.
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:22.240]   No confidence in the flesh whatsoever.
[00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:23.960]   That brings me to my last point.
[00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:26.080]   Here it is, you see.
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:38.720]   We are the circumcision who worship God in the Spirit and rejoice in Christ Jesus.
[00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:41.360]   It's a great word, this word translated rejoice.
[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:45.240]   A better word is make our best.
[00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:50.960]   We are the circumcision who worship God in the Spirit, who make our best in Christ Jesus,
[00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:53.280]   and have no confidence in the flesh.
[00:42:53.280 --> 00:43:01.040]   Now, this of course is absolutely crucial.
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:11.120]   The question of Christians, as I'm repeating, is on what do you rely as you face God?
[00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:16.000]   And the Christian has only got one answer.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.520]   It is Christ Jesus.
[00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:19.760]   Why?
[00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:25.200]   Well, because there's nothing apart from him.
[00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:30.480]   There is no knowledge of God apart from him.
[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:34.920]   There is no true worship except it is through him.
[00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:38.200]   There is no communion with God apart from him.
[00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:42.040]   Now, I'm not making these statements, I'm just putting in my own words what the Scripture
[00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:43.040]   teaches.
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:45.040]   Listen to our Lord saying it himself.
[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:48.240]   "I am the way and the truth and the life.
[00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:53.880]   No man cometh unto the Father but by me."
[00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:56.600]   Isn't that sufficiently categorical?
[00:43:56.600 --> 00:44:02.760]   No man can come unto the Father but by me.
[00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:05.720]   I say there's no communion with God, there's no worship.
[00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:06.720]   Why?
[00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:11.960]   Listen to the Hebrew, it says, "Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest
[00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:18.880]   of all by the blood of Jesus."
[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:29.920]   There is one God and one and only one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.
[00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:32.040]   There's no other.
[00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:34.840]   You see, we can't know God without a mediator.
[00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:36.720]   God is holy and we are sinful.
[00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:39.080]   God is eternal light and we are darkness.
[00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:40.620]   We need a mediator.
[00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:44.560]   We need someone to bring us to God and there's only one.
[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:48.300]   That is why the Christian rejoiceth in Christ Jesus.
[00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:51.200]   It makes his best in him and of him.
[00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:53.400]   Oh, why am I preaching like this?
[00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:54.480]   Well, I'll tell you.
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:45:00.040]   You see, we are surrounded by people almost everywhere in the world at the present time
[00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:05.720]   who talk and talk about Christianity but who never mention Christ Jesus.
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:12.440]   I hear people saying there was a fine sermon that was a wonderful address but Christ Jesus
[00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:13.880]   wasn't even mentioned in it.
[00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:18.920]   How can it be a fine sermon if he isn't the center and the soul and the heart and
[00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:19.920]   the everything?
[00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:22.640]   The Christian is a man who rejoices in Christ.
[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:30.440]   He makes his best only in him, entirely, utterly in him, exclusively in him.
[00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:32.600]   He is his all and in all.
[00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:36.800]   The alpha, the omega, the beginning, the end, the first, the last.
[00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:39.800]   There's nothing without him.
[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:41.800]   What's it mean?
[00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:51.560]   Well, you see, it means this, that you believe in him and the truth concerning him.
[00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:56.200]   You can't rejoice in him unless you believe in him.
[00:45:56.200 --> 00:46:03.040]   And to believe in him means to believe the record we have given of him in this world.
[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:12.720]   Believe what it tells you about his person, that he is the eternal son of God, that he
[00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:20.680]   was made flesh, born as a babe of a virgin, that he manifested his glory by the performance
[00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:26.240]   of miracles, that he taught in a manner that no man had ever taught, making a Roman official
[00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:28.320]   say never man should act like this man.
[00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:29.920]   You believe all that.
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:34.600]   The attestation of the person as given in his acts and in his teaching as recorded in
[00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:36.960]   the four Gospels.
[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:41.960]   But still more important, that's essential, that you believe in the incarnation, that
[00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:46.660]   you believe that at that given point in time the second person in the blessed holy trinity
[00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:51.440]   left the courts of heaven and came down on earth to dwell, the whole marvel of it all,
[00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:59.000]   and the miracle of it all, you believe it all, and then you come to his work.
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:05.680]   You look at him dying on that cross on Calvary's Hill, and you believe what the Bible tells
[00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:12.480]   you about that, namely this, that it wasn't the death of a martyr, it wasn't a man being
[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:20.840]   put to death cruelly by ignorant, foul people, it was the Son of God, as he said himself,
[00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:24.320]   giving his life a ransom for many.
[00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:25.320]   That's what he said.
[00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:29.480]   He said the Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which is lost.
[00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:34.120]   The Son of Man is not come to be ministered unto, but to minister and to give his life
[00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:36.760]   a ransom for many.
[00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:39.360]   He set his face steadfastly to go to Jerusalem.
[00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:40.600]   He did it deliberately.
[00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:45.240]   He came to die because by dying for us alone he can save us.
[00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:47.240]   That's the message.
[00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:56.280]   Or as this great apostle is so fond of putting it, God was in Christ by what he did in and
[00:47:56.280 --> 00:48:01.920]   through his own Son, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses
[00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:02.920]   unto them.
[00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:05.200]   It means that you believe that message.
[00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:06.200]   This is what Paul preached.
[00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:08.880]   That's what he preached to these Philippians when he went there.
[00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:11.080]   Don't you remember the Philippian jailer?
[00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:14.080]   Suddenly cries out and says, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"
[00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:15.080]   Here was the answer.
[00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:19.080]   "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved and thy house."
[00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:21.900]   And he began to speak to them the word of the Lord.
[00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:23.840]   He taught them concerning this message.
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:29.080]   This was his message, given to him by the Lord himself on the road to Damascus.
[00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:34.280]   That Jesus is the Christ and that Christ must needs have suffered before he can save us
[00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:36.200]   and that he is risen from the dead.
[00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:38.880]   All these, that's what to believe in him means.
[00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:41.320]   And you can't rejoice in him unless you believe in him.
[00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:44.040]   But remember it goes on to this.
[00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:48.960]   You not only believe these facts concerning him, you trust in them.
[00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:53.600]   You trust in them as the means of your salvation.
[00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:59.840]   You see, you've already seen that you can have no confidence in the flesh.
[00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:02.200]   Because nothing you do is good enough.
[00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:05.400]   How then can a man be saved?
[00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:08.800]   Oh, a man is saved like this.
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:15.320]   By believing that the Son of God came into the world to do all he did for me.
[00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:20.400]   Yes, as this Paul in writing to the Galatians in chapter 2, 20.
[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:27.720]   The Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me.
[00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:33.960]   That's trusting in Christ, saying I've nothing else I can trust.
[00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:39.600]   Just as I am without one plea, but that thy blood was shed for me and that thou bidst
[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:46.000]   me come to thee, O Lamb of God, I come.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.400]   I come poor, wretched, blind.
[00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:51.960]   I've got nothing at all, nothing in my hands I bring.
[00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:54.040]   I've no confidence in the flesh.
[00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:58.440]   I say to thy cross I cling, naked come to thee for dress.
[00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:00.840]   Helpless look to thee for grace.
[00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:03.240]   Fell I to the fount and fly.
[00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:05.640]   Wash me, Savior, or I die.
[00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:09.440]   That's what it means.
[00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:19.440]   That my only confidence is in the Son of God who loved me and who gave his life himself
[00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:22.440]   for me.
[00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:30.160]   And then you see when you believe that it leads to rejoicing of necessity for this reason,
[00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:34.160]   that you know you're accepted in the Beloved.
[00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:38.040]   He's given you rest, he's given you peace.
[00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:41.600]   So you now realize that you owe him everything.
[00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:44.080]   When you were helpless he died for you.
[00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:46.760]   When you were hopeless he gives you hope.
[00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:48.860]   He makes you a child of God.
[00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:53.120]   He opens out the vista of everlasting glory.
[00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:57.520]   If you believe that and if you know that to be true, you can't help rejoicing in him.
[00:50:57.520 --> 00:51:00.660]   What it means is, as I say, that you make your best in him.
[00:51:00.660 --> 00:51:04.080]   You don't boast of what a good man you are or what a good woman you are and all the good
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:05.080]   you've done.
[00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:06.720]   No, no, you don't talk about yourself.
[00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:12.120]   You talk about him the whole time, the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me.
[00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:19.320]   "Oh," says this man, "God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of the Lord Jesus
[00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:28.360]   Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me and I unto the world."
[00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:35.500]   This is a man who lives for and who glories in Christ Jesus.
[00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:40.360]   You know when he sings that hymn we sang just now, he really means it.
[00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:51.080]   He says, "Oh, for a thousand tongues to sing my great Redeemer's praise, the glories of
[00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:55.320]   my God and King, the triumphs of his grace.
[00:51:55.320 --> 00:52:02.320]   Jesus the name that charms our fears, that bids our sorrows cease.
[00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:14.200]   'Tis music in the sinner's ears, 'tis life and health and peace.
[00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:17.560]   Is he that to you, my friend?
[00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:21.740]   He breaks the power of cancelled sin.
[00:52:21.740 --> 00:52:24.860]   He sets the prisoner free.
[00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:27.720]   His blood can make the foulest clean.
[00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:31.800]   His blood availed for me.
[00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:36.800]   He speaks and listening to his voice, new life, the dead receive.
[00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:37.800]   Have you heard it?
[00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:38.800]   Have you listened?
[00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:44.680]   The mournful broken hearts rejoice.
[00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:48.040]   The humble poor believe.
[00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:51.800]   Are you rejoicing in Christ Jesus?
[00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:53.800]   If not, listen to this invitation.
[00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:57.160]   "Hear him, you deaf."
[00:52:57.160 --> 00:52:58.160]   You say, "I can't hear.
[00:52:58.160 --> 00:52:59.160]   How can the deaf hear?"
[00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:00.160]   I say to you, "Hear him.
[00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:01.160]   Listen to him.
[00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:03.400]   His voice can wake the dead."
[00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:05.440]   Hear him, you deaf.
[00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:10.840]   His praise you dumb, your loosened tongues employ.
[00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:15.920]   You blind, behold your Savior come and leap.
[00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:19.560]   Ye lame for joy.
[00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:23.240]   Don't you want to join me now in offering this prayer?
[00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:32.080]   My gracious Master and my God, assist me to proclaim, to spread through all the earth
[00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:38.560]   abroad, the honors of thy name.
[00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:40.200]   Don't you want everybody to know about him?
[00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:42.240]   That's what it means to rejoice in him.
[00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:44.320]   That's what it means to boast in him.
[00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:48.600]   That you spend your time in talking more and more and more about him, and less and less
[00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:51.120]   and less about yourself and other people.
[00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:53.600]   Rejoice in Christ Jesus.
[00:53:53.600 --> 00:54:01.760]   God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:04.760]   Very well, my friends.
[00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:08.280]   Those are the marks of a Christian.
[00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:10.400]   Doesn't matter how much good you've done.
[00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:13.960]   Doesn't matter how wonderful your notions and ideas tonight.
[00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:16.560]   Doesn't matter how exalted your views.
[00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:22.120]   Are you worshipping God in the Spirit?
[00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:29.400]   Have you lost all confidence in your flesh, in yourself, when you think of your relationship
[00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:31.520]   to God?
[00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:38.880]   And are you relying utterly and only and absolutely upon the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God,
[00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:42.800]   and his death for you and the cross, and his glorious resurrection?
[00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:44.080]   And are you rejoicing in him?
[00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:46.960]   Are you boasting in him and of him?
[00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:52.200]   And are you anxious that others should come to know him?
[00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:58.120]   Those are the marks of a true Christian.
[00:54:58.120 --> 00:55:02.480]   If you've never done it, ask him to reveal himself to you.
[00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:06.520]   Ask the Spirit of God to bring the truth home to you.
[00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:07.920]   Cry out unto him.
[00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:09.600]   That's all you need to do.
[00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:11.400]   Cry out unto him.
[00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:16.720]   And give yourself rest and peace until you can say without utter absolute honesty that
[00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:27.480]   you rejoice alone in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh.
[00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:30.000]   Let us pray.
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:39.200]   O God, make plain thy truth by the power of thy blessed Spirit.
[00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:47.880]   Bring it home to us, O Lord, one by one, that we may be safe, that we may be saved, that
[00:55:47.880 --> 00:55:54.200]   we may have security, so that whatever may happen to us in this world of time, we know
[00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:59.040]   that we shall ever be with the Lord.
[00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:06.600]   And now may the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and the love of God, and the
[00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:13.720]   fellowship and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night,
[00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:20.160]   throughout the remainder of this hour's short, uncertain earthly life and pilgrimage, and
