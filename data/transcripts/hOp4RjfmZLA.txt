[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.040]   I would like to call your attention this evening to that great and famous incident in the life
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.600]   and ministry of the Apostle Paul, which is recorded in the portion of Scripture we read
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:18.000]   at the beginning in the book of the Acts of the Apostles, chapter 17, beginning at verse
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.200]   16. Perhaps verse 18 will concentrate our attention upon the dramatic nature of the
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:33.320]   incident. "Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans and of the Stoics encountered him.
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:41.520]   And some said, 'What will this babbler say?' Others some, 'He seemeth to be a set-aforth
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.640]   of strange gods, because he preached unto them Jesus and the resurrection.'"
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:57.960]   Now, we are met together on Easter Sunday, Easter Sunday evening. And like most in the
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.960]   Christian church, probably throughout the whole world, we are going to look together
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:12.320]   at the resurrection of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. That is the meaning of this
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:20.800]   day. That is why this day is observed in the Christian church and has been through Anchorage,
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.960]   as Good Friday reminds us of the death of the Lord Jesus Christ upon the cross on Calvary's
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:36.880]   hill. So this day reminds us of his rising again from the dead.
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:44.800]   Now the question that inevitably offers itself to us is this. What does this day mean to
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.840]   this modern world? What does it mean, for instance, to the vast majority of people in
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.640]   this country without going any further this very evening? And we have only to ask the
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:03.360]   question, of course, to know that it is our last true to say that for the vast majority
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:10.600]   this day has no meaning at all. It is just a holiday, not a holy day, just a day like
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:18.640]   any other holiday, a weekend when people cease from work and go home, visit their families,
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:25.400]   and visit one another. Just a kind of bank holiday. And so it is regarded by the vast
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.560]   majority. But, and this is the thing that I am interested
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:36.720]   in this evening. If you go to these people to whom this day represents nothing at all,
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.160]   really, apart from just a holiday in that way, and ask them why that is their attitude
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.280]   towards it. Ask them if they have ever heard of the message of the church, and they will
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.800]   probably say they have. And then you ask them, well, why don't you believe it? Why is it
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:58.680]   of no interest to you? Why do you say that you couldn't care less as to what it is all
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.840]   about? If you put that question to them, you will probably find that they will tell you
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:12.160]   that they don't believe this. They don't believe that this Jesus of Nazareth who was killed
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.880]   on Good Friday and buried, put in a grave, they don't believe that he literally came
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.200]   out of that grave in the body, and appeared to certain people and then ascended to heaven.
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:29.160]   They say that it's just laughable, quite ridiculous. They have no interest in it at
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.800]   all. It's just one of those fairy tales, they say. And they go further and they will
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:39.120]   tell you that they don't believe it, that it's got nothing to do with them, and that
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:45.160]   they regard it as a pure irrelevance in this modern world, something which is of no value
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:51.600]   at all and of no practical importance. And their reason for that is that they are men
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:57.760]   of the 20th century. And being men of the 20th century, they've got a certain knowledge
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:04.420]   and certain information. They have a certain understanding. They say that they've rejected
[00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:10.640]   all this simply because they now are in a position to know certain things which people
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.560]   formerly didn't know. Of course, they say. We know that a hundred years ago, probably
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.240]   most people believed this sort of thing. Two hundred years ago, still more. And as you
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:26.120]   go back, the number is greater and greater. But, they say, it was all due to their ignorance.
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:31.200]   They just didn't know. They hadn't the advantages that we have. They hadn't the
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.600]   scientific knowledge that we possess. In other words, they believed all this because of their
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:44.040]   ignorance. And we don't believe it because of our knowledge, our understanding, and our
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:51.760]   scientific information. Now, I think you'll agree with me that that is the typical modern
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:58.280]   attitude towards this great fact which is commemorated today, namely the resurrection
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:04.280]   of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. Well, now then, what are we to say to this?
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:12.240]   Well, my one remark this evening is this, that there is nothing new at all in such an
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:23.240]   attitude. Now, this to me is the perpetual tragedy of this modern age. The people who
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:31.160]   deny this gospel and reject its message think that that is the very hallmark of modernity,
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:38.440]   that this is the thing that makes them twentieth-century men. The truth being, of course, that there
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:44.640]   is nothing new whatsoever about this attitude. And that is why I am calling your attention
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.760]   to this portion of Scripture that is found in this seventeenth chapter of the book of
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:53.880]   the Acts of the Apostles. Here we have the Apostle Paul paying his first visit to the
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:06:02.200]   famous city of Athens, and he just found that the attitude of the average person in Athens
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:12.040]   nineteen hundred years ago to the resurrection of Jesus Christ was just exactly and precisely
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:17.800]   what it is at this present time. Now, this is something to me that surely ought
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:24.640]   to shake anybody who is in this congregation and who doesn't believe in the resurrection.
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:29.560]   Whatever is obvious, it is obvious before I go any further, isn't it, that this has
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:36.240]   got nothing whatsoever to do with the twentieth century. It has got nothing to do with modern
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:41.560]   knowledge, modern learning, modern scientific development, nothing at all, because the very
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:51.080]   selfsame attitude was to be found nineteen hundred long years ago. Very well, then, I
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:58.440]   deduce from that something like this, that the position of the world is still what it
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:05.600]   was then, and that all our advance in knowledge doesn't make the slightest difference to
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:13.680]   man as man, to the needs of men, and to the truth of God that has come to men, and which
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:18.500]   I am having the privilege of offering to you this evening in expounding this particular
[00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:23.360]   section of the Scripture. There is nothing new at all. So you see, the
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:28.480]   fact that this is a very old book doesn't mean that it's out of date. It doesn't
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:33.360]   mean that it's irrelevant. Somebody may say to me, "Now, wait a minute. This is,
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:39.200]   after all, nineteen sixty-one, and how can a book which is as old as that possibly have
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:44.200]   anything of value to give to me, face to face as I am with the problems of the world, this
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:48.240]   very evening?" Now, I'm going to try to answer that question. Let's do it like
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:54.480]   this. Let's first of all take a glance at this great city of Athens in which the Apostle
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:08:00.760]   Paul was preaching. And it's clear, as you see, that what he was preaching was Jesus
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:07.640]   and the resurrection. These Epicureans and Stoics, these philosophers, encountered him
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:12.880]   and some said, "What will this babbler say? What's this fellow talking about? This
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:16.760]   man who's picking up a bit of knowledge and information here and there, and he's
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:22.040]   putting it before us, what is this babbler saying?" Others said, "You know," they
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:28.620]   said, "he seems to be a set of some strange gods, because he preached unto them Jesus
[00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:32.720]   and the resurrection." Now, let's go and have a look at the great city of Athens,
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:40.240]   not as it is now, but as it was nineteen hundred years ago and just a little bit more.
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:45.720]   Very well, what do we find? Well, we find that it was a very learned city, a very proud
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:53.100]   city. Athens, after all, was the seat of learning of the ancient world. Rome was very famous
[00:08:53.100 --> 00:09:00.720]   for its law, for its civic government and arrangements. The world has never known planners
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:06.960]   like the Romans. They knew all about the devolution of government and about planning, road making,
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:13.000]   and all the rest of it. But the Greeks, they were particularly famous for their philosophy.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.480]   They had produced the greatest philosophers that the world has ever known. And Athens
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:25.420]   was the great center, the capital, the mecca of this great philosophical learning and teaching.
[00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:31.040]   So she was a great city and a very proud one. She had great and magnificent buildings. People
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:35.360]   still go and look at the ruins of them and they're worth seeing. Well, there she was
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:42.560]   with her great palaces, buildings, pantheon, and all the rest of them, and this great pride
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:48.680]   in knowledge and in learning. A busy city, a very beautiful city, and a very wonderful
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:56.320]   city. Now, intellectually, she was divided up, as the record tells us, to these two main
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:02.440]   parties. There were other subsidiary groups, but these were the two main groups, these
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:09.760]   epicureans and stoics. They were the great intellects, the teachers of the people, the
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:16.320]   philosophers. Now, what did they believe? Well, let's look at them. The stoics were
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:20.200]   a very remarkable people, there's no doubt about that at all. They were a very serious
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:25.440]   people. They said life is a very difficult thing. This world is a very difficult place
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:30.480]   to live in. They said, you know, it takes a great deal to go through this life and through
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:35.720]   this world without failing. And they said a man can only do it as long as he takes himself
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:41.520]   in hand and exercises an iron discipline over himself. He's got to be very serious. He's
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:46.520]   got to hold himself in. He's got to watch his feelings in particular. Then they said
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:53.040]   he may just get through. But in addition to that, they did hold a view of a kind of future
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:11:01.200]   life. But they did not believe in personal immortality. They had a belief that somehow
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:07.320]   or another the spirit of man went on beyond death. It was a very shadowy and nebulous
[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:12.480]   kind of existence. We didn't go on as individuals, but they did believe that there was a kind
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:18.400]   of immortality of the soul in general and the souls of men perhaps became absorbed in
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:23.920]   some great absolute. They didn't believe in personal immortality, whereas they did
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:32.280]   believe in this vague, nebulous kind of future life. They were pantheists, which means that
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:39.360]   they said God is in everything. God is in matter. God is in buildings, trees, everything.
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:44.800]   God is everywhere and in everything. So man is a part of all this and he goes back and
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:51.200]   sinks again into that kind of absolute. Now that was the belief of the Stoics. What about
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:12:01.720]   the Epicureans? Well, they were materialists and more or less irreligious materialists.
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:10.360]   To them the good life was to be found in pleasures, pleasures of the senses. That was the way
[00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:17.120]   their slogan was, "Eat, drink and be merry." That to them was the good life and that was
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:23.960]   the essence of wisdom. They didn't believe at all in a future realm. They were utter
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:29.880]   sceptics as regard that. They said that life was limited entirely to this world and it
[00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:36.640]   was to be a life of the senses. The world was a world of chance, without God, without
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:44.920]   any meaning, without any rhyme or reason whatsoever. Now that was the belief of the Epicureans.
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:49.280]   And so we are told that this great city of Athens in its learning and outlook was divided
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:54.600]   very largely between these two groups. Now there was one thing in common. They were both
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:13:00.840]   seeking for peace of mind. They were all out for happiness. They said, "You know, in
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:05.840]   the midst of all this battle of life, if only one could find peace, how can one find it?"
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:10.200]   Well, as I say, the Stoics said, "You'll find it by discipline and by courage." The
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:14.480]   other said, "You'll find it by pleasure and the use of pleasure. Make the most of
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:18.880]   it while you are here. Eat, drink and be merry. Tomorrow we die." Now they were both out
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:25.520]   for peace. They were both out for happiness for the individual. That was the controlling
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:34.000]   intellectual outlook. But you remember we are told a very interesting thing. Though
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:40.640]   that was true of these Athenians, it was also true to say that their city was more or less
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:47.120]   cluttered up with a number of temples, temples to the various gods. The apostle turns to
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:52.120]   them and says, "Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you are too religious,
[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:57.840]   superstitious here." It means religious, and they were highly religious. They built
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:03.480]   temples to every conceivable god, the god of war, the god of peace, the god of love,
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:09.520]   and all the various gods. Why did they do that? Well, they said this. They said, "You
[00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:14.160]   see, there is no doubt at all that there are certain unseen forces influencing this life
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:19.600]   and this world." "What are they?" "Well," they said, "they are these gods, and they
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:23.480]   are the gods that are controlling the destinies of men." So they said, "There's only
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:30.640]   one thing to do. We must please them. We must try to placate them." So they had put up
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:35.640]   their temples to every known god, and they'd got a list of them, and they'd got a very
[00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:39.920]   strict law about it. If you worshipped a god that wasn't in their list, you could be
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:43.840]   punished. That was why probably they took hold of the apostle Paul. He seemed to be
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:49.080]   a setter forth of some strange god. They said, "Who is this god? He's not in the list.
[00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:52.520]   It isn't permissible. It isn't legal." You see, there were so many of them, they'd
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:57.560]   had to control it a little bit, and so they'd got a list of the gods. The place was cluttered
[00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:06.560]   up with temples to the various gods. And then, do you remember the other interesting thing?
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:13.400]   Amidst these temples, Paul noticed one that attracted him in particular. There was a temple,
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:21.560]   and it had got this inscription over it, not Mercury, Mars, or Jupiter, but just this,
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:29.440]   "The Unknown God." What did this mean? Most significant. Well, you see, what it meant
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:35.320]   was this. They said, "No, we've covered every god we know about, and we've got them
[00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:40.840]   in the list." But having done that, they had a terrible, uncomfortable feeling that
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:45.560]   there was another god at the back of them all. There was another god that seemed to
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:49.760]   be more powerful than them all, a god whom they couldn't find. They couldn't give
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:54.080]   him a name, and yet they knew something of his power. And the best they could do, therefore,
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:16:01.240]   was to call him "The Unknown God," the god behind the known gods. And they'd put
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:05.800]   up a temple to him, and they were trying to worship him also, as best they could, and
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:12.200]   to take their offerings and their sacrifices to him, the temple to the Unknown God.
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:15.240]   There's only one other thing that I want to remind you about these Athenians. It's
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:22.840]   a very significant thing. It's here in brackets in verse 21. "For all the Athenians
[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:30.040]   and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else but either to tell or
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:40.120]   to hear some new thing." Oh, what a significant statement. There they were, you see, the best
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:47.600]   philosophy that the world can commend. Every conceivable god catered for even this Unknown
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:55.440]   God. And yet here they are, spending their time either to tell or to hear some new thing.
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:17:00.720]   Why? Well, because they were not very satisfied with the things that they knew. There was
[00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:08.200]   a great dissatisfaction. There was much unhappiness. Secular writers tell us that at this time
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:14.800]   suicide was increasing at an alarming rate, and many of the philosophers themselves were
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:20.040]   committing suicide. Here they were, you see, with all this learning and all this glorious
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:25.440]   architecture, with all their sports, their Olympic games, their marathon races, all their
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:33.760]   cultivation of the human form and its appearance and so on, in spite of all these benefits.
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:38.760]   They spent their time in either to tell or to hear some new thing. That's always a
[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:44.080]   sign of a dissatisfied people. I wonder whether this is it. I wonder whether this is going
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:48.200]   to help us. Going the round from one thing to the next. Ah, here's a new theory. What's
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:51.120]   this? We haven't heard of this. Oh, they went after it. Well, has this man got some
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:57.440]   comfort or peace to give us? You see, they couldn't find it in the things they'd got.
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:06.440]   It was the great and the famous city of Athens. Would it not be almost insulting, my friends,
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:11.080]   to suggest to you at this point that what I've really been telling you about and describing
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:22.000]   to you is nothing but the modern world? It's identical, isn't it? Don't you recognize
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.560]   the Stoics and the Epicureans today? Well, if you've got a wireless or a television,
[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:35.000]   you must be very familiar with them. They are the chief representatives of modern thought.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:42.520]   Stoics and Epicureans. Those who believe in morality and discipline. Those who don't
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:47.840]   and say, "Let's have a good time." Don't waste your time. You'll never solve the problem.
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:53.120]   The essence of wisdom is to enjoy yourself. The people who live for pleasure and for happiness
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:59.800]   only and the others who try to understand. Here it is, the world tonight is divided up
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:04.800]   between the Stoics and the Epicureans, and the world tonight is as proud of its knowledge
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:10.640]   as the Athenians were. There's no difference. The Athenians were as proud of their culture
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:16.400]   and their knowledge as we are in this country this evening. The people are outside the church
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:20.640]   and outside Christ and who boast about the learning and the knowledge and the understanding
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:28.200]   and the culture. It's an exact repetition. Yes, but you see, side by side with all that
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:35.480]   are all the cults that are so obvious in the modern world and not only the cults but the
[00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:41.720]   superstitions. The cults are doing good business today. They're thriving. People are running
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:48.000]   after them. Why? Well, for the same old reason that there's no satisfaction, there's no
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:56.040]   rest, there's no peace. The world is unhappy and like the Athenians, the world spends its
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:20:01.560]   time today neither to tell nor to hear some new thing, a new idea, a new teaching. Wonderful,
[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:05.280]   people will rush after it. You announce any new teaching and you'll get a crowd. Ah,
[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:10.040]   they say, "I wonder whether this is it." Charlatans can succeed very well with these
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:15.560]   things, not only in remedies for our physical ills but in remedies for our minds and for
[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:19.600]   our hearts. Oh, there's nothing more obvious in the world tonight than the unhappiness
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:24.200]   of men and women, the way they'll clutch at any straw, the way they'll believe in anything.
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:28.400]   You see, that's the sort of thing that produced a dictator like Hitler. It was this utter
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:32.840]   failure, the feeling that everything was hopeless. Up gets a man who said, "Follow me. I'll
[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:37.080]   be your leader. I'll lead you out to triumph and to peace and to joy." They said, "Why
[00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:40.840]   not? Why not give him a chance? We've tried everything else, nothing else." They listened.
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:43.360]   They said, "It must be all right." Some people warned them. "No, no." They said, "It's
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:47.920]   all right. Give him a chance, some new thing. This seemed to be it." And so men will believe
[00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:55.320]   almost anything, as long as it's plausible, either to tell or to hear some new thing.
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:21:00.640]   The world, therefore, you see, is full tonight of philosophy and of cults and of superstition
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:05.200]   and of this desire for something new and some fresh excitement, anything to get away from
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:09.920]   the problem, anything to escape from life and its harsh reality, anything that will
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:16.560]   give us peace and some hope in a world that's becoming increasingly dark. The world this
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:24.240]   evening is exactly as it was when Paul visited Athens 1,900 long years ago. And somebody
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:29.200]   says, "What about Christianity?" "Christianity," they say, "this babble." "What this babble
[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:33.720]   of what they're talking about, some Jesus who, they say, has risen from the dead. What's
[00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:38.760]   this babbler going to say? What's the Christian church got to say at a time like this, with
[00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:43.240]   all these terrible problems? Are you really just going to give us this old story once
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:49.760]   more, this babbling? We are tired of it. What will this babbler say?"
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:58.000]   However, they had the sense to take hold of the apostle and to lead him up to Areopagus
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.800]   and to ask him to explain what all this was about. It was partly, as I've told you, a
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:07.880]   judicial trial, but they were also interested to hear about this new religion and this new
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:13.760]   God that he apparently was talking about. So with this curious mixture of law and of
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:19.760]   curiosity, something new and so on, they took hold of Paul and took him up to Areopagus
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:26.800]   and asked him to speak. And the apostle preached to them. And what did he preach? Well, he
[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:31.880]   just went on doing what he'd already been doing in the synagogue and in the marketplace
[00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:40.320]   where people met together and discussed things. He just again preached Jesus and the resurrection.
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:47.200]   The same thing. Now the question I've got to ask is this. Why did he do it? Why am I
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:54.260]   trying to do it feebly this evening? Why should this still be done? Has this any relevance
[00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:59.920]   to us? Or are we just perpetuating some old custom and tradition? Is Christianity but
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:03.960]   an anachronism in the modern world? Or is it, as the apostle Paul tried to show the
[00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:08.840]   Athenians, and as I, God willing, in the power of the Spirit tonight would like to show anybody
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:15.360]   who has never seen it hitherto, that this is the most urgently relevant message in the
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:22.320]   whole world at this present moment? But let me put it like this. Why did he preach Jesus
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:30.440]   and the resurrection? The first answer is he did so because it's a fact. Simply because
[00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:36.160]   he was announcing a fact. In other words, you see, his reply to these people who think
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:40.440]   he's a babbler, and what they meant by babbler was this. It was a term to represent a seed
[00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:44.680]   gatherer. There were lots of hack orators in the ancient world, these men who made a
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:50.880]   profession out of philosophy and out of speaking. They did it then, you see, in the marketplace.
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:55.100]   They do it now on the television, same thing, they made a living out of it. And they picked
[00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:58.480]   up a bit of information there and another bit there, you know, they get it out of books
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:04.280]   and they put it out before us. It was done in the ancient world, exactly the same thing.
[00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:13.480]   Babbler. Now, said the apostle, you've completely misunderstood this. He said, I'm not a philosopher,
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:18.800]   I'm not a travelling philosopher, and he wasn't, of course. He had been brought up
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:23.960]   as a pharisee, but he's now going around the world making an announcement, he's making
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:30.200]   a declaration, he's a man who's got a proclamation to make. And what he's talking about is not
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:39.680]   a view of life, not a theory, but a fact. And the fact is that Jesus of Nazareth had
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:47.040]   literally risen from the dead. That he had been there in Nazareth preaching for three
[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:52.880]   years, that he'd been condemned by the Jewish authorities and by the Roman authorities,
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:25:00.320]   and that he'd been nailed on a tree, that he had died, that they'd buried him in a grave,
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:06.960]   that they'd sealed the grave having rolled a stone onto its mouth, that they'd put soldiers
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:15.160]   to guard it. But that in spite of that, the stone had been rolled away and this Jesus
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:20.560]   who had died and who'd been buried had gone out of the grave in the body, and had appeared
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:29.000]   unto certain of his own followers in various places. A fact, not an idea, not a concept,
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:37.440]   but a literal, actual, hard, brute fact. And the apostle was at pains to tell these people
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:43.320]   in Athens that he really was preaching about Jesus and the resurrection simply because
[00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:47.360]   it was to him the most amazing and astounding fact that had ever happened in the history
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:54.560]   of the human race. Now let's remember the story. Look at this
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:26:01.480]   man, this preacher, the apostle Paul. What are the facts about him? Well, they're these.
[00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:07.680]   He as I've reminded you was a Jew, and he'd been brought up and trained for the work and
[00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:15.120]   occupation of a Pharisee, one of the authorities on the Jewish law amongst the people. And
[00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:20.280]   as such he had heard about Jesus of Nazareth, but he hated everything he heard. He said,
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:25.480]   "Who's this fellow? He's a carpenter. What can he know? He's never been trained as a
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:29.920]   Pharisee. What does this man know about the law? He's no knowledge at all. He's an artisan.
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:33.960]   He's a commoner. He comes from Galilee. He's never sat at the feet of Gamaliel." Like all
[00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:41.560]   the Pharisees, he hated Jesus Christ. He regarded him as an utter blasphemer. And as he tells
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:46.520]   us repeatedly in this book of Acts, he thought he was doing God's will by trying to put an
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:51.280]   end to Christianity and to exterminate the Christian church. And he did it with his own
[00:26:51.280 --> 00:27:00.480]   characteristic zeal and vehemence and thoroughness. To him, he was serving God in trying to destroy
[00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:06.440]   Christianity. And this nonsense about this Jesus having risen from the dead was to him
[00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:13.040]   the greatest of all nonsense and the height of blasphemy. And yet here he is in the city
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:18.960]   of Athens preaching that very fact. What made him do so? And there's only one answer to
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:29.680]   this. He had got proof positive that this was a fact. On the road to Damascus, he had
[00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:37.920]   realized that what he had been saying was a lie, a denial of the truth. This Jesus of
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:42.840]   Nazareth who had risen and had returned to heaven appeared unto him, giving him absolute
[00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:52.840]   proof that he had indeed risen from the dead and ascended to heaven and to the glory. Well,
[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:58.280]   now this changed the man's entire life, of course. Here he is confronted by this fact
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:03.880]   that there has been one person in this world who has conquered death and the grave and
[00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:08.880]   has come up the other side. Here is one who has gone through death and has risen from
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:15.480]   the dead in the body. It revolutionized his life. It changed his whole outlook. He became
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:22.400]   a preacher of this. And so he tells them in Athens that he's preaching this because it's
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:28.640]   a fact. He's not the setter forth of some strange doctrine. He's not the purveyor of
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:33.680]   yet another philosophy. He's not the expounder of some great philosophical teaching. He says,
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:39.680]   "I'm here just to tell you that Jesus of Nazareth was crucified, he died, he was buried,
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:45.480]   but he literally came out of the grave, in the body, and revealed himself to chosen witnesses
[00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:55.600]   and finally to me." A fact. But of course he didn't leave it at that. He went on to
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:29:01.000]   show them the meaning and the significance of the fact. And that is what made him preach,
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.520]   you see. Listen to this. "While Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:13.320]   in him when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry." He couldn't keep still. You see,
[00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:17.320]   he'd had trouble in a previous city and he'd gone on on his own. He'd almost had to escape
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:21.760]   for his life and he was waiting for his friends to come, intending not to do anything until
[00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:27.720]   they'd arrived. So he just walked round Athens as a sort of sightseer, waiting for his companions.
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:33.320]   But you know, he couldn't hold out any longer. His spirit was stirred in him. He felt an
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:38.040]   agony in his soul. He said, "I must preach to these people." Why? Well, to him this was
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:43.440]   such a terrible tragedy, that these people should be wholly given to idolatry, that they
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:49.120]   should be in such darkness and in such danger. So he began to dispute in the synagogue with
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:53.120]   the Jews and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with
[00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:57.280]   him. He said, "I can't keep still." He knew that he was doing a very dangerous thing.
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:01.520]   He might be arrested. He might be put to death. He can't help it. He's so sorry for these
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:06.960]   people. He's heartbroken for them. He says, "I must tell them. I know something that
[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:12.080]   can make all the difference to them, as it has done to me." He was stirred in his spirit.
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:18.640]   He couldn't refrain. So he tells them about Jesus and the resurrection, this extraordinary
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:25.480]   fact. Yes, but he wants them to see the meaning of the fact. And what is the meaning? Well,
[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:39.000]   he tells us. Let me just put it in headings before you. This Jesus is the Son of God.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:45.880]   You see, the resurrection proves that. Here is the first and the only one who has risen
[00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:55.320]   from the dead, not resuscitated, but risen from the dead. He's passed through death
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:31:02.320]   and up the other side. It had never happened before. Here is the very first, and it's a
[00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:07.560]   fact. Paul knew it was a fact. He'd seen him. He'd met him. Jesus had spoken to him from
[00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:12.100]   the glory on the road to Damascus. He knows it's a fact, and it was that fact that convinced
[00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:17.480]   him once and forever that the Jesus whom he had despised was none other than the Lord
[00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:23.000]   of glory, the Son of God. Jesus had always said that. He'd always claimed that. He had
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.800]   said he was the Son of God. He had said that he wasn't only a man, that he'd come from
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:32.680]   the Father, that the Father had sent him. He claimed to be equal with God. He said,
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:40.120]   "Before Abraham was I am." That was all his claim. You'll read it in the four Gospels.
[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:44.200]   But Paul and others hadn't believed it, but he came to believe it when he saw him.
[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:51.760]   The resurrection is the final proof of the fact that Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of
[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:57.960]   God. The Old Testament prophets in prophesying about the coming Messiah had said that he
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:02.200]   was going to be crucified, that he'd die, but that he'd rise again. Here is one who's
[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:09.500]   done it. He is the fulfillment of all the prophecies. He is the Son of God.
[00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:13.800]   Now then, the apostle says, "Listen, I'm coming to tell you about the Son of God who
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:18.640]   appeared as Jesus of Nazareth. I know he's Son of God. He's risen from the dead. Listen,
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:30.160]   says Paul. Why listen? Well, here's the answer. "You good people of Athens," he said, "have
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:37.440]   made it perfectly plain and clear that you're seeking for the unknown God. Your very temple
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:44.320]   that I've noticed proves that. You've been trying to find him. Your philosophers have
[00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:51.480]   sought to arrive at him. They can't find him. They've done their best. You can go no further
[00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:56.760]   than call him the unknown God. You know that at the back of everything there is this being,
[00:32:56.760 --> 00:33:01.040]   but you can't find him. You don't know him. You can't speak to him. You're lost. He's
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:07.880]   the unknown God." The apostle in writing to the church at Corinth afterwards reminds them
[00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:14.920]   of that, you remember, when he says, "The world by wisdom knew not God." You know, some
[00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:19.640]   of the philosophers got very near. Plato, Socrates, and Aristotle, they got very near,
[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:24.240]   but they never got there. They had a feeling that there must be some almighty creator,
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:27.040]   but they didn't get there. They didn't know him. They couldn't find him. The world by
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:33.120]   wisdom knew not God. They'd done their utmost. They couldn't get there. The unknown God.
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:40.240]   Listen, says Paul, "I want to tell you that there is a way whereby this unknown God can
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:48.800]   be found and can be known. There is only one way," he said, "but there is one way, and
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:57.000]   I want to tell you about it." And so he begins to tell them. This Jesus, who is son of God,
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:04.480]   why did he come into the world? What was his purpose in coming here at all? And the answer
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:11.320]   is this, "No man hath seen God at any time. The only begotten he that is in the bosom
[00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:19.320]   of the Father, he hath declared him." You see, man can't arrive at God. God being God
[00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:24.600]   and everlasting and absolute in all his attributes. He's beyond man, and he's holy, and man is
[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:30.640]   sinful. Man can never arrive at the knowledge of God. So God, in his infinite condescension,
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:36.520]   has been pleased to give a revelation of himself. He did so through the Jews, through the law
[00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:43.400]   of Moses, through the prophets. But God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:49.360]   in times past to the fathers through the prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us in
[00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:56.760]   his Son. This is what it means. God has sent his only Son into this world. What for? In
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:35:02.560]   order that mankind might come to know God. That he might no longer be an unknown God,
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:09.200]   but the known God. This is the person who said, "He who hath seen me hath seen the Father."
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:14.880]   He said, "No man hath ascended up into heaven save the Son of Man that is in heaven." He
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:19.360]   says, "You can't climb to heaven." But he says, "I've come down from heaven to give
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:27.680]   you the knowledge and the information." So the apostle looking at these men of Athens
[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:35.840]   said, "Listen to me. There is one way only to get to know God and the truth about God,
[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:41.200]   and it's all in this Jesus who has risen from the dead, proving he is the Son of God. He's
[00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:45.760]   come out from God, he's gone back to God, but he came into this world to tell us about
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:55.560]   this God. And what has he told us?" "Well," said the apostle, "he is the only God. The
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:36:01.280]   other gods you've been worshipping are no gods at all. You see," he said, "the Godhead
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:07.800]   is not likened to gold or silver or stone, graven by art and men's device. That was the
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:12.720]   character of their gods. They'd made gods out of these precious metals and then they
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:16.400]   bowed before them and worshipped them." They said, "What?" He said, "What a conception
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:22.880]   of the Godhead. Nonsense. This is idolatry. These are no gods. You've been deluding yourselves.
[00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:28.240]   You're fools. This is superstition. This is make-belief. This is nonsense. This is a lie.
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:35.440]   No, no," he said, "there's only one God." And as he proceeds to tell them, he is the
[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:42.920]   Creator. "God," he said, "is neither worshipped with men's hands, God that made the world
[00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:48.400]   and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in
[00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:54.480]   temples made with hens, neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed anything,
[00:36:54.480 --> 00:37:01.680]   seeing he giveth to all life and breath and all things." This is what Jesus has taught
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:09.480]   us, that there is only one God, the only true and living God, the everlasting God, and he
[00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:18.280]   is the God who has made everything, God the Creator. He is the God who at the beginning
[00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:24.960]   created the heavens and the earth and the sea and all that in them is. He is the one
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:30.800]   who's made this world, who started this time process in which we live. He's from eternity
[00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:36.120]   to eternity, but he decided to create the world and to create men, and he's done so.
[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:43.560]   He is the Creator. He's overall, blessed overall, the everlasting God, the Lord of heaven and
[00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:48.760]   earth, and he doesn't dwell in temples made with hens, and you can't make him and move
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:54.960]   him from one place to another and think he's confined to a temple. He made all, he controls
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:38:01.960]   all, he's the governor of the whole universe. Not only that, he says, we all have derived
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:08.200]   our being from him, and we can't live without him. In him we live and move and have our
[00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:17.240]   being, as some of your own poets have said and have discovered, we are all his offspring.
[00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:25.200]   That is what this Jesus has taught us, this Paul, but he hasn't only taught us that. He
[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:32.440]   has taught us that this God is a lawgiver, that he is a God who is to be worshipped.
[00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:41.160]   He demands it. He has made us and that we ourselves, and he demands our worship. He
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:47.960]   is a righteous God. He made us in his own image. He made us for companionship with himself,
[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:54.040]   and he demands of us worship. He asks that we should praise him and pay homage to him.
[00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:58.560]   He's entitled to do it. We are very ready to pay homage to others. The Athenians paid
[00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:02.920]   great homage to their philosophers. They bowed before them. They sat and they listened to
[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:07.160]   them, and they believed their every word. They admired them. They heaped their honors
[00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:11.720]   upon them. There's nothing wrong in that. It's very right. Well, says the apostle,
[00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:16.720]   this great God who's made everything, he asks that men should believe in him and worship
[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:22.880]   him and live to his praise and do what he's asked him to do and keep his laws and manifest
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:27.640]   his glory. That's the God whom Christ has revealed. This Jesus has shown forth, says
[00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:41.600]   the apostle. God the creator, God the controller and the sustainer of the universe, the God
[00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:51.200]   who desires the worship of men. Yes, and you notice something further. The God who has
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:59.160]   appointed a day in the which he will judge the world in righteousness. By that man whom
[00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:06.080]   he hath appointed, whereof he hath given assurance unto all men in that he hath raised him from
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:16.960]   the dead. What's it mean? Well, it means this. This is the message of Jesus in the resurrection.
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:23.960]   God is the creator and the controller of everything. He's made the world for himself. He has started,
[00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:33.320]   I say, this time process, and he is going to stop the time process. He has appointed
[00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:43.320]   a day. As there was a beginning, there is going to be an end. This is what Jesus taught,
[00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:48.960]   and he's come from God. He is the son of God. He's proved it in the resurrection,
[00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:57.080]   and this is what he teaches. A day has been appointed when there shall be an end to this
[00:40:57.080 --> 00:41:05.840]   universe, an end to life as we now know it. And when that day comes, there is to be a
[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:15.200]   great judgment. As this Jesus rose from the dead, everybody who's ever lived in this
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:27.320]   world will rise and will stand before this almighty God in the judgment. The times of
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:32.880]   this ignorance God winked at. The times when he allowed men to worship idols, that's
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:38.160]   ended. The times of this ignorance God winked at. But now, commended all men everywhere
[00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:44.880]   to repent because he has appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness.
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:53.400]   How do you know that, says someone? Well, says the apostle, whereof he has given assurance
[00:41:53.400 --> 00:42:01.420]   unto all men in that he has raised Jesus from the dead. That's what the resurrection means.
[00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:06.980]   That is what it's announcing. It's a guarantee of that. That God is going to raise from the
[00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:12.760]   dead every one of us, everybody who's ever lived or who ever shall live in this world,
[00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:20.080]   and we shall all stand before God in judgment. But you say, I don't believe that. My dear
[00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:24.740]   friend, I don't suppose you do. The Stoics and the Epicureans didn't. People have never
[00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:28.720]   believed this, you know. The world is never like this. It's always objected. There's nothing
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:33.080]   new in your position whatsoever. This has always been a hateful message, but we're not
[00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:40.480]   concerned about whether it's hateful or not. The question is, is it true or not? And you
[00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:45.720]   see, you and I are left in this position. You can either go home tonight believing in
[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:51.460]   the theories and the suppositions of the Stoics and the Epicureans who weave their philosophies
[00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:55.800]   out of the web of their own minds and out of their own ignorance and superstition and
[00:42:55.800 --> 00:43:03.280]   darkness, or else you can listen to the testimony of one who's been in this world as you were
[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:09.520]   in it at this moment, and who died in it and who was buried in it, but who rose from the
[00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:15.520]   grave, appeared to be in, and has ascended into heaven and is there now and is coming
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:22.440]   back. It's one or the other. This is what he teaches. He said it himself. You'll find
[00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:28.040]   the teaching set out very plainly in the fifth chapter of the Gospel according to St. Matthew.
[00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:34.080]   Listen to this. "For as the Father raiseth up the dead and quickneth them even so, the
[00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:38.600]   Son quickneth whom he will." This is this Jesus speaking. "For the Father judgeth no
[00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:43.560]   men, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son, that all men should honour the Son
[00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:47.860]   even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which
[00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:53.280]   hath sent him. Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that heareth my word and believeth
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:58.360]   on him that sent me hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation, but
[00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:03.680]   is passed from death unto life. Verily, verily, I say unto you, the hour is coming, and now
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:11.040]   is when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live."
[00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:16.560]   That's his own statement, and the apostle is but repeating it.
[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:23.660]   Very well, my friend, this is the message. The resurrection of Jesus Christ from the
[00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:29.360]   dead is a proclamation not only of the fact that he is the Son of God, but that you and
[00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:38.540]   I are also going to rise from the dead and from the grave and stand before the everlasting
[00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:44.460]   God in judgment. What's he going to judge me on? What will be the terms of the judgment?
[00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:50.180]   He will judge the world in righteousness. There'll be nothing unfair about it. It'll
[00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:56.500]   be absolutely just. What will be the terms? Well, the terms I've already given you.
[00:44:56.500 --> 00:45:04.980]   God, the Almighty, having made us for himself, has only asked that we should worship him.
[00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:10.500]   He wants us to love him. Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and all thy
[00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:15.140]   soul and all thy mind and all thy strength. That's the first and the chiefest commandment,
[00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:19.740]   and the second is likened to it. Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. And you know
[00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:24.620]   you and I are going to be judged on that. My dear friends, is it surprising that this
[00:45:24.620 --> 00:45:30.500]   apostle was stirred in his spirit in Athens? He saw these men spending their time hearing
[00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:33.820]   the latest tidbit. Have you heard this one? What do you think of that? What do you think
[00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:37.540]   of this joke? What do you think of that new philosophy? "Stir, accept your realms, eat,
[00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:41.780]   drink and be merry. Tomorrow we die." And he knew that every one of them would have
[00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:47.340]   to stand before God in the judgment. He couldn't keep still. He felt responsible for their
[00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:53.740]   souls. He knew the facts. Christ had revealed it to him on the road to Damascus. God is
[00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:58.860]   the judge, and he's going to judge everybody. And he'll judge us on our relationship to
[00:45:58.860 --> 00:46:03.100]   him as to whether we've lived to his glory or not. Now, you won't be judged only on
[00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:07.260]   how you've lived. You see, it won't help you to say, "Oh, I never got drunk. I never
[00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:11.220]   committed adultery. I wasn't a fornicator. I never committed murder." It won't be of
[00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:17.300]   any interest to God. What God wants to know is this. Have you lived entirely to his glory?
[00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:22.460]   Have you worshipped him? Have you praised him? Have you obeyed him? Have you glorified
[00:46:22.460 --> 00:46:28.580]   him? And if you haven't, you're a sinner. You're deserving of punishment and of hell,
[00:46:28.580 --> 00:46:36.140]   and God has announced that to you. That's what the apostle told them. He said, "The
[00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:42.660]   proof of all this is the fact that Jesus has risen from the dead." And then I read, "When
[00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:46.940]   they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked. They stopped the preaching. They
[00:46:46.940 --> 00:46:53.540]   broke up the meeting, and they went away." Oh, what a tragedy! What if I let you go like
[00:46:53.540 --> 00:47:00.220]   that this evening? What if I stood here and said, "The message of Easter Day is this,
[00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:07.460]   that God is and is the only God, that he's made us and that we are ourselves, that our
[00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:12.140]   lives are in his hands, that he could end our life at any moment he chooses, that we've
[00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:16.820]   all got to die and after death stand before him in the judgment, and that the question
[00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:23.180]   is this. Have you loved the Lord, you, a God, with all your heart and all your soul and
[00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:27.540]   all your mind and all your strength? And have you loved your neighbour as yourself? And
[00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:34.980]   if you haven't, you're condemned, and not only condemned for a day or a month or a year
[00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:43.300]   or for the period of your life, but condemned through all eternity without end." What if
[00:47:43.300 --> 00:47:50.260]   I left you like that? They broke up the meeting. They were so furious at this talk about the
[00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:53.580]   resurrection, they didn't want to hear it. They stopped it. The meeting broke up and
[00:47:53.580 --> 00:48:05.820]   they scattered. Oh, fools and blind! Why didn't they wait and ask him this question? Do you
[00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:12.700]   mean to say that the Son of God came into this world simply in order to pronounce judgment?
[00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:17.100]   And to tell us that God has committed the judgment to him and he's just here to blast
[00:48:17.100 --> 00:48:21.820]   us and to damn us all, and to tell us there's no hope? Would God send his Son from heaven
[00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:37.100]   just for that? And the answer is an everlasting no. This Jesus who rose from the dead had
[00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:45.660]   died on Calvary's cross. Son of God, you say? Yes. Well, then why did he die? If he's the
[00:48:45.660 --> 00:48:51.260]   Son of God, you may ask me, why did he die? If you say God is almighty, why does he lie
[00:48:51.260 --> 00:49:01.340]   with some to die? That's the right question to ask, my friend. And the answer is a very
[00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:11.700]   glorious one. The Son of God came into this world not only to teach us about God, not
[00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:19.900]   only to tell us about this judgment which is certainly coming, he came to tell us that
[00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:27.580]   there is a way in which we can already pass through that judgment in this world of time.
[00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:31.820]   His message condemns us, of course. We are all sinners, every one of us. We have all
[00:49:31.820 --> 00:49:37.540]   sinned and come short of the glory of God. But he has come to tell us this, that in our
[00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:44.380]   lost and helpless and hopeless condition, he can deliver us, he can save us. We've all
[00:49:44.380 --> 00:49:49.180]   sinned against God. Not one of us has honored him. Not one of us has kept his commandments.
[00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:53.940]   Not one of us has lived to his glory. And we're all under condemnation. But the Son
[00:49:53.940 --> 00:50:03.060]   of God, this Jesus, has taken our condemnation upon himself. Oh, his own self bear our sins
[00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:08.300]   in his own body on the tree, that we being dead to sins should live unto righteousness,
[00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:15.860]   by whose stripes we are healed. He's not only risen, he died. He died that we might be forgiven.
[00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:22.700]   He gave himself an offering to God for us, that we might escape the condemnation and
[00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:35.500]   the everlasting death. And he's risen to represent us before God and to intercede on our behalf.
[00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:45.820]   That's the message. And it is the message this evening, my dear friend. As certainly
[00:50:45.820 --> 00:50:53.900]   as you and I are in this building at this moment, we shall appear before God. Have you
[00:50:53.900 --> 00:51:00.700]   ever thought of it? Have you ever contemplated it? Have you realized that this is true about
[00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:06.060]   you, listening to Stoics and Epicureans, marveling at the cleverness of the philosophers on your
[00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:14.940]   brain's crust, listening to the latest story and the latest theory and idea, eating, drinking,
[00:51:14.940 --> 00:51:23.100]   making merry, saying, "Isn't life wonderful? What great learning we've got!" Why don't
[00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:31.180]   you write to the philosopher and ask him how to die? Write and ask him to give you his
[00:51:31.180 --> 00:51:37.220]   absolute proof that there isn't a life after death. Write and ask him for the secret of
[00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:43.980]   how to control your lusts and passions and never to fail again. Write and ask them that,
[00:51:43.980 --> 00:51:50.300]   and see what you'll get out of them. You'll get nothing at all. They don't know. They
[00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:55.780]   can't live decently themselves, most of them. They know nothing about death. They're
[00:51:55.780 --> 00:52:02.700]   utterly ignorant of what lies beyond. They can spin their theories. We can all do that.
[00:52:02.700 --> 00:52:11.900]   But if you want to know how to die without fear, if you want to know how to answer God
[00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:19.060]   in the judgment, if you want real peace while you're still in this world, if you want
[00:52:19.060 --> 00:52:26.260]   to know a joy that has no sorrow mixed with it, if you want a purity and a cleanliness,
[00:52:26.260 --> 00:52:31.220]   if you want an honesty, if you want a new life worthy of the name of life, if you want
[00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:40.020]   an understanding of history, of time, beginning, end, eternity, the only thing to do is what
[00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:46.700]   the apostle exhorted the learned Athenians to do. "God commendeth all men everywhere
[00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:59.260]   to repent. Acknowledge your ignorance. Acknowledge your failure. Acknowledge your sin. Tell God
[00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:04.900]   that you know nothing and that you're frightened of life, that you don't know where you are.
[00:53:04.900 --> 00:53:09.820]   Admit it, that's repentance. Think again. Admit you're wrong. Dismiss your Stoics and
[00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:16.060]   Epicureans and all your philosophers and cleverness and just say, "I don't know." And they don't
[00:53:16.060 --> 00:53:22.340]   know. And I don't want to die like that in darkness and ignorance. Repent. God calleth
[00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:34.740]   all men everywhere to repent." And to believe this simple message concerning his Son, you
[00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:43.060]   see the message of the resurrection is this, that God so loved the world that he gave his
[00:53:43.060 --> 00:53:50.980]   only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting
[00:53:50.980 --> 00:53:59.380]   life. The Stoics and the Epicureans will never bring you to a knowledge of that unknown God.
[00:53:59.380 --> 00:54:03.260]   Believe in Christ tonight and you'll get to know him. Not only that, he'll become your
[00:54:03.260 --> 00:54:08.380]   Father, you'll become his child, he'll put his own nature in you, you'll have a new nature,
[00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:12.020]   you'll have a new start, you'll have a new beginning, he'll put his Holy Spirit in you,
[00:54:12.020 --> 00:54:15.740]   you'll have a strength you've never known before, you'll really begin to live, you'll
[00:54:15.740 --> 00:54:23.780]   begin to know peace and joy and happiness. And though men in their madness let off all
[00:54:23.780 --> 00:54:28.820]   their atomic bombs together and the world be blown to atoms and to nothing, you will
[00:54:28.820 --> 00:54:33.460]   have nothing to fear. You will already, as the Son of God has said, you will already
[00:54:33.460 --> 00:54:44.820]   have passed from death unto judgment, through judgment, unto life, which is life indeed,
[00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:50.860]   which is life eternal. God commended all men everywhere to repent and to believe in his
[00:54:50.860 --> 00:55:00.140]   Son and whosoever doeth so shall not perish, but shall have here and now everlasting life.
[00:55:00.140 --> 00:55:06.260]   It will take you through death, it will take you through the judgment, it will take you
[00:55:06.260 --> 00:55:14.940]   into the very presence of God and you shall see him and spend your eternity in the glory
[00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:26.940]   of his presence. Have you repented? You are going to rise, my dear friend. You will rise
[00:55:26.940 --> 00:55:32.020]   from the grave or if you are still alive when Christ comes back, you'll see him, you'll
[00:55:32.020 --> 00:55:37.580]   have to face him. It is appointed unto all men everywhere to once to die and after death
[00:55:37.580 --> 00:55:43.580]   the judgment. God is going to judge the whole world in righteousness by this man whom he
[00:55:43.580 --> 00:55:51.900]   hath appointed, whereof he hath given assurance in that he hath raised him from the dead.
[00:55:51.900 --> 00:55:56.100]   It's almost impossible to believe it now, isn't it? But you can't believe you're going
[00:55:56.100 --> 00:56:00.300]   to die, can you? You can't think of yourself as dying and yet you know perfectly well that
[00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:05.220]   you're going to. Read the obituary notice in the Times, whatever paper you read. Ah,
[00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:10.060]   you say, "Oh, so-and-so's gone." The day will come when somebody will say that about
[00:56:10.060 --> 00:56:15.620]   you. It's difficult to believe it, isn't it? And it's difficult to believe that you're
[00:56:15.620 --> 00:56:21.060]   going to rise from the dead. But if you believe that this Jesus is the Son of God and he's
[00:56:21.060 --> 00:56:26.180]   given proof in the resurrection that he is, believe him and you must believe that you
[00:56:26.180 --> 00:56:34.700]   are going to rise and be examined by God in justice and righteousness. And if you believe
[00:56:34.700 --> 00:56:41.500]   that, well, you won't waste a moment, you'll repent immediately and you'll believe in the
[00:56:41.500 --> 00:56:47.700]   Lord Jesus Christ and make sure that your sins are forgiven, that you become a child
[00:56:47.700 --> 00:56:52.460]   of God and that you'll have nothing to fear in the judgment because you are one of God's
[00:56:52.460 --> 00:57:01.420]   children, one of his heirs and joint heir with the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
