[00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.700]   Alright, we got another question here from TreeFallingInAForest
[00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:16.700]   who asks, "Would you do your CS researcher writing if you could not share it?"
[00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:25.700]   Probably not. I mean, I think impact is an important property of satisfying a meaningful career.
[00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:31.700]   Knowing that your writing is being read by people, I think, is really valuable and it's fine to prioritize that.
[00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.700]   Knowing that your computer science paper is cited and other people are building on it
[00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.700]   is a real source of satisfaction and is important.
[00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:46.700]   So I'm not a big believer in this fortune cookie wisdom around careers
[00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.700]   that it should just be the thing you would do if no one was watching.
[00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:58.700]   Well, I don't think that actually really holds, right? Because it's way too narrow of a view of what a satisfying career is.
[00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.700]   It narrows down to the actual activity that you're doing.
[00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:10.700]   You know, it's, okay, is the activity you're doing in the moment something that feels good or something like this?
[00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.700]   And career satisfaction is a much more complicated and rich tapestry.
[00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.700]   That's why I talk about it so good they can't ignore you.
[00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.700]   Things like connection to other people, impact on the world, mastery,
[00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.700]   so having an objective measure of you getting better at something,
[00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.700]   these are all part of the tapestry that all weaves together to build a satisfying career.
[00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.700]   So I don't think it's useful to try to separate work from all of that and become obsessively activity-focused.
[00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.700]   Is the actual activity you're doing, you just enjoy doing the activity and that's the only measure?
[00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.700]   I think that's going to be probably way too myopic.
[00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.700]   It's why, for example, sports stars obsess so much about their contract size.
[00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.700]   Now, let's use this as a quick case study.
[00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:56.700]   Again and again, the casual fan will say, "I don't understand. This player likes it here.
[00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.700]   The hometown crowd loves them.
[00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.700]   They're being offered more money than they'll ever know what to do with in their life.
[00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.700]   So why throw that all away to go somewhere completely new and to get all of the ire of their fans
[00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.700]   for a little bit more money on top of an amount of money that they would never know how to spend in all of their life?"
[00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.700]   I mean, in other words, what I'm saying is, why, Bryce Harper, why? Come on.
[00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.700]   But if you talk to the more serious sports fan, to the athletes themselves, mastery is important.
[00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.700]   I mean, what else was going to get someone to that top level in something as competitive as sports
[00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:43.700]   than a real desire to get better and better, to push themselves, to revel in the unambiguous mastery that they have developed?
[00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.700]   One of the ways you measure that mastery is the contract size.
[00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.700]   And so they care about these epsilons.
[00:02:50.700 --> 00:03:01.700]   Bryce Harper cared about the $330 million that the Phillies were offering versus the $300 million that the Nationals were offering.
[00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:07.700]   And this is exactly the type of conversation with similar numbers I have with my publisher, very similar numbers.
[00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.700]   He cared about that difference because $330 million would have been, it was at that point, I believe,
[00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.700]   the largest contract that had been given to an individual ballplayer.
[00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.700]   Like, that really matters, right? When you're really, the epsilons of mastery, when you're at that level of the game,
[00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.700]   at an MVP caliber, that really matters.
[00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.700]   If you just think about it the way we do, it's like, "$300 million seems good to me. It doesn't make sense."
[00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:39.700]   So this whole divergence, me excising my baseball demons, is really about getting back to this main point,
[00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.700]   which is there's a lot of different attributes that come into making work satisfying,
[00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.700]   and some of those attributes include other people, other people recognizing you,
[00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.700]   you getting unambiguous indicators of mastery, you make an impact on the world.
[00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:57.700]   That all matters. We can't just think about work in a myopic, activity-focused manner.
[00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.700]   We can't just say, "If you would do this when no one's watching, then that's what you're meant to do."
[00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:07.700]   Nonsense. Professional life is complicated, and it's social, and there's community aspects to it,
[00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.700]   and there's a lot of interesting, complicated stuff in it.
[00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:17.700]   So that is why Bryce Harper left, and it's why we should care about how many people actually read what we write.
