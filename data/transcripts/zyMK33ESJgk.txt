[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   All right, our next question here comes from Christoph.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   Christoph asks, what is your take on the informal
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   stop by the office chat?
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   He notes it's synchronous but also disruptive.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   Instead of multiple emails, a quick chat with my boss while I walk by his office
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   and he waves me down, gets a quick informal project update.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   What is your take on these type of informal meetings?
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   Well, Christoph, there's two different forces
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   that are working cross-current when it comes to this habit of office stop by.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   So the positive force is that it helps the boss feel more
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   connected to his or her employees, and I think it actually
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   does achieve that effect, right? It means that you get to have
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   a regular interaction with the people you work with that might not otherwise really happen at all
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   and quite infrequently that does have a social cohesion effect which is positive.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   The negative force that this creates, of course,
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   is context switching. We now know because we've all read my book, A World Without
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   Email, we've all venerated the book, we all talk about it all the time with our bosses
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   and buy numerous copies for our friends and relatives in the upcoming holiday season.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   We all know from that book that there's a really non-trivial cost to having to switch
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   the target of your attention from one thing to another. Christoph, you probably
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   feel a sense of fatigue, cognitive fatigue, after your
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   boss stops by, grabs you, you do an update, and you're trying to go back to the things you're doing. You probably
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   feel that fatigue that makes it hard to get going again. Maybe you just devolve into
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   "Let me go into my email inbox. I just don't have it anymore."
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   That's not random. That's the cost of the attention residue of having to completely
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   switch your cognitive context from whatever you were doing to what the boss is doing. So there's a really big
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   footprint from that that can give you cognitive fatigue and more generally lower your
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   cognitive capacity. So we have a positive and a negative.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   I think the right thing to do here, in my personal opinion, is find
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   an alternative way of accomplishing the same positive benefit
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   of the stop by, the social cohesion benefit, that sidesteps the
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   context switching cost. So what this means is
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   let's have a regular way that we can talk with each other, but it's predictable.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   I know when it's going to happen. It's not going to happen in the middle of something
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   else I am doing. If you practice office hours,
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   which I think almost every office environment should, where everyone
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   says on a set days at set times, "Here are my office
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   hours. My door is open. My zoom is on. My phone is on.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   I expect to do nothing in here but to talk to people, call me with questions,
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   stop by my office with questions." If you practice office hours, now
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   the boss can basically circumnavigate those office hours.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   And now you can get that same effect if you're the boss by saying
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   "I keep track of when all of my different employees' office hours are
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   and I want to stop by each employee's office hours once per week."
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   No disruption because that's the point of the office hours, but
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   you also get that social cohesion. I can regularly be talking to you. So I think that's probably the right
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   balance, but you are correct to note that cost you feel.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   That cost you feel accruing from the
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   stop by is real. That's actually a neurological, a qualia
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   of the neurological dance that goes on when you have to keep switching
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   your attention from one target to another, then back again.
