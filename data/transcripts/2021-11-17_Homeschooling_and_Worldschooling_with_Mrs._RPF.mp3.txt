[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance,

[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need

[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   while building a plan for financial freedom
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   in 10 years or less.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   My name is Josh Roschitz.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   I am your host, and today I have a special show for you.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   I have roped Mrs. Radical Personal Finance
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   back onto the show.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   It's been a long time since you've been here, babe.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   - Six or seven years, maybe.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   - I don't think, I think you've been,
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   you must have been on--
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   - I think we did the baby show.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   - And that was baby number two, right?
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   - Don't know.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   - I'm pretty sure it was a while.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Anyway, welcome back.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   - Thank you, thank you very much.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   - You would think that it's easy,
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   you would think we would do more shows together.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   In fact, listeners have frequently asked me to do shows.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   I think one suggestion that somebody made one time
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   was to do kind of a live call-in show
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   with Mrs. Radical Personal Finance
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   answering all the questions about Joshua
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   to see what Joshua tells the truth and what he says.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   Well, part of it is just hard to schedule, right?
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   Even right now, it's late at night,
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   and my voice is shot,
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   and we'll keep this fairly short today.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Maybe we'll sprinkle some more back in.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   But I wanted to have you back, partly to save me,
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   'cause my voice is not able to do a two-hour show
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   by myself right now.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   But a bunch of people have been asking questions
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   and inquiring about some of our experiences
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   with homeschooling on the road, road schooling,
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   and some of the things that we have done.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   And it's been quite a while since I've talked about
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   kind of what we are doing,
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   some of the things that have changed,
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   some of the things that we're learning as our children grow,
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   and I just thought it'd be a perfect subject to do with you.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   So I thought to begin with, let's share with the audience
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   a little bit about what we're doing
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   in terms of a philosophy of homeschooling,
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   how we're approaching our homeschool.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   - Most people would call it eclectic.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   I call it half and half.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   We have half the typical workbook, follow a plan,
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   have a checklist style,
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   and then we have half of the Charlotte Mason,
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   reading real books, living books sort of style.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   - Right.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Yeah, so in homeschooling, of course,
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   there's tons of different--
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Let's begin with kind of an overview
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   of the styles of homeschooling,
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   because for me, I often feel like,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   "Oh, they talk about this too much,"
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   but then I talk to clients and I talk to people,
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   and I realize that people are looking for kind of an overview.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   So if you look at the world of homeschooling,
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   I think there's a continuum that goes from,
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   on one end, basically taking a classroom,
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   normal school experience, and repeating it at home,
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   all the way to, on the other end,
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   building kind of what they call unschooling
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   or even radical unschooling.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   This may be radical personal finance,
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   but I am not a radical unschooler.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   I'm a part of this Facebook group
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   called Radical Unschooling,
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   and I am very much convinced that that is not for me,
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   what the parents in there are doing.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   And so unschooling is basically the idea that,
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   "Oh, your child just naturally loves to learn.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   "Your child is naturally going to want to learn,
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   "so you don't need to do anything.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   "Just leave them alone."
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   - Well, it's not leave them.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   I think it's more follow their passions.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   If they're interested in sewing, teach them to sew.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   - Varieties, yeah, agreed.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Right, go ahead.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   - That's all I was going to say.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   - There are varieties.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   - I mean, I know I have some unschooler friends,
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   well, acquaintances, I think we met once,
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   and I followed them on Instagram,
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   so if you don't, friends.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   And their son does art, and he does painting and sewing,
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   and he's been in art shows.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   It's not like they're doing nothing.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   And also, he wasn't really very interested
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   in reading for some time.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   I think he was seven when he discovered
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   that all his friends were doing Minecraft.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   And he was like, "Oh, I want to do Minecraft too."
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   But his mom said, "All right, well,
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   "you're going to have to read the screen for yourself.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   "I'm not going to sit in here and read it to you."
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   And suddenly, he was reading.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   - Right, right, right.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   And so I appreciate a lot of the aspects
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   of the unschooling philosophy for some subjects,
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   but we're definitely not unschoolers.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   And I'm unpersuaded that unschooling
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   is the right solution.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Although I appreciate certain emphases that they have,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   we're not unschoolers.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   But neither are we like to redo
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   the classroom experience at home.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   Where we're at would be,
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   I think that the basic outline of schooling
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   should be reading, writing, and arithmetic.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   And so the best, most important, most efficient way
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   to acquire knowledge is through reading.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   And so reading should be core and central to all,
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   it's the fundamental skill.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Writing is the ability to express ideas,
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   and arithmetic is its own language
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   that has to be learned and has to be studied.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   And it doesn't seem to me that arithmetic
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   is acquired in any way except by simply
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   the child doing it, right?
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   Building on it day by day, progressing, et cetera.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   So my theory has been,
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   oh, and by the way, I've recently added,
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   do you remember the other two things that I've added?
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   - One of them was persuasion.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   - Right.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   - And the other one, coding.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   - Coding, right.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   So I've recently adjusted that three-part model
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   of reading, writing, arithmetic.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   I stumbled into a guy, I think it was,
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   it may have been Naval, actually it was Naval on Twitter.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   And he said the five skills are reading, writing,
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   arithmetic, coding, computer coding, and persuasion.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   And I thought, that's good, I like that.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   And the argument is that persuasion,
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   which usually, of course, means speaking,
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   persuasion is its own discrete skill.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   And that's something that has to be developed.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   And coding, like mathematics, is its own discrete skill.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   I don't know how to code, but I come from a family of coders,
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   and I definitely think that somebody
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   who has some basic fluency in coding,
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   I guess I did do, what did we do in school?
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   C, what was that language?
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   HTML, I guess, which--
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   - I didn't even do that in school.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   I had to learn that from a job.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   I mean, it was pretty basic to pick up,
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   just reading the code once in a while.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   - Right.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   So my five-part framework now is reading, writing,
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   arithmetic, coding, and persuasion.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   But at the moment, it's just reading and writing
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   and arithmetic.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   So we have two students right now, for context.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   We have two kind of formally schooling students,
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   an eight-year-old and a six-year-old.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   Our eight-year-old is in--
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   - Third grade.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   - Third grade.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   And let's talk about kind of what's working.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   So he is doing workbooks right now for a few things.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   - Right, we have workbooks for writing.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   We have a workbook for math.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   And then we have a workbook for, it's called language.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   It's basically grammar and the structure of composition,
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   writing, composition.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Right now, it's basic, like, how to formulate your ideas,
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   topic bubbles, things like that.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   - And we're using Abeka.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   Why did you like Abeka?
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   - When I was in school, I went to a school that used
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   the Abeka curriculum.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   - And to be clear, you were never homeschooled.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   - Correct.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   No, I was in private school up until eighth grade.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   And then I went to public school for nine through 12.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   So when I was in the private school,
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   they used the Abeka curriculum.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   I didn't think anything of it.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   Don't even know if I knew the name of it at the time.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   It was just what you did.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   But when I got to high school, I found that I was advanced
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   above the other students who had been in public school.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   And it wasn't because I was extra skilled or more talented.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   It was because the program I had been using was more advanced.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   So once I got to high school and found, wow,
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   this actually was pretty good, then I got the name in mind
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   and said, I think we should consider this.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   And when we did start schooling, we didn't just say,
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   all right, this is it.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   We're going to use Abeka.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   We looked at some other options, too.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   And maybe there's better things for differently skilled children.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   But for me, I like Abeka because it worked for me.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   I think it's good.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   It has some similar qualities to other curricula that people like.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   For example, you've told me a lot about Saxon, how you love Saxon.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   And one of the things you liked was, I think they call it a spiral method.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   I don't know the name of the method.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   But basically, it teaches something new and reviews all the old stuff
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   that you already learned.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   It teaches something new, reviews all the old stuff,
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   so you don't forget the old stuff and just move on and not learn it.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   It really cements it in your mind.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   Well, Abeka does the same thing with their math curriculum,
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   and they have pictures.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   Which is a big deal.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   I think it's interesting that I never cared about that.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   I always thought, oh, who needs pictures?
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   But it's remarkable to me to see how much more the children enjoy doing their
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   work when there's pictures.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   And how much they complain when there aren't any pictures.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   So our eldest, I think, is unusually skilled with math.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   He seems to be ahead of --
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   Well, maybe, maybe not.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   We started him with the first grade book in kindergarten.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   I looked at the kindergarten book and said, this is a waste of time.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   We're going to first grade.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   And if it takes us longer to get it done, that's okay.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   We have two years to do it.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   And he actually got it done.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   And then when we did the second grade book,
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   it was so easy for him that he was doing two lessons a day.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   So that got him ahead enough to do the third grade.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   But since we've been traveling, we started third grade still in the third grade book.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   So it was probably a good thing we started ahead,
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   because now we're kind of getting back on par.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   Right.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   And at the moment, we're not really running on a normal schedule.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   Basically, I think we should do school year-round.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   I think there should be some breaks.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   But we travel so much that generally the breaks just kind of naturally work out as,
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   hey, it's a good time for a break because we're traveling somewhere.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   Yeah, instead of having spring break and Thanksgiving break and Christmas break,
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   we have when we're home, we're schooling.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   When we're not home, we're not.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   Right, right.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   And so I think that a 12-month schedule, meaning a year-round schooling schedule,
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   makes a lot of sense.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   I'm open to changing my mind.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   I read people's perspectives who change their mind and implemented summer breaks.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   But it just seems to me kind of a waste to go to -- for the child's brain to get flabby
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   and then to have to spend a week or two coming back into things.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   Why not take more focused, shorter breaks?
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   Many traditional school systems around the world do that where they have a three-week break,
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   a three-week break, a three-week break.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   And, again, with our travel schedule, it seems like a natural thing.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   When we were in France, we talked to a missionary couple that we met at the church there
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   whose girls had been in the French system, and they shared with us a little about the culture there.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   And apparently the French have a right to rest, and this means that every six weeks,
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   they have a certain amount of time off.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   I don't remember if it was a week or two weeks or whatever.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   But every six weeks, they have a break, and this is because their minds need to rest.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   And the woman we spoke to, she's an adult, and so they were in this language school at one time.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   And, of course, they had to have a rest because the French have a right to rest.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   And they took a little break after six weeks, and she said when they came back,
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   they actually had advanced a lot from having had that rest.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   Interesting.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   Yeah, and so with me, I would love to see our children do a math lesson every day.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   I would like to do six days a week.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   We are not doing six days a week right now because we're often using Saturday,
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   but I'd like to do six days a week, and hopefully as our eldest child becomes more self-directed
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   and requires less input, it's my hope that we'll be able to get back to that.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   Because if you do a calculation, you say the normal school schedule is 183 days per year, right?
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   180 or 183? I think 180.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   Más o menos.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   Yeah, I think about 180.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   If you just go from five days a week to six days a week, and you go to year-round,
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   you go from, let's just say, 180 days to something like, even if you go to 250 days,
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   you still have 90 days free for travels and rests, etc.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   You can easily go from 180 days of schoolwork to 250 or more days of schoolwork.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   And you chart that out in terms of something like math,
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   to me that's a no-brainer to help a child achieve his math faster.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   And since math is something that just needs to be done little by little, day by day,
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   in relatively short periods, I don't think it's in any way a hardship to expect a child
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   to do 30 minutes of math every day, regardless of anything else.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   And so we just begin with that every day.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   So we're using Abeka math as the point.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   We talked this year about switching to Saxon math,
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   but I don't think that our Elders could handle the requirement of basically writing out the problems.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   It would cause too much conflict.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   Abeka comes with one page.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   He does one page front and back.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   It's a simple, discrete lesson.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   It's not too much. It's not too little.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   It has pretty pictures, which he still needs.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   And so I think we've made the right decision on that,
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   and we'll continue to assess as time goes forward.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   Yeah, it's easy to just say, "Do this lesson," and he knows it starts here, it ends here,
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   and then you're done.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   Whereas I've seen a couple of Saxon books, I may not understand it totally right,
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   but as I understand, it seems like you kind of have to choose a starting and stopping point,
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   and then whatever you decide to do, the child has to write out all the problems on a different paper,
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   which can be good.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   People like it because you don't have to buy a separate book for each child.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   Right, right.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   Yeah, I've been inspired very much by Art Robinson, RobinsonCurriculum.com,
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   and his experience with his children, the way that he does it is his children wake up,
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   and the first thing they do, or the way he did it back when he was doing this,
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   he'd wake up in the morning, children do the first thing, do a lesson of math.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   In their case, they would do, I think, about two hours of math per day.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   We're not at that point yet, right, Errol?
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   This is eight, and sometimes the lesson stretches to two hours.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   But it's not supposed to.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   That is not the goal.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   The goal is to keep it at basically 30 minutes.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   And so we're using that now as a tool of just teaching him the skill of focus
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   because he's wildly unfocused and can easily sit and dawdle and daydream.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   And so just trying to teach him the skill of focus, to sit and to focus.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   But it's not a--anyway, he's where he should be.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   He grasps the concepts easily, which is why we're using it as a tool of discipline
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   to say sit down, focus, and work your way through it steadily.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   Right. He's never had any trouble with the concepts.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   I mean, if he were, we would ease off, we would do some extra practice or something,
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   but he's just kept right along with the book.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   And, oh, another good thing about the book is it explains everything in the book,
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   which is another thing people like about Saxon.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   Like the instructions are there, so it's not as teacher-intensive.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   And Rebecca does the same thing.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   There has been like two times where I have found the teacher guide had something extra
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   that wasn't written in that student book,
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   but it really--I don't think we've really needed the teacher guide much at this level.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   Right. So we're pleased with Saxon--or sorry, with Rebecca at the moment.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   And I think that at least for right now we'll finish the fourth grade book
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   and then reassess and see, but we'll probably--I would guess we'll probably continue on
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   because he's doing well with that.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   We're also using an Abeka workbook for writing.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   Now we started early with the decision that we were going to do all cursive all the time,
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   which is something that you can do with Abeka.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   You can have all of their books ordered with all cursive all the time.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   And we were persuaded at the beginning that that seemed--that it all made sense.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   I've recently become less persuaded that that's important
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   after watching our children with their struggles with cursive.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   Well, their struggles are with manuscripts.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   Well, that was the point. Go ahead and tell the story.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   Yeah, they see--they read--everything's in block letters.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   Like when you read a book, it's not going to be in cursive.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   You need cursive so you can read the Constitution, but we're not reading that right now.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   So everything they read is in print, you know, block letters from a printer.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   So they want to write that way, but they have never had any instruction in manuscript, none.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   So their letters are not formed properly.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   And they come out all different ways.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   We have capitals mixed with lowercase, not on the lines.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   We have improper shapes. It's almost illegible.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   So that's something I didn't expect that surprised me
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   because I thought, "We'll just do all cursive.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   We'll just ignore the fact that printing exists,
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   and we'll just teach our children when they learn to write to write in cursive."
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   But what has happened is exactly what you're saying,
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   is that now we need to get, and we will get, a book on remedial instruction for printing
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   so they can learn how to make their P's properly and make their B's
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   and just do them because it's painful to watch them write.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   They just naturally do it, but it's just painful because the stroke order is not optimal.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   And because they learned cursive first, they start at the bottom instead of starting at the top.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   Right, right.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   So they don't stroke a P down, where you P down and then make the side part.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   They do it like a cursive P, but they create it in printing.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   And the I's go up from the bottom, the T's go up from the bottom.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   Right, right.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   We've got to get a manuscript book.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   So that's--and then the other thing that I read that persuaded me is I read an essay
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   where somebody was talking about the technology of cursive.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   And cursive is a superior way of writing to printing, to manuscript, for those who write.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   I write--whenever I'm writing, I always write in cursive.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   It's a superior way of orthography.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   It's a superior skill of orthography.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   But we no longer live in a world in which manual writing is particularly important.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   And so unlike the world of 40 years ago, when you could expect that your whole lifetime you would be writing,
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   today, virtually, you don't really ever write by hand unless you're writing notes, keeping journals, etc.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   And so the need for the superior technology of cursive no longer exists
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   because the technology of cursive has been replaced by an even superior technology of typing
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   or entering with your finger--thumb typing on a mobile device or just simply dictation.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   And so since most students seem to be naturally resistant to cursive really at any time,
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   it just seems like--it's not--I'm not as persuaded by the cursive arguments as I was three years ago.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   And to this point, I think that if even we dropped cursive,
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   knowing that they're going to spend their whole lives typing on a computer,
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   I probably wouldn't be as upset about it today as I would have been three years ago.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   I don't know. We came across a picture of the Constitution in their My America book,
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   and I was like, "I can read this." I don't know if you're going to be able to. This is a problem.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   We'll see on that one.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   What has been a real challenge, though, is our eldest child really, really despises writing.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   He really, really struggles with writing.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   And it doesn't make sense to me why he does, but he does.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   Yeah, it's not his strong point. He has better skills in other subjects.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   So we've--I firmly believe that the skill of writing is very important,
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   and I had major ambitions that, "Hey, my children are going to be wonderful writers,
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   and they're going to write page after page after page."
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   But we're down at this point in time to one page out of his writing book.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   That's the lesson. It's one page.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   Yeah, but the point is, one page. It should not be that big of a deal,
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   but we're down at this point to one page.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   And there's a simple warm-up. There's practice with letter formation.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   Then there's two sentences, just two sentences for copy work.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   You trace the sentence, and then you write it.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   And it's a daily battle on that one.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   I mean, it takes him literally 10 minutes per sentence, which just boggles my mind.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   So we're still pressing forward on that,
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   and I don't think we should go to any less than what we are doing,
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   but that is not a strong skill set right now for that one.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   That's okay. We all have our strong points.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   Right, right. Now, where we are doing well is reading.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   And so I think at this level, good writers are always good readers too.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   So where we are doing very well is reading.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   And so you mentioned Charlotte Mason.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   We're using the Ambleside Online book lists and reading lists as a foundation.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   What do you like about Ambleside Online?
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   I like that they have already--
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   these are moms that have used the Charlotte Mason method with their own students.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   They've already read all the books.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   They've coordinated the chapters of the different books into the same time periods,
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   so I don't have to do that.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   They're not textbooks. They're real books.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   They call them living books that are meant to engage the child and not just be dry text.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   There are no questions at the end. There's no quizzes.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   You read for enjoyment and information,
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   and you take from it what's interesting to you.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   They call it a delectable feast.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   I think there's a podcast called The Delectable Feast based on the Charlotte Mason method.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   And the idea is that even if you had questions at the end,
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   you're still only going to retain the information that's interesting to you.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   So maybe you still get your Henry's confused in Britain because that's just not interesting to you,
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   but maybe you really think that Sir Walter Raleigh was pretty cool,
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   and you dig really far into explorations in the 1500s.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   So the idea is you spread before the child a delectable feast
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   and allow them to taste of each of the different ideas and topics,
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   and then they can, from that time, dig in more to the things that interest them.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   Yeah, and you spent, for the first couple years, a huge amount of time doing the read-alouds.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   Right. Before he was reading, or before he was reading at the read-aloud level, I did the read-alouds, yes.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   Right. And so with our second child, you're doing all--she's not yet reading.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   She's been working on it, and she's getting there,
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   but she's still not to the point of fluent reading and not able to read just for enjoyment.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   And so we do them as read-alouds.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   But now with our eldest, though, he's able to do all the reading himself,
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   even though a lot of the texts are intricate. Is that right?
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   Yeah, they're not--they're old. We'll put it that way.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   Yeah, they're old, and they're intricate. But he's able to do that.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   And so we just go through the Amblesight Online reading lists using the living books.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   And I'm very well persuaded of the value of living books. To me, that's the key.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   And I'm also very well persuaded of the idea of just simply having a student read.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   When I reflect on my own schooling, the only things I remember from school are the things I cared about.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   And the things I cared about, I just read regardless.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   I don't remember any of the other stuff that I didn't care about.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   And so as I see it, there are some basic skills that a child needs.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   First and foremost, the child needs a skill of learning.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   And there are some basic things--basic ability to read, basic ability to do arithmetic,
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   a little bit of basic scientific understanding, etc.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   But beyond that, the only thing a child is ever going to retain are the things he's interested in.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   So our job as parents or as educators is to lay out the feast of ideas
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   and allow the child to pick and choose, sample from everything,
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   and then in time, the child's interests will develop.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   And then as the interests are developed, then feed those interests
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   while simultaneously challenging with other things to see what else comes along,
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   and then let the child repeat the process.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   And so at this point, the reading lists are fairly simple and straightforward,
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   and he just does the readings chapter by chapter.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   And using the Ambleside Online curriculum, they have all the readings laid out.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   And these are all open-source materials.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   Most of them, yeah.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   Most of them.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   And so what we have done is we've switched to Kindle reading, especially while traveling.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   So what are your thoughts on making that switch?
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   Because we had zero devices of any kind for a very long time.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   Right. We have done zero devices, like no screen time at all of any kind.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   So when we went traveling, we realized we couldn't bring along
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   all of the books that we would have liked to have.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   I still prefer a physical book.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   I like to have something to hold, something to look at.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   I don't want to have to go tapping when I want to find a page.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   But I recognize that with traveling, the Kindle is invaluable because it's so small,
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   and it holds all the books.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   And let me be clear, this is the Kindle that is just the white background with the black words.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   There is no color. There is no games. There is no pictures.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   Right, right.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   What has been wonderful about the Kindle is just being able to load it up with the Delectable Feast.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   And we've been able to use this to good advantage with a lot of fiction reading.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   I think that doing a lot of fiction reading is the way that you stabilize a young reader.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   And a young reader is going to be mostly interested in stories.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   And so tee up the stories and let the skill of reading become effortless,
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   so that then when you move into the more meaty reading,
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   the actual act of decoding the text is something that is easy.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   And so one of the things that's nice about the Kindle,
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   we loaded it up with a bunch of series before we started traveling full-time.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   We had one suitcase full of homeschooling stuff, but still, we had a few--
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   Now hold on, that was a shared suitcase.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   That is true.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   Pretty amazing packing you did when you were traveling full-time.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   But for example, I found the whole set of Tom Swift books.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   And so one of the things I love to do is I go on Amazon.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   And the Kindles, I can put the books onto the Kindle by hand.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   But because we're using the Amazon Kids settings for managing content,
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   that works best if I just simply use the traditional Amazon system of sending the books.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   Right, you cannot put a PDF on a child profile.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   Right, right.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   And so since we have it set up with a child profile,
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   then I can't just--I've got all the e-books that usually I would put on it,
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   but now I'm using the Amazon servers to do that.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   So I guess the best example is I put on there the entire Tom Swift collection.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   I think it was something like 1,600 pages we should check out.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   But at this point he's 1,200 or 1,300 pages into the 1,600-page Tom Swift collection.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   And so the nice thing about it is--and we've got tons of books on there--
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   is that I think the Kindle is a really good complement to reading paper books.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   We have a very large home library of paper books,
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   but the Kindle works as a really nice complement to that
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   to allow reading to be done based upon interest level at different times
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   and to allow voluminous reading to be done with very low friction.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   If you laid out for a lot of readers what 1,600 pages looked like,
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   a lot of people were intimidated by it.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   I don't think our reader would be intimidated by it.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   It's just kind of what he's always known.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   But still, when you realize, "Here's 25 books that you're working your way through,
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   and I got them for $1.99 or 99 cents just to pay the person who compiled them
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   because they're all open source or public domain at this point in time,"
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   it's pretty powerful.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   So I really like having the Kindle.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   We're also using the Kindle a lot with foreign language reading.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   So one of the nice things that Kindle does is you can use foreign language dictionaries on there.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   And so when we're traveling, of course, I want to keep him--
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   because he's reading in Spanish also.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   We've talked about that. I've done episodes on that.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   Yeah, you had him on one time, I remember.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   Yeah. So we've talked about that.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   And so that continues to be good.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   And basically, I believe that reading is the foundation of education.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   And so my rule is for myself is that I will get any book that I think is interesting,
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   regardless of the cost.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   I'm not going to worry about the money cost of a book.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   And my commitment, although I haven't told him, is basically I'll get him any book that he's interested in,
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   no matter what.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   And so I've just tried to find--of course, with proper supervision,
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   but meaning that I've just tried to surround him with the highest quality books that I can find,
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   and that's worked.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   It's worked in Spanish. It's worked in English.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   And so the nice thing is he doesn't make any distinction between those two languages,
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   which has been awesome to see because that's something that you and I--
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   that's a level you and I never reached, right?
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   Spanish, even though you have a college minor in Spanish, Spanish was never easy for you to read.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   No, and even with having lived in a country, even in the United States,
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   where they've got radio stations in Spanish, I would listen to the radio station
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   just to keep my ear fluent, but the speaking has never come easily to me.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   Whereas our 8-year-old, he does what we learned was advanced Spanish effortlessly.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   Right. Yeah. And so, you know, we're back in the United States.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   We're not in any kind of Spanish-speaking community,
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   but I'm totally relaxed to not try to even facilitate any kind of talking.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   I just want to keep him reading.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   And I figure as long as you're reading in your target language regularly, then that's great.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   And so I keep plying him with more novels I keep finding,
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   and I spend all my time searching for books.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   I spent hours and hours searching for books, some books that I can find on Kindle,
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   ordering old books on eBay, searching the globe.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   We went to Spain, scouring all the used bookstores in Spain to find books that are suitable and--
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   And quality.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   Yeah, I don't-- just wanted to be twaddle.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   But that's been really great.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   But back to kind of the Kindle, now we've added in French.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   And this year, the project was after the good success we had with Spanish,
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   so I thought, "Let's see if we can repeat it with French."
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   So we started the year strong, and then everything just died.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   The whole project fell apart.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   And the reason it fell apart was I had bought a bunch of French-graded readers,
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   and we started those strong at the beginning of the year, and we all got bored.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   I got bored reading them.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   They weren't interesting to me to read, the graded readers.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   But I couldn't get any other French books.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   And so when we went to France, we bought a bunch of French books.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   Basically, we found a great bookstore, searched through,
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   and I bought the first five of every long series that I could find.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   And then we tested them out and started to see what worked.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   Our big winner has been the Magic Treehouse series.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   Right, La Cabane Magique.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   That has been the big winner.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   And I think that that is an optimal--
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   we could do a standalone show on just children's literature
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   and go over some of the books in the series and whatnot we found useful.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   But the Magic Treehouse series, I think, is perfect material for language learners
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   because it's an actual story.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   It's a simple story, but it's an actual story.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   It's not as boring as a lot of the graded readers are,
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   but it's a simple enough story that your brain kind of automatically fills in the words
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   and fills in the vocabulary.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   And it's got enough pictures to grab children's attention.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   But it's enough text.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   It's not a children's book.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   It's not just lots of pictures and little text,
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   which that's not good for language acquisition.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   You need the text.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   You need the actual story.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   And so that has been a real linchpin,
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   is that I had the first five of the Magic Treehouse series,
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   and even the day we got them, he started going through them.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   Right, without our saying, "Hey, you read these."
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   We just left them on the table, you know, surreptitiously.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   I told the audience how you salt the house or seed the house with books.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   So that, I mean, he started going through them.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   Then I started reading them, and my secret is I start reading aloud,
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   and that will pique his interest, and then I leave the book around strategically,
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   and he just can't help but go and read the book himself.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   Plus we give him no options.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   We don't have a TV.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   We don't have any iPads.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   We don't have any phones for them to play with.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   They have nothing.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   They have books.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   They have books and more books.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   Hey, it works.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   It works.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   We've been talking a lot.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   I feel like we're at the point where we need to go ahead
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   and start adding in more computer stuff,
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   but we're quite conscious of the fact that the day we open the door to that,
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   it's going to just filter on down, and we're going to lose this really powerful--
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   Right, because we've got a 2-year-old,
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   and if you start the 8-year-old watching whatever,
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   then the 2-year-old is going to watch it too,
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   and when it comes time for him to read, he's going to be like,
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   "But I want to watch how it's made."
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   Right, right.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   So I think we're going to need to cross that over pretty quickly here
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   because we're at the right point to start those skills in,
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   but neither of us really wants to do it
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   just because we've seen the benefits of not having a choice with this approach.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   So the point is, with the Kindle, I've been able to recently, just this week,
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   I went ahead and started him reading the--is it Marc Thiel?
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   I think you said that was his name.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   Yeah, he's a modern French author who's written a series of children's books.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   They're simple stories.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   Histoire à lire le soir.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   His book is Stories to Read at Night,
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   and he's got a few mystery stories and simple things like that.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   So the nice thing about those is I've been able to get those
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   on the audiobook version and the same text on Kindle.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   And so by having it on Kindle,
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   he can use the built-in functionality of the Kindle,
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   just like I love to do myself using LingQ, L-I-N-G-Q,
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   which is where I do all of my reading in foreign languages.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   He can do that on the Kindle and translate any words he may be struggling with.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   Right, and he's getting the audio at the same time as the reading.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   Right, right.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   And so I'm not worried about oral or written expression at this point in time.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   I just want to get him reading and then fill him with French books.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   And he's been able to pick up the French pronunciation scheme better,
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   but we'll do a bunch of audiobooks with these books that I can find.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   So that's been--those are big wins right now, and that's working well.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   Yep. One thing I think we could improve on is our P.E. program.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   We have nothing in place.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   They have scooters now, and they like riding them.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   It's just been hard with all of our traveling that--
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   I meant to take this more in the conversation--well, let's do it.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   How do you think traveling has impacted education?
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   What are your thoughts?
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   Overall or the P.E. part?
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   I'm just giving you a nice softball open-end question for you to share your thoughts.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   All right, well, it totally disrupted the schedule for sure.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   I have checklists.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   I have a grid of what is supposed to be done in a week, and that did not work.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   In case it's not clear, my wife is the checklist maker.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   I'm the, "Oh, come on, honey. It's okay. Look, they're learning.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   No, we've got to get this done." That's you.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   Yeah, I'm the checklist maker.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   I like to have it written down.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   This is what we're doing today.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   This is what we're doing tomorrow.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   These pages, these books, you check it off, and it's very lovely when it's done.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   Very lovely.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   But when we were traveling, we didn't have the checklists.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   We paired it down to math and language, I think, for each child, math and language,
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   and then whatever we could fit on the Kindle.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   I may have brought a couple of graded readers.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   Yeah, I put the Bob books on the Kindle for the first grader who was in kindergarten at the time.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   So she read the Bob books on the Kindle, and then she did math, and she did language.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   And then the older student did math, language, and Kindle reading.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   So we were able to keep up with his reading, his Ambleside Online reading pretty well,
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   and then the math and the language with the Abeka books, which worked pretty well with minimal books.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   We didn't do any writing.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   I mean, I think we did one postcard home, but that was it for the writing.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   We did get a lot of swimming done.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   They all improved in their swimming quite a bit.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   Right, which was--my point was, like, P.E., which I totally agree with you, right?
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   I'm not a sports guy.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   I don't throw balls.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   I don't do sports things, and you don't either.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   So we're just not really sports parents.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   But I do want to have more exposure to that.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   But the exposure has been kind of weird traveling exposure.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   And we've wanted to change it, one of the things, one of the ambitions we've had.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   And, in fact, when we had a house rental in Florida, before all that fell apart,
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   we had gone and found a local swim club.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   I was looking at martial arts gyms and had everything lined up.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   And then, of course, the house had mold, so we had to move.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   But it is important.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   But we've also had some good experiences.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   Yes, we have.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   Yes, we have, for sure.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   I can't ignore the fact that world travel does count as some degree of education,
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   even though you can't put it on a checklist.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   Right.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   So I'm always telling my wife, like, look, world school is where it's at.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   Like, all the cool people understand this word "world school."
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   And she's like, it doesn't fit in my checklist.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   It doesn't matter.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   But it was pretty amazing, right?
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   We've done some pretty remarkable things.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   And I actually fear that we've done too much.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   I feel like our children have no concept of the lives that they live.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   What was it?
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   We were somewhere last week, and someone was saying, oh, our dream.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   We were touring.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   We were in Tennessee doing the Ruby Falls tour.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   And the tour guide said, I'd really like to do--we were having a conversation.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   This came up.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   I'd really like to do this--I don't know if it was a race or something.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   He's like, it goes from the Pyrenees to the ocean.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   And I was like, oh, we just came from the Pyrenees.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   It's a little bit remarkable.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   And he's like, oh, we just came from the Pyrenees.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   And you realize that the child has no concept of the life that he lives based upon--
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   for a lot of people, it's a lifelong dream to go to France, right?
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   So I do wonder if we don't do too much, but how do you know those things?
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   One thing, though, because they are so young, you would think that their geography would get better with the travel,
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   but no, no, no.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   They think everything's a country.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   Their favorite country is Florida, or their favorite country is Mexico, because those are the same.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   Exactly.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   So I guess the point would be that--let me rephrase it in a question,
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   because I'm trying to draw your perspectives more.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   Do you think that the travel has been worth it for our children's sake?
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   If we were doing it for our children's education, do you think it's been worth it?
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   I don't know.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   Some of them are so young, they won't remember.
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   For the older one, I think it's been cool for him.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   I think he'll remember a lot of it.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   The child might remember some of it, though the confusion about countries remains.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   But we were able to do some traditional schooling on the road, and it's a very cool experience.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   We have lots of pictures we can show them--you did this, you did that--and they may remember some of it.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   I don't think it's worth it for the younger children.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   I agree with you.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   I think that basically my observation is about the age of six would be the youngest.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   I don't expect the child to get much benefit from bouncing around or seeing things, and even then not much.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   Right, because you can't do the museums, you can't do any kind of tours.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   We did one 30-minute tour, and we had to walk out with the baby because he was not having it.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   Right, and they just don't have the attention span for it.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   So I feel like it's a lot wasted.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   People are always telling me, "Oh, it's not wasted, it's not wasted."
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   They're going to remember it, and I don't buy it.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   It is wasted.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   We take lots of pictures, but I haven't traveled for them.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   Right, we traveled for us.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   Right.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   And we remember it.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   Exactly.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   My point is that some people, though I think it unnecessarily idealistic about, "Oh, it's just going to be great to go travel with my five-year-old,"
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   I don't think your five-year-old's going to care.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   It's going to be a whole lot of work for you to take your five-year-old places.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   You better make sure that you want to go for you, not for the five-year-old, because the five-year-old, it really doesn't matter.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   They just want to go to the park.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   That's really all they care about.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   Exactly.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   Where's the nearest park?
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   Exactly.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   So I don't think that the whole world schooling or road schooling thing, it's just wasted on the young.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   I really think it's not worth it.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   I think it's better to wait until the children are older if you're doing it for their sake.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   Again, I'm not sad we've traveled, but we've traveled for us and just dragged the children along because they're dragged along with us.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   I think we have been able to enjoy relationships together in a good way.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   We are at this point together with the children 168 hours a week, and that has led to a closeness that I think a lot of people don't have.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   But that also does lead to weaknesses and defects.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   We're always talking. We have some challenges with children in how they relate to other authority figures.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   They're not as respectful as we would like, and they don't really relate to other authority figures very much.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   So we talk about ways to kind of integrate more of that.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   We work hard to have lots of socializing opportunities.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   We're constant with other people, but usually we're around.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   And so I think we need to continue to work for more opportunities for socializing, but in other contexts where there are other adults, other parent, other figures, etc.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   So it's not all perfect, but it is not bad either.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   It's different.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   I think either way you're going to have tradeoffs.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   If you go the traditional school route, you're going to have less family time, but possibly different social skills.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   If you go the home route, you may have to work a little harder at the social skills, but the family time is built in.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   Right.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   I do think that what I like about homeschooling is the flexibility.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   I wouldn't give it up for anything to me, meaning that the flexibility that we feel.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   But I also recognize that some of that flexibility will be coming to an end here pretty soon as I have to integrate more of our children's goals and ambitions and plans into our family plan.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   Whereas right now I kind of just do what I want and figure for they'll follow along.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   But but in the coming years, that's not going to be the case.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   As you've reminded me many times, that's not quite as close as you might think it is.
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   So I still I still it's there, but I feel like it's breathing on my neck, even though I still feel like I got about four years.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   But but I that is something I think about.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   You tired of being on the road?
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   I'm ready to be still for a while.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   Yeah, me too.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   Me too.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   Definitely.
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   I think that's one of the other things that I appreciate about doing things about traveling and you don't have to hold back.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   You can say you're tired.
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   But I definitely.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   You know, you live in a house and you look forward to traveling and then you travel a lot and you realize how much you're looking forward to living in a house.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   What are your thoughts on full time travel for a family?
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   What are your thoughts on this?
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   Like totally nomadic thing we've been doing for the last six months?
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   It changes your perspective on what a home needs to be or have.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   For example, when we unpacked all of our stuff from the storage unit after being on the road for three or four months, I said, why do we have so much clothes?
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   Why are there clothes popping out everywhere?
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   We don't need this.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   This is a taking up space.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   Also, someone recently asked me that this person was involved in the building industry and he said, so what is your ideal house like?
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   I thought, well, I've been in tons of houses and they've got places to cook, places to sleep.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   They've got place to go to the bathroom.
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   That's that's pretty ideal.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   Right.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   Right.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   Definitely changes like your space expectations.
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   I've been in so many small hotel rooms that, you know, we're totally comfortable taking one hotel room with the four children.
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   They're accustomed to it.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   Even if we do put three of them in a bed and one of them on the floor, like usually we have enough beds, they can all have bed space.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   But on occasion, it's just a small space and that's just normal.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   So you go into many houses and the house feels like a massive upgrade, even if it's just a modest little house.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   We were in an Airbnb last week that was just a modest little house in a normal neighborhood, but it had fresh paint on the walls and it felt like luxury after being in a hotel room.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   But I've talked about publicly, we don't need to dig into it, but I do not believe that full time travel, like the digital nomad thing, is a great lifestyle with children.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   It's really not.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   It's just too much work on mom and dad.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   I would live as I would, I would myself would love being a digital nomad if I were single.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   You wouldn't love it if we were a couple with no children, because that's just not really your.
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   I think it would depend on exactly what you meant by digital nomads.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   Some people are digital nomads and that just means they move to Mexico and then they live there.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   I mean, like, just never having one fixed house for months and months.
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   Oh, you mean like three months here, three months there, three months in the next place.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   I mean, the three weeks or the one month rentals, like that kind of thing.
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   Like that, you would not be in.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   That would be a little fast for me.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   Yeah, you would not be into that.
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   You're a homebody.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   If I didn't drag you out of the house, you'd never leave.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   So, like, but the point is that I think that you and I would do fine, would do, given the caveat that you don't love that, like you like to have your routines.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   You mean a typical couple would do fine with a nomad lifestyle?
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   A typical couple would do fine, right?
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   You have your, each of you have your computer, each of you have your books.
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   And we have some friends who do that with no children.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   They travel a lot and they love it.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   Yeah, and I think the point is that it's not uncomfortable, right?
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   I can sit down at just about any desk and as long as it's quiet enough for me to work, it doesn't really matter.
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   I can sit down in any hotel lobby and I can put my earphones in and I can work.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   The problem is what are children going to do, right?
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   And that's what I think is underestimated.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   What are the children going to do?
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   Because...
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   Just stick them on an iPad. They'll be fine.
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   That's the thing is that especially like we're the weirdos that are hardcore.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   So, you take travel, you take small spaces, you take all the parks closed with COVID.
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   So, you can't get them, they can't get their wiggles out at the park.
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   And that's not fun, right?
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   That's one of the challenges of traveling with children.
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   That's not fun.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   That was one of the really nice things about staying in so many hotels because a lot of them have the pool.
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   Right.
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   And that has been invaluable.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   Right.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   So, the point that I'm trying to make is that why is travel with children not so much fun?
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   It's because the children don't have enough things to do.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   And so, as a parent, you wind up having to constantly find things for them to do.
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   If you're in your house, they're comfortable with your house.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   They know where their toys are.
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   They know what they have and they can enjoy playing.
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   But if you're not in your house, you're always worried about, "Are we going to break something?
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   We don't want to be too loud.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   What am I going to give them to do?"
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   And you have a little Ziploc bag with toys.
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   It just doesn't go that far.
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   Yeah, when you've got just the coloring book and the sticker book and you didn't bring your 40,000 bin of Legos.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   Exactly.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   It gets old a little fast.
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   It gets old.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   And so, that just creates a lot of work for parents to find things for children to do on the road, for young children to do on the road.
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   And so, when we got back, rented a house, got the stuff out of the storage unit, got out a big bin of trains,
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   and it was like, "Ah, the children, there they go.
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   They've got things to do for the next hour and a half, and we don't have to tell them what to do."
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   Yes, they were so happy building with the Lego blocks and the trains.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   It was like, "Yes!"
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   And I forget that because it's totally uninteresting to me to build with trains.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   I don't want to do that.
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   I don't want to play with cars.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   It was just such a stark, obvious contrast of being on the road and then not knowing what to do,
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   and then all of a sudden, here's a giant box of trains, and then they're taken for hours.
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   One good thing, though, about their having been on the road so much and having limited toys was they got to express their creativity.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   They rolled suitcases all over the house.
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   They built what they called catamarans, which were kind of like mobiles with all the hangers in the closets.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   And they had to use what we had with us.
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   They put their jackets on, and they built tents with the sheets and the chairs that were in the house.
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:14.000]   They just had to use the home furnishings to come up with stuff to do, and they managed.
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.000]   Agreed.
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   So I guess what I'm trying to tell other parents is it can be done.
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   We've done it.
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   We've been on the road full time.
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:31.000]   I mean, depending on how we count the days right now, it's a little bit mixed up with the different things we've done,
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:36.000]   but we've been on the road full time without a home, and we were planning on at least--
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   I was planning on another six months before we decided to cut it short with COVID.
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   So you can do it, right?
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:45.000]   Here we are doing it.
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:48.000]   We've done it with a two-year-old, four-year-old, six-year-old, and eight-year-old.
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   Problem is it's a lot harder to be productive on the road,
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   and I think that's the biggest thing that's always been difficult for me is that I need to work.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   I want to work.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:01.000]   We're living in this golden age of opportunity.
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   I'm surrounded by so much opportunity on all sides, and yet I can't--as a husband, I can't put you in that situation.
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   I'm like, "Here, honey. Here's a hotel room and a hotel key, and you've got a pool, and that's all."
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   That's just unlivable.
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.000]   It's too much for you to not have those things.
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:25.000]   And so in order for me to work, I've got to give you better infrastructure.
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   And imagine if I had some kind of work I was supposed to be accomplishing.
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   There'd be no way.
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:30.000]   It's not possible.
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   No.
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   I don't understand.
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   I do not understand.
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:44.000]   I read about all these mega super moms who are running their mom blog and making millions with their Instagram posts
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   and also being moms of children.
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   I don't understand how they do it.
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   It's not possible.
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   I can't do it.
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:51.000]   Anyway.
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   Kudos to those moms.
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   Kudos to them.
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   But no, I could not do it.
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   So I guess anything else you want to share from your experience?
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:05.000]   Because the audience always wonders what your thoughts are on all the wacky stuff that we've done.
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   We haven't even talked about countries.
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   We haven't even talked about--let's save all that for another show.
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:18.000]   Well, one overview comment, as I've seen all the stuff in the news with the controversies on, you name it, in schools, masks, safety.
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   Oh, vaccines.
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:27.000]   All the controversy in the schools, it makes me say, "If I didn't already homeschool, I would start."
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:34.000]   And I think I am definitely convinced that homeschooling can be very simple.
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   Our schedule is pretty simple.
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   We do three workbooks and reading.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.000]   Yeah, three workbooks and reading.
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:45.000]   And our eldest is not narrating at this point in time.
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   One of those workbooks is writing, which is copywork.
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.000]   That's all he can handle right now.
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   But we've got three workbooks and reading.
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   I think that's enough.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   Mathematics, reading, writing, and arithmetic.
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   And the foundational ones, writing can come later.
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   You just need reading and arithmetic.
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   Right, and with the first grader, we're really focusing on the reading.
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:11.000]   So even sometimes we don't get through all the read-alouds.
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:16.000]   We don't get to the foreign language because we're just focusing on the reading and English.
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   Right, and I think that with those skills, if you will surround a student with things that are interesting,
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   then children are naturally curious.
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:33.000]   What I find so funny is when I was younger, I used to love reading the encyclopedias.
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:39.000]   My parents had one of the sets of encyclopedias, and I just thought it was so fascinating to read all the different things.
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:40.000]   I loved the pictures.
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:46.000]   And so I always try to buy the encyclopedia-type books.
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:50.000]   We've got a set of encyclopedias locked away in a bunch of boxes somewhere.
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:54.000]   But I try to buy the encyclopedia-type books.
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   Like the Dorling Kindersley books are phenomenal.
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:00.000]   And I just lay them out.
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:05.000]   So what I find is funny is we'll go through and we get our homeschool day done.
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:09.000]   And we're like, "Okay, here are the three workbooks, and here are all the assigned readings."
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:18.000]   Okay, you can go and obviously play time, but then at nap time, that's quiet reading time for the ones who aren't napping.
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   It's like, "Okay, you need to go and read."
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:31.000]   And so the break, the relaxation from homeschool is to go and read an encyclopedia book about the human body.
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.000]   Right?
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   Yes.
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:38.000]   Sitting there studying how the stomach works and the acid and then how the neurons.
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:41.000]   And so I just am constantly buying these new books.
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   And so when I look at science education, the idea of going through some kind of science textbook to me is anathema.
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   Like, what's the point?
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:54.000]   There are a ton of nice science books out there.
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.000]   Costco is awesome, right?
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   But I mean it's like a textbook, right?
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:00.000]   Because that's always been my argument to you in building the philosophy.
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   Like, I did physical science in seventh grade and marine biology in ninth grade.
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:07.000]   And I don't care about any of that stuff.
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   I don't remember any of it.
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   It was all worthless because I never had any interest in it.
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   And it wasn't presented in an attractive way.
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.000]   It was presented as intellectual stuff.
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   If I had just had books left out about marine life and whatnot, those are the things that I remembered.
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   And so the physical science or the human biology that I'm interested in has always come from books on human performance or on weight loss books or things like that.
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:38.000]   And then if I don't know something, then I got to go fill it in.
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:41.000]   But it's not something that I was taught in eighth grade.
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.000]   It's something that I recognized.
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   I don't understand this particular thing, and I'm going to need to buttress my knowledge in this area.
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   And so to me, education really is that simple.
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:56:11.000]   If you are an uneducated person and you need to become educated, then it's basically a matter of finding the right books to begin with and then finding the right people and knowing how to talk to them.
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:15.000]   That's pretty much what education is.
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:31.000]   Speaking of the right books, I wanted to go back to something you said earlier about I forgot the exact phrase you used, but you said basically we just bring on the novels, bring on the fiction, fill them up with fiction.
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:39.000]   I totally agree with the added point that we are quite discriminating in our fiction choices.
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:41.000]   We're not reading Diary of a Wimpy Kid.
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.000]   I hate that book.
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:45.000]   That's a very good point.
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.000]   It's a constant work.
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:49.000]   I don't mind good fiction.
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:56.000]   I want my children to read fiction, but I want that fiction to have some benefits.
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:59.000]   Number one, I want the fiction to be morally pure.
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:05.000]   I want it to be complex, appropriate syntax.
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:14.000]   One of the things that is shocking to me is how much time and effort I have to put into buying old books.
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:21.000]   I just bought a set of, I figured our eldest was probably almost at the point for Hardy Boys.
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:28.000]   They're still making Hardy Boys, but you pick up one of the Hardy Boys.
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.000]   They've actually recently redone.
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:31.000]   I looked at all the Kindle versions.
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:41.000]   For those who don't know, there is an author way back in the early 20th century named Edward Strattmire.
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:46.000]   He created the Edward Strattmire Syndicate.
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.000]   This is an organization.
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:59.000]   He had the idea of basically building these novels that had characters who didn't age and that were all published under a pen name.
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:03.000]   I don't remember what the original one was.
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.000]   It may have been the Rover Boys.
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.000]   It may have been Bobsy Twins.
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:08.000]   I can't remember.
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:11.000]   But they started publishing all these different series.
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:24.000]   Many of the ones that people know of as kids books, Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew, Tom Swift, Bobsy Twins, Rover Boys.
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:30.000]   There's lots more that are lesser known, but that are still out there.
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:33.000]   These were all published by the Edward Strattmire Syndicate.
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:36.000]   They're still doing this.
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:38.000]   They're still publishing new Hardy Boys books.
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:43.000]   They're still written by Franklin W. Dixon.
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:45.000]   Who just miraculously never ages either.
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:48.000]   They're just being updated with the times.
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:50.000]   But you can go through these.
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:52.000]   You read one of the modern ones.
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:54.000]   There's Joe Hardy.
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.000]   I picked up one somewhere.
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:58.000]   I guess it was the introduction on Amazon.
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:02.000]   There's Joe Hardy in Paris putting pictures on his Instagram.
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:05.000]   There's all the tags up there of what it is.
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:12.000]   I grew up reading the classic blue-bound ones that you can find in the library.
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:17.000]   But what's interesting is those themselves were actually a reprint of the first edition.
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:20.000]   You can go back and you can find the early ones.
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:23.000]   They're not yet in the public domain, but you can find the early ones.
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:28.000]   Some of them that you really can't find, they were a little bit racist,
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:32.000]   and they kind of changed out the language and made them a little bit more appropriate.
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:36.000]   But there was a major language update between the first set
[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:41.000]   and even that classic blue book set that was set in the 1950s.
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:45.000]   I have to go on eBay and I buy these old collections of books
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:48.000]   just so I can go back and get the original language.
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:51.000]   - And then we tape them all back together. - Exactly.
[00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:54.000]   Here, be very careful with this book.
[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:56.000]   But the point is I do it because of the language.
[00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:59.000]   The language is much richer. The imagery is much more vivid.
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.000]   It's much more evocative, and it plays.
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000]   Now, here's what's amazing.
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.000]   When Stratemeyer-- I don't know how to say his name, Stratemeyer, Stratemeyer--
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:11.000]   but when he first started publishing those books,
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:16.000]   they were considered to be twaddle for that time.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.000]   And everyone's like, "Why would you read-- we've got great literature.
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.000]   Why are you letting children read Hardy Boys?"
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.000]   Today I'm saying, "Yeah, go read Hardy Boys or Bobsy Twins,
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:34.000]   but read the original language because it's much richer in content."
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:39.000]   So I look for books that are morally pure.
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:45.000]   I look for books that have good, rich language, that are complex language,
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:52.000]   because the ability that you have in language is going to measure the ability of your thoughts.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000]   That's not to say you should always use complex language.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:59.000]   I think a real skill of persuasion is using simple language,
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:03.000]   that if you want to persuade people, you should be able to use simple language.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000]   I struggle with this.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:11.000]   But your skill in language, the ability to use language,
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.000]   is going to mark the complexity of your thoughts.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.000]   If you are-- that's the point.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:22.000]   I'm also looking for books that are going to set a set of ideals,
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.000]   because if you put a novel in your child's hand,
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:32.000]   the child is going to naturally come to see that the protagonist in that novel is a hero.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:38.000]   So be very careful what those protagonists are doing before you put it in your child's hands.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:43.000]   Right. And even with some of these old books, like you mentioned about racist things popping up,
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:47.000]   even with the books that we've chosen, we've had a couple of discussions like,
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:53.000]   "This is not what we do. I'm sorry they're treating people this way. This is not how we treat people."
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.000]   Right. I mean, you go-- that's what--
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.000]   one of the big complaints on the internet about Amblesaw Online was like,
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.000]   "Why did you put all these racist books in there?"
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:05.000]   You can't get out of that when you're reading old books, any of it.
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:12.000]   But it's really important. I think it's better to deal with it straightforward than to hide it.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000]   So a couple of book lists, and then we'll wrap up.
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000]   So we've mentioned Amblesaw Online.
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000]   Right. Amblesaw Online.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000]   Okay. Amblesaw Online is wonderful.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000]   What is that living book search engine that they have?
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:27.000]   Is that Delectable Feast that does that, or who does that?
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.000]   No, there's-- somebody has--
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000]   But you did just mention the Delectable Feast podcast.
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:37.000]   Yeah, but there's the-- who's the big Charlotte Mason podcast website?
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.000]   Oh, Simply Charlotte Mason.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.000]   Simply Charlotte Mason.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.000]   Sonja's website.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:46.000]   Sonja has a really great book listing on her website on Simply Charlotte Mason
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:50.000]   where you can go in there and you can search for different topics,
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000]   and they have their living books.
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.000]   So that's a really good solution if your child's really into horses
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000]   and you're trying to find living books on horses.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000]   That would be a great solution.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:03.000]   I also am using the Robinson Curriculum Book List,
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:07.000]   which lines up nicely with a lot of the Amblesaw Online stuff
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:12.000]   and making sure that our children read through the Robinson Curriculum Book List.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:15.000]   And then we just always look for other book lists that we find.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000]   In English, this is easy.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000]   I just found a new one I was telling you about today.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.000]   Mensa for Kids actually has a book list,
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000]   and I was very impressed with their book list,
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.000]   and so I've added those to the checklist to make sure that all of that literature
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000]   is sourced for our children to read through.
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:32.000]   Right, and that one was refreshing when you showed it to me this afternoon
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:37.000]   because a lot of the books on there are stuff that are not on all the other book lists.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.000]   Right, right.
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.000]   What we've really struggled with is finding those foreign language book lists.
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:48.000]   I have spent hours and hours searching through the classics for classic Spanish literature.
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:54.000]   I can find the book lists for college-level stuff, right?
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:57.000]   I can find the book lists for that.
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:02.000]   What I cannot find is the classic children's books in Spanish or in French
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.000]   because when you do web searches and whatnot,
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:08.000]   I guess the homeschooling community is not as big in those languages as it is in English,
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:13.000]   but when you do the searches, you always wind up with just the same books you have in English
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.000]   but a Spanish translation.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:19.000]   Right, we joke that the Hispanic culture wrote Don Quixote and then said,
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000]   "Well, we can't top that."
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.000]   Right, right.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:27.000]   By the way, if any of you know of good Spanish-quality literature written in Spanish,
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000]   we would love to know about it.
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.000]   Right, because I feel bad because a lot of the books that we're reading right now in Spanish
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.000]   are all in translations from English, which is better than nothing,
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000]   certainly better than nothing.
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.000]   The translations are very good, but still I'd rather have--
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:44.000]   What you lose with the translations is you lose the flavor for the place
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000]   and the deep flavor for the language.
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:53.000]   Right, we found a whole-- I found at a used bookstore a bunch of the Hollister books in Spanish,
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000]   and so I bought all those.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:00.000]   And those have been great, but still you're getting, you know, Baytown--
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.000]   Is it Baytown or where they-- I can't remember--
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000]   Does the town even have a name?
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.000]   It's fictional anyway.
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.000]   Exactly, you've got Meadowbrook and Bayport and whatnot, all these made-up places.
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.000]   Which actually are totally hard to pin down to.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000]   You're kind of like, "Well, I think they're in the Northeast."
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000]   It's Northeast USA, right?
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:22.000]   So you're getting like this any town, vanilla Northeast USA experience, but in Spanish.
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.000]   Well, that's better than no Spanish, but I don't want that.
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:30.000]   I want my children to have a different sense of place that comes through in the literature.
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:37.000]   But I can't find those same series, those same books that are set in Valencia or whatnot.
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000]   So it's really cool when you find it.
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:45.000]   Recently, our eldest has been working his way through the audiobooks for Los Futbolisimos,
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:49.000]   which is a story that was placed in Spain.
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:54.000]   And so it's been wonderful to have the locations be in Spain and to have more of that experience.
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000]   Right, even that one is a little advanced for his age.
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:59.000]   It's got some themes that we have to talk about.
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.000]   But still, you know, it's something.
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000]   Well, I think we're done for tonight.
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.000]   I just wanted to share.
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000]   I'm like, "Why is anyone interested in our homeschooling?"
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000]   But I find out people are.
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:18.000]   And so I guess I would just say that the thing that I love about homeschooling is you can make your homeschooling match you.
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:23.000]   I was homeschooled when I was a child, and I have a bunch of siblings who all have children.
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:29.000]   And they all homeschool in different ways at different times and in different reasons.
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.000]   But they're all very different than my wife and I are.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:39.000]   I've got one sibling that's super into classical homeschooling and super hardcore on those themes.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:42.000]   I've got one sibling who's totally into relaxed homeschooling.
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:45.000]   I've got another who kind of mixes it up here and there.
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:50.000]   And one child's in private school and one child's in homeschool and kind of going back and forth.
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:56.000]   And the point is, as a parent, it's your responsibility not to be committed to a dogmatic approach,
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000]   but to say, "What's best for my child right now?"
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:05.000]   And with homeschooling, you have the ability to adapt, to change, to adjust, and to relate to the needs of that child.
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:09.000]   And that's the ultimate goal that we all have is to see our children flourish.
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:14.000]   We love to do what we love with the travel and the stuff that we're into.
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:19.000]   I'm into languages. I think it's fun. I think it's neat. I think it's a cool thing to do.
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000]   And that rubs off on the children.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:27.000]   I think I've discovered good techniques that have made it easy, but some people aren't into that.
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.000]   And that's totally fine.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:34.000]   Quick note on techniques. With our child that's in first grade but not yet reading and also not taking naps,
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.000]   we have found audio books to be invaluable.
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:43.000]   So she does part of the time listening in Spanish, which has been really hard to find good books for that.
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.000]   So hard.
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000]   And part of the time listening in English.
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:52.000]   Yeah. If any of my audience members are speaking in Spanish, there is such an opportunity,
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:57.000]   at least that I think there's an opportunity, for some really good Spanish homeschool blogs.
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:00.000]   I've read a few of them. There's some in the Charlotte Mason world.
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:07.000]   But what is happening is there's so much English influence from kind of just the American homeschooling stuff
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:11.000]   that there's not enough authentic materials in Spanish.
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:15.000]   And so like audio books for my first grader, I'm forever searching.
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:21.000]   I've spent hours combing through Audible, finding and trying different things.
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:28.000]   I've bought dozens of books at this point in time, trying to find something that will grab her with the story.
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:33.000]   The thing that has been the biggest success is the boxcar children in Spanish.
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000]   Los chicos del vagón de carga.
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:39.000]   They love that. But the problem is there's only first five of them.
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.000]   There's hundreds of them in English.
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000]   And they're all available as audio books.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:45.000]   But in Spanish, they only translated the first five.
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:51.000]   And so I've got all five of them on audio books, but I don't have Spanish translations.
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:09:06.000]   I have commissioned my own readings of books in Spanish and made my own private audio books from a native speaker
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.000]   just to try to solve this problem.
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:16.000]   But there is not enough good quality Spanish audio books available for first graders.
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:19.000]   What is available is usually twaddle.
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000]   I know that's kind of a Charlotte Mason-y word, but to describe it,
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:27.000]   it's either just the same old bedtime stories, bedtime stories, or just dumb stuff.
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:35.000]   And what I'm looking for is stories that are going to be actual stories with a plot and especially series.
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:38.000]   Like our first grader right now is really into the Bobsy Twins.
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:45.000]   And thankfully with LibriVox, I can get at least 20 or so free audio books there.
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.000]   And she loves those.
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:50.000]   But I'm desperate for that in Spanish, and I can't find it.
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000]   It's been super hard to find stuff in Spanish.
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:56.000]   Every time we look, it's just fables, fables, and more fables.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:59.000]   And they're just junk. It's all junk.
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:02.000]   And we've already had her try to listen to Platero y Yo.
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000]   She didn't really love that.
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.000]   That worked.
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000]   And some of the good ones, right?
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:14.000]   I started her on the Anne of Green Gables series in Spanish, but it's just beyond her age.
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000]   It's not interesting to her yet.
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:20.000]   Right, and we tried with Jerónimo Stilton, which we thought was hilarious.
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000]   But she hasn't really grabbed onto it.
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.000]   We'll find it. We'll find it.
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000]   Just pointing it out that there are options out there.
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:28.000]   And as an educator, a lot of your challenge is just finding the right books.
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000]   And if you can find the right books, everything is easy.
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.000]   But you spend hours searching for those books.
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:37.000]   Another reason we love Amblesight Online, because I don't have to search for the books.
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.000]   They're just there.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:41.000]   They've been pre-read by people who share my values.
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:45.000]   And I can just endorse them without having to pre-read them.
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:46.000]   Absolutely.
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000]   So, thanks, babe, for coming back on the show.
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000]   Thanks for having me after six years.
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:54.000]   We'll try to make it less than six in the future.
