[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:08.320]   - Welcome to our financial planning panel.
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.560]   I'm going to very briefly introduce our panelists
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.200]   because you know them all very well.
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.360]   They're all prolific writers and speakers.
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.900]   They have long ties to the Bogle heads.
[00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.160]   All are current or past Bogle Center board members.
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.120]   They've been frequent, much appreciated speakers
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.160]   at multiple Bogle heads conferences.
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.920]   And you've seen them a lot over the past two days
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.040]   at multiple sessions,
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.060]   including Bogle heads university on Wednesday.
[00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.200]   So one sentence each, Christine Benz,
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.120]   director of personal finance
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.580]   and retirement planning at Morningstar.
[00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.380]   Alan Roth is founder of WealthLogic,
[00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.960]   an hourly based investment advisory
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.340]   and financial planning firm.
[00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.900]   I'm obviously jumping around
[00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.300]   'cause I didn't look over before I started doing that.
[00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.760]   Mike Piper is a CPA, financial advisor,
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.340]   and among his many contributions
[00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.640]   is the creator of the Open Social Security Calculator.
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:19.020]   I thought it was interesting that in the Vanguard session,
[00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.020]   the point that Joel made about a lot of what can contribute
[00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.140]   so much to outcomes for individuals
[00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.000]   is on the personal financial planning side,
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.500]   not the investment side.
[00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.700]   As Mike was also saying,
[00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.700]   we talk a lot in this audience about portfolio strategies
[00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.540]   and allocations in different portfolios,
[00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.140]   but when it comes down to our individual lives,
[00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.740]   there's a lot more to that.
[00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.020]   So to start off, one of the things I wanted to ask you is,
[00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.100]   this is our first in-person annual meeting in a few years
[00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.620]   since the COVID pandemic.
[00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.100]   It was a global phenomenon that affected all of us
[00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.620]   in ways from the tragic to the trivial,
[00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.540]   led a lot of people to make changes in their lives
[00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.520]   and how they thought about their lives,
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.640]   where they wanted to live, their jobs,
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.220]   their work-life balance.
[00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.860]   And I'm just wondering if the past few years
[00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.420]   led you to change any of your thinking
[00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.860]   about financial planning topics
[00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.980]   and how you approach questions
[00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.400]   either in your own lives or for clients.
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.820]   - Sure, I can start.
[00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.740]   A couple of areas where I think the pandemic
[00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.500]   and the experience of the past few years
[00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.780]   has changed the way I think about things.
[00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.640]   One is in the realm of,
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.140]   I guess you could kind of call it mindful spending,
[00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.020]   which Nick Mazzulli touched on
[00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.020]   in his conversation with Jeff,
[00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.940]   this idea of being really thoughtful
[00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.140]   about how you spend your money.
[00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.480]   And I do think that the pandemic gave us all a good chance
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.340]   to reflect on, especially the things that we missed
[00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.500]   in that sort of year from March, 2020
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.660]   until the vaccines came online
[00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.860]   and things came back to some version of normalcy.
[00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.640]   But I know in our own household,
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.980]   my husband and I walked and talked a ton during that time
[00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.260]   about the things that we missed
[00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.980]   and frankly, the things that we didn't miss.
[00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.620]   So it was just a really great opportunity
[00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.660]   to reflect on spending.
[00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.900]   I love that people like Ramit Sethi
[00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.160]   spend a lot of time talking about
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.660]   this mindful spending idea
[00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.100]   where you're being really thoughtful
[00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.700]   about how you're deploying your capital on an ongoing basis.
[00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.040]   And his point is like, if you're into getting the appetizer,
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.440]   get the appetizer every time.
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.140]   It's not gonna make a difference.
[00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.040]   You just have to make some cuts elsewhere
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.220]   to accommodate that.
[00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.640]   So mindful spending.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.000]   And then another thing that I've been talking about,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.280]   thinking about, encouraged mainly by Carl Richards,
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.960]   I would say is time on earth allocation.
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.920]   That there's no more precious
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.400]   or finite resource in our lives.
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.740]   Forget money for a second.
[00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:19.980]   Think about the one thing that we have
[00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.320]   that is just a non-renewable resource
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.360]   and it is our time on earth allocation.
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.560]   So how are we deploying that time?
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.800]   Carl has created a simple mantra.
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.160]   He spoke to this group via video.
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.160]   But his time spent with family, preferably outdoors.
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.080]   That's like his focus.
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.240]   That's his compass.
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.680]   That's what he loves.
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.280]   And that is how he tries to figure out his life
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.080]   so he can do more of that.
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.800]   So those are just a couple of deep thoughts
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:53.840]   early in the morning.
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:59.720]   - For me, it's mostly been just a reminder
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.060]   that it is impossible to predict
[00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.280]   what's actually going to happen.
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.280]   I mean, legislation, inflation, pandemics,
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.800]   no one I knew saw that coming.
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.460]   We were not talking about that the summer beforehand.
[00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.760]   And it changed everything.
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.220]   And despite changing everything,
[00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.280]   as far as personal finance and investing,
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.240]   all of the same principles applied.
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.880]   Everything is still the same, personal finance-wise,
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.720]   even though it upended our lives
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.160]   in the most serious of ways.
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.720]   But the things that you go back to,
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:36.840]   okay, how do we respond?
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:37.680]   What do we do?
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.600]   How do we plan?
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.400]   It's the exact same thing it's always been.
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.600]   We still need the same types of insurance coverage.
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.800]   You need to make sure you have a level of spending
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.040]   that's appropriate.
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.700]   Asset allocations should match your risk tolerance.
[00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.420]   Nothing changes, even though, boy, the world changed.
[00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:58.960]   - I'm a pessimist by nature.
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.040]   But the pandemic is one of the few things
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.320]   that I was way too optimistic.
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.520]   I mean, it changed our lives.
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:12.320]   It reminded me that health is far more important than wealth.
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:17.320]   And it also, bringing it to the market, makes us humble.
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.960]   I mean, sure, the market is down this year.
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.520]   We're in a bear market.
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.280]   But if I had a partial crystal ball going into 2020,
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.120]   knew this pandemic was coming,
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:33.120]   Putin was gonna invade, complete political dysfunction,
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.380]   weather catastrophes,
[00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.400]   I would have thought the market would be way down.
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.740]   But the market is up since the pandemic.
[00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:44.540]   So think three years is short term.
[00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.060]   But certainly this year is incredibly short term.
[00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:51.700]   So think long term and yeah, be humble.
[00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.500]   - Thank you all.
[00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.260]   So this is an audience of people who care a lot
[00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.500]   about investing and personal finance,
[00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.540]   who think about those topics a lot,
[00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:06.120]   who are largely committed to Boglehead principles
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:11.120]   of diversification, simplification, low cost investing.
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:16.300]   So what might be some blind spots for this group of people,
[00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:22.180]   things that we could be doing better or in a smarter way?
[00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:25.580]   Oh, nothing.
[00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:29.000]   - That's why I was asking Nick earlier.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.660]   Yeah, that's a trick question.
[00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.660]   - Well, Mike, you were just talking about
[00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:38.620]   some things that we don't talk about enough.
[00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:41.060]   - Okay, thank you for the prompt.
[00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.780]   Yeah, so we spend all of our time.
[00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:43.780]   Well, not all of our time,
[00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:46.580]   but a lot of time on the forum
[00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:49.120]   talking about small cap value tilting
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:52.500]   and exactly what's the right percent in international stocks
[00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.560]   and international bonds and should you own tips
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:58.660]   and all of these things that are not even in the top 100
[00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:01.160]   most important financial decisions you need to make.
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.540]   And that's because a lot of the most important
[00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:05.400]   financial decisions you need to make
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:08.620]   are kind of terrible topics to talk about.
[00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:12.420]   You know, it's you dying, you're becoming disabled,
[00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:14.380]   your spouse dying, your kids dying,
[00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:15.660]   all like horrible things, right?
[00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:17.500]   'Cause you were talking about insurance coverage,
[00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:18.900]   we're talking about estate planning
[00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.020]   and they're not happy topics,
[00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:22.420]   but they're so important
[00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:24.660]   to make sure you have those boxes checked off.
[00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:26.300]   And the other reason we don't talk about them very often
[00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:28.940]   is because there's not a whole lot to say.
[00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:31.240]   Like if someone came up and asked,
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:35.160]   I'm 36, I'm working, do I need disability insurance?
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.720]   Yes, I mean, that's the end of the discussion.
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:40.840]   And so there's just, whereas we can talk forever
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:44.120]   about whether you could, should small cap value tilt
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.160]   because it's not a clear answer.
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.260]   That's the reason we talk about it
[00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.520]   because there's really strong arguments on each side
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:51.640]   and it's not obvious at all.
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:54.600]   And that's why we can go around in circles for 15 years,
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:58.480]   whereas we don't do that about disability insurance.
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.840]   But disability insurance is more important.
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:04.980]   - I'll just hop in really quick
[00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:07.620]   if we're talking about hard things,
[00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:08.820]   the topic of hard things.
[00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:11.540]   One thing that came up at a Bogleheads conference
[00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:13.820]   probably three or four years ago
[00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:16.140]   was the topic of elder care,
[00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:19.140]   caring for older adults in your lives,
[00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:22.580]   parents thinking about your own self as an older adult
[00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:25.900]   and the various issues that might accompany that.
[00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:30.760]   So I would say that that's sort of the softer dimension
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:33.380]   of long-term care and elder care planning
[00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:35.900]   is probably something that we don't discuss enough
[00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:36.860]   as a community.
[00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:40.680]   And I think we need to discuss all of those dimensions.
[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:43.540]   And I would give my family's experience
[00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:46.180]   as kind of a, I think a good reminder
[00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:48.380]   of why it's not just financial.
[00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:51.380]   So I think of my parents as in a lot of ways
[00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:53.820]   came into their later senior years,
[00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:56.300]   very well equipped financially.
[00:09:56.300 --> 00:10:00.060]   They could handle long-term care expenses
[00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:01.940]   out of their own coffers
[00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:05.100]   and were able to die with funds left
[00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:07.940]   besides those which they wanted.
[00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:11.540]   And they had adult children living close by
[00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:14.660]   to help ensure that the long-term care delivery
[00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:16.340]   happened as they had envisioned.
[00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:18.480]   So we had caregivers in the house.
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.300]   So a lot of that was pretty perfect.
[00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:23.780]   I lived about two and a half minutes away.
[00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:27.420]   And so what I would say is if that's your plan
[00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:30.220]   and if you're well-situated with long-term care,
[00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:35.220]   just think through sort of the side aspects
[00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:36.960]   of that long-term care.
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.580]   Don't just dwell on the financial.
[00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:42.980]   Think about the actual delivery of the long-term care.
[00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:46.100]   Because I would say from my own family situation,
[00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:49.980]   even though it all lined up on paper, it was awful.
[00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:53.100]   Those were the worst years of my life.
[00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:56.700]   And my parents went into it thinking
[00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:58.900]   that they had everything all lined up,
[00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:01.980]   but still super hard on the family.
[00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:05.460]   So whatever you can do to kind of think through
[00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:09.740]   all of the possible contingencies on that front
[00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:10.860]   I think will go a long way.
[00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:13.240]   And one resource I would throw out on this front
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:16.740]   is Carolyn McClanahan, who is an MD
[00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:18.580]   and also a financial planner.
[00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:21.580]   She talks about all of this stuff in her work,
[00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:23.500]   the things that you might never think of.
[00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:27.020]   So if the plan is for the children to be involved
[00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:30.780]   in managing the house that the parents wanna stay in,
[00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:32.880]   well, they need to sign a contract
[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:35.840]   to ensure that they're actually committed,
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:38.440]   that the parents aren't just thinking they're committed.
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:41.140]   So all that stuff I would say is a blind spot
[00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:43.420]   for a lot of us, even if we feel like
[00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:45.580]   we have everything all lined up on paper.
[00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:49.540]   - I just wanna echo the same thing.
[00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:52.060]   The investing part is incredibly simple.
[00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:54.020]   The only complication, admittedly,
[00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:56.420]   it's a big complication, are taxes.
[00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:58.660]   Boy, do you make it simple.
[00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:01.860]   I don't like talking about estate planning, that's death.
[00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:05.500]   It's not fun, but it's incredibly important.
[00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:10.500]   Long-term care, very, very difficult.
[00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:13.820]   And the information out there, whenever I write about it,
[00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:16.680]   I get a lot of hate mail 'cause the data's all over the map
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:20.380]   on your probability of needing long-term care.
[00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:25.180]   And by the way, it's usually lopsided.
[00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:28.620]   Don't forget, if one spouse becomes the caregiver,
[00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:31.560]   the other spouse eventually needs long-term care,
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:32.820]   they no longer need a house.
[00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:34.740]   They're not traveling, they're not eating out.
[00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:37.940]   They're saving a lot of money elsewhere.
[00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:42.700]   So yes, financial planning is less about investments
[00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:47.700]   and more about planning for our lives.
[00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:49.560]   We will get older, we will die.
[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.520]   Did I say I'm a pessimist by nature?
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:53.040]   (audience laughing)
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:58.040]   - Okay, so now that we've stepped into some
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:00.080]   of those really painful topics,
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:03.400]   let's take a step back into some of our safe space,
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:05.040]   talk about investing.
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:09.600]   At our investing panel yesterday,
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:12.900]   one of the topics that came up was ESG funds,
[00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:15.780]   which elicited some very strong,
[00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:18.780]   consistently negative reactions.
[00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:22.060]   So just a very quick question to the panel here.
[00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:25.900]   Anyone own ESG funds or wanna make a case
[00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:28.620]   for why that's something that people should consider?
[00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:32.820]   (audience laughing)
[00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:35.140]   - I do not own ESG investments.
[00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:37.980]   I will say Morningstar has made a huge investment
[00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:39.820]   in the ESG space.
[00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:41.860]   We acquired a company called Sustainalytics
[00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:44.180]   that does a lot of research in ESG matters
[00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:47.780]   and have some of our team focused on ESG matters.
[00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:50.900]   I do not own ESG.
[00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:55.020]   It's not that I don't think that there are valid ways
[00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:59.160]   to ESG, but I think that there might be better uses
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:04.160]   of my principles or better ways to deploy my principles.
[00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:09.340]   In terms of the landscape, I do find it terribly confusing.
[00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:13.020]   In fact, I was attempting to help do these portfolio
[00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:15.500]   makeovers every year, and I was attempting to help a woman
[00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:19.180]   who did want to have an ESG portfolio sort out
[00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:21.860]   her tangle of funds that she had assembled,
[00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:24.300]   and she had about 25 different holdings
[00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:26.420]   with a portfolio of about $100,000.
[00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:29.620]   So a terribly complicated portfolio.
[00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:33.260]   And I found it really difficult to sort among
[00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.700]   the various ESG options.
[00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:38.500]   I think that there's a need for transparency
[00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:40.940]   to help people ESG if they want to.
[00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:44.540]   The one thing that tantalizes me in the ESG space
[00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:45.820]   is behavioral.
[00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:49.020]   I have a feeling that if people have a portfolio
[00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:53.340]   that is aligned with their values,
[00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:56.340]   that potentially they might be more likely
[00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:59.300]   to stick with that plan, and that's not nothing.
[00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:03.340]   The idea that someone, we have seen all this data
[00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:04.780]   about dollar-weighted returns.
[00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:06.420]   We know that people, a lot of times,
[00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:09.260]   don't stick around when they buy something.
[00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:10.460]   So that's the one thing.
[00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:14.860]   I'll be intrigued to see how the data unfold on that front,
[00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:17.620]   because that's the one thing that really compels me
[00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:19.500]   in the ESG space.
[00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:22.340]   If someone has that alignment, are they more likely
[00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:23.780]   to stick with the program?
[00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:25.660]   I think that that's worth watching.
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:29.440]   I own a business.
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:31.080]   Alan owns a business.
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:34.520]   I have control over that business because I own it.
[00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:37.800]   Alan has control over his business because he owns it.
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:41.960]   To me, it has always seemed just on-its-face bananas
[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:45.360]   that the way you could best influence a company
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:48.000]   is to choose to not be a shareholder.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.080]   It's backwards.
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.400]   That's what it's always seemed to me.
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:54.880]   You're doing exactly the opposite
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:55.960]   of what you want to be doing.
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:16:00.020]   You're giving up a major potential source of influence
[00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:02.920]   over this company by excluding it from your portfolio.
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:07.920]   So it's always seemed not just unhelpful, but detrimental.
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:14.040]   What I do feel differently about is,
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:17.740]   and so I asked this yesterday to Ben from Morningstar,
[00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:23.720]   is engine number one or other similar companies
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:25.580]   that have a different approach to ESG.
[00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:26.940]   They say, "We're gonna own everything.
[00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:29.480]   "It's a low-cost indexed portfolio."
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:31.840]   So they're gonna get similar investment returns
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:32.840]   to what you would get.
[00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:36.880]   And they vote the shares in a particular way.
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:39.280]   And maybe that way is in keeping with your values,
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:42.220]   maybe it's not, but I like the idea of having options.
[00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:44.720]   This fund company is gonna vote their shares this way.
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:47.260]   That fund company is gonna vote their shares that way.
[00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:51.760]   And they're still boring, simple index portfolios,
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:55.020]   but they're actually exercising the source of control
[00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:56.600]   and influence that we have.
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.400]   And to me, I'm much more optimistic
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:01.920]   about that version of ESG.
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:05.340]   Whether it's gonna be super impactful, I don't know.
[00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:07.360]   Do I still think, just like Jim said yesterday,
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:09.840]   there are better and more impactful ways
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:11.720]   to change the world, yes.
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:14.920]   But I'm more optimistic about that
[00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:19.400]   than the traditional version of ESG by a huge margin.
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:20.240]   - Okay.
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.880]   Christine, when you were saying about the makeovers
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:26.100]   and someone who has 25 funds,
[00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:28.740]   and I will admit to there have been periods in my life
[00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:30.620]   when I have had more than 20 funds
[00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:32.380]   for no justifiable reason.
[00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:37.380]   So I wanted to ask you about simplicity, radical simplicity
[00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:40.460]   and complexity in portfolios.
[00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:43.320]   We had a question from the audience
[00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:47.340]   about a couple who had opted for a very simple approach
[00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:49.300]   with a three fund portfolio.
[00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:53.140]   And then more recently had augmented that with I-bonds
[00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:55.820]   and laddered CDs and tips.
[00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:57.700]   And so the question was,
[00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:02.300]   so we are drifting from what was once a simple
[00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:04.380]   and easy to manage portfolio
[00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:07.780]   into something that might be safer, but more complex.
[00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:10.900]   Is it a mistake to abandon our commitment
[00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:13.100]   to simplicity in this manner?
[00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:16.880]   And I just wonder just how much of a,
[00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:20.300]   how far do you feel people should go in simplicity?
[00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:21.780]   - Right, it's a great question.
[00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:24.740]   And I often evangelize about the value of simplicity,
[00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:28.540]   but I do think specifically what this couple has done
[00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:30.100]   makes a lot of sense to me.
[00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:31.580]   So in retirement,
[00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:34.340]   as you kind of think about a retirement portfolio,
[00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:37.740]   I just like the idea of stair-stepping it by risk level.
[00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:40.580]   So you've got your liquid reserves
[00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:42.900]   that you're drawing upon on an ongoing basis.
[00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:45.200]   You've got some short-term bonds,
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:48.860]   which you can't ask total bond market
[00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:51.260]   just to give you your short-term bond piece.
[00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:52.340]   If you need to take some money
[00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:55.700]   out of your in-retirement portfolio,
[00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:58.260]   I think it's wise to have some short-term bonds
[00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:00.840]   as kind of next line reserves
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:04.420]   in case the cash is depleted in a year like 2022,
[00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:06.900]   for example, and you still need additional funds.
[00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:10.460]   And then maybe moving into intermediate term bonds,
[00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:12.580]   and you'd also want to have I-bonds
[00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:15.080]   in that portion of the portfolio.
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:17.500]   The other thing I would say is to me,
[00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:21.620]   it's fine for accumulators to manage their portfolios
[00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:23.980]   as kind of a unified whole.
[00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:26.880]   So as long as if someone has
[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:30.540]   the really great low-cost index fund in their 401k,
[00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:32.400]   they can put all their funds there,
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:35.380]   but in other parts of the portfolio,
[00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:37.480]   they may want to hold fixed income
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:40.860]   where perhaps they can obtain more favorable pricing.
[00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:43.300]   So I think it's fine to sort of use
[00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:47.500]   that unified portfolio model in the accumulation years.
[00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:49.320]   In the decumulation years,
[00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:53.700]   Mike showed the value of being a little bit flexible
[00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:57.060]   about where you're pulling your assets from
[00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:58.540]   on a year-to-year basis.
[00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:00.900]   And at that point, as you move into retirement,
[00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:04.540]   I think it makes sense to internally diversify
[00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:07.700]   each of those silos across asset classes.
[00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:11.500]   You might use different asset allocations within them,
[00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:14.300]   but there may be years, for example,
[00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:18.820]   where it is a slam dunk to pull all of your allocation
[00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:22.340]   from your traditional tax-deferred IRA,
[00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:27.340]   and you'd want to make sure that that withdrawal comes from
[00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:32.260]   whatever is the right part of the portfolio for picking.
[00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:37.260]   So I do think that you can oversimplify in draw-down mode.
[00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:40.780]   And so I think, to me, the sound of the changes,
[00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:43.060]   the couple made, it seems like they're exactly
[00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:44.060]   on the right track.
[00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:52.900]   - Investing is simple, but taxes aren't,
[00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:54.460]   although I know somebody that makes it
[00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:55.980]   as simple as possible.
[00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:59.300]   So when I started investing,
[00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:03.300]   there was no Vanguard Total Stock Index Fund,
[00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:04.940]   Total International.
[00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:07.700]   And I have unrealized capital gains,
[00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:10.980]   and that creates some complexities.
[00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:12.820]   A really simple plan, by the way,
[00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:14.020]   is when somebody comes to me,
[00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:18.100]   they've just sold their business for $100 million.
[00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:20.260]   There's no tax implications.
[00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:23.980]   So generally speaking, I believe in simplicity,
[00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:27.580]   and I'm gonna sneak one other thing in on the ESG.
[00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:30.660]   I own a Chevy Volt, getting over 10 years old,
[00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:33.100]   getting over 250 miles per gallon.
[00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:36.500]   I believe in being socially responsible,
[00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:39.780]   but buy VTI and take the savings
[00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:43.100]   and donate it to whatever cause you believe in.
[00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:46.940]   - Okay, talking about the investment environment,
[00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:50.820]   a number of speakers, starting with Bill Bernstein,
[00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:54.620]   said this is a great market for accumulators to be buying,
[00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:56.540]   but it's a really tough market for people
[00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:59.860]   who are approaching or just in retirement,
[00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:02.700]   who are hit by those losses early on.
[00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:06.180]   So what are some strategies or approaches
[00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:07.740]   that people should think about
[00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:12.260]   to limit the pain of these losses
[00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:14.820]   as they go into the drawdown period?
[00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:17.820]   You wanna give that to Alan?
[00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:20.780]   - Well, I don't know how to limit the pain.
[00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:22.020]   I don't even know how not to look
[00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:23.780]   at the market 10 times a day.
[00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:31.060]   But in terms of, there's a lot of strategies
[00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:34.060]   like buy an income ladder, buy a SPIA.
[00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:37.700]   You know, cash right now is--
[00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:39.460]   - Immediate annuity just to get that--
[00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:42.020]   - Yeah, yeah, let's get the annuity out there.
[00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:44.380]   And by the way, there's a great annuity out there,
[00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:46.460]   and that is delaying social security.
[00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:49.540]   That's one annuity I very much believe in.
[00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:51.220]   As somebody who failed retirement,
[00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:54.100]   I believe in retiring slowly.
[00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:57.460]   Maybe that person with the high stress job
[00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:00.300]   that Joel pointed out, you know, hated his boss,
[00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:02.340]   but maybe he could do something that's more fun
[00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:05.260]   that, you know, brings healthcare insurance.
[00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:07.380]   And, you know, there are things like that.
[00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:12.020]   You know, the cash now might be the exception,
[00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:14.180]   might feel as good as eating that steak I ate
[00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:16.140]   a couple of nights ago, but in the long run,
[00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:18.260]   that cash is a drag.
[00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:21.100]   And, you know, we can't count on two or three years
[00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:25.540]   worth of cash getting us through the market turnaround.
[00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:28.260]   We've had teddy bears so far this year.
[00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:31.500]   I think that was Jason's term.
[00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:35.260]   And, you know, I was in Japan in 1989.
[00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:38.140]   The market today is still below that.
[00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:39.820]   Yes, I'm a pessimist.
[00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:42.820]   (audience laughing)
[00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:45.620]   - Sure, I would echo Alan's point
[00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:48.260]   about the series of incremental steps
[00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:53.020]   versus like one giant sort of leap to help make a save
[00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:55.420]   if a portfolio is looking shaky
[00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:57.140]   in the years leading up to retirement
[00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:59.580]   to explore multiple levers.
[00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:01.820]   Maybe that's working a year or two longer.
[00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:04.380]   Maybe that's having a part-time job.
[00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:06.300]   Maybe it's delaying social security.
[00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:09.460]   I think all of the levers can work together,
[00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:14.460]   that it's not one big asset allocation change, for example.
[00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:17.940]   One thing I would say is I don't think there's any shame
[00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:21.140]   in de-risking a portfolio that's overly risky,
[00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:24.900]   that's overly stacked towards stocks.
[00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:28.180]   Ideally, you would have done that in 2020 or 2021
[00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:32.100]   rather than doing it in this market.
[00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:34.620]   But I think we all have to remember,
[00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:38.220]   if you look at the 10-year return on stocks,
[00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:39.380]   still really strong.
[00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:43.500]   I think still double-digit 10-year annualized return.
[00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:45.300]   So if you've been along for that ride,
[00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:48.100]   you've had a good experience in equities,
[00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:51.100]   you didn't catch the absolute top,
[00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:53.980]   but there's no shame in de-risking a portfolio
[00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:59.740]   appropriately given your proximity to retirement.
[00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:02.980]   I'm a big believer, and I know Alan and I differ on this,
[00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:05.540]   but I'm a big believer in the bucket approach
[00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:07.780]   to retirement portfolio planning,
[00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:10.260]   mainly because I see and I hear from people
[00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:12.900]   that it really works behaviorally,
[00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:15.180]   that it keeps them on board
[00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:17.540]   with the long-term assets in their plan.
[00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:20.900]   And that's really the point is, yes,
[00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:23.500]   you want to grow and maximize the portfolio,
[00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:26.900]   but peace of mind is really important.
[00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:30.900]   So I like that idea of structuring the portfolio
[00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:34.180]   by sort of using your portfolio spending
[00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:36.420]   as kind of the yardstick to determine
[00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:39.300]   how much to drop into each of the buckets.
[00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:40.780]   And we can talk about that,
[00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:47.460]   or I talk a lot about it in my work on Morningstar.com.
[00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:50.580]   -Christine was talking about de-risking,
[00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:54.900]   making your portfolio slightly less risky.
[00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:58.740]   In my opinion, the very best post ever on the forum
[00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:00.900]   is by the anonymous Nissy Prius,
[00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:04.740]   and it is "Evaluate Your Jitters."
[00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:06.500]   Look it up if you haven't read it.
[00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:09.700]   And the principle is basically,
[00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:14.700]   so any time that the market has gone down significantly,
[00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:16.260]   take note of how you're feeling.
[00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:21.180]   And if you are really not feeling well about it,
[00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:26.060]   then it can make sense to scale back that stock allocation.
[00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:27.220]   Would it have been better to do that
[00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:28.300]   before the market went down?
[00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:29.900]   Yes, obviously, duh.
[00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:34.180]   But it still might be better than never doing it.
[00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:36.420]   But the key point, the really, really key point,
[00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:37.860]   is that if you do that now,
[00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:40.300]   you scale back that stock allocation,
[00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:42.460]   write it down, write down how you're feeling,
[00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:44.260]   write down that you made this decision.
[00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:47.020]   Because two years from now, when the market's doing great,
[00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:50.700]   and you're tempted to go back to a higher stock allocation,
[00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:52.500]   you don't wanna be bitten again.
[00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:55.740]   Make this mistake once, okay, fine, but don't make it twice.
[00:26:55.740 --> 00:27:03.460]   - So let me ask a question for all of you, I guess.
[00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:06.940]   If you were talking to someone, a neighbor,
[00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:10.740]   a young relative, someone who wants to start investing
[00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:14.340]   along with Boglehead's philosophy,
[00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:17.900]   would you suggest that person open account at Vanguard,
[00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:21.420]   or would you suggest they invest at a different platform,
[00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:26.420]   potentially using Vanguard products, or other products?
[00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:29.180]   - Yeah, I'm surprised Joel didn't mention
[00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:30.820]   our conversation last night.
[00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:34.540]   I think I gave him an earful, and by the way,
[00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:37.140]   I still have a flagship advisor who can't overcome
[00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:40.540]   some of the customer service issues at Vanguard.
[00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:44.020]   You know, on one hand, for somebody starting saving,
[00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:46.140]   by the way, I probably would recommend Vanguard,
[00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:48.580]   'cause automating it is really important,
[00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:51.980]   and one can automate mutual funds.
[00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:55.620]   And I still believe that the Vanguard funds
[00:27:55.620 --> 00:28:00.180]   are better than Fidelity, or the Fidelity Zero,
[00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:01.460]   or other low-cost.
[00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:04.220]   I trust Vanguard more.
[00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:06.740]   So, you know, it's a tough call.
[00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:08.980]   And Schwab, by the way, I argue,
[00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:11.420]   is no longer in the investment advisory business.
[00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:16.060]   They make about 120% of their profit
[00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:20.540]   from paying people virtually nothing on cash,
[00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:23.900]   and reinvesting that cash in short-term T-bills.
[00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:25.900]   So I trust Vanguard more.
[00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:30.420]   I probably would recommend Vanguard still,
[00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:33.220]   but I am more than a little bit concerned
[00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:36.620]   that some of the philosophies of Jack Bogle
[00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:38.900]   are not as prominent as they used to be.
[00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:44.500]   - I would certainly recommend Vanguard
[00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:46.740]   to young people in my life.
[00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:48.660]   I have had a good experience with the firm.
[00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:50.340]   I also have a Schwab account.
[00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:53.720]   And I would say, from a technology standpoint,
[00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:55.480]   I don't see a big difference.
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:59.480]   On the other hand, I'm not a big user of either website.
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:01.680]   I spend as little time as possible
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:04.660]   interacting with my financial matters.
[00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:07.300]   I see it as one of my luxury goods,
[00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:09.200]   that I feel like things are on track,
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:11.040]   and I just don't have time,
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:13.020]   and I don't spend much time at all.
[00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:15.900]   And I would also say, from the standpoint of young people,
[00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:18.560]   generally speaking, they'll do anything
[00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:20.780]   to avoid getting on the phone with someone.
[00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:23.580]   So that is not, right? (audience laughing)
[00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:25.860]   And I'm one of those people.
[00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:27.900]   In fact, and I'm not young, but my husband,
[00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:29.900]   I'll call him, and he'll pick up his phone,
[00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:31.020]   and he'll be like, "What's wrong?
[00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:32.300]   "Why are you calling me?"
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:38.800]   So anyway, I don't see the customer service,
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:40.380]   the phone customer service,
[00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:42.260]   as being a big impediment for young folks,
[00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:45.480]   but certainly have been observing,
[00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:47.420]   there's a level of dissatisfaction,
[00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:48.820]   and that's not nothing,
[00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:51.420]   but it wouldn't deter me from recommending the firm.
[00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:55.500]   - I had this conversation recently
[00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:56.780]   with a neighbor and a good friend,
[00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:59.620]   and in both cases, I did recommend Vanguard.
[00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:02.340]   Targeted fund, it's so straightforward, it's so easy.
[00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:04.980]   Are there all of these concerns?
[00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:06.100]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:09.300]   Is Schwab a totally fine place, or E-Trade, or Fidelity,
[00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:10.380]   or any place where you could build
[00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:12.500]   a simple three-fund ETF portfolio?
[00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:13.700]   Sure, go for it.
[00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:16.340]   But I still trust Vanguard
[00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:18.140]   more than I trust any other company.
[00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:21.060]   - Thank you, I know that's a difficult question,
[00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:23.300]   and I think you've all given really interesting
[00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:25.820]   and nuanced answers to a question
[00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:28.740]   I think a lot of people have struggled with.
[00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:30.740]   So Mike, while you're there holding the mic,
[00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:35.340]   let's talk a bit about favorite tax strategies
[00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:39.380]   or opportunities that you wanna flag for people.
[00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:40.500]   - Gosh.
[00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:41.340]   - Or not.
[00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:43.980]   - That's a challenging one,
[00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:45.760]   'cause it varies so much
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:48.100]   depending on what stage of life you're in.
[00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:51.260]   - I have a specific question for you.
[00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:52.220]   Go for it.
[00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:55.620]   So we've heard a little bit about direct indexing
[00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:57.900]   during this conference,
[00:30:57.900 --> 00:31:01.140]   and Ben Johnson was talking about the tax benefits,
[00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:04.500]   but I'd like to hear Mike's thoughts
[00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:07.340]   on tax loss harvesting.
[00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:10.740]   We've been hearing a lot about that in this market.
[00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:15.740]   And so one of the criticisms
[00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:18.560]   of really aggressive tax loss harvesting
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:20.340]   from Michael Kitsis and his team
[00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:24.300]   is that it has the potential to lower your cost basis.
[00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:29.300]   So the benefits are not as great as are being touted
[00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:32.220]   from these direct indexing platforms.
[00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:34.220]   So I'd love to hear you talk about that.
[00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:38.700]   - Tax loss harvesting is when you sell something.
[00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:40.820]   So it's currently worth less than what you paid for it.
[00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:43.420]   It's in a taxable account, not an IRA or a 401k.
[00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:45.620]   And the idea is you sell it right now.
[00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:46.820]   So you have a capital loss,
[00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:48.620]   which is gonna save you some money on your taxes.
[00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:49.840]   And at the same time,
[00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:52.500]   you buy something that's not exactly the same thing,
[00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:54.340]   but it's gonna fill a similar role
[00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:55.940]   in your asset allocation.
[00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:58.180]   And so you haven't had to mess up your portfolio,
[00:31:58.180 --> 00:31:59.460]   but now you have some tax savings.
[00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:00.540]   That's the idea.
[00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:03.540]   And the tax savings, it comes from a few things.
[00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:07.900]   Number one is, well, so just like Christine said
[00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:09.700]   and other people have pointed out,
[00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:12.940]   when you do this, the downside is that
[00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:15.820]   this replacement investment that you purchased
[00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:17.980]   has a lower cost basis.
[00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:20.460]   So when you sell that replacement investment,
[00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:22.220]   the gain is now going to be larger.
[00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:24.100]   So someone was asking me yesterday,
[00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:25.660]   well, what's the point?
[00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:27.420]   There's three points.
[00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:29.140]   Point number one is that
[00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:35.620]   you can use up to $3,000 of net capital losses every year
[00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:37.900]   to offset ordinary income.
[00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:40.180]   And ordinary income is taxed at a higher tax rate
[00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:41.460]   than capital gains.
[00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:45.440]   So if you create later capital gain income,
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:48.300]   but you're offsetting ordinary income right now,
[00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:49.300]   that's advantageous
[00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:51.660]   'cause you're offsetting higher tax rate income
[00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:53.940]   and creating lower tax rate income.
[00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:55.900]   So that's thing number one.
[00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:59.020]   Thing number two, and this is not,
[00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:00.860]   this is the least important one,
[00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:03.500]   is that there's simply some tax deferral, right?
[00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:06.480]   Even if you have to pay tax on a gain later,
[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:07.700]   well, it's gonna be later.
[00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:11.000]   And so that extra money that you have right now
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:11.940]   from that tax savings,
[00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:14.660]   you can invest it and get some earnings.
[00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:16.220]   That's the least important piece.
[00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:18.940]   The third piece is that
[00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:21.900]   maybe this new thing that you bought,
[00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:23.660]   maybe you never sell it.
[00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:25.660]   Maybe you donate it to charity.
[00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:27.300]   Maybe you leave it to your kids.
[00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:29.620]   And so that lower cost basis
[00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:31.380]   that results in a higher capital gain,
[00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:34.260]   you're never paying tax on that higher capital gain anyway.
[00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:36.060]   Because if you donate it to charity,
[00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:38.120]   you get a deduction for the current market value
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:39.940]   and you don't have to pay tax on the gain.
[00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:40.900]   If you leave it to somebody,
[00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:42.380]   they get a step up in cost basis
[00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:44.140]   and they don't have to pay tax on the gain.
[00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:47.140]   So there's three things that the tax savings comes from.
[00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:52.140]   And there's some studies that are ambitious
[00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:56.820]   with what they estimate as the value
[00:33:56.820 --> 00:33:58.780]   of that tax deferral piece.
[00:33:58.780 --> 00:33:59.880]   Most of it, in my opinion,
[00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:04.020]   comes from that $3,000 deduction against ordinary income
[00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:05.140]   and the fact that
[00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:07.380]   maybe you never have to pay tax on this gain.
[00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:11.500]   - You get the quick tax savings,
[00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:15.100]   but then assuming the market goes up in the long run,
[00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:18.460]   you get less and less of the harvesting
[00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:20.840]   and the fees and complexities stay.
[00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:25.840]   With that said, 40 bips is not outrageous.
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:28.420]   And you stole my point, darn it.
[00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:30.860]   If you're gonna, in a few years,
[00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:33.740]   give it to a donor advised fund, that's wonderful.
[00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:35.300]   If you're 98 years old
[00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:40.300]   and you're not gonna be paying those fees for 40 years,
[00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:43.840]   that could work as well.
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:47.360]   Or if you're in a really high tax bracket this year
[00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:48.940]   in a high tax state
[00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:51.140]   and you're gonna retire a year or two later,
[00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:53.860]   then you could be in a much lower bracket.
[00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:55.900]   So there are some small cases
[00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:58.260]   where direct indexing can work.
[00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:00.700]   - Thank you.
[00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:04.900]   I think while we still have a few minutes left,
[00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:08.340]   let's give you out there a chance to ask some questions.
[00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:12.460]   So Lady Geek, would you put this or somebody else?
[00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:13.700]   Just share one mic.
[00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:16.640]   Oh, wow, responsibility.
[00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:24.540]   Very quick.
[00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:26.040]   Okay, first thing on tax loss,
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:29.240]   Bogleheads Wiki, tax loss harvesting.
[00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:31.720]   And again, taxes are complicated.
[00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:33.920]   If you're not sure what Mike and Christine
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:37.100]   are talking about, please stop and ask.
[00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:38.880]   'Cause if you buy, if you sell something
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:41.040]   in your taxable account and you take a loss,
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:41.880]   you can buy something.
[00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:44.560]   If you're not sure what that's for, please stop.
[00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:47.600]   And it's better to do nothing than the wrong thing.
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:49.280]   That's my perennial thing.
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:51.480]   Okay, next, let me back up a bit
[00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:53.800]   about buying confidence in Vanguard.
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:57.400]   I've posted in the, well, let me just say
[00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:01.220]   that don't confuse owning the Vanguard fund
[00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:02.760]   with your trading platform.
[00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:06.080]   I own Vanguard funds at Fidelity.
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:09.080]   I've moved my mother's accounts to Fidelity
[00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:11.160]   because of, well, so as I say,
[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:12.560]   you can own Vanguard.
[00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:15.120]   Vanguard funds are fantastic.
[00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:17.480]   But I am doing that from Fidelity right now.
[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:21.400]   The reasons are that website errors,
[00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:23.640]   customer, lack of customer service.
[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:25.400]   And the main thing that drove me
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:27.080]   to move my mom's account under POA
[00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:30.120]   was because of their transfer to the brokerage platform.
[00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:32.200]   They required a new power of attorney.
[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:33.520]   My mom can't sign that.
[00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:34.640]   That's why I have a POA.
[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:37.120]   So I just basically had an off and left.
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:38.340]   That's my situation.
[00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:41.280]   But the confidence in Vanguard personal advisor service
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:42.560]   is different.
[00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:45.080]   So if people have confidence in the people
[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:47.240]   who are offering the service, that's fine.
[00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:49.200]   I just wanna make sure there's a differentiation
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:52.680]   between the website issues.
[00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:54.680]   I say you can find Vanguard.
[00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:57.920]   So it comes to the Fisher Price UI design.
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:01.040]   That's our long running thread on their website.
[00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:04.440]   And I express my opinion in there.
[00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:07.000]   But I say, please don't confuse their service
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.600]   with the website and their phone support.
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:10.420]   So, okay.
[00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:11.260]   - Excellent point.
[00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:15.680]   - Wanna get some of your thoughts on longevity.
[00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:18.600]   Financial planners and demographers
[00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:21.220]   are telling young folks like me,
[00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:24.800]   anticipate still being alive when you're close to 100,
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:26.240]   95, 100.
[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:28.440]   And even others are saying,
[00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:31.220]   there may be advances in nutrition,
[00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:33.440]   in endocrinology and medicine
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:35.760]   that may have us living even longer
[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:40.000]   as we advance in the coming decades with technology.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.400]   So any thoughts on how that might affect asset allocation
[00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:46.640]   or in the case of target date funds,
[00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:50.000]   setting your target date, any other implications?
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   - Well, I suppose if you are forecasting a very long life,
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.980]   you'd want to have more in growth assets.
[00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:03.520]   On the other hand, bonds are finally looking
[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:06.020]   like a halfway compelling thing.
[00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:10.500]   One broader point I would make is just how I think
[00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:14.820]   the traditional concept of retirement in our mid 60s
[00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:18.940]   is pretty flawed from a lot of standpoints financially,
[00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:21.060]   there's that dimension for sure.
[00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:25.180]   But also, it's like how much more data do we need to see
[00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:30.180]   to show that engagement with others, physical activity,
[00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:35.500]   all of those things confer wellness and happiness
[00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:36.660]   later in life.
[00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:39.220]   And how do many of us get those things?
[00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:40.720]   We get them through working.
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:44.180]   So I wish, especially younger people
[00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:49.100]   would be less kind of one dimensional about retirement,
[00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:50.580]   that they'd be thinking about,
[00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:53.240]   well, maybe I transfer to something
[00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:54.780]   that's less remunerative,
[00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:57.260]   but more rewarding later in life,
[00:38:57.260 --> 00:38:58.460]   just to keep active.
[00:38:58.460 --> 00:39:02.300]   And there's also a financial side benefit of that as well.
[00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:05.860]   So that's the main way I'd like to see people address
[00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:07.220]   concerns about longevity.
[00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:10.860]   But I would also say one thing I think a lot about
[00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:15.020]   is how health and longevity are not at all
[00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:17.260]   equally distributed in our society,
[00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:19.940]   it very much aligns with wealth,
[00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:21.500]   unfortunately, in my opinion.
[00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:24.540]   And so I always exhort wealthy
[00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:27.240]   or certainly people with investment assets
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:30.260]   to push toward the further end
[00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:31.780]   when they're thinking about longevity,
[00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:33.020]   because you see the data
[00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:35.340]   and there's a very clear correlation.
[00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:36.620]   If you have assets,
[00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:39.140]   you're probably going to be more toward
[00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:43.140]   the longer lived side of the actuarial tables.
[00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:50.060]   - We talk about safe spin rates.
[00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:52.240]   I guess one of the good things about the pandemic
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:54.440]   is life expectancy is shortened.
[00:39:54.440 --> 00:40:00.440]   But we talk about a 90% safe spin rate,
[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:02.980]   and especially for younger people.
[00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:04.740]   If you look at the history of governments,
[00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:07.180]   Bill Bernstein educated me on this,
[00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:09.380]   I'm not 90% sure the US government's
[00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:12.060]   going to survive that long.
[00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:21.060]   Mike, your chart on social security
[00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:24.060]   with that two by two grid,
[00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:27.900]   the biggest predictor of life expectancy is wealth,
[00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:30.180]   especially for men, by the way,
[00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:32.080]   because wealthy people are better educated,
[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:35.000]   take better care of themselves, et cetera.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.060]   So I would plan on a very long life
[00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:42.080]   if you can stay aggressively invested.
[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:44.500]   And the last piece I wrote for Money Magazine
[00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:47.220]   was the 2009 financial crisis,
[00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:50.000]   write down how you feel now and pull it out
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.680]   the next time stocks recover and you suddenly feel brave.
[00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:56.600]   So stick to an asset allocation,
[00:40:56.600 --> 00:40:58.280]   go for the long run,
[00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:00.640]   try to do what I can't do,
[00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:02.720]   ignore what the market's doing every day
[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:04.020]   or every 10 minutes.
[00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:09.360]   - I don't think I have anything to add particularly.
[00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:10.200]   Sorry.
[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:11.020]   - Thank you.
[00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:14.760]   - My question is,
[00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:16.800]   obviously there's the difficult things to talk about
[00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:19.840]   with estate planning and some of those topics
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:24.380]   are just not really a topic of conversation amongst families.
[00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:26.240]   For those families that have businesses
[00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:29.260]   that need to be passed down to their children or whatnot,
[00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:31.440]   what are your guys' strategies
[00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:33.440]   in speaking about these things
[00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:36.880]   as I'm sure the ones that are owning that business
[00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:37.960]   or owning their portfolio,
[00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:40.840]   they don't think that time is there
[00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:42.520]   for them to do those things.
[00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:44.200]   So what are your guys' strategies
[00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:47.600]   to account and handle those conversations?
[00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:51.440]   - Okay, so we're talking strategies for the conversations,
[00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:53.080]   the interpersonal strategies rather than--
[00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:54.040]   - Right. - Okay.
[00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:55.000]   - Right.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.280]   - Christine.
[00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:57.120]   - Sorry.
[00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:59.760]   (audience laughing)
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:00.600]   Yeah, no.
[00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:03.720]   - It's not a fun thing to do,
[00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:07.620]   but we just started and not as early as I should have
[00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:09.520]   sharing our financials with our son.
[00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:13.920]   We only have one son so that he understands.
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:17.960]   If he had any inclination in taking over my business,
[00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:19.000]   we would work on that,
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:23.260]   but my exit strategy is to eventually shut it down.
[00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:27.240]   I think there's some difficult conversations.
[00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:28.720]   We haven't had this yet,
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:33.840]   but if I start having cognitive impairment,
[00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:36.800]   when does he need to start taking things over?
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:38.860]   And will I resist it?
[00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:42.760]   Those are very difficult conversations to have.
[00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:48.320]   - I would also throw out one resource
[00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:53.320]   in the realm of thinking about your finances as you age.
[00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:56.480]   Cameron Holston wrote a really great book.
[00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:57.520]   I think it's called "Mom and Dad,
[00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:59.760]   "We Need to Talk About Your Money" or something like that.
[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:01.760]   It's written from the standpoint of someone
[00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:05.380]   who is in her 30s or 40s and was thrust into the role
[00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:08.400]   of kind of the main decision maker for her mother.
[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:12.840]   But it's very well done and includes a lot of concrete ideas
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:15.160]   for managing these issues.
[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:18.360]   And Jeff and I had a great conversation with Cameron.
[00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:20.100]   So I would recommend that book.
[00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:21.960]   And I think she's also got a website.
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:25.520]   Sorry, that's exactly what I was thinking of
[00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:26.560]   when I handed it to you.
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:27.400]   Sorry about that.
[00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:29.080]   Yes, it's an excellent long view episode.
[00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:30.840]   It's recent within the last few weeks.
[00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:31.940]   Yeah, it's super good.
[00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:35.260]   - Great, thanks as always for sharing.
[00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:36.920]   So I'm one of the organizers
[00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:38.720]   for the New York City Bogleheads chapter
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:41.240]   as well as one of the Life Stage chapters.
[00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:42.440]   In speaking with folks here,
[00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:44.560]   we thought a good future meeting topic
[00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:47.440]   would be couples and personal finance.
[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:50.000]   Are there any top tips you have for couples
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.860]   and any specific authors you like on the topic?
[00:43:52.860 --> 00:44:02.080]   - As far as my spouse and I, we've been pretty lucky.
[00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:03.880]   We've been mostly on the same page.
[00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:06.100]   It's not the case where either one of us is the big spender
[00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:08.800]   and the other one isn't and there's been any conflict.
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:13.760]   I think one thing that is something
[00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:16.320]   that I don't necessarily wanna say that we struggle with it,
[00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:18.600]   but clearly of the two of us,
[00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:21.200]   you might guess who is more involved in the finances.
[00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:25.760]   But we do, every month, sit down,
[00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:27.460]   got a spreadsheet, obviously,
[00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:30.840]   and it shows us. (audience laughing)
[00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:31.860]   And we go over it.
[00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:33.840]   And it's not the portfolio stuff
[00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:35.880]   'cause that doesn't need to be looked at every month,
[00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:38.040]   but okay, let's talk about spending.
[00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:40.080]   Let's talk about just where we are
[00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:41.720]   and whether anything needs to be adjusted.
[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:44.560]   So trying to get the other person involved
[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:46.880]   and making it as easy for them as possible,
[00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:47.720]   I think is helpful.
[00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:50.120]   So that they don't have to do any of the analysis.
[00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:52.620]   You're just showing them, okay, here's where we are.
[00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:55.920]   - I have a thought on that, too.
[00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:58.440]   One thought is, and I think this is the case
[00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:02.400]   with a lot of couples, one spouse is simply not into it,
[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:04.160]   will never be into it.
[00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:08.080]   So I would say, do not spend a lot of time
[00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:10.200]   trying to get them engaged with books.
[00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:13.040]   And I love that there are couples who are here
[00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:14.840]   because the other spouse is not that into it,
[00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:15.720]   and that's great.
[00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:16.680]   But in some cases, I mean,
[00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:18.960]   you've got a spouse who is truly not into it.
[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:20.720]   The best thing you can do in that case
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:25.400]   is pre-identify an appropriate financial advisor,
[00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:28.640]   make sure that that person knows the person.
[00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:30.520]   Rick Ferry once made the great comment
[00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:33.840]   that he had had so many guys come up to him and say,
[00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:37.740]   "I told my spouse that if ever something happens with me,
[00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:39.880]   "to check in with you."
[00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:43.680]   And Rick said, because they hadn't made the introduction
[00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:46.520]   to Rick, he hadn't heard from these people.
[00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:49.800]   So go through that step of introducing your spouse
[00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:54.000]   once you've found someone who ticks the right boxes for you,
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.880]   get that introduction in place.
[00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:59.080]   You may have to pay for a meeting, you may not,
[00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:01.760]   but identify the right type of person.
[00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:04.080]   And then if your spouse isn't comfortable
[00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:07.520]   on sort of an emotional interpersonal level,
[00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:10.660]   that's great feedback, move on to the next person.
[00:46:10.660 --> 00:46:15.360]   So I guess my bias would be if someone's just not into it,
[00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:17.760]   yes, leave the good details,
[00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:21.760]   leave what they need to hand it off to someone else,
[00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:23.520]   but don't overdo the education
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:25.800]   if it's just gonna waste everyone's time.
[00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:30.600]   - I won't even take on a client if they're married
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:33.220]   and the spouse isn't going to participate
[00:46:33.220 --> 00:46:35.640]   'cause it's important that both be involved,
[00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:37.640]   understand the game plan.
[00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:40.680]   And my strategy when I kick the bucket,
[00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:43.760]   my wife Patty knows to call Mike Piper.
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:46.760]   (audience laughing)
[00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:50.880]   - I was gonna say the other advantage
[00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:55.120]   of making that connection with an advisor,
[00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:56.600]   could be a Vanguard type service,
[00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:58.960]   it could be a local individual,
[00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:00.720]   is if you put it on your calendar,
[00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:03.680]   okay, we're gonna have this conversation next Thursday
[00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:05.540]   at 11 with this advisor
[00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:08.040]   and I will show you some spreadsheets in advance
[00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:11.500]   so you know the things I'm talking, I'm looking at,
[00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:13.840]   but let's have a conversation in advance
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:16.580]   about what are some of the important questions
[00:47:16.580 --> 00:47:19.360]   that we wanna take up with this person.
[00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:21.600]   And it's actually very liberating
[00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:25.000]   because then you're not the expert,
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:28.840]   quasi expert in this conversation with your spouse,
[00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:33.120]   you're bringing in somebody else as a neutral party
[00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:36.000]   and you are also laying the groundwork
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.680]   for if you're not around your spouse
[00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:42.240]   that has somebody already that they have a connection to
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:44.520]   that they can take things up with.
[00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:49.720]   - Hello, my question is regarding
[00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:53.060]   tax loss harvesting strategy.
[00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:59.160]   I have a simple three-fold portfolio across the board,
[00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:03.420]   retirement, HSA and my brokerage account.
[00:48:03.420 --> 00:48:06.760]   I was thinking to apply the strategy
[00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:08.360]   in my brokerage account,
[00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:11.120]   will it trigger a wash rule
[00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:15.800]   if I have the same funds in retirement or HSA?
[00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:20.480]   - It can, if you buy them in those accounts
[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:21.720]   during the wash sale period,
[00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:25.160]   so 30 days in either direction, yes is the answer.
[00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:28.160]   Similarly, if your spouse does for what it's worth.
[00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:32.720]   - And if I already have them 30 days prior for years,
[00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:34.200]   will it still--
[00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:35.960]   - Just owning it, not a problem,
[00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:38.040]   it's only if purchase transactions happen
[00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:39.320]   during those windows.
[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:40.160]   - Thank you.
[00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:44.780]   - Thank you all for the excellent questions.
[00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:46.120]   We're gonna wrap it up now.
[00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:49.000]   Thank you so much, Christine, Mike and Alan.
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:52.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:48:52.160 --> 00:49:02.160]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
