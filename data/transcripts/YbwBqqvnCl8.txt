[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.640]   Let me just say, I respect President Biden, he's probably the only Democrat who could
[00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.100]   and will lose to Donald Trump in 2024.
[00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.380]   He's now in his 80s, he is clearly on the decline, he's not incompetent.
[00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.580]   All I'm doing you guys is saying the quiet part out loud.
[00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.780]   I think they're disappointed because this is not what you do when you're a member of
[00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.560]   a party, you fall in line, you shush up, you sit down, you get in line, and you do nothing
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.340]   to upset the apple cart of others who've been waiting in line perhaps a little longer than
[00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.340]   you.
[00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.900]   Most members of Congress thought he was going to stand down.
[00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.420]   I called Gretchen Whitmer, I called J.B. Pritzker to jump in.
[00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.700]   The water's warm, you guys, it's a Democratic primary, that's what we do.
[00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.340]   Not only did those two not take my calls, which they would have any other day, they
[00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.180]   had their political operatives take those calls and they told me, "Please don't use
[00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.180]   their names."
[00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.060]   That's the culture, you guys, that we're dealing with.
[00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:52.620]   You will be blackballed, you will be disenfranchised, you will be let out the door if you so much
[00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.140]   as even issue a word that you might challenge a sitting president of the United States.
