[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.360]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning are to be found in
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:14.080]   Paul's epistle to the Ephesians in chapter 5, and I'm going to read from verse 8 to
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.080]   verse 13.
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:27.160]   "For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord.
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:34.960]   Walk as children of light, for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:41.500]   and truth, proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.
[00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:50.160]   And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them,
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:57.240]   for it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:04.120]   But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light, for whatsoever doth
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.560]   make manifest is light."
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:15.840]   Now we are considering this exhortation of the apostle to these Ephesians to live a life
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:24.320]   that shall be in conformity with their profession and with their creed, with what they claim
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.320]   to believe.
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.720]   He has been doing this, as we have seen, for some time.
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.360]   He has been putting it to them in terms of their new birth.
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.080]   He has been putting it to them in terms of their relationship to God as dear children,
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.880]   and has been calling upon them, therefore, to walk in love.
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.640]   But now, here in the eighth verse, he takes up a new argument, and he is appealing to
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:56.880]   them, as we began to see last Sunday morning, to walk also in light, to walk as children
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:04.720]   of light, as those who belong to the light and whose native sphere is light rather than
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.880]   darkness.
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:13.920]   And of course, he is here using a very powerful argument, one that we saw hurriedly last Sunday
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.960]   morning, is used very frequently and extensively in the New Testament, starting with our Lord
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:26.920]   himself, who said, "I am the light of the world.
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:35.600]   He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life."
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.880]   And we have been looking at the matter in this way.
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:47.040]   We see here very clearly that the real basis of the argument is that we have to realize
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:54.720]   that as Christian people we are in a position and in a category that is altogether different
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.800]   from that of those who are not Christian.
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.480]   That must be the first thing always for us to realize.
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.000]   Of course, the world will say, therefore, that we are putting ourselves up on a pedestal
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.120]   and that we are claiming great things for ourselves.
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.000]   Well, we cannot help that.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.440]   The world never has understood Christianity, and it never will.
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.560]   That need not trouble us at all.
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.920]   The criticisms of those who are not Christians should never really trouble us, because they
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.440]   cannot possibly understand.
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.520]   But we can at Inuit show this, that we are not claiming that we are what we are because
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.400]   of our own efforts and exertions, or even because of our own understanding.
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.460]   We are what we are, we say, by the grace of God alone.
[00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.480]   We are his workmanship, as the apostle has already been explaining.
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:50.920]   But because we are his workmanship, we must of necessity be entirely different from those
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:57.080]   in whom God has not done this mighty and transforming work.
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:03.560]   So we have emphasized that there is a complete and an entire difference between those who
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.800]   are in the light and those who are in darkness, those who are Christians and those who are
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.040]   not Christians.
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.320]   We then went on to consider the nature of this difference, and again we emphasized its
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:21.080]   radical character, that we are not merely in the dark before we become Christians, but
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.440]   we are actually darkness.
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.360]   There is darkness in us.
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:32.120]   And so when we become Christians, we are not merely given light, but we are made light.
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.960]   There is this transformation.
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:41.840]   Light enters and irradiates the very depths and vitals of our being.
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.000]   And then we ended by reminding you of the thing the apostle never fails to tell us,
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.760]   that all this has been produced and done by the Lord.
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.120]   Now he says he is light in the Lord.
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.520]   There is no Christianity apart from him.
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.520]   There is no light apart from him.
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:08.240]   He is, as I say, the light of the world, and we are only light in the Lord.
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.240]   Very well.
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:18.240]   Now then, we come on this morning to consider the manifestations of this entire difference
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.040]   between these two positions, between darkness and light.
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.040]   They are essentially different.
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.520]   Well now then, how is that shown?
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.040]   How is that revealed?
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:33.040]   Now that is the thing about which the apostle is particularly concerned here, because this
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.000]   is the practical part of his epistle.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.920]   Because he has already been dealing with this, he has already dealt with it in chapter 4,
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:46.680]   from verse 17 right on to verse 24.
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.640]   He has really been saying the same thing.
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:54.240]   He has been describing that old life with their understanding darkened, vanity of their
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.320]   mind alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them.
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.440]   There it is, but he says it again.
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:05.800]   Indeed, he had already said it all at the beginning of chapter 2, where he reminds these
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.960]   people that in time past he walked according to the course of this world, according to
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:16.480]   the prince of the power of the air, among whom also we all had our conversation in times
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:23.600]   past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind,
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.160]   and were the children of wrath, even as others.
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:32.000]   However, here he comes and says it once more.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.780]   And that, of course, reminds us immediately of the all-importance of grasping and understanding
[00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.200]   this principle and then applying it.
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:47.400]   He keeps on bringing out argument after argument after argument because we are so slow to learn
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.400]   and we so readily forget.
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:54.760]   Well now then, what are these differences?
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.360]   And we are going to look at them for two main reasons.
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:05.000]   One, there is no better way of testing whether we are in the faith or not than to examine
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:11.920]   ourselves in the light of these manifestations of darkness within or light within.
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:16.840]   It is a wonderful test to discover where exactly we are.
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:23.240]   Secondly, it is of vital importance, as the whole context shows us here, in the matter
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:27.520]   of our daily conduct and behavior.
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.680]   Very well, let us look at these two things.
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.320]   What are the manifestations of darkness?
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:37.240]   Ye were sometimes darkness.
[00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:40.200]   Well, what were they like?
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:44.040]   How do you know whether one is in the dark or in the light, or whether one is darkness
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:47.560]   or whether one is light?
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:56.640]   And the answer is that this shows itself in three main ways, or along three main lines.
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:05.600]   First of all, darkness shows itself in the mind, in the matter of one's intellect and
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.240]   understanding.
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:15.360]   We have a habit, have we not, of associating ignorance always with darkness.
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:24.360]   We refer to certain continents as the dark continent, meaning by that, that ignorance
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:30.840]   prevails, that they have been lacking in knowledge and instruction and in information.
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:36.920]   We refer to the dark ages before the Renaissance in Europe.
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:42.960]   The dark ages, well, that was before there was this rediscovery of Greek philosophy and
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.620]   learning and so on.
[00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:52.480]   In other words, we are all familiar with this equating of darkness with ignorance.
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:57.040]   The things are synonymous in our ordinary parlance.
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:02.440]   And on the other hand, we tend to speak of people who have knowledge as people who are
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:03.440]   enlightened.
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:08.480]   People like to refer to the whole of the eighteenth century as the age of enlightenment.
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:14.440]   There certainly was, in the eighteenth century again, as in the sixteenth century, a kind
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:20.600]   of revival, recrudescence of knowledge and of learning, the enlightenment it's called.
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:25.120]   There was a new birth of an interest in philosophy and things like that.
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:34.800]   Well, now there is the kind of term, the connotation that is given to this expression, darkness.
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:42.120]   Darkness affects the mind, the intellect, the understanding, all the faculties that
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:46.080]   are concerned with knowledge.
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:52.560]   And the Bible, of course, above everything else, uses this term in this respect.
[00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:59.400]   And so when the apostle turns to these Ephesians and says, "Ye were sometimes darkness,"
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:07.160]   he means there was a time when your minds were dark, you were ignorant.
[00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:12.280]   And this, of course, is still true of all who are not Christians.
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:15.800]   That is the trouble with a person who is not a Christian.
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:19.320]   He or she is just ignorant.
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:20.760]   There's no other word for it.
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:27.960]   They are lacking in certain vital knowledge.
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:32.880]   That is, of course, as we saw last Sunday, because of the fact that they are blinded
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.220]   by sin.
[00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.480]   But what are they ignorant of?
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.720]   This is the thing we're looking at this morning.
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:44.840]   Well, they're ignorant of God.
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.440]   The fool hath said in his heart, "There is no God."
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:51.960]   Well, any man who says there is no God is just displaying his ignorance.
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:57.000]   He says there is no God because he lacks the knowledge of God.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.080]   That is typical of ignorant people always, isn't it?
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:02.360]   You give them a piece of information, they say, "I won't believe it.
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.360]   I can't believe it.
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.360]   It isn't true."
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:07.120]   Now, the thing is a fact, but they say it isn't true.
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.120]   Why?
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.120]   Well, it's their ignorance.
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.320]   It's the darkness that is in them.
[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:12.960]   They are not proving the thing isn't there.
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:17.080]   They are just telling us a great deal about themselves.
[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:19.440]   It's their ignorance.
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:25.040]   As a man I heard once put it very well, he said, "When a man tells me that he sees
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:29.040]   nothing in Beethoven, he says he's telling me nothing about Beethoven, but he's telling
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:31.440]   me a great deal about himself."
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:37.040]   And that is the exact point which we make here.
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:45.680]   The non-Christian, the unbeliever, is ignorant of God.
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:51.920]   If only men and women knew God and knew the truth about God, they wouldn't live for a
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.880]   second as they do.
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:59.000]   They know nothing about his holy character.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.680]   They talk of God glibly.
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.360]   They express their opinions.
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:09.960]   They don't hesitate to criticize him if they but had some dim, vague, glimmering notion
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:12.160]   of God as he rarely is.
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:19.880]   Well, as Job of old, they'd put their hands upon their mouths and they'd remain silent.
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:25.240]   It's the appalling ignorance of God that makes people talk as they do.
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:30.480]   You see, the Jews, let us say this for them, even at their worst, they knew this about
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.480]   God.
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:37.000]   They knew that God was so great and so mighty and so holy, they never even dared to use
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.880]   the term Jehovah.
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:43.280]   They spoke about the name.
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:48.720]   That was their way of indicating their knowledge of the glory and the majesty and the holiness
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.960]   and the might of God.
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:55.520]   But people who are non-Christian are in darkness.
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:57.200]   They are darkness.
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:58.200]   They don't know God.
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.920]   They're ignorant.
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:04.640]   And the more they talk, the more they express their ignorance.
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:08.600]   They're ignorant of God and of his laws.
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:13.200]   And in the same way, they're ignorant about the real truth about themselves, ignorant
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:20.520]   about their souls, ignorant about the value of the soul.
[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:26.520]   Look at people living a life of pleasure and living in sin, plunging into it, glaring in
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:28.480]   it, reveling in it.
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:29.960]   What's the matter with them?
[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:32.200]   Well, you know, it can be put like this.
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:35.280]   The real trouble with them is this.
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:38.680]   They don't know the answer to this kind of question.
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:49.480]   What shall it profit a man, though he gain the whole world and lose his own soul?
[00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:54.080]   Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:57.240]   They have no conception of it.
[00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:59.560]   They don't realize they have a soul.
[00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:05.040]   They don't realize that there is within them this thing that has been placed there by God,
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:10.360]   which is bigger and greater than the whole world, the most precious, the most wonderful
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:11.360]   thing of all.
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.920]   They're completely ignorant about it.
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:14.800]   They live as if they hadn't a soul.
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.420]   They're living like animals.
[00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:18.440]   They're living on the animal level.
[00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:19.640]   You know such people.
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:21.160]   You read about such people.
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.320]   They're found in all classes in society.
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:28.800]   And the tragedy about them is that they're just ignorant of the fact that they've got
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:33.680]   souls within them that are immortal.
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.360]   They're ignorant of it.
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:40.120]   In spite of all their knowledge on many another subject, they're ignorant of this.
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:46.960]   And so, of course, in the same way they're ignorant of the true meaning of life, its
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:48.760]   object and its purpose.
[00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:51.240]   What is life?
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:54.640]   What are we meant for?
[00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:59.600]   What's the whole object of our being in this world?
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.880]   What's the end to which all this is leading?
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:05.200]   What is real life itself?
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:09.960]   Now again they display this appalling ignorance about death.
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:13.440]   They're just in the dark completely about it.
[00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:18.960]   You see, their whole notion of life and of living is, as is stated so frequently in the
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:23.000]   scriptures, "Let us eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die."
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.760]   What an insult to life and living and to human nature.
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.880]   Are we but animals?
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:39.120]   Is eating, drinking, gambling, indulging the natural instincts, is that really life?
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:42.920]   Well that's what it is, obviously, to those people who are not Christians.
[00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:50.200]   And therefore, I say it's one of the manifestations of this appalling darkness, ignorance, with
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.440]   regard to such a vital matter.
[00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:58.440]   And then, I'm just giving you these headings to indicate the thing in general.
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:06.600]   They're completely ignorant about the end of life and what happens beyond it.
[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:17.440]   The Bible says it is given unto all men once to die, and after death, the judgment.
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:23.760]   You see, according to this book, life is a tremendous thing, full of responsibility of
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:26.520]   the most momentous character.
[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:34.040]   All we do and all we say is being recorded.
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:37.800]   All our actions are known unto God.
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:41.800]   Book of Revelation puts it pictorially and says that the books will be produced and will
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:44.640]   be opened.
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:50.520]   That's the biblical view of life, that our lives in this world are full of the highest
[00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:53.360]   responsibility conceivable.
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:55.760]   We know of responsibilities, don't we?
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:59.640]   We know that ministers of the crown have a great and a dread responsibility, and the
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:04.800]   higher they go, the prime minister, the most responsible position of all, responsible to
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:05.800]   the crown.
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:12.360]   And every one of us, according to this book, is thus directly and immediately and personally
[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:15.600]   responsible to God.
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:21.320]   We'll have to have an audience with him and give an account of the deeds done in the body,
[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:25.640]   whether they be good or bad, a judgment.
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:29.480]   But you see, these people are entirely ignorant of all that.
[00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.160]   That's why they live as they do.
[00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:34.080]   It is this darkness in the mind, in the intellect.
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:38.080]   It is this appalling ignorance.
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:43.960]   And it is because they're ignorant of all these things that they're equally ignorant
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:53.440]   about the Lord Jesus Christ, who he is, the eternal Son of God.
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:57.440]   Why he ever came into this world.
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:00.800]   They're ignorant, you see, of the need of salvation.
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:03.680]   So they're not interested in the salvation.
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:05.000]   They know nothing about it.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.680]   They're just completely ignorant.
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:07.920]   You must have tested this often.
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:11.080]   If you haven't, well, it's about time you did test it.
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:15.800]   Just discover what people really do know about Christianity and about the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:18.160]   Now, it's almost incredible, isn't it?
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:23.840]   With books like this open before them, which they can buy so easily and read without being
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:24.840]   molested.
[00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:25.840]   Here they are.
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:29.320]   They've been brought up in a sense on it, and they've heard it all their lives, and
[00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:36.640]   yet they're completely ignorant about the Lord Jesus Christ and his way of salvation.
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:38.480]   They're ignorant of his person.
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:41.120]   They're ignorant of his work.
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:48.520]   They're ignorant of the one and only way whereby we can be reconciled to God and saved and
[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:52.200]   made safe to all eternity.
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:19:00.320]   That is something of this appalling darkness that afflicts the minds of the unbeliever.
[00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:03.440]   It is this astounding ignorance.
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:09.240]   Oh, this is a Sunday morning, but I wonder whether there's somebody even in this congregation
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:15.520]   who has been ignorant about all those things until this moment.
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:20.040]   Have you realized you've got a soul?
[00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:25.960]   Have you realized the truth about God and that you've got to meet him and face him?
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:31.960]   Have you realized day by day the responsibility of living, the preciousness of this gift that
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:35.160]   God has given to you?
[00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:39.720]   Do you think of yourself as one who has been made and created in the image of Almighty
[00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:40.720]   God?
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:43.080]   What's your view of yourself?
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:46.840]   Have you thought about your death and facing God and giving him an account of what you've
[00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:47.840]   done?
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:53.000]   Now, we are either in the light or in the dark about these things.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.120]   We are either people of knowledge or people of ignorance.
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:00.880]   It's one or the other, and that is the condition of those who are in darkness.
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:01.880]   They're ignorant.
[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:08.600]   Well, but it not only affects the mind, it also affects the heart and the emotions.
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:11.520]   They're not only ignorant of the truth, they don't want to hear it.
[00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:14.480]   They're irresponsive to it.
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:17.120]   They're hard when they do hear it.
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:18.880]   They think it's boring.
[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:20.320]   They can't stand it.
[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:23.120]   You know, it's a terrible thing to listen to a sermon.
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:27.800]   As you listen to a sermon, you as an unbeliever, if you're here, you may think that you are
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:32.920]   judging the preacher, but you know what's really happening is that you are being judged.
[00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:37.800]   If you are bored by the preaching of the gospel, well, you're just making a tremendous proclamation
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:39.880]   about yourself.
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:46.120]   There is no more terrible state conceivable than that, that the truth of God, the glories
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:53.960]   of the gospel are just boring, dull, uninteresting, fatuous, something to be dismissed with a
[00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:54.960]   curse.
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:57.160]   But that is the position of the unbeliever.
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:58.680]   Our Lord himself said it.
[00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:03.760]   This, he said, is the condemnation, that light has come into the world.
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:06.000]   "But why doesn't everybody believe it?"
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:15.880]   The answer is, "And men loved darkness, loved darkness rather than light, because their
[00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:16.880]   deeds were evil."
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:19.680]   You see, it isn't only the mind that's dark.
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:22.000]   The heart is dark.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.360]   Can anything be worse than that?
[00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:31.200]   Than that a human being should have a heart that hates the light, detests it, abominates
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:32.200]   it?
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.800]   But that is what sin does to us.
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.880]   That is the effect of the devil upon us all.
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:40.960]   But let me hurry to the third thing, which is the will.
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:44.840]   For this is the thing which the apostle is emphasizing in this paragraph above everything
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:45.840]   else.
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:48.600]   And, of course, it follows of necessity.
[00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:53.440]   We've got an adage which reminds us that as a man thinks, so he is.
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:56.160]   And it's absolutely true.
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:58.240]   And we often tend to forget that.
[00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:03.640]   You see, everybody today who's alive and living and acting is proclaiming exactly what
[00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:07.680]   he or she thinks.
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:10.040]   Everybody's a philosopher.
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:11.960]   Everybody's got a philosophy of life.
[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:17.720]   And we show what our philosophy of life is by the way in which we live.
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:22.960]   Our actions always correspond to what we think and what we believe.
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:28.360]   Therefore, if people are living a superficial bubble kind of existence, they do so because
[00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:31.360]   that's the sort of minds they have.
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:36.400]   It's their failure to think that leads them to live a superficial kind of life.
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:39.680]   And that is why we must always bear this in mind.
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:43.320]   And indeed it becomes increasingly important because you see this kind of thing in the
[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:47.400]   press almost every day now.
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:55.800]   You can never tackle the problem of immorality or vice or crime directly.
[00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:59.040]   Conduct is the result of the point of view.
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:01.600]   So you'll never deal with the conduct directly.
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:07.040]   That is the fatal blunder of every non-Christian system.
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:10.340]   And we are seeing the failure on all hands.
[00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:16.560]   You see, they will not recognize this fundamental principle which is that as a man thinks, so
[00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:18.000]   he is.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.680]   So it's no use trying to control his behavior and his conduct if his thinking is wrong.
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:27.760]   You see, it's like a man who pours chemicals into a stream because it's polluted and does
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:34.480]   nothing about the lake out of which the stream comes in which is the source of the pollution.
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:41.680]   For so long we were told by these thinkers who were non-Christian that the one great
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:46.680]   cause of crime was poverty.
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:51.280]   But you see, at the present time what they're telling us is this, the one great cause of
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:54.240]   crime is prosperity.
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:57.680]   The cause of crime is that these young people are earning too much money and they don't
[00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:58.680]   know what to do with it.
[00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:01.520]   It's this prosperity that's brought this crime wave.
[00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:06.560]   And yet you see, until this century, that was the great argument for doing away with
[00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:07.560]   poverty and slums.
[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:09.120]   Now don't misunderstand me.
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:12.880]   We should all be concerned about doing away with poverty and slums.
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:14.400]   Nobody can justify that.
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:21.040]   But it does show the tragic, pathetic fallacy of this non-Christian thinking.
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:29.160]   They will not face this central truth that it is a man's total attitude towards life,
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:35.040]   himself, God, and their relationship that ultimately determines and controls conduct
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:36.040]   and behavior.
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:37.040]   It's inevitable.
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:42.840]   Well, in other words, the apostle puts it so clearly in his first chapter of the epistle
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:49.760]   to the Romans, verse 18, where he says, "The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:55.560]   all"—notice the order—"ungodliness and unrighteousness of men."
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:57.360]   Ungodliness first.
[00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:01.480]   It is ungodliness that leads to unrighteousness.
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:06.880]   And to try and deal with unrighteousness without dealing with the ungodliness is a sheer waste
[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:10.400]   of time and energy and money.
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:13.160]   So let them bring their new acts of Parliament.
[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:15.040]   Let them enlarge their prisons.
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:20.440]   Let them invoke the schoolteachers and the schoolmasters and all the social agencies.
[00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:22.080]   It will avail them nothing.
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:23.080]   It never has.
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:25.640]   It never can.
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:31.600]   There is only one thing that can deal with this whole question of morality and behavior,
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:37.720]   and that is that men and women be brought out of darkness into God's marvelous light,
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:43.760]   that they cease to be darkness and become light in the Lord.
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:45.080]   He proves that.
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:50.680]   The contemporary situation is demonstrating it anew and afresh.
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:54.440]   Very well, then, I say, what is this kind of life that these people live?
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:59.000]   How does darkness manifest itself in the realm of the will?
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:04.640]   Again, here is something that you find almost endlessly in the Bible.
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:09.120]   Have you noticed its terms?
[00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:15.000]   To live an evil life are described and talked of as "children of the night."
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.240]   They that be drunken are drunken in the night.
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:22.120]   They are children of darkness, children of light, night.
[00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:23.120]   What is a Christian?
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:25.320]   Well, he is a child of the light.
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:27.800]   We are children of the day, says Paul.
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:29.640]   We are not in darkness.
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:33.360]   We are children of the day, children of light.
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:39.640]   You notice the terms are quite different, and indeed quite apart from Christianity.
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:46.520]   The general observation of mankind seems to have discovered this, because we have an expression
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:47.600]   like this, haven't we?
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:51.480]   We hear and read about the nightlife of London.
[00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:53.480]   Yes, the nightlife.
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:55.880]   That is the description.
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:27:01.120]   It is something that happens in the night, in the dark, the nightlife of London.
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:03.880]   It is a perfect description.
[00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:11.480]   Or as the apostle puts it here, still more clearly, he refers to the hidden works of
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:12.480]   darkness.
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:14.960]   There it is.
[00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:19.120]   It is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in darkness.
[00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:23.560]   He talks about the unfruitful works of darkness.
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:26.800]   Well now, what does he mean by this?
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:31.920]   I merely want to note the terms with you, because they are really very expressive.
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:35.160]   You notice he has got a contrast here.
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:42.160]   He is going to contrast the fruit of the light with the unfruitful works of darkness.
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:44.160]   He is very fond of this contrast.
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:48.840]   That is why I read to you that fifth chapter of his epistle to the Galatians this morning.
[00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:51.800]   Did you notice he had got exactly the same terms there?
[00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:57.880]   In verse 19 of that fifth chapter of Galatians I read, "Now the works of the flesh are
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:59.760]   manifest which are these."
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.840]   Then comes that terrible list.
[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:09.240]   Then he says in verse 22, "But not the works of the Spirit, but the fruit of the Spirit."
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:15.760]   There is a contrast here between works and fruit.
[00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:20.000]   This is clearly therefore not something which is accidental.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.720]   The apostle obviously has a very profound meaning to convey to us by putting it in this
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:26.160]   particular form.
[00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:31.400]   And invariably he talks about the works of darkness.
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:32.400]   Why?
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:39.360]   Well, it seems to me that this is the only deduction which we can draw.
[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:47.400]   There is something about that evil life of darkness, which, to use the term in its right
[00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:51.200]   meaning, is artificial.
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:56.120]   It is a sort of artifact produced by man.
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:29:00.320]   In other words, it is not man's natural life.
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:03.600]   It is not the kind of life that man was meant to live.
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:09.800]   Now, that is true of what we call and boast of as civilization.
[00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:13.080]   That is man's production.
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:20.080]   We can say with assurance and certainty that God never meant people to live as, for instance,
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:22.920]   we live in this city of London.
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:28.520]   God never planned a place like London, or Chicago, or New York, or Paris, or any one
[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:34.600]   of these great cities, or indeed by today, even any one of our villages.
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:36.600]   God never planned a thing like that.
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:38.320]   God never meant life to be like that.
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:42.420]   No, no, this is man's artifact.
[00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:43.760]   This is what man has produced.
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:48.440]   You remember the first to build a city was Cain, the sinner, the murderer, the man who
[00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:50.480]   had murdered his brother.
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:54.880]   He had become dark and he began to express it, and he at once built a city, and he began
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:56.200]   to have city life.
[00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:58.680]   That is not God's way.
[00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:01.680]   With respect to man, that is not God's intention at all.
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:05.160]   All this is some sort of monstrosity that man has produced.
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:07.680]   It is not God's production at all.
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:15.980]   So the apostle talks of this as the works of darkness.
[00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:20.000]   It is something mechanical, something which is organized.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:27.240]   Of course, we see this today perhaps more clearly than mankind has ever seen it.
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:31.400]   It is all done today by advertising.
[00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:32.980]   Read your papers.
[00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:39.040]   The papers today are becoming more and more the finest commentary that I know of on the
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:40.040]   Bible.
[00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:47.380]   You see, the utter artificiality of it all, how a man is built up purely on lies almost.
[00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:49.600]   The things said about him were not true, but there it was.
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:51.160]   He was built up and people believed it.
[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:52.160]   That is how it is produced.
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:54.560]   That is the kind of life of darkness you see.
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:56.440]   It is the works of darkness.
[00:30:56.440 --> 00:31:01.160]   There is nothing real there at all, but a fabric has been erected and put up.
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:03.120]   It is all man's work.
[00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:05.400]   Man makes it.
[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:09.480]   And so life goes on and it is called civilization.
[00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:13.720]   But the Bible calls it the works of darkness.
[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:20.200]   And isn't there something tragically mechanical about it all?
[00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:25.840]   You know, the most awful thing to me at times about the life of sin is its mechanical character,
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:30.800]   the way it goes on repeating itself like a machine.
[00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:36.280]   Nothing new, nothing artistic about it, just churning out the same old thing day after
[00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:41.120]   day, the same sin, the same temptation, the same vice, the same ugly thing that gets you
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:42.120]   down.
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:48.440]   Isn't there an awful mechanical aspect about this repetitive aspect of it all?
[00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:50.080]   Oh, it is just like a machine.
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:51.520]   It is machine produced.
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:52.520]   It works.
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:59.400]   It is all the difference between a machine and a flower, or anything which has real life
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:02.080]   in it, the works of darkness.
[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:05.360]   Horrible, foul.
[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:08.680]   And you see, we all get involved in it, in the machinery.
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:10.600]   Our lives are organized for us.
[00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:12.280]   People don't think any longer.
[00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:15.040]   They just do what is the thing to do and what everybody else is doing.
[00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:17.720]   Well, that is the mechanical side again, you see.
[00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:19.240]   Your originality doesn't come out.
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:20.720]   Your real interest doesn't come.
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:23.840]   You just drop into it and we all look alike, dress alike.
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:25.920]   We are mass produced in every respect.
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:30.920]   We are made to enjoy the same things, believe in the same things, do the same things.
[00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:32.400]   The works of darkness.
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:36.080]   It is a perfectly accurate description.
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:38.440]   How contemporary is this book?
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:41.000]   And then let me take up this second word.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   He talks about here the unfruitful works of darkness.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:57.160]   Yes, he is not only contrasting the machine with real life and growth, but he is looking
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:00.880]   at another side of it.
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:07.200]   He says there is no value to that life, no value in it at all.
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:09.000]   This apostle is very fond of this idea.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.520]   Let me give you another illustration of where he says the same thing in writing to the Romans
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:15.040]   in chapter 6.
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:21.080]   He puts it like this, verses 20, 21, "For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were
[00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:23.040]   free from righteousness.
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:29.360]   What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed?
[00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:31.320]   For the end of those things is death."
[00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:37.000]   What fruit had you then in those things of which you are now ashamed?
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.360]   But what fruit had you then?
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:42.000]   None at all.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:50.880]   That is the appalling thing about this life of sin, this life of darkness.
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:54.920]   It is of no value to the man himself.
[00:33:54.920 --> 00:34:01.400]   That life of sin, that un-Christian life, does nothing for the man himself who lives
[00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:02.400]   it.
[00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:04.680]   It does not add to him in any respect.
[00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:12.360]   It does not add to his mind, his understanding, his knowledge, his purity, his cleanliness.
[00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:14.480]   It does not add to him in any respect.
[00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:20.120]   It takes his money, takes his energy, and leaves him as an exhausted hulk at the end
[00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:22.480]   of his life.
[00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:26.920]   The life that started with such glamour may end in a garret.
[00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:33.320]   The beauty with which it started becomes just a hag.
[00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:34.320]   It is a terrible life.
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:35.320]   There is no value in it.
[00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:36.320]   There is no fruit in it.
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:37.320]   There is no profit in it.
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:38.560]   It takes from you.
[00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:41.520]   We see it all in the case of the prodigal son, don't we?
[00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:43.360]   He started off with his pockets full of money.
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:48.560]   He ended with nothing, empty pockets, no friends, nothing at all.
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:49.760]   That is the life of sin.
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:50.760]   It takes from us.
[00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:51.760]   It is unfruitful.
[00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:54.440]   It is of no value to the man himself.
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:35:01.560]   Yes, and what is even worse, in a sense, is that it is of no value to anybody else.
[00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:05.080]   It makes no contribution.
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:08.840]   That is, I suppose, the final charge that will be brought against this generation to
[00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:11.520]   which you and I belong.
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:16.960]   What are we really contributing even to the story of humanity and of the human race?
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:20.400]   No, no, it is empty.
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:21.960]   There is nothing uplifting.
[00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:23.920]   There is nothing ennobling about it.
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:26.720]   There is nothing stimulating to anybody else.
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:29.560]   It does not make other people rouse themselves to some high achievement.
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:32.240]   No, no, we are not interested in achievement.
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:34.440]   We are interested in ease.
[00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:36.600]   Our interest is leisure.
[00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:40.200]   We have even lost interest in work.
[00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:42.480]   It is the time we are not working that interests us.
[00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:45.040]   Then how do we spend that time?
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:46.760]   Is it some active interest?
[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:49.600]   Is it something that improves the mind or enlarges the heart?
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:50.600]   Not at all.
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:54.160]   Passive, mechanical entertainment always.
[00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:56.440]   You see, it is unfruitful altogether.
[00:35:56.440 --> 00:36:02.640]   It has no contribution to make to others, even as it fails to produce any fruit in the
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:04.680]   persons themselves.
[00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:14.680]   Indeed, it never leads to any kind of growth, except the growth of some noxious weeds.
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:20.360]   It produces a garden of the soul, which is a mass of weeds and of thorns, and there is
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:23.280]   no fruit there, nothing to eat, nothing to live on.
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:26.160]   You cannot look back at it and feel proud of it.
[00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:30.160]   It does not help you at the present if you are taken ill or laid aside, or find yourself
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:34.480]   lying on a sick bed or facing death and eternity, and you say, "Well, now then, I am going
[00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:39.640]   to fall back on my reserves," and you find you have not got anything at all.
[00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:44.200]   You remember the words that came to the rich fool who was congratulating himself and saying,
[00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:47.320]   "So, thou hast much goods laid up for many years.
[00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:48.320]   Take thine ease.
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:50.160]   Eat, drink, and be merry."
[00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:55.920]   But God said unto him, "Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee.
[00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:58.480]   Then whose are these things which thou hast provided?
[00:36:58.480 --> 00:36:59.880]   They are not yours.
[00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:00.880]   You cannot take them with you.
[00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:02.120]   You have got to leave them behind you."
[00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:05.120]   He had got nothing.
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:08.200]   Unfruitful.
[00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:11.680]   You see, it is because people do not think about these things that they go on living
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:12.680]   as they do.
[00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:14.680]   "Is not life wonderful?" says the young person.
[00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:15.680]   Is it?
[00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:16.840]   Examine it, my friend.
[00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:18.640]   See what it is going to lead you to.
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:19.960]   Go on to the end.
[00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:26.040]   Is there any fruit for you or for anybody?
[00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:28.200]   No.
[00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:36.040]   These things are completely and entirely unfruitful.
[00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:41.000]   This is not only true on the personal level, but it is, as I say, on a wider level in the
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.040]   case of countries and nations and empires.
[00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:47.040]   It is simply a fact of history, isn't it?
[00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:54.320]   That what finally produced the decline and the fall of the great Roman Empire was this
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:57.160]   sort of thing.
[00:37:57.160 --> 00:38:04.080]   Rome went down and collapsed because of internal rot.
[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:05.680]   Gibbon will teach you that.
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:08.400]   The secular historians bring that out.
[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:12.200]   It was when the people became indolent and lovers of pleasures.
[00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:17.520]   They all built their marvelous baths of gold and of silver, and they spent their day lolling
[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:23.920]   in their baths and had their sweet music playing to them as they lolled in their baths.
[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:29.640]   The whole race became indolent and slack and lost, even its own ambition and a sense of
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:32.080]   its own mission and greatness.
[00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:38.640]   Rome collapsed and died because of this internal rot.
[00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:48.160]   This life, as the apostle says, is always unfruitful in every respect.
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:52.960]   What alarms one is the question, "Are we witnessing something like this in this very
[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:55.560]   country of ours at the present time?
[00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:58.760]   Isn't this the whole essence of the trouble?"
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:05.440]   You see, you cannot maintain not only morality, but you cannot even maintain political idealism
[00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:14.520]   apart from some grand motive or some noble view and conception of man.
[00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:19.000]   And we are as we are today, and we are witnessing what we are witnessing because about the middle
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:25.640]   of the last century people began to listen to those like Charles Darwin and others who
[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:27.240]   said, "Man, what is he?
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:29.200]   He's not a special creation of God.
[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:31.120]   Is there a God at all?"
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:32.120]   This is a process.
[00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:34.540]   So your view of man becomes degraded.
[00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:36.000]   You forget God.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.880]   And of course, for a while you can live on the capital of the evangelical awakening,
[00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:44.080]   and you can carry on with your morality and your work and your political idealism, but
[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:46.080]   it does not last very long.
[00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:54.640]   Once the real motive has been lost, you get what we are witnessing today, the unfruitful
[00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:57.880]   works of darkness.
[00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:01.080]   They have a kind of inevitable consequence of their own.
[00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:05.520]   It is not fruit; it is just the smashing up of the machine.
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:10.200]   Our Lord Himself said it all, of course, in the Sermon on the Mount when He gave His great
[00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:13.920]   invitation and said, "Enter ye in at the straight gate."
[00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:14.920]   Why?
[00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:24.320]   Well, He said, "Because wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to"—what?—destruction.
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:30.160]   The machine has become master, and the whole thing is blown up and smashed, and it leadeth
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:33.760]   to destruction.
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:42.080]   And the unfruitful works of darkness inevitably always lead to destruction.
[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:44.720]   The last word I want to hold before you is this.
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:48.720]   It is the word that He uses in verse twelve.
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:41:00.800]   No, it is verse twelve.
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:21.800]   "And they are shameful."
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:27.200]   They even feel it themselves, so they do it under cover of darkness.
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:31.960]   They would even be ashamed to do it in broad daylight themselves.
[00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:32.960]   It is a shame.
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:33.960]   It is shameful.
[00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:34.960]   It is disgusting.
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:35.960]   It is foul.
[00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:36.960]   It is vile.
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:50.880]   It is a shame, He says, even to speak of these things which are done of them in secret.
[00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:56.440]   Man, after all, whether he believes it or not, you know, was made in the image of God,
[00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:59.240]   and he shows it when he least suspects it.
[00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:03.240]   Though he does not believe in God and does not believe in his own soul, though he is
[00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:08.440]   fallen and degraded, there is something in him still, this sense of shame.
[00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:09.440]   Thank God for that.
[00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:11.000]   Man is not an animal.
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   Man is not a machine.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   No, no.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.680]   There is this that remains and abides.
[00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:22.920]   Though marred and ruined, there is something of the image left.
[00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:31.480]   Man, even at his lowest and his vilest, still knows something about a sense of shame.
[00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:38.960]   Well, it is your business and mine, in terrible, godless days like these, to start with people
[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:42.440]   on their own level and say to them, "Well, now then, tell me, why don't you do things
[00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:45.120]   like that in broad daylight?"
[00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:50.040]   Then start from this sense of shame and try and bring them to see how their whole view
[00:42:50.040 --> 00:43:00.560]   of themselves and God and of life is just based on utter ignorance, which, if it be
[00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:09.080]   not enlightened, will lead them to destruction and disaster and a final doom.
[00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:16.800]   Oh, the love of God, that looking upon such a world of darkness and of ignorance and of
[00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:26.360]   shame, should have sent his only begotten Son into it to be a light of the world, and
[00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:33.000]   by dying upon the cross to deliver us from it and to translate us from the kingdom of
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:38.800]   darkness into the kingdom of God's dear Son.
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:45.760]   But Christian people, may I put it to you like this, are you concerned about the messes
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:49.200]   that are in this darkness?
[00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:52.560]   I know you feel a sense of disgust with respect to them.
[00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:53.560]   We all do.
[00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:58.000]   But, you know, if you merely feel a sense of disgust and gather up your skirts and walk
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:06.120]   on the other side of the street, you are almost as bad as they are.
[00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:11.240]   That is what the Levite and the priest did, you remember, with that poor man that was
[00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:14.360]   wounded by the roadside.
[00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:16.400]   That is of no value.
[00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:22.640]   If we realize that these people are living that kind of life because of this tragic ignorance
[00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:27.600]   and darkness, well, then I say as Christian people it should work in us like this.
[00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:30.220]   We should say, "What can be done about these people?
[00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:33.120]   How can this light and knowledge be brought to them?"
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:38.480]   And I say once more that there is nothing that can deal with it.
[00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:45.280]   But such an outpouring of the Spirit of God, such a visitation of God's Spirit in revival,
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:52.440]   such as we had in 1859, such as we had for so many years in the eighteenth century under
[00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:57.120]   the preaching of Whitefield and the Westleys and Romaine and others here in the City of
[00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:02.680]   London, such as you had under the Puritans, such as you had in the Protestant Reformation.
[00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:07.200]   And therefore it seems to me that the way to test whether we really do take these things
[00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:09.280]   seriously is this.
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:18.040]   Are we praying God to send us such a revival to pour out His Spirit upon us that the church
[00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:27.160]   may be so filled with power that this apathetic, godless, dark, ignorant, shameful generation
[00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:49.080]   will be compelled to listen and compelled to think and compelled to face God and their
[00:45:49.080 --> 00:46:12.280]   audio
[00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:19.520]   of
[00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:29.520]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
