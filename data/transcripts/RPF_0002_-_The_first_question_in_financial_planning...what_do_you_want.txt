[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:07.440]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast, Episode 2. I'm your host, Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:15.640]   I thought a lot about how to begin this podcast. I've gone down a few different rabbit trails in my mind.
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:24.860]   For example, I questioned should I jump right into the tactics of what type of retirement account to open
[00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:31.940]   or what type of investment to choose or how to save money on your living expenses.
[00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:41.440]   But I think I'd like to begin somewhere else. I'd like to begin with a question.
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:51.980]   What do you really want? And then that would lead naturally to the second question, why?
[00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:59.960]   Why? I read and consume, probably like many of you, a lot of financial literature.
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:10.200]   And I think about a lot of arguments. I think about a lot of the debates that are commonly had about what's the better thing to do.
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.160]   And I've come to the conclusion that there are lots of great things to do.
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.960]   And just about every decision that somebody makes could be correct.
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.520]   Given their circumstances, if they know what they want and what they're trying to achieve.
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.780]   So the best place to start with financial planning is what do you want?
[00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.800]   What are your goals?
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:48.820]   Now, the challenging thing is that most of us, me included, often don't exactly know what we want.
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.320]   And so I think we're going to have to take a step back and think about what we want.
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.120]   And I think that's going to be the first step to the right direction.
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.320]   Because if we're going to be doing this, we're going to be doing it right now.
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.520]   And if we did, we'd probably be a lot closer to it than we are right now.
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.960]   So I think there's a period of self-searching, soul-searching, self-discovery as you kind of figure out what it is that we actually want.
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:14.200]   But that's got to form the foundation of our financial planning conversation.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.960]   When I chose the title for this podcast, Radical Personal Finance,
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.060]   I chose it because I'm drawn to the extremes.
[00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.620]   I'm drawn to the people who live radically.
[00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.420]   The interesting thing is I think I'm not the only one who's drawn to that.
[00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.880]   I think many people are drawn to that.
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.300]   We're often drawn to extreme stories.
[00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.520]   Stories of extreme wealth and success.
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.560]   Stories of extreme poverty.
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.140]   Stories of extreme success.
[00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.460]   Extreme sacrifice.
[00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.940]   And I think the reason that we're drawn to those things,
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:59.240]   is partly because we admire people who are 100% focused on their task.
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:04.980]   We often find people in history who did one thing and did it well.
