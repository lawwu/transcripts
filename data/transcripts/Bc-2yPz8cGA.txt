[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   Welcome, everyone.
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   This short screencast is an overview of the Lit Review.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   We've reached the project phase of this course,
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   and I think the Lit Review is a really crucial element there.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   It's where you begin to build an intellectual foundation
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   for your project.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   Fundamentally, for me, the rationale behind the Lit Review
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   is about productive dialogue.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   We want you to enter into dialogue with your teammates
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   and with yourself and with your mentors
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   and with your colleagues.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   With your teammates and with yourself and with your mentor
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   from the teaching team about what you're
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   going to try to accomplish in the final project.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   So you should pose questions.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   You should identify obstacles and propose initial workarounds.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   You should find data sets and models and architectures
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   and everything else, and you should think carefully
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   about your resources.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   The idea here is to gather intel from the literature
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   about what people are doing in your space
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   and use that information to begin
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   to carve out an original vision for your own final projects.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   The specific requirements are listed at the course website.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   You can follow the link at the top of the slide here.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   Let me just offer you a brief rundown.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   First, it's a roughly six-page document,
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   and we say eight pages is the max so you don't go overboard,
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   and that does not include the obligatory references section.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   We have a template that you can use.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   It's a LaTeX template based in the ACL format.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   You're not required to use it, but you might as well,
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   and you'll begin to get used to dealing with that ACL format,
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   which is required for the final paper.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Groups of one should review five papers.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Groups of two should review seven,
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   and groups of three should review nine.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   I think you can hear in there a small incentive
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   for doing group work, which we think is productive in general.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   The ideal is to have the same topic for your lit review
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   and final project.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Obviously, that's the most efficient,
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   but we do grant that sometimes people finish their lit review,
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   and that leads them to the realization that they don't want to work
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   in that area anymore.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   That is perfectly fine, but then you should negotiate that
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   with your mentor and with the members of your team
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   to make sure you can have your actual project converge
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   in the time available, which is always too short.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Then we come to the major things to include,
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   and you might as well use these phrases as section headings
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   in the document to help your mentor understand
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   what you're trying to do.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   General problem task definition, this is absolutely crucial.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   We want to know what kind of questions you're going to be asking,
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   and you might begin to guide us toward things
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   that will be crucial for your project.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Then we want concise summaries of the articles.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   I will say we're not really looking for you
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   to just summarize the content.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   The ideal summary is going to raise questions
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   and identify issues that will be useful to you
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   in thinking about the project work itself.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Relatedly, you should compare and contrast these articles.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   How do they differ in terms of models and data
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   and fundamental results?
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Because that too could help point the way toward space
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   for an original contribution.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Then really importantly, let's think about future work.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   What are you going to do next?
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   How might this all come together into a project?
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   It's never too early to begin that creative process,
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   and the more you can do under this heading,
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   the more productive your dialogue with your mentor will be,
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   and then I think you'll be able to go farther.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Then finally, so that you get in the habit of this
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   and so that we can identify what literature items you're reviewing,
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   we want an obligatory references section.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   In terms of actually conducting lit review searches,
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   I do have some tips that I have found really productive over the years.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Here's the kind of cycle that I still use regularly.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Search with some keywords in the ACL anthology,
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Google Scholar, or Semantic Scholar.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   Because it's NLP, I recommend starting with the ACL anthology.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   A wonderful aspect of the NLP community is that it is
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   very well organized when it comes to its literature.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Essentially, all of the work that's published by the ACL
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   is accumulated into this anthology, which has good Google search,
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   good bib entries, abstracts, links to the papers, you name it.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   So that's a good first stop, especially if you're working on a core topic in NLP.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   But don't limit yourself to that.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   You should branch out also and check Google Scholar and Semantic Scholar.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   In this course, we really value interdisciplinary work,
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   and so you want to connect with other literatures besides NLP in many cases.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Next step, download relevant and/or highly cited results
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   and check out their abstracts and related work sections.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   These are heuristics.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Relevant will be delivered by the search engine according to your keywords,
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   and then highly cited is just a good heuristic
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   for finding things that have been influential.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   You shouldn't depend on it, but there's no doubt that it's a useful piece of information.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   When you do this, you're seeking out key questions and techniques
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   and also other highly cited papers.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   You should not read entire papers at this point.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   That is tremendously inefficient.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   There are too many papers out there, so you need to use your time wisely.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   So the idea here is to get a feel for these papers
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   and also get a sense for what else they are citing.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   Download the papers that you see prominently in the related work section
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   and kind of add those to the set that you downloaded as part of your core search.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   And then return to step one with some new keywords
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   that you gathered as part of the searching that you did.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   And you should keep going on that loop and break out of it
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   when you have a sense for what you're doing and what others have done in the area.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   You'll start to iterate around in a few papers that you think are clearly important.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Maybe some new directions will be suggested by the other papers that are in your set.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Now you've got the basis for thinking about a selection for the lit review.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   At that stage, you select some core papers from that downloaded set.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   And finally, you read those deeply and you cover those in the lit review.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   Notice you do that only at the final stage so that you can learn as much as you can
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   by kind of surveying widely in a lightweight way.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   And then you go deep once you have a sense for where to invest.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   This is sort of amusing, a plagiarism policy.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   It's especially meta-feeling for us because, after all, we study large language models.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   And there's a growing concern in academia that these language models will make it harder for us
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   to assess student writing.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   Let's try to embrace this a little bit.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   So I did do a search based on how the Electra paper relates to the Transformers paper.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   This is with GPD 4, and I will confess to you that what came back looks awfully useful to me.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   This does look like kind of raw information that you could use to inform a lit review.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   So that's all to the good.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   Make sure you know the course policy, though.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   It's linked here.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   And what it essentially says is there's no rule against using an AI assistant like GPT-4
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   to help you with your lit review.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   But all output from the model needs to be quoted.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   That's per the policy.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   You treat it like any other resource.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   And, of course, assignments that are just quotations from any resource are not going to do well
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   in terms of evaluation.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   Assignments with substantial overlap in prose will be scrutinized for plagiarism.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   And what that means is that if two groups used a similar prompt and got back similar results
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   and included them in the lit review unquoted, they'd probably get nabbed for plagiarism,
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   not because they used a model, but because the two assignments look too much alike.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   And at that point, it's not the language model that we're implicating here,
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   but rather the standard sort of thing that we see when we worry about plagiarism.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   So I would suggest using these assistants not to produce raw prose for you,
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   but rather to help you figure out what's in the literature.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   And you'll want to be skeptical consumers because while I think this is a pretty good description
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   of Elektra and Transformers, I haven't thoroughly audited it,
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   and I wouldn't include it anywhere, even paraphrased by me,
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   until I had given it a thorough audit to make sure that it was all factually correct.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   Because that's the ultimate thing that we're looking for,
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   never mind where all this prose came from.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   But the idea here is that there's obviously value to these things.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   They could supercharge certain aspects of research, so we don't want to ban them.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   After all, we think they're really interesting artifacts.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   That's why we're in this course.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   But we want to use them with caution, and we want to make sure that they don't end up
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   kind of producing really bad scholarship.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   That is the fundamental thing that we're watching out for.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   That's it for the lit review.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   It's worth thinking ahead to the next document,
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   which is a bit more unusual in the context of this course.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   That's the experiment protocol.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   This is a short, structured report designed to help you establish your core experimental framework.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   And the required sections are listed here, hypotheses, data, metrics, models,
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   general reasoning, summary of progress, and references.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   You can see that that's kind of the raw materials for a project in this space.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   And we're trying to look to see whether anything is missing,
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   and whether there are any other obstacles that would prevent your project
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   from converging in the time available.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   The idea is clarity around project goals, identification of obstacles, and project risks.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   So you should be erring on the side of disclosing too much in the interest of making sure
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   we overcome all the obstacles and fill in all the gaps so that the project succeeds in the end.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   That's for the protocol, but you might as well be thinking along these lines for the lit review.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   It is never too early to begin brainstorming about exactly what the final project is going to look like.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   Even at the lit review stage, you can start to get a feel for what hypotheses are interesting,
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   what techniques you want to try, and so forth and so on.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   So the earlier the better. That's what all of these preliminary project assignments are about.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   Thank you.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
