[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:41.520]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge, skills, insight and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.520]   My name is Josh Rasheeds, and today I'm thrilled to welcome back to Radical Personal Finance, my friend Stephen Harris.
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.120]   Stephen, welcome to the show again.
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.880]   Hey, Josh, 10 years or less.
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:56.840]   Good news. You're going to make a million in either 10 months or lose your million in 10 months.
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.160]   I was thinking about that when we talk about what we're going to talk about today.
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:08.920]   I think that we're all going to be thinking about wealth in a different perspective and what financial independence and financial freedom means in different perspective.
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:19.840]   And this has been a drum that I've been beating for, I mean, almost 10 years now in Radical Personal Finance, that we need to be prepared to function and flourish in a financialized world.
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.360]   But we also need to be prepared to function and flourish if and when the financial system breaks down.
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.400]   And we're going to be talking about some of the ways that right now the financial system is breaking down.
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.640]   Let me give a quick background for the uninitiated.
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.200]   Stephen Harris is an engineer, a scientist, a chemist.
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.640]   He spent a number of years working in automobile development with Chrysler.
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:52.280]   And for many years, he's been a purveyor of high quality information, publishing books on energy, publishing books on disaster preparedness, publishing books on all kinds of things.
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:02:00.600]   And he's my go-to science guy that I'm recruiting little by little to help me prepare the science education for my homeschooled children.
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.600]   So we're going to be...
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.360]   Stephen and I chat from time to time and I give him, "Here's what I'm doing, Stephen.
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.120]   How can I give a better education to my children?"
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.400]   Because he is an autodidact and a polymath.
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.880]   So Stephen, again, welcome.
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.680]   I'm excited to talk to you today.
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.960]   Yeah, I sent him back a picture of a fireman with a four-inch fire hose.
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.880]   And it's like, "Is this what you wanted?"
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.600]   And he goes, "No, too much, too much."
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.480]   So let's begin, Stephen.
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.560]   You and I have been talking for a while.
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.040]   And here on the show, we've released episodes about a year ago.
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.960]   We released a podcast here on Radical Personal Finance talking about some of the various
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.480]   shortages happening in fundamental materials.
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.480]   And...
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.960]   Stop the word shortages, okay?
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.840]   Shortage means you can go someplace else and get it.
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.800]   This is like out of stock, outage, not produced, gone from the planet.
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.960]   You got to wait until next year's planting that hasn't been planted yet and harvest.
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:01.960]   Right, right.
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:07.480]   Yeah, we're going to do some off-the-cuff talk between you and I.
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:17.440]   And a lot about energy finance, investing opportunities, the world, food, deglobalization,
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:24.200]   the shifting of manufacturing, how this is like incredible opportunity and incredible
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:31.240]   non-opportunity for a lot of places and what the greater trends are going to be.
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.880]   And you and I are just going to do what people seem to like the best.
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.000]   And it's called dumping from unconscious competence.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.400]   You and I are just going to dump back and forth from what we know and let it flow, but
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.400]   continue.
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.400]   Yeah.
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.320]   So I'm going to begin by talking about the food situation.
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:58.240]   I will refrain from using the word shortage because I am deeply concerned about what seems
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.200]   the inevitable global famine.
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:06.520]   I already have friends, some friends in Kenya who are reporting that friends, people in
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:12.200]   their neighborhood, people in their church are literally already dying of starvation.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:19.360]   And as best I can see, we're kind of at the front end of a global famine that is coming.
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.560]   Let's start with talking about that.
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.800]   They're not dying of starvation.
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.800]   They have died.
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:24.800]   Two have died.
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:25.800]   Yes.
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.800]   Correct.
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.800]   Two have died.
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.800]   That's right.
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:34.000]   They are dead in the ground, buried from starvation, which is famine.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.040]   And as anyone else said, that's food insecurity.
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.320]   No, they're dead.
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.160]   They're no longer corporeal on this planet.
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.120]   And that is what is already beginning.
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:54.040]   And that is what's going to be happening to the tune of, well, both you and I are now
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:05:01.400]   fans and purveyors and listeners to a gentleman by the name of Peter Zion, Z-I-E-H-A-N.
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.400]   He's on YouTube.
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.680]   He wrote a couple of books.
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.840]   We've read his books.
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:12.440]   And he gets into, he is just like, he is the savant, not the idiot savant, the genius
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:23.240]   savant on all things, age waves, population, demographics, location, depth reports, you
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:31.560]   know, how big ships can get in and out, bottlenecks, history, and a lot of other things.
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:37.080]   So we definitely want to give him credit where credit is due.
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:46.560]   But the famine stuff, first of all, we got to erase all of the BS in people's minds.
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.280]   It has nothing to do with Ukraine.
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:55.280]   Now Ukraine is not making it any better, but it is not the root cause.
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:03.440]   Now Ukraine invasion started around the 26th or 28th, I think of February of this year,
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:04.720]   2022.
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:15.560]   Now in 2021, early November of 2021, I saw what was going on in the European theater
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:23.360]   and the America theater with natural gas and their attempt to regulate, control natural
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:30.600]   gas, and I've seen it before going all the way back to Obama administration.
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:36.560]   But I mean, there were some, all of a sudden I saw the teeth of some of the sharks in early
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:44.200]   November and I wrote just a two page white paper and it was called "Swimming Out to
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:50.840]   Sea and the Possibility for First World" and I put in parentheses CONUS, which means continental
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.960]   United States, famine.
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.600]   And I husband my words very carefully.
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:05.440]   I gave percentages, references, sources, and the way I saw famine in the United States
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.440]   of America.
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.880]   Now famine means not shortage, not food.
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.060]   It means out of stock, gone.
[00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:18.520]   You go to a store in this city, the next city, the next state, Amazon, eBay, it does not
[00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:19.520]   exist.
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:20.520]   Okay?
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.580]   Some of it has been consumed.
[00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:25.200]   There is no more to backfill.
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.680]   There's no more coming in.
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:31.800]   This is a hard concept for people to grasp, but what do you mean there's no more?
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.920]   When's the next truck coming in?
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:34.920]   There isn't.
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:37.560]   Is that because there's the truckers?
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:41.400]   No, it's not because there's a shortage of truckers.
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.440]   Is there a supply?
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:44.560]   No.
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:52.240]   Everything that was grown has been harvested and has been distributed and they are now
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.520]   out until the next planting season.
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.280]   People don't understand that.
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.680]   The same way people go, "Where does milk come from?"
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:00.680]   The store.
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.440]   "What do you mean I go to the store, I get milk?
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:03.440]   Milk comes from the store."
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:07.760]   No, it comes from a cow, which comes from the cows and the dairy.
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:11.360]   The cow is fed food in the dairy by the dairy farmer.
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:15.120]   Many times he grows his own food or imports his own food.
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:19.920]   The milk is then, you know, that is grown by another farmer that is then transported
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:22.720]   to his location for food for the cows.
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:29.160]   The milk is then processed, goes through a whole bunch of processes, is then transported
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:35.720]   to a bottling location where it is bottled and filled and transported to a distribution
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:43.160]   center, which is then transported to the grocery store distribution, then to the grocery stores,
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:47.360]   and then into your hand, into your shopping cart, into the self-checkout, also called
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:56.400]   the Walmart IQ test, and then into your refrigerator at home and your stomach.
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:03.520]   So I saw all this happening and I wrote this paper and the next thing I know I get some
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:07.480]   phone calls that's like, "Hey, Harris, what?
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:10.520]   Your paper got picked up by this think tank."
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.520]   It's like, "Them?
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:13.520]   Really?"
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:17.480]   And they go, "Yeah, they spent four hours on it."
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:23.720]   I go, "They don't spend four hours even on like, you know, nuclear war."
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:27.040]   He goes, "Yeah, well, they took it pretty seriously."
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:37.120]   And I got contacted and did some more stuff and that report became what's called embargoed.
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:44.520]   And the embargo is off now and that's why I've been talking about the information.
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:48.320]   Not that people were listening anyways.
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.040]   So I can't release the actual report.
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.440]   I can write another report.
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:56.160]   I can do a podcast about it, as I've done, and I can talk to you about it and everything
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:01.200]   else and the information is freely dissembled by me.
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:08.320]   But yeah, I was contracted to do the research for a particular subject.
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:15.120]   And they came and they said, "Yeah, your estimate of 20% is very good.
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.840]   The numbers look to be about right."
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:19.600]   Again, this is last November.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:26.800]   And they go, "We agree with you that if there is to be a famine in 2022, 2023, then it will
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:30.200]   be like the way no other famine has happened.
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:35.040]   Normally a plague of locusts come in or you have like two years of drought or something
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.520]   and it's like all the crops are gone."
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:42.600]   And keep in mind in ancient times, biblical times, which is mostly where we get the word
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:50.080]   famine from, we didn't have diesel fuel trucks, trains.
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:57.760]   We had mules, asses, things that Mary rode on and wagons.
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:01.040]   And that was your transportation infrastructure.
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:05.440]   Now we're a lot more global, but now we're looking at a global famine.
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:12.640]   So, let's talk about why, because when I talk about my friends and acquaintances in Kenya
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:19.320]   who have died from the current famine that's happening there, it's much more related to
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:25.640]   drought crop failures in the way that you just alluded to and exacerbated by the massive
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:30.560]   price increases, inflation of food that they can't afford to buy imported food.
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:34.600]   And so it's more of that traditional model and they just have no money to buy the food
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:39.160]   and evidently now it's to the point where, again, the reports I have is that two people
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.520]   that are in my circle of connection have died.
[00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:47.360]   But that's not a universal thing and that's not the kind of thing where it's actually
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.680]   unavailable.
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.800]   Wealthy people are still able to buy food.
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.840]   So let's begin with natural gas.
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:56.040]   What is the connection between natural gas and food?
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:12:02.360]   Okay, I actually, if you want the long story, and I'm going to give you the short one here,
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:05.640]   okay, this is even smaller than the garden hose.
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:11.520]   If you want the four inch fire hose, I did my first podcast and thank you Josh for giving
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:17.800]   me the model for everything that you use successfully for podcasting because I duplicated it as
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:18.800]   you told me to.
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:19.800]   I took your advice.
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:20.800]   Good.
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:21.800]   So thank you.
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.640]   Thank you, sir.
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:25.000]   And I got two of them out.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.380]   I got more to come out.
[00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:31.480]   And the first one is natural gas and its role in human life.
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:39.360]   Now you have to go back and you have to understand first and foremost that everything in the
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.600]   world that is alive is made of carbon.
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:49.640]   You, me, my cat, we're all made out of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, and then trace minerals
[00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:55.520]   for bones, teeth, and nutrients and stuff like, but everything else is carbon, nitrogen,
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:13:00.720]   sorry, carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen, which is called an organic molecule.
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:10.080]   So C, H, and O. And all of our carbon comes from atmospheric carbon dioxide, every bit
[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.080]   of it.
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:17.320]   None of the structure of all you, me, the cat, the dog, your salary, coffee beans, they're
[00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:21.860]   all structure physically comes from the carbon.
[00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:29.100]   And all that carbon is brought into the plant through the photosynthetic process of absorbing
[00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:34.280]   atmospheric CO2, water, and sunlight.
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:40.900]   And the thing that makes chlorophyll, because the plant produces chlorophyll that converts
[00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:45.460]   CO2 and water with sunlight into organic material.
[00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:49.200]   And when I say organic, I don't mean like your organic tomatoes.
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:52.320]   I mean organic as in organic chemistry.
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:55.700]   All organic chemistry contains a carbon in it.
[00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:56.700]   Okay.
[00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:02.380]   Inorganic chemistry is what you had in high school, the periodic table of elements, iron,
[00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:08.940]   zinc, sodium, potassium, uranium, et cetera, that is all inorganic chemistry.
[00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:17.100]   So nitrogen, and the nitrogen for photosynthesis does not come from the air.
[00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:22.380]   I repeat the nitrogen for photosynthesis does not come from the air.
[00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:24.200]   That is bound up nitrogen.
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:31.700]   That is N2, diatomic nitrogen, just like all of our oxygen is O2, a diatomic oxygen.
[00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:32.700]   It is bound up.
[00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:35.460]   It is a tight bond.
[00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:40.300]   We need chemically available nitrogen in the soil.
[00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:46.180]   And actually one of the ways that happens is through rain, because the rain falls through
[00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:51.780]   the sky, it absorbs the nitrogen based upon the temperature of the water droplet, it absorbs
[00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:55.260]   nitrogen and oxygen, and then it hits the soil.
[00:14:55.260 --> 00:15:02.760]   And then it actually reacts with a few things that may or may not be in the soil.
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:05.900]   And you get fixed nitrogen.
[00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:13.280]   Now we discovered that the addition of nitrogen to the soil, either through different forms
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:18.980]   of ammonia or urea, which is human pee, animal pee, et cetera.
[00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:25.020]   I mean, a lot of people who are into the permaculture stuff, literally collect their human urine
[00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:30.140]   in their bathroom in a container, dilute it one to two, one to three, and they go put
[00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:32.660]   it on their garden.
[00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:35.220]   But that is not enough to feed the world.
[00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:42.220]   But that was actually one of the original sources for the nitrate that made up gunpowder,
[00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:46.220]   which is a whole nother six inch fire hose lecture from Harris.
[00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:53.300]   Incidentally, Josh, when your kids start learning chemistry, we're going to teach them pyrotechnics
[00:15:53.300 --> 00:16:00.900]   first, which starts with gunpowder, which is yes, very safe, very easy to do.
[00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:04.900]   And that's how they'll learn their chemistry is through the chemistry of pyrotechnics,
[00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:09.900]   because you get to see your results, and then all your changes.
[00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:17.660]   So anyways, we learned that if we take nitro, or what farmers just call nitrogen, but this
[00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:26.260]   is going to be in the form of nitro, sodium nitrate, potassium nitrate, et cetera, which
[00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:29.320]   a lot of it comes from bird droppings.
[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:33.140]   And there are lots of bird droppings off the coast of Chile.
[00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:38.460]   When the birds fly into their nest off the coast or on an island, they're smart enough
[00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:42.900]   to take a dump before they fly into their nest.
[00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:51.140]   So birds extricate urine, fecal material, and their eggs all through the same spot.
[00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:57.540]   So it's a mixture of everything, and that collects into the ocean or on the island.
[00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:03.500]   There's great history of if you found an island full of bird guano, you could claim it as
[00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:09.380]   territory of the United States, which is how we got some of our islands in the Pacific.
[00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:14.660]   So this is the late 1800s, early 1900s.
[00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:22.020]   And we would import Chilean saltpeter from off of Chile, in Chile, et cetera.
[00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:31.140]   And it's saltpeter, which is generally considered potassium nitrate, but it's a flavor of sodium
[00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:37.180]   nitrate, sodium nitrite, as well as potassium.
[00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:45.540]   It's the whole chemistry, urea, ammonium nitrate, the whole flavors of nitrogen organic chemistry
[00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:46.540]   in there.
[00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:52.860]   And then we would bring it over by the shipload as fast as possible.
[00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:56.940]   And we would then put that on our soil.
[00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:01.120]   And it's no different than putting manure on the soil.
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:07.780]   And/or what's better is you biodigest manure, make methane from it.
[00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:09.940]   And really smart dairies do this.
[00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:13.120]   They use this to help power their dairy and heat their dairy.
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:19.140]   And then the byproduct is actually doubly enhanced nitrogen fertilizer that they sell.
[00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:26.820]   But even this is not enough to feed the population of the world on an industrial scale.
[00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:29.140]   People keep going, permaculture, dude.
[00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:35.820]   Yes, there's some very good things about permaculture, some very intelligent things about permaculture.
[00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:43.980]   But it isn't to scale of 7 to 8 billion people.
[00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:49.380]   So anyways, early 1900s, someone who could actually do math figured out with the population
[00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:54.220]   growth of Europe and everything that they were going to run out of fertilizer sometime
[00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:56.740]   in the next decade-ish.
[00:18:56.740 --> 00:19:00.140]   And they needed more fertilizer.
[00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:02.340]   And there was no place else to get it.
[00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:08.660]   I mean, it was a biological process to make the diatomic nitrogen from the air freely
[00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:11.900]   available in the chemical form.
[00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:19.380]   If you've ever smelled ammonia, you know that that is freely available form of nitrogen.
[00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:20.860]   You can smell it.
[00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:23.160]   It's great refrigerant too.
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:29.580]   So Europe was literally going to starve because the addition of the fertilizer was more than
[00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:31.740]   doubling your bushels per acre.
[00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:40.020]   I mean, we're talking like today corn is well over 200 bushels per acre.
[00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:44.460]   You have to look up the world records on it, but it is very high.
[00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:51.100]   And that's because we're adding nutrients to the soil and the plants and the pest load
[00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:57.900]   to allow more chlorophyll production that allows more photosynthesis, which allows more
[00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:05.820]   bringing of water through the roots and CO2 from the air.
[00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:11.460]   In addition to make it basically the plant makes glucose.
[00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:16.060]   Maple syrup is a lot of maple syrup is glucose, which is tree sap.
[00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:20.940]   And just like you and I, the majority of what we eat gets turned into glucose.
[00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:23.700]   That is the energy of the body.
[00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:29.860]   The body then stores that as fat and or the tree then makes cellulose, hemicellulose or
[00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:36.020]   lignin from the glucose that it forms through the photosynthetic process.
[00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:42.940]   Sorry, I don't mean to lose you guys, but I mean, understanding the chemistry in the
[00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:44.500]   most basics.
[00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:49.980]   And then when you see the interruption, you go, oh, who pulled the chair out from underneath
[00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:50.980]   my legs?
[00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:55.980]   I'm like Wile E. Coyote standing here over the cliff, you know, and gravity has yet to
[00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:59.500]   take me over, but I know I'm going to fall.
[00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:04.140]   And there's an anvil, not only are you going to fall off the cliff and not get the road
[00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:09.780]   runner, there's an anvil and a boulder above you getting ready to hit you after you hit
[00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:12.340]   the ground.
[00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:15.300]   So that's how photosynthesis works.
[00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:21.260]   And what happens is this brilliant guy by the name of Haber, German chemistry, he's
[00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:27.660]   also villainized for making chlorine for World War One for chemical warfare.
[00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:33.740]   And believe me, if you're a chemist, making chlorine is not that difficult.
[00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:36.660]   He just made it, bottled it and distributed it.
[00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:39.020]   And he was doing it for his country.
[00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:40.020]   It was German.
[00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:41.680]   Germany was at war.
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:46.140]   So they say he's the man that has saved billions and killed millions.
[00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:51.140]   Both of those are probably an order of magnitude off.
[00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:58.300]   But he figured out how to take atmospheric nitrogen, mix it with hydrogen.
[00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:02.980]   Now they had a hydrogen back then and abundance because they were making what was called town
[00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:10.700]   gas or coal gas, which is what we use to feed through pipelines before we actually put methane
[00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:11.700]   through them.
[00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:16.300]   If you remember the old saying, go stick your head in the oven, which meant go kill yourself.
[00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:21.780]   That's because the gas flowing through the town pipes was actually made from coal and
[00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:24.300]   a coal distillation process.
[00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:30.300]   And it was primarily carbon monoxide and hydrogen and some other volatile organic compounds.
[00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:36.420]   So when you stuck your head in the oven, you would kill yourself from carbon monoxide poisoning.
[00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:42.720]   So anyways, he figures out how to, incidentally, the first internal combustion engines ran
[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:45.740]   on hydrogen and this type of gas.
[00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:50.220]   So the first internal combustion engines were hydrogen engines.
[00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:51.860]   Not a hard thing to do.
[00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:58.940]   So he figured out on a laboratory scale, meaning a laboratory bench top, how to combine hydrogen
[00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:07.020]   and nitrogen, and he actually got drips of ammonia condensing and coming out of his system.
[00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:14.100]   Now we're talking like 1908-ish time frame here and before, and material science, the
[00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:18.620]   science of iron and steel was not what it is today.
[00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:26.180]   And he was at the operating limits of temperature and pressure for the iron/crude steels that
[00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:27.580]   he had.
[00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:35.900]   Well, Haber nevertheless won the Nobel Prize in chemistry for figuring out how to make
[00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:38.900]   synthetic nitrogen fertilizer.
[00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:43.460]   It was a breakthrough, but they couldn't make it in volume.
[00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:52.380]   Now this guy you probably never heard of by the name of Bosch, another German, I believe
[00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:57.700]   there's a chemical company that is named after him, B-O-S-C-H.
[00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:04.980]   Not a big one, just worldwide.
[00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:15.540]   He figured out how to industrialize on a commercial scale Haber's process for making ammonia out
[00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:22.060]   of hydrogen and nitrogen and enough to feed all of Europe.
[00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:28.060]   He quadrupled the production of food in Europe.
[00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:31.540]   This is early 1900s.
[00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:39.380]   And it's called the Haber-Bosch process because one person fertilized the egg and the other
[00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:40.900]   one gave birth to it.
[00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:43.620]   So it's called the Haber-Bosch process.
[00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:51.180]   And lo and behold, Bosch wins a Nobel Prize for this.
[00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:53.340]   And thus Europe was saved.
[00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:58.860]   Now this is the fundamental base of all of our fertilizer in the world.
[00:24:58.860 --> 00:24:59.860]   There's three types of fertilizer.
[00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:03.260]   There's N, there's P, and there's K. N is nitrogen.
[00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:06.060]   P is not potassium, it's phosphorus.
[00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:08.820]   K is potassium.
[00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:14.300]   And by far the biggest fertilizer that does the most, yes, rice requires a lot of one
[00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:22.900]   of the others and a few others and they are needed, but nitrogen is by and far the largest
[00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:27.620]   driver of agriculture in the world.
[00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:30.420]   Now farmers are not dummies.
[00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:32.980]   They actually take a sample of their soil.
[00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:40.300]   They take it down to the fertilizer company, a lot of which are still mom and pop owned.
[00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:42.300]   And some are big, some are small.
[00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:47.380]   They do an analysis of the soil to see how much carryover of nitrogen there is from the
[00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:53.340]   previous years, what it's deficient in all the way down to individual minerals and nitrogen
[00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:54.580]   and everything else.
[00:25:54.580 --> 00:26:00.500]   And they specifically make a fertilizer of the right mix to go onto that farmer's field
[00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:04.580]   for the crop that he's going to plant, because maybe he had soybeans last year, he's going
[00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:07.200]   to do corn this year.
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:15.960]   But nevertheless, our source today for hydrogen is natural gas.
[00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:19.720]   Natural gas is methane, which is CH4.
[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:23.200]   Four hydrogens, one carbon molecule.
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:32.000]   So when I, and all of our fertilizers made from this, basically all of the nitrogen fertilizer,
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:39.160]   because it's just too damn easy to make hydrogen from natural gas and make ammonia from the
[00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:40.160]   hydrogen.
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:44.040]   The nitrogen's in the air, it's free.
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:53.040]   And even EPA hasn't regulated nitrogen in the air because it's 78% nitrogen there.
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:27:00.280]   And so now you have this base precursor chemical called ammonia, NH3, which is kind of analogous
[00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:09.120]   to methane, CH4, only it's nitrogen and three hydrogens rather than a carbon and four hydrogens.
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:13.480]   Now from this, we make, you've heard of urea for like diesel trucks.
[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:19.160]   Urea is also a fertilizer that is a nitrogen compound made from ammonia that goes onto
[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:20.760]   the soil.
[00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:23.880]   It's white prills.
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:29.200]   Ammonium nitrate used to be a lot more popular and used a lot, but it's very easy to make
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.360]   explosives out of ammonium nitrate.
[00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:39.280]   So all the insurance companies have kind of dissuaded everyone from using ammonium nitrate.
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:45.640]   And they also make aqua ammonia, which is ammonia in water because ammonia, you think
[00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:51.460]   you had love for your first crush in junior high.
[00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:56.120]   Ammonia loves water more than that.
[00:27:56.120 --> 00:28:00.560]   Ammonia loves water more than you love your dog.
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:07.960]   So aqua ammonia, which is also known as ammonium hydroxide, is a method of distributing it.
[00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:13.720]   And also farmers will actually put ammonia directly into the soil.
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:22.240]   They'll run a plow and inject raw aqueous ammonia, you know, stuff that stinks so bad,
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:23.240]   directly into the soil.
[00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:27.760]   And the thing is, I said, it has this great affinity for water.
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:33.760]   Well, it's absorbed into the moisture of the soil, any moisture in the soil.
[00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:36.600]   So it gets put in directly like this.
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:43.320]   And this is roughly responsible for a quadrupling, more or less, sometimes mostly more, sometimes
[00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:45.640]   less of our current crop.
[00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:53.920]   So when you see them trying to regulate, tax, restrict natural gas, it's like they
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:59.440]   are literally trying to take the food out of your mouth.
[00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:05.120]   And that is what led me, you know, I have a different type of vision.
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:10.320]   I see things, I see the entire series of dominoes on the basketball court.
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:18.840]   And I go, because I can see the first one falling and the other train of the dominoes
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:19.840]   that are falling.
[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:24.640]   It's like, if you light the fuse on the stick of dynamite, the dynamite is going to
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:30.600]   explode unless you clip it or something else like that.
[00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:35.280]   And that's what prompted me to write this report.
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:39.040]   And it was kind of like an offhand report.
[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:41.640]   But I was scientifically literate.
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:46.160]   I was careful and understood the audience that might be reading it and everything else.
[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:49.280]   And it's like, you know, better think from Harris.
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:53.400]   And for whatever reason, it gets picked up by them.
[00:29:53.400 --> 00:30:01.800]   But anyways, that is the role of natural gas in human life.
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:03.740]   I go into more of it.
[00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:04.740]   You can get it.
[00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:09.800]   You can type in Stephen Harris Science and Technology Podcast and whatever you like for
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:14.920]   podcast engines or it's at harris1234.com.
[00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:16.800]   I get into it more in there.
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:23.200]   But let me stop there because I'm sure I probably instigated about 18 questions in your head.
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:24.200]   So let me clarify.
[00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:34.540]   So as I understand it, to recount, the reason we have such a large and well-fed population
[00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:42.320]   on the earth today is fundamentally because we figured out how to feed the world's population.
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:46.800]   When Thomas Ehrlich wrote his famous book, sorry, Paul Ehrlich wrote his famous book,
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:47.800]   the population...
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:51.000]   Don't even mention the default science.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:31:00.280]   Don't even give it the credence of mentioning one of the biggest lies in the world.
[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:03.480]   He was on Johnny Carson.
[00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:12.260]   So the point is that it was probable that we would not be able to successfully grow
[00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:19.980]   enough food with previous technologies, but due to the input of the chemical processes
[00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:26.460]   that you've gone over and the Haber-Bosch process of being able to build a system for
[00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:34.540]   creating nitrogen fertilizer, then that led to a massive growth in crop productivity,
[00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:41.300]   which has allowed us to successfully feed the world now since World War I and counting.
[00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:47.140]   Today we use natural gas to facilitate that process.
[00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:55.380]   But what I don't understand is why there's a danger of having minimal amounts of... of
[00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:59.260]   not having enough fertilizer due to natural gas.
[00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:03.500]   What's causing the problem now in the current way of producing fertilizer?
[00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:12.020]   Oh, well, they're artificially inflating the price of natural gas and they're trying to
[00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:19.220]   put restrictions on it for climate reasons and everything else.
[00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:22.740]   Who is that?
[00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:28.860]   Whoever you want to see on TV, Greta Thornburg, whoever, whatever.
[00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:29.860]   I don't care.
[00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:32.620]   The point is it is being done.
[00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:35.940]   It is happening.
[00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:39.220]   There's a lot of false science behind it.
[00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:41.340]   It's like, no, they say carbon dioxide.
[00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:44.260]   The thing about carbon dioxide, it's thermally emissive.
[00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:49.060]   You can, if I look at it coming out, if it's a different temperature, I can see it coming
[00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:55.420]   out of a bottle and I have an infrared camera, I can see the gas coming out because it's
[00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:58.100]   thermally emissive.
[00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:06.780]   And so they said, well, carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas and it's 420 parts per million.
[00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:08.740]   Remember that word.
[00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:14.260]   So if you had a billion, if you had a million dollars to give away, Josh, here's some finance.
[00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:17.340]   It's like, I'm going to give away a million dollars.
[00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:23.620]   And to you, Mr. Harris, or to you, Josh, me, Steve Harris, I'm giving away a million dollars
[00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:24.620]   in the next 60 seconds.
[00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:25.620]   Oh, Josh, you can have 420.
[00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:26.620]   Here's $420.
[00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:27.620]   What would you say to me?
[00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:28.620]   It's not much.
[00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:29.620]   It's not much.
[00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:30.620]   It's called a trace gas for a reason.
[00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:31.620]   It's responsible for all life on the planet, literally.
[00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:32.620]   Okay, so let me restate.
[00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:52.500]   Due to the current press to change gas emissions on the world, bureaucratic leaders, government
[00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:56.980]   regulators are seeking to minimize the production and the use of natural gas.
[00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:59.220]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:03.220]   Well, it's not the, yes.
[00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:06.060]   I mean, natural gas is already there.
[00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:14.500]   And in fact, everything in the world that, as I was talking about in my podcast, look,
[00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:18.720]   I take you out in the woods and I shoot you in the head, you fall down in the forest.
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:24.860]   You're going to rot aerobically with atmospheric oxygen and you're going to turn into water
[00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:26.860]   and carbon dioxide.
[00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:32.980]   Now, if I like take you out in the woods and I shoot you in the head and I bury you, you're
[00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:38.620]   going to be in an environment without oxygen and that is called anaerobic.
[00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:39.620]   I know my metaphors.
[00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:40.620]   I'm sorry.
[00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:45.300]   They're kind of hard to forget, but they get the point across quickly.
[00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:51.260]   And you are going to decompose principally because all the bacteria are already inside
[00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:52.940]   you to do this.
[00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:57.700]   You're going to decompose into methane and carbon dioxide.
[00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:04.620]   So everything on the entire planet, every whale that dies, every leaf that falls into
[00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:14.780]   the water, every leaf that falls and gets covered up by other leaves, all turn into
[00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:17.660]   methane and carbon dioxide.
[00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:25.620]   And carbon dioxide is measured 400 and about 428 parts per million.
[00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:33.500]   Now this horrible thing of methane, you know what, how many parts per million it is?
[00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:34.500]   I don't.
[00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:41.020]   Atmospherically, they'll show you the rise and everything else.
[00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:48.980]   The Al Gore chart with the hockey stick, it's about 1.8 parts per million.
[00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:52.540]   But do you know how they label it?
[00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:53.540]   I don't.
[00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:57.900]   Natural gas is 1800 parts per billion in the atmosphere.
[00:35:57.900 --> 00:35:58.900]   Interesting.
[00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:05.580]   So they, they changed the units from parts per million to parts per billion so they could
[00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:06.940]   make a larger number.
[00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:12.100]   And then they say it's got a forcing factor 80 times of CO2.
[00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:13.660]   All right.
[00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:19.740]   So, so let me clarify then, because I know I'm not worried.
[00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:24.260]   Obviously that's an important conversation, but I want to understand what is happening
[00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:27.680]   that is making fertilizer in short supply.
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:30.100]   Is natural gas production going down?
[00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:32.820]   Is natural gas usage going down?
[00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:38.780]   What is the connection between natural gas and the increasing desire to regulate natural
[00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:42.500]   gas and fertilizer?
[00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:53.100]   The right now, as we're speaking in the United States on August 26, around 10am, the Henry
[00:36:53.100 --> 00:37:04.260]   Hub price for natural gas is $9.57.
[00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:08.660]   And in the United States, we measure it, what's called MMBTU.
[00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:11.700]   M is a thousand, M is a thousand.
[00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:14.260]   So a thousand, and these are Roman numerals.
[00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:16.660]   So a thousand, a thousand is a million.
[00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:25.260]   So an MMBTU is a million BTUs of natural gas is around $9.57.
[00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:28.580]   Now to give you an example, that's the also the spot price.
[00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:30.820]   That's not the delivered to you price.
[00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:34.940]   The delivered you price is like double.
[00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:42.100]   Give you an example, a big furnace in a house in the Midwest, upper Midwest, is going to
[00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:48.780]   be 60 to a hundred thousand BTUs per hour.
[00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:53.020]   That's how much natural gas, just to kind of like put it in context for the people listening.
[00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:55.340]   I try to like make things relevant.
[00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:58.940]   Now in Europe right now, see they don't price it.
[00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:08.100]   They don't price it in dollars, obviously, per MMBTU, per million BTUs, which mathematically
[00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:12.500]   is coincidentally a thousand cubic feet of that of methane.
[00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:18.420]   They price it in euros, when what's a euro worth today, almost a dollar, right?
[00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:20.420]   Yeah, more or less.
[00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:26.980]   So they price it in euros per megawatt hours thermal.
[00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:36.100]   And they always neglect to say thermal because megawatt hours is a unit of power of energy,
[00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:39.220]   which is power over time.
[00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:43.060]   So my power is five watts.
[00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:50.420]   If I use five watts for an hour, the amount of energy I've used is five watt hours.
[00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:58.620]   So they measure natural gas and they sell it in megawatt hours thermal.
[00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:02.980]   And that's different from electricity because if you want to know how much electricity,
[00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:10.940]   you got to take the efficiency of your generator, which is going to be 18% to 40 some percent
[00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:14.260]   for like a code generation to internal combustion engine.
[00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:21.100]   And there's 3412 BTUs and a kilowatt hour electric.
[00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:26.020]   But anyways, if you do the math, it's like the price of natural gas in Europe right now
[00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:32.700]   is about six, six and a half times the price of natural gas in the United States.
[00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:38.420]   It's so expensive that they have just literally stopped making ammonia in the European Union
[00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:41.060]   because it's like it's too expensive.
[00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:48.140]   The price of nitrogen fertilizer in the United States has been varying between this year.
[00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:57.100]   Let's pick a and never mind 2021, 2020, it's go all the way back to 2019 when like, I mean,
[00:39:57.100 --> 00:40:00.260]   what would you pay for a month of 2019 right now?
[00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:01.260]   I mean, really?
[00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:02.260]   Right.
[00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:07.940]   So, you know, just like transport your back.
[00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:13.420]   Farmers are paying year over year, let alone going back to 2019.
[00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:18.700]   Natural gas was around 235, 270 and MMBTU.
[00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:26.820]   Now it's 957 and it's been down to seven, up to nine, down to, you know, it's been fluctuating
[00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:31.780]   around up there, but it's quite off quite a bit.
[00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:32.780]   Yeah.
[00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:40.300]   The price of fertilizer for the farmer to buy in the United States is six to eight times.
[00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:44.180]   So 600, 800 percent, six to eight times higher.
[00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:53.300]   So what they were paying $220 a ton for, for a particular type of nitrogen fertilizer,
[00:40:53.300 --> 00:41:00.100]   they're literally paying $1,200 a ton for the same fertilizer.
[00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:07.060]   Right now, as of right now, well, planting season, one of the main planting season is
[00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:08.060]   over.
[00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:09.980]   We're actually getting into harvest season.
[00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:12.340]   Crop reports are coming out now.
[00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:14.940]   Vegas crop reports are coming out in mid-September.
[00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:19.180]   It's probably when the rest of the world is going to get that sinking feeling in their
[00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:24.060]   legs of looking over like the Empire State Building or a bridge, ever get up to a high
[00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:27.620]   place and look down and get that sinking feeling in your legs.
[00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:30.580]   The rest of the world's probably going to get that sinking feeling around the end of
[00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:37.780]   September when the crop reports for the September, October, November harvesting finally actually
[00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:46.180]   come in because right now we're eating the wheat, the rice, and the corn from last year.
[00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:54.740]   - So the connection between natural gas and nitrogen fertilizer is there are significant
[00:41:54.740 --> 00:42:02.580]   increases in the cost of natural gas, especially outside of the United States.
[00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:10.660]   In the United States, the price of natural gas has increased from $2.5 per mmBtu to $9.5
[00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:13.820]   mmBtu.
[00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:19.180]   But in other regions, specifically in Europe, natural gas is 6.5 times more expensive than
[00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:22.540]   natural gas in the United States.
[00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:30.040]   Because natural gas is used to make fertilizer through the production of ammonia, that means
[00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:34.060]   that fertilizer prices have increased massively.
[00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:40.400]   And farmers, at least in the United States, have gone from paying $220 a ton for nitrogen
[00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:46.260]   fertilizer to $1,200 per ton for nitrogen fertilizer.
[00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:51.620]   - And the nitrogen fertilizer basically quadruples the output.
[00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:55.900]   Some plants, like soybeans, don't require a lot of extra nitrogen.
[00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:58.780]   Corn is very nitrogen-intensive.
[00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:06.300]   - So now, because of the high price of nitrogen, the concern is simply that farmers will not
[00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:11.540]   be able to pay for it and thus have lower crop yields.
[00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:13.940]   - They've already switched to different crops.
[00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:16.100]   They've already switched from corn to soy.
[00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:20.420]   That happened in the spring.
[00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:23.340]   We already have reduced planting.
[00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:28.860]   - We know that because of the high price of nitrogen fertilizer, and because farmers around
[00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:35.620]   the world were not confident of there ever being a high price for their crops, they switched
[00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:38.780]   to other crops and planted less of the staple food crops.
[00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:40.620]   Is that right?
[00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:48.540]   - Or they didn't plant, or they planted anyways and just didn't put on any or as much nitrogen
[00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:49.540]   as they could.
[00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:58.100]   So their crop yield is going to go from, instead of 200 bushels to acre, maybe to 100.
[00:43:58.100 --> 00:44:03.500]   Some of the stuff I was just watching today on the USA Private Crop Reports, they're going
[00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:10.260]   from 200 bushels an acre or 220 at a high down to 180.
[00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:15.540]   And in other places in the world, they could be literally going from 200 bushels an acre
[00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:20.700]   to 140, 80, 160.
[00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:24.700]   The numbers aren't fully in yet, but it's going to be a lot less.
[00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:28.060]   I mean, it's not a, "Well, we'll just get it from someplace else."
[00:44:28.060 --> 00:44:32.060]   It's like it doesn't exist in other places.
[00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:38.620]   And the price of the energy, the diesel fuel, and the other variations thereof, to bring
[00:44:38.620 --> 00:44:42.140]   it to you is also now greatly increased as well.
[00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:43.140]   - Right.
[00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:44.140]   All right.
[00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:51.260]   So on a global basis then, it sounds like because there's, and it's my understanding
[00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:57.100]   that setting aside the question of regulation, which is obviously important, but the United
[00:44:57.100 --> 00:45:01.660]   States has abundant amounts of natural gas.
[00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:06.500]   That's why it is so cheap in the United States compared to other places.
[00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:07.860]   Is that right?
[00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:10.180]   - No, it's actually at a record price.
[00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:12.140]   It's almost at a record high right now.
[00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:19.260]   - Comparatively speaking, the United States has much larger quantities of natural gas
[00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:24.060]   than other regions of the world, and it's used in the United States.
[00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:29.900]   That's why natural gas, while more expensive than it was in the past, is much cheaper in
[00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:32.660]   the United States than it is, say, in Germany.
[00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:37.140]   - Well, we got a lot less regulation, but they're trying to put more and more regulation
[00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:38.140]   on it.
[00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:43.180]   I have a lot of friends that have a natural gas well, which I was going to put a natural
[00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:49.620]   gas generator on, and we were going to use that for cryptocurrency off of their stranded
[00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:53.100]   well, not on the pipeline system.
[00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:58.380]   And they started getting into some of the regulations, and EPA has yet to come out with
[00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:01.340]   their final ruling on rogue methane emissions.
[00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:06.340]   And they said, "Steve, there's no way we're uncapping that well, unsealing that well until
[00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:12.020]   we get a final ruling on what the rogue methane emissions are, because that methane is still
[00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:15.820]   going to be in the ground for my children or my grandchildren.
[00:46:15.820 --> 00:46:17.660]   It doesn't matter.
[00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:23.380]   And I'm not about ready to open that Pandora's box until there's a decision made."
[00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:29.460]   So there is actually the prevention of a lot of it from coming online in the United States
[00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:35.700]   and as much as it could be, as well as the exploration for it.
[00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:43.500]   And United States, you know, this goes back to Zion and globalization and everything United
[00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:48.660]   States has been doing since the end of World War II to counter to the Soviets.
[00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:54.420]   And then what we've had the residual of for the last 30 years, which is freedom of the
[00:46:54.420 --> 00:47:01.460]   seas, which is now the globalization is all coming to an end abruptly.
[00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:07.300]   That's why Zion's book is called "The End of the World is Just the Beginning."
[00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:14.240]   And so we were getting a lot of our ammonia from outside the United States.
[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:19.940]   We were literally blowing up our ammonia plants in the United States.
[00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:26.660]   You can go to YouTube to control demolition, CDI, part of the Lorenz group.
[00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:32.460]   You can see them blowing up coal plants and ammonia plants and, you know, raising them
[00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:34.140]   to the ground.
[00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:39.940]   So we don't have the ammonia production that we used to have because we would get a lot
[00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:49.660]   of it very inexpensively from China and other foreign markets because we had cheap globalization
[00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:54.180]   and it was more affordable to get it from other places and to bring it in.
[00:47:54.180 --> 00:48:06.020]   So we are mostly self-sufficient at this moment on ammonia here, but not, you know, it's like
[00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:08.420]   saying, well, Steve, how much water do I need?
[00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:10.180]   Oh, about a gallon a day.
[00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:11.180]   But I'm in Arizona.
[00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:15.540]   You're in trouble.
[00:48:15.540 --> 00:48:23.100]   So we have about enough, but we're not awash in the ammonia production.
[00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:25.260]   It's still a difficult process.
[00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:31.460]   I mean, the Haber-Bosch process is not something Steve Harris, with all his chemical knowledge,
[00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:39.140]   is going to do in his research shop or his backyard or his garage or anywhere else.
[00:48:39.140 --> 00:48:42.620]   I mean, there are plenty of complications.
[00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:47.020]   It's a high temperature, high pressure and a catalytically driven system.
[00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:54.340]   So whereas if you got, you know, a hundred million to throw at it, it's pretty darn easy.
[00:48:54.340 --> 00:49:00.940]   In fact, you'll get your money back pretty quickly, but it's not something where like
[00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:06.060]   Henry Ford originally wanted the Model T to run off of ethanol because every farmer can
[00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:07.780]   make ethanol.
[00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:12.220]   Making alcohol on the farm is pretty easy and straightforward.
[00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:14.940]   It's actually hard not to make it.
[00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:18.780]   That is not true with the Haber-Bosch process of making ammonia.
[00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:27.460]   And there is really no other process anywhere near as efficient as the Haber-Bosch process
[00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:30.180]   for the manufacture of ammonia.
[00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:31.900]   It's not trivial.
[00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:39.340]   It is PhD level chemistry, master's level, PhD level chemistry and industrial process
[00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:44.100]   at the same time and metallurgy and process control.
[00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:48.220]   So it's not trivial.
[00:49:48.220 --> 00:49:56.940]   So as things stand here on August 26, 2022, the world is consuming last year's crop harvest
[00:49:56.940 --> 00:50:02.160]   of wheat and corn and all of the other crops.
[00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:06.680]   We don't yet have crop reports for this summer's production in the Western Hemisphere.
[00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:10.420]   We expect those to come in starting in the middle of September.
[00:50:10.420 --> 00:50:12.220]   Official ones.
[00:50:12.220 --> 00:50:17.660]   There are people out in the fields right now on YouTube doing their own crop analysis right
[00:50:17.660 --> 00:50:26.620]   now of the corn, the soybean and the other crops.
[00:50:26.620 --> 00:50:30.660]   It's going to be lower, but not catastrophically lower.
[00:50:30.660 --> 00:50:34.580]   And the way I say it is the United States is going to have a famine.
[00:50:34.580 --> 00:50:37.980]   The rest of the world is going to have a biblical famine.
[00:50:37.980 --> 00:50:42.940]   So let's talk about that because obviously, you know, the commitment that we said at the
[00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:48.780]   beginning is we'll use the right words, but also I want to understand why those words
[00:50:48.780 --> 00:50:50.700]   are warranted.
[00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:55.380]   So would you guess, and I know this is a guess, but an informed guess, do you think we'll
[00:50:55.380 --> 00:51:01.020]   have on a global basis when we're analyzing the official reports two years from now, do
[00:51:01.020 --> 00:51:06.540]   you think this year, due to the higher prices of fertilizer, due to farmers putting substitutes
[00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:12.340]   or not planting as much, etc., do you think we'll have 20% less global food production,
[00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:13.820]   10%, 30%?
[00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:14.820]   What would you guess?
[00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:21.620]   Well, the best thing I can do, and I'm going to give full credit to Peter Zion for this
[00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:31.820]   because he is the population expert and not only the geography, but the geopolitical population
[00:51:31.820 --> 00:51:32.820]   expert.
[00:51:32.820 --> 00:51:35.020]   And he's written about it in his book.
[00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:44.820]   And he says a billion people dead and so many others are coming out and independently saying
[00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:54.740]   like 1.2 billion, not million, billion people dead solely of famine, starvation.
[00:51:54.740 --> 00:52:03.180]   And the estimates are from a year, 18 months to five years at the outside of what we're
[00:52:03.180 --> 00:52:04.180]   looking at.
[00:52:04.180 --> 00:52:10.940]   We're literally looking at rolling back the population of the planet to 1992 levels.
[00:52:10.940 --> 00:52:17.300]   So obviously that's a heavy, even to talk about that is a heavy and horrific thing to
[00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:21.340]   contemplate.
[00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:26.940]   What keeps, why could we not, so let's assume that, let's pretend that we are governed and
[00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:29.940]   ruled by intelligent people that have good data sources.
[00:52:29.940 --> 00:52:34.540]   Let's pretend that they're able to access smart scientific reports, etc.
[00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:42.060]   Why can we not increase the production of natural gas, quickly eliminate regulation
[00:52:42.060 --> 00:52:53.420]   and quickly bring back supplies of sufficient fertilizer in order to lower the costs so
[00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:58.020]   that the next planting season is abundant?
[00:52:58.020 --> 00:53:02.380]   Because it's going to take at least three years to make the ammonia plants if we started
[00:53:02.380 --> 00:53:04.260]   today.
[00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:08.940]   But aren't, there were enough ammonia plants a year ago or two years ago.
[00:53:08.940 --> 00:53:12.580]   Why are there not enough ammonia plants today?
[00:53:12.580 --> 00:53:18.500]   Well, because that ammonia we were using that was abundant and cheap here in the United
[00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:24.420]   States, I remember buying ammonia back in the late nineties with Walter Petzold down
[00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:28.980]   in Herford, Texas, God rest his soul.
[00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:36.180]   And because I was doing some refrigeration experiments with it and you could just go
[00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:37.700]   down to the ag place.
[00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:45.420]   It's like, I need, you know, it was a hundred pound propane tank with a brass valve on it.
[00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:50.260]   It was like, I see the propane is heavier.
[00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:52.180]   It was like, yeah, we fill this up.
[00:53:52.180 --> 00:53:56.980]   And it was like, okay, they charged me for 65 pounds of ammonia.
[00:53:56.980 --> 00:54:04.580]   And there was nothing to it, but a lot of that was being imported and or brought from
[00:54:04.580 --> 00:54:05.580]   other places.
[00:54:05.580 --> 00:54:17.180]   So, I mean, in 2019, let's say you got yourself a thousand pounds of the special metal alloy
[00:54:17.180 --> 00:54:21.140]   of aluminum, copper, and titanium.
[00:54:21.140 --> 00:54:23.580]   And I want to buy it.
[00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:30.860]   And you're in, say, Korea and you want to ship that to me and it's going to come, it's
[00:54:30.860 --> 00:54:31.860]   a 10,000 pounds.
[00:54:31.860 --> 00:54:34.700]   So, it's going to be coming by boat.
[00:54:34.700 --> 00:54:43.540]   What was the cost of that in 2017, 2018, 2019 compared to the shipping of that to me now?
[00:54:43.540 --> 00:54:46.460]   I don't know.
[00:54:46.460 --> 00:54:48.060]   Yeah, right.
[00:54:48.060 --> 00:54:56.620]   Yeah, I mean, the cost of the fuel, the transportation, the logistics, literally the bandwidth of
[00:54:56.620 --> 00:55:05.220]   the freighter and the people working on it is not there where it had previously existed.
[00:55:05.220 --> 00:55:14.180]   And all of the other sources that are making or could make ammonia, like say Europe, are
[00:55:14.180 --> 00:55:19.300]   currently offline because of an incredible high cost of their source material.
[00:55:19.300 --> 00:55:24.100]   So, it's like I'm not buying ammonia from Germany.
[00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:28.660]   I'm not buying ammonia from Bosch and having to come in here because their source material
[00:55:28.660 --> 00:55:31.060]   for it is so darn expensive.
[00:55:31.060 --> 00:55:36.820]   And then there's the cost of the shipping, the marine fuel, the labor for the people
[00:55:36.820 --> 00:55:40.400]   on the tanker and everything else to ship it over here.
[00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:46.500]   We have everything that used to go around the globe seamlessly and for pennies on the
[00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:49.100]   dollar, that era is ended.
[00:55:49.100 --> 00:55:57.780]   In fact, we're going to have to double our manufacturing base according to the Zion here
[00:55:57.780 --> 00:56:01.980]   in the United States as well as everywhere else around the world except for China, who
[00:56:01.980 --> 00:56:06.060]   is circling the drain and going down.
[00:56:06.060 --> 00:56:15.660]   Mexico, United States, Canada, Germany, Spain, everyone is bringing home their manufacturing
[00:56:15.660 --> 00:56:21.140]   and or it's going to be going to India, Pakistan and other places.
[00:56:21.140 --> 00:56:27.060]   It's going to be a whole basket of manufacturing that's going to change radically in the next
[00:56:27.060 --> 00:56:28.060]   five years.
[00:56:28.060 --> 00:56:34.220]   So, that's kind of pivoting to a conversation about deglobalization, which clearly has an
[00:56:34.220 --> 00:56:35.220]   impact.
[00:56:35.220 --> 00:56:39.060]   Let's wrap up the food conversation first.
[00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:42.620]   Let's put the train of arguments together.
[00:56:42.620 --> 00:56:48.660]   Repeating, number one, because we learned how to make synthetic chemical fertilizers,
[00:56:48.660 --> 00:56:54.700]   we were able to massively increase crop yields as compared to the old models of exclusively
[00:56:54.700 --> 00:57:00.740]   using local animal manure or bringing in freighter loads of bird guano.
[00:57:00.740 --> 00:57:08.420]   So that process of creating NPK, or in this case, but focus mostly on N, on nitrogen,
[00:57:08.420 --> 00:57:15.300]   that process is a difficult and intensive process, but of course we've been doing it
[00:57:15.300 --> 00:57:17.220]   now for many decades.
[00:57:17.220 --> 00:57:18.740]   The major input for…
[00:57:18.740 --> 00:57:21.560]   Century, yeah, century literally.
[00:57:21.560 --> 00:57:28.340]   The major input at this point in time used for creating nitrogen fertilizer is natural
[00:57:28.340 --> 00:57:29.820]   gas.
[00:57:29.820 --> 00:57:37.340]   Natural gas is experiencing a significant increase in price for various reasons, and
[00:57:37.340 --> 00:57:45.540]   because the inputs have increased significantly in price, fertilizer, nitrogen fertilizer,
[00:57:45.540 --> 00:57:50.820]   has also experienced a huge increase in price.
[00:57:50.820 --> 00:57:52.140]   And also non-production.
[00:57:52.140 --> 00:58:00.420]   Germany has a choice right now.
[00:58:00.420 --> 00:58:04.220]   The Nord Stream 2 pipeline is shut down.
[00:58:04.220 --> 00:58:09.540]   Nord Stream 1 from Russia to Germany was down.
[00:58:09.540 --> 00:58:16.740]   It's now back up at 20% capacity, and Russia can turn it off at any time, and the Ukrainians
[00:58:16.740 --> 00:58:20.100]   can blow it up at any time that they so desire.
[00:58:20.100 --> 00:58:26.620]   So they're sending, Russia's sending 20% of Germany's total natural gas to Nord Stream
[00:58:26.620 --> 00:58:27.620]   1.
[00:58:27.620 --> 00:58:33.340]   Germany was trying to dump it into their empty natural gas wells as fast as possible to have
[00:58:33.340 --> 00:58:37.820]   enough natural gas for the winter, which now they can't do.
[00:58:37.820 --> 00:58:43.140]   All the natural gas coming from Russia is basically going to run Germany's industrial
[00:58:43.140 --> 00:58:49.940]   base, industrial furnaces, heating, forges, smelting, everything that you can think of
[00:58:49.940 --> 00:58:54.140]   chemically, it's all being done off of natural gas.
[00:58:54.140 --> 00:58:57.940]   I mean, it's an incredible chemical feedstock.
[00:58:57.940 --> 00:59:05.620]   So I mean, if you want to be warm, do not go to Germany this winter, because they are
[00:59:05.620 --> 00:59:13.100]   literally looking at the, I want to be careful here, the significantly measurable price of
[00:59:13.100 --> 00:59:19.260]   possibility, like let's roll a die, and say, you know, one chance in six, one chance in
[00:59:19.260 --> 00:59:27.860]   four, you know, that there are going to be measurable deaths from freezing to death in
[00:59:27.860 --> 00:59:33.780]   Germany and the other areas, because that pipeline, they made themselves dependent on
[00:59:33.780 --> 00:59:39.340]   Russian natural gas, and Russia has taken their toys and gone home.
[00:59:39.340 --> 00:59:47.940]   In fact, the entire world, Halberd and the other oil supply companies, which are not
[00:59:47.940 --> 00:59:54.060]   just oil, but they're oil, natural gas, and all the petrochemical, everything.
[00:59:54.060 --> 00:59:57.540]   There was no law, no sanction that said they had to leave.
[00:59:57.540 --> 01:00:02.660]   They just picked up and left Russia in total.
[01:00:02.660 --> 01:00:09.340]   Shell, Halberd, and the other companies abandoned everything in Russia.
[01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:14.900]   They took their intellectual property, the people, the intellectual knowledge of how
[01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:24.100]   to run it, and they left, completely left everything behind, got on the planes, flew
[01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:30.420]   home, and they're not coming back.
[01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:38.620]   And the Russian oil lines are literally going to freeze in place in the permafrost zones,
[01:00:38.620 --> 01:00:43.620]   and the last time that happened was '92, when the Soviet Union fell, and they only
[01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:47.980]   now just got it going 30 years later.
[01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:52.700]   So I think that is helpful, to talk about the broader scale of natural gas.
[01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:56.500]   The reason I hadn't gone to Russia and the comments you issued there was I was trying
[01:00:56.500 --> 01:01:07.540]   to understand what you were seeing in November of 2021 that was causing you to be concerned,
[01:01:07.540 --> 01:01:13.540]   and this is because this was all before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, this was before the instability
[01:01:13.540 --> 01:01:15.840]   of the pipeline to Germany, these factors.
[01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:22.300]   And so there were some base factors that caused you to write your report in November that
[01:01:22.300 --> 01:01:24.780]   have been exacerbated now by these other things.
[01:01:24.780 --> 01:01:32.420]   And so to reaffirm or to emphasize what you said, one of the additional factors that makes
[01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:40.580]   natural gas for fertilizer production so difficult to come by is that natural gas is a primary
[01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:43.980]   mover in many, many other industries.
[01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:49.580]   It's a primary heating fuel, it's a primary fuel for creating energy, for creating electricity
[01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:55.060]   that's used in industrial processes, it's a primary fuel for fueling machinery making
[01:01:55.060 --> 01:01:57.740]   and virtually everything in the industrial cycle.
[01:01:57.740 --> 01:01:58.740]   >>TYLER: Chemicals?
[01:01:58.740 --> 01:01:59.740]   Chemicals?
[01:01:59.740 --> 01:02:00.740]   Huge.
[01:02:00.740 --> 01:02:03.740]   I mean, it is the simplest organic molecule.
[01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:06.020]   It's one carbon and four hydrogen.
[01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:08.940]   It is the simplest organic molecule there is.
[01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:14.280]   >>STEVE: So the pressure on natural gas doesn't only come from nitrogen.
[01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:18.140]   If we diverted more natural gas—excuse me, nitrogen fertilizer—if we diverted more
[01:02:18.140 --> 01:02:23.540]   natural gas production to creating more nitrogen fertilizer, that might allow us to produce
[01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:28.700]   sufficient quantities of food to minimize the global famine, but that will have massive
[01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:33.560]   effects on industry, on people's ability to keep their houses warm, on the home prices
[01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:35.780]   they pay for gas heating, et cetera.
[01:02:35.780 --> 01:02:42.960]   So the natural gas disruption, the increases in natural gas prices are disrupting everything
[01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:46.700]   and food is perhaps the most pressing and the other things are also very bad.
[01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:47.700]   Is that a fair assessment?
[01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:54.020]   >>TYLER: Well, that is only the tip of the iceberg because hungry, cold people change
[01:02:54.020 --> 01:03:00.420]   entire countries and worlds in days and weeks, not months and years.
[01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:04.060]   Now look around you and look at everything around you, okay?
[01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:10.100]   Look at your screen, your microphone, your wood table, your wood floor.
[01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:13.020]   Look at your plastic pencil.
[01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:20.740]   Look at—put on your Superman glasses, look through your walls, look at the copper wire,
[01:03:20.740 --> 01:03:29.020]   look at your asphalt shingles, look at your aluminum computer stand, your steel case on
[01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:37.340]   your computer, the magnesium on your Macintosh, whatever you got, it's nice and light, it's
[01:03:37.340 --> 01:03:39.340]   made from magnesium.
[01:03:39.340 --> 01:03:41.820]   Look at everything that is around you, okay?
[01:03:41.820 --> 01:03:47.980]   Except if you have a meteorite that fell from space, don't look at that.
[01:03:47.980 --> 01:03:57.900]   Everything around you in your entire world is either groaned or mined.
[01:03:57.900 --> 01:04:01.220]   I'm going to scare the living piss out of you here.
[01:04:01.220 --> 01:04:02.220]   You ready?
[01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:06.580]   If any of you want to press pause and go pee first, go do it because I'm about ready to
[01:04:06.580 --> 01:04:09.220]   make you pee your pants.
[01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:14.900]   Everything around you is either groaned or mined.
[01:04:14.900 --> 01:04:17.300]   Is there—am I missing something?
[01:04:17.300 --> 01:04:20.340]   Is there something else I'm missing, Josh?
[01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:23.900]   Josh: Nothing except the meteor, the incoming asteroid.
[01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:27.820]   Well, I guess we could still mine it when it hits the ground.
[01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:31.260]   David: No, that's called pick it up, okay?
[01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:32.260]   Josh: Right.
[01:04:32.260 --> 01:04:33.260]   David: That's called picking up.
[01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:36.340]   So everything around you is groaned or mined.
[01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:41.020]   What is the foundation of modern mining?
[01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:44.060]   What made the Panama Canal possible?
[01:04:44.060 --> 01:04:48.380]   What made the train tunnels through the mountains possible?
[01:04:48.380 --> 01:04:57.540]   When they mine coal and surface mining and copper and iron oxide, iron ore, and you see
[01:04:57.540 --> 01:05:03.980]   this big rippling going all the way through, you go, "Wow, that was huge."
[01:05:03.980 --> 01:05:05.700]   What are they using?
[01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:11.300]   What is the foundation of 98% of all mining in the world?
[01:05:11.300 --> 01:05:12.660]   Josh: Explosives.
[01:05:12.660 --> 01:05:14.220]   David: Explosives.
[01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:15.980]   What are explosives made from?
[01:05:15.980 --> 01:05:17.740]   Josh: I wish I knew.
[01:05:17.740 --> 01:05:19.540]   It would be fun to make them.
[01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:21.660]   That would be my high school chemistry class.
[01:05:21.660 --> 01:05:23.220]   I haven't done it.
[01:05:23.220 --> 01:05:25.540]   David: Okay.
[01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:27.500]   Explosives like that.
[01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:35.220]   We're talking about detonating wave explosives, which are called detonation, not a deflagration.
[01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:37.900]   So it's faster than the speed of sound.
[01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:41.860]   A slow one is ammonium nitrate and fuel oil, ANFO.
[01:05:41.860 --> 01:05:43.860]   They use that for moving earth.
[01:05:43.860 --> 01:05:46.660]   It heaves things beautifully.
[01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:50.420]   Blasting things apart, like buildings or rock faces.
[01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:55.820]   When they make the tunnels for stuff, like for salt, they like to use a higher speed
[01:05:55.820 --> 01:05:56.820]   explosive.
[01:05:56.820 --> 01:05:59.700]   You would know it as TNT, but they use different formulations.
[01:05:59.700 --> 01:06:07.660]   TNT is tri-nitrous toluene, ammonium nitrate, ANFO, ammonium nitrate, fuel oil.
[01:06:07.660 --> 01:06:09.820]   Are you seeing a common word in there?
[01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:10.820]   Josh: Ammonia.
[01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:12.820]   David: No, nitrate.
[01:06:12.820 --> 01:06:13.820]   Nitrogen.
[01:06:13.820 --> 01:06:14.820]   Okay?
[01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:21.740]   All modern explosives are made from nitric acid as the original precursor to make all
[01:06:21.740 --> 01:06:26.260]   the different variations of explosives that we use today.
[01:06:26.260 --> 01:06:31.940]   Where does nitric acid come from?
[01:06:31.940 --> 01:06:40.180]   It's made from the, careful of the pronunciation, the Oswald process.
[01:06:40.180 --> 01:06:41.180]   Another German.
[01:06:41.180 --> 01:06:43.620]   The Oswald process.
[01:06:43.620 --> 01:06:47.860]   And guess what the Oswald process uses for making nitric acid?
[01:06:47.860 --> 01:06:49.860]   Josh: Natural gas.
[01:06:49.860 --> 01:06:50.860]   David: Ammonia!
[01:06:50.860 --> 01:06:51.860]   Josh: Ammonia.
[01:06:51.860 --> 01:06:52.860]   There we go.
[01:06:52.860 --> 01:06:53.860]   Off the front of natural gas.
[01:06:53.860 --> 01:06:58.020]   David: And what makes, yeah, which is from natural gas.
[01:06:58.020 --> 01:07:01.380]   Josh: The Haber-Bosch process of natural gas to make ammonia.
[01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:02.380]   David: Haber.
[01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:03.380]   Josh: Haber.
[01:07:03.380 --> 01:07:04.380]   David: Haber.
[01:07:04.380 --> 01:07:05.380]   My name is Haber, not Haber.
[01:07:05.380 --> 01:07:06.380]   Where are you from?
[01:07:06.380 --> 01:07:07.380]   France?
[01:07:07.380 --> 01:07:10.500]   Yes, I have a sense of humor.
[01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:24.140]   So anyways, so the people, the regulations, the stupidity is messing with the fundamental
[01:07:24.140 --> 01:07:27.860]   thing that minds and grows everything.
[01:07:27.860 --> 01:07:30.500]   It was like, well, Steve, I'm not eating corn.
[01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:32.500]   Steve, I'm not eating soybeans.
[01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:36.180]   The pigs, the bacon you eat from the pigs is made from soybeans.
[01:07:36.180 --> 01:07:37.180]   Okay?
[01:07:37.180 --> 01:07:44.540]   Everything else, you know, everything, oh God, the things that's made from corn is huge.
[01:07:44.540 --> 01:07:49.740]   The world still runs off of a particular staple.
[01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:56.700]   America, the staple is mostly wheat, but also wheat and corn.
[01:07:56.700 --> 01:08:02.820]   Central America, a lot of corn, you know, maize is a staple.
[01:08:02.820 --> 01:08:11.820]   Russia and Eastern European wheat, China, rice, Asia, rice.
[01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:16.500]   Most of the world, the Irish of the days of old, potatoes.
[01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:22.100]   Again, most of the world lives off a starch product and anything that you're eating that's
[01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:29.020]   a protein product like meat is fed a starch product of one type or another for its food
[01:08:29.020 --> 01:08:30.020]   source.
[01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:35.220]   It's literally the thing that makes everything that makes everything that makes everything
[01:08:35.220 --> 01:08:40.380]   that we eat that we just made into something that we ate.
[01:08:40.380 --> 01:08:47.140]   It's really complex, but it's like, Josh, there's this guy, his name is, pick a scary
[01:08:47.140 --> 01:08:48.140]   name Josh.
[01:08:48.140 --> 01:08:53.140]   You can't do that to me.
[01:08:53.140 --> 01:08:57.780]   Carlos, Josh, Carlos is going to kill you.
[01:08:57.780 --> 01:08:58.780]   Okay.
[01:08:58.780 --> 01:09:04.060]   Josh, Carlos is in your town, in your country.
[01:09:04.060 --> 01:09:05.060]   Okay.
[01:09:05.060 --> 01:09:07.980]   Josh, Carlos was seen in your town.
[01:09:07.980 --> 01:09:09.900]   He wants to kill you.
[01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:11.020]   Okay.
[01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:16.900]   So when I wrote the report about called swimming out to sea, because you know what swimming
[01:09:16.900 --> 01:09:18.820]   out sea reference is.
[01:09:18.820 --> 01:09:22.980]   People would commit suicide by swimming out to sea so they couldn't change their mind.
[01:09:22.980 --> 01:09:28.380]   So let's say you could swim for six, eight hours and you're swimming.
[01:09:28.380 --> 01:09:33.180]   And, and you're six hours out and you, and you say, Oh, I don't want to die.
[01:09:33.180 --> 01:09:34.500]   I want to swim back to shore.
[01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:38.820]   Well, you don't have enough energy to swim six hours back.
[01:09:38.820 --> 01:09:41.540]   You got enough energy to swim two hours back.
[01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:43.780]   So you drown and you die.
[01:09:43.780 --> 01:09:49.420]   So it's, it's, it's, it's a metaphor for an irreversible decision.
[01:09:49.420 --> 01:09:50.420]   Okay.
[01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:52.260]   I decided to swim out to sea.
[01:09:52.260 --> 01:09:53.260]   I'm committing suicide.
[01:09:53.260 --> 01:10:00.140]   So that's why the report was called swimming out to sea and the potential for first world
[01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:02.860]   famine.
[01:10:02.860 --> 01:10:11.100]   So when I wrote that report in November of 2021, because I saw what was beginning to
[01:10:11.100 --> 01:10:18.900]   happen with natural gas was like me writing the report when Carlos was standing behind
[01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:25.100]   you and had his hands around his neck, but he wasn't touching your neck yet.
[01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:27.180]   Right.
[01:10:27.180 --> 01:10:30.860]   That's what I saw.
[01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:31.860]   Okay.
[01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:33.260]   Carlos wasn't in the country.
[01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:35.820]   Carlos wasn't in the same city.
[01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:41.860]   Carlos was standing behind you with his hands around his neck, but he hadn't started squeezing
[01:10:41.860 --> 01:10:45.420]   yet and you didn't know Carlos was there.
[01:10:45.420 --> 01:10:48.220]   That is what made me write that report.
[01:10:48.220 --> 01:10:53.740]   So now bringing it forward, the major things that have happened, number one, the trends
[01:10:53.740 --> 01:10:57.140]   that you saw then have continued.
[01:10:57.140 --> 01:11:05.260]   And then we have factors like Russia invading Ukraine and factors like Russia using its
[01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:10.500]   current natural gas supplies as political leverage over Europe and basically...
[01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:11.500]   No, no, no, a weapon.
[01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:12.500]   Hold on.
[01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:13.500]   Okay.
[01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:14.500]   As a weapon, sure.
[01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:19.180]   As a weapon in Europe, like we talked about with Germany, but worse than that, there are
[01:11:19.180 --> 01:11:28.700]   major reasons to believe that Russia, now due to the complete absence of all the international
[01:11:28.700 --> 01:11:33.380]   workers, all the international scientists, all the international... their ability to
[01:11:33.380 --> 01:11:40.700]   get parts, et cetera, that very possibly significant amounts or even all of their energy production
[01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:44.340]   could go offline due to lack of human intellectual capital.
[01:11:44.340 --> 01:11:52.060]   So that you take a huge natural producer and you take them offline and now you have complete
[01:11:52.060 --> 01:11:53.060]   disaster.
[01:11:53.060 --> 01:12:00.540]   Let's use the words of Peter Zion, "You melon scoop out Russia," which is like five million
[01:12:00.540 --> 01:12:04.260]   barrels of oil alone per day out of the market.
[01:12:04.260 --> 01:12:05.260]   Right.
[01:12:05.260 --> 01:12:07.180]   So you melon scoop Russia out.
[01:12:07.180 --> 01:12:09.500]   I want to find out where he lives.
[01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:12.300]   I'm going to send him like a box of melon scoops.
[01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:20.620]   And yeah, you melon scoop Russia out and all of a sudden there is a hole there.
[01:12:20.620 --> 01:12:26.940]   And the interesting thing is there's one other huge advantage that about doubled or quadrupled
[01:12:26.940 --> 01:12:28.660]   our food production.
[01:12:28.660 --> 01:12:34.460]   Before that, Idiot wrote the book about the world population going out of control, which
[01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:42.900]   was part of the impetus between Mao doing the one child policy, which basically was
[01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:47.660]   the death knell for China.
[01:12:47.660 --> 01:12:56.220]   This gentleman by the name of Norman Borlaug, Borlang, I get the pronunciation of his...
[01:12:56.220 --> 01:12:59.220]   Oh, they wrote it in a way that I can't read it.
[01:12:59.220 --> 01:13:02.920]   Come on, say it.
[01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:05.140]   Pronunciation is a key for...
[01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:15.060]   Anyways, he discovered, invented, genetically modified through a variety of methods, either
[01:13:15.060 --> 01:13:23.220]   probably the traditional methods that we've been doing GMO for thousands of years.
[01:13:23.220 --> 01:13:34.120]   He made a high yield disease resistant variety of wheat and this hit the world market and
[01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:41.280]   started doubling wheat production initially in Pakistan and India a year before that moron
[01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:45.960]   put his book out that the world was going to have too many people and too little food.
[01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:51.660]   In fact, if you look at the movie Soylent Green with Charleston Heston, they had everything
[01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:52.660]   wrong in there.
[01:13:52.660 --> 01:13:59.840]   I mean, Soylent Green takes place in 2022 and everything they did was on the fallacy
[01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:04.120]   of what we call linear no threshold theory.
[01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:09.080]   Whereas if one person jumps off a thousand foot cliff, they're going to die.
[01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:15.280]   If a thousand people jump off a one foot curb, one person will die, which is a fallacy.
[01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:22.080]   They extrapolated linear into the future without looking for technology and innovation disruptions
[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:28.760]   and everything that changed from 1972 when the movie was made to 2022.
[01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:34.680]   And everything in the entire movie was absolutely fundamentally wrong.
[01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:43.000]   And this guy that wrote this book, he didn't anticipate a technology disruptor coming along
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:48.780]   like the change in the wheat that doubled production.
[01:14:48.780 --> 01:14:53.800]   Now you take a doubling of wheat production, you add it to a quadrupling with fertilizer,
[01:14:53.800 --> 01:15:01.120]   you're now making in 1970 eight times the wheat you did in 1902 in the same space.
[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:03.120]   I mean, that's huge.
[01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:05.040]   It is huge.
[01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:10.360]   And that's why I, that's specifically what's always in the back of my mind when talking
[01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:15.320]   about this, when talking about global famine this year, next year, the following year is
[01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:21.640]   humans are adaptable, humans are smart, and we can develop new technologies, I hope, and
[01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:27.700]   new processes, new something that can help to mitigate the worst effects.
[01:15:27.700 --> 01:15:34.120]   And when the incentives are there, if people are dying for lack of food, all government
[01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:38.080]   regulations on natural gas production will disappear, either because the people will
[01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:45.280]   simply ignore them out of moral duty or because the governments will change them based upon
[01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:47.320]   their population not dying.
[01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:50.640]   And so I'm hopeful that it's not a worst case scenario.
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:55.640]   I'm sorry, there's a Kardashian's marathon on and they're all watching it and they don't
[01:15:55.640 --> 01:15:57.820]   give a crap.
[01:15:57.820 --> 01:16:00.720]   They think there's too many people anyways.
[01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:01.960]   You are too cynical.
[01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:05.120]   I'm going to be the optimist, you can be the cynic, and hopefully it's somewhere between
[01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:06.120]   us.
[01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:10.720]   So let's pivot now, because we've talked about food production, and I want to talk a little
[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:14.280]   bit about deglobalization.
[01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:18.640]   I've recently finished the book that we referenced, and you and I have talked a little bit about
[01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:23.640]   it, Peter Zahan's The End of the World as We Know It is Just the Beginning.
[01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:29.120]   I was planning to do a series of podcasts about it, because I believe it reflects an
[01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:35.200]   important perspective that makes a lot of sense of the world that we're living in and
[01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:37.280]   some of the trends that we're living in.
[01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:41.640]   It's very hard for me to talk about, because my entire lifetime everything has always gotten
[01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:46.960]   better, and yet I've always been aware of the fact that the idea that everything always
[01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:49.000]   gets better is not a true fact of life.
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.960]   It doesn't reflect the reality of human history.
[01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:59.360]   So he goes through and he argues about some of the trends, but at its core is a trend
[01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:01.600]   of deglobalization.
[01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:09.180]   If you were going to encapsulate or give a broad overview of Zahan's arguments for deglobalization,
[01:17:09.180 --> 01:17:11.980]   how would you approach that?
[01:17:11.980 --> 01:17:20.000]   All of the ships and planes either stopped or got very expensive.
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:24.640]   And then the knock-on effects of that basically completely disrupt the world that we live
[01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:25.640]   in.
[01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:27.440]   Yeah, you got this.
[01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:32.920]   I mean, imagine, okay, you got a road between you and the grocery store, okay, and you got
[01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:37.000]   one road that you drive to the grocery store, okay.
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:42.520]   You got one road that you drive, it's a different road, to the hardware store, okay.
[01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:46.240]   And you got another road that you drive to the gas station.
[01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:50.880]   Well, imagine the road to the grocery store is gone.
[01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:56.760]   It's like mudslide, 80 feet high, gone, okay.
[01:17:56.760 --> 01:18:05.840]   The road to the Home Depot is potted and horrible, and you got to go through it five miles an
[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:11.560]   hour, and it shakes the hell out of your pickup truck, and you can't stack anything up, and
[01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:13.800]   you're breaking your suspension.
[01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:17.640]   And the road to the gas station is no longer paved, it's a dirt road.
[01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:23.200]   In fact, it's two-track, and one car has to pull over to let another car pass and everything
[01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:25.360]   else like that.
[01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:37.160]   That is basically what deglobalization is to the world, is the marine shipping traffic
[01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:49.640]   becoming very labor short, expensive due to fuel, and the whole demand, everything, the
[01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:51.000]   just-in-time.
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.960]   People blame just-in-time inventory.
[01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:57.680]   Just-in-time is a miracle of modern manufacturing.
[01:18:57.680 --> 01:19:02.720]   And that whole model has now like broken, because the ship could sail from China, show
[01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:09.400]   up to the day, get offloaded, be on a truck, and going to the production facility and arrive
[01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:15.840]   within eight hours of when it was supposed to, plus or minus eight hours or a day.
[01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:20.080]   That is all now turned upside down.
[01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:28.440]   China is going through massive problems, not only with the pandemic that's going on, their
[01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:37.240]   inability to handle the pandemic, the availability of energy that is driving their infrastructure.
[01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:41.560]   I mean, you know what's going on in China with the entire banking system and everything
[01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:42.560]   else right now.
[01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:46.840]   It's just an absolute nightmare.
[01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:50.200]   And they're basically becoming non-functional.
[01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:57.040]   And you can take this all the way back to colonial America.
[01:19:57.040 --> 01:19:59.900]   We were the raw materials.
[01:19:59.900 --> 01:20:08.720]   We chopped down the lumber and grew the tobacco and everything, and the sugar, and it was
[01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:10.560]   shipped back to England, right?
[01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:16.120]   We were the manufacturing hub for, we were the raw material source for England.
[01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:20.520]   It went back to England and got manufactured.
[01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:25.480]   While China was like that for us, and you can repeat this throughout history going back
[01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:29.640]   2000 years with the Silk Road and everything.
[01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:36.960]   While that entire line of ants, okay, you just put a leaf there and the ants are going,
[01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:38.120]   I don't know which way to go.
[01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:39.720]   I don't know which way to go.
[01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:41.320]   There's something blocking my path.
[01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:46.480]   I can't follow the chemical scent trail anymore.
[01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:49.960]   And in a nutshell, it's a lot more complex than that.
[01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:53.480]   And you really got to go into Zion's book to get it.
[01:20:53.480 --> 01:21:03.600]   But that is, for those of you listening, that is a very simplification of deglobalization.
[01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:08.440]   Someone dropped a leaf in front of the trail of ants and they don't know what to do.
[01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:13.880]   So if I were to summarize the basic argument of deglobalization, and I actually finally
[01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:18.880]   understood something that it was missing, my critique of that book, which I'll probably
[01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:27.760]   do in a standalone chapter, or sorry, a standalone podcast, is that there's this book that is
[01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:31.780]   very persuasive and has powerful arguments in it.
[01:21:31.780 --> 01:21:36.040]   But what I don't understand is the why.
[01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:39.800]   And that's partly, I think he probably wrote about in his previous books, which I haven't
[01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:41.480]   read yet myself.
[01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:48.040]   And so, but he made a comment in the back fourth of the book that helped me to finally
[01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:49.040]   understand.
[01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:53.680]   So if I were to articulate his argument for deglobalization, the United States is pulling
[01:21:53.680 --> 01:22:02.160]   back over the last 15 to 20 years, the United States has been systematically pulling back
[01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:09.640]   from acting as the police officer of the world, acting as the global security enforcer of
[01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:10.640]   the world.
[01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:11.640]   And according to—
[01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:14.400]   More like the oceans and the air.
[01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:15.400]   Good.
[01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:16.400]   Oceans and the air.
[01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:17.400]   Fair correction.
[01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:18.400]   Continue.
[01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:26.200]   So, and this is for a variety of reasons that I don't fully understand, but the United
[01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:29.400]   States is pulling back as enforcer of world peace.
[01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:34.760]   And basically, this is kind of the closing out of an agreement that the United States
[01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:37.300]   made after World War II.
[01:22:37.300 --> 01:22:42.880]   As the victor of World War II, the victor able to basically dictate global policy, the
[01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:46.680]   United States, instead of occupying foreign countries, instead of saying, "We're going
[01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:49.640]   to take you over and make you part of our nation, or we're going to colonize you,"
[01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:56.560]   the United States said, "We're going to establish a new system that we will see to
[01:22:56.560 --> 01:22:57.560]   the world's security.
[01:22:57.560 --> 01:23:02.240]   We'll make sure that the oceans are available for anybody who wants to use them, to use
[01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:07.200]   them free of concerns of attack, of piracy, et cetera, and we will see to the security
[01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:11.360]   of the world's oceans and the world's airspace."
[01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:18.720]   And as long as you support us and are on our side against the Soviet Union.
[01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:19.720]   So after—
[01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:25.520]   As long as you line up in front of us and alongside of us against the Soviets.
[01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:26.520]   Fair.
[01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:32.440]   Not just stand up, but I mean, link arms with us against the Soviets.
[01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:34.840]   And the Chinese said, "Yes."
[01:23:34.840 --> 01:23:35.840]   Right.
[01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:41.640]   And so the United States is basically responsible for creating the conditions that allowed the
[01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:47.940]   mass industrialization of China and the economic miracle that was that mass industrialization,
[01:23:47.940 --> 01:23:52.600]   as well as what has happened on a global basis, and has created the truly incredible world
[01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:57.440]   that we live in of these magical globalized systems.
[01:23:57.440 --> 01:24:03.400]   Now, as I understand the argument, since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States
[01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:09.140]   has basically systematically pulled back and has become more entrenched in internal affairs
[01:24:09.140 --> 01:24:11.640]   rather than external affairs.
[01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:13.640]   And it's taken 30 years.
[01:24:13.640 --> 01:24:14.640]   Right.
[01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:16.800]   Keep in mind, it's taken 30 years.
[01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:17.800]   Right.
[01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:22.160]   And as I understand it, Zeyhan's argument is that this trend will continue for a variety
[01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:23.160]   of reasons.
[01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:24.160]   It's a bipartisan trend.
[01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:26.080]   Both Republicans and Democrats have done it.
[01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:28.880]   And it's a trend that reflects the wishes of the American people.
[01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:30.760]   American people are tired of foreign wars.
[01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:34.400]   They don't really understand the previous system, et cetera.
[01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:41.240]   And as the United States pulls back from ensuring the world's order and security, then it's
[01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:46.440]   probable that other players around the world will start to get involved.
[01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:51.640]   And you'll have everything from localized piracy to nation state piracy to other nation
[01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:55.040]   states seeking to expand their control.
[01:24:55.040 --> 01:25:01.540]   And the most dangerous effect of this is that global shipping is exceedingly vulnerable
[01:25:01.540 --> 01:25:03.320]   to violence.
[01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:12.520]   And one freighter, one oil tanker is vulnerable to any nation state or any even just private
[01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:18.200]   contractor who can accumulate some very basic weapons to threaten that.
[01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:24.440]   And if that happens, the global trade of shipping could potentially implode for everything from
[01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:31.640]   the real risk of having your ship sunk to a destruction of the insurance markets, massive
[01:25:31.640 --> 01:25:35.000]   increases in cost just across the board.
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.080]   Go back to the insurance markets.
[01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:39.840]   That's the one that is going to hit hardest the quickest.
[01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:40.840]   Right.
[01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:41.840]   The insurance.
[01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:47.920]   You can't even really go into the Black Sea right now because you can't get insurance
[01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:51.000]   for it because it's mined in certain areas.
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:52.000]   Right.
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:58.920]   And so we see, so if that continues, then basically the entire, all of the lifestyle
[01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:05.120]   that we've become accustomed to because of globalization falls apart on a differing level
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:07.440]   in many, many regions.
[01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:12.440]   And at its core, one of the things that I think I finally understood, which was really
[01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:20.240]   remarkable to me, was, and by the way, this has been a big challenge to me because politically
[01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:26.560]   speaking I have been exceedingly anti-intervention, politically speaking.
[01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:30.200]   I haven't wanted the United States to intervene in the world.
[01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:34.160]   I've been a Ron Paul acolyte since I was in my teens, have closed down all the military
[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:38.120]   bases around the world, end the standing army, et cetera.
[01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:42.840]   And perhaps that, you know, it seems to reflect moral and ethical values that make sense to
[01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:51.200]   me, but I struggled to understand the perspective of those who made the opposite point.
[01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:55.720]   But Zion made this statement that I read, and first of all, he said that globalization
[01:26:55.720 --> 01:26:58.860]   was invented to isolate the Soviets.
[01:26:58.860 --> 01:27:02.080]   That was the basic goal, and that worked.
[01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:10.040]   And then he said this, I'm quoting from his chapter called The Map of the Future, and
[01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:14.400]   he's talking about NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, and he makes this strong
[01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:19.840]   argument as to why North America is going to be the best performing region of the world
[01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:22.280]   for the foreseeable future.
[01:27:22.280 --> 01:27:26.240]   And he says this, "When it comes to the fate of the NAFTA system, most indicators look
[01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:28.240]   wildly positive.
[01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:30.800]   Let's begin with base structure.
[01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:38.160]   Part of why American manufacturers feel cheated by globalization is because that was the plan.
[01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:42.960]   The core precept of the order," and by order he means the American order, the American
[01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:50.080]   commitment to secure the world, right, world peace, "The core precept of the order is that
[01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:56.600]   the United States would sacrifice economic dynamism in order to achieve security control.
[01:27:56.600 --> 01:28:00.320]   The American market was supposed to be sacrificed.
[01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:03.920]   The American worker was supposed to be sacrificed.
[01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:06.680]   American companies were supposed to be sacrificed.
[01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:11.200]   Thus, anything that the United States still manufactures is a product set for which the
[01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:15.440]   American market, worker, and corporate structure are hyper-competitive.
[01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:20.920]   Furthermore, the deliberate sacrifice means that most American manufactured products are
[01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:25.360]   not for export, but instead for consumption within North America."
[01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:29.080]   And he goes on and talks about some examples of comparing American firms versus Chinese
[01:28:29.080 --> 01:28:36.400]   firms, but at its core, this has helped me to understand why this deglobalized future
[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:42.440]   is probable, because Americans are angry about offshoring, right?
[01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:45.000]   Americans are pissed off about their jobs going to China.
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:46.520]   They're angry about it.
[01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:49.760]   Look at the political waves that happened in 2016.
[01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:54.440]   It's a lot more insidious than that.
[01:28:54.440 --> 01:29:00.760]   I mean, what you're saying is like a surface explanation, but the real explanation has
[01:29:00.760 --> 01:29:06.880]   to do with the age demographics of the countries that were providing those services to us.
[01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:08.080]   Right, right.
[01:29:08.080 --> 01:29:11.760]   So I totally agree, and that's a huge other conversation of the population.
[01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:17.360]   But I guess what I'm focusing on is I think I understand now, because this helps me to
[01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:23.840]   make sense of even the politics of the United States that I know, and that I understand
[01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:30.240]   the feeling of the people, that Americans at this point in time are pretty much set
[01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:33.240]   on, "Yeah, we don't want to be involved with that."
[01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:38.080]   And the people who are making the arguments for American domination of the world don't
[01:29:38.080 --> 01:29:41.600]   seem to be very effective in convincing others of why that's the case.
[01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:46.400]   So maybe a deglobalized world would have such difficult effects that all of a sudden the
[01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:50.120]   American electorate would swing and go back the other direction and say, "No, let's
[01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:51.120]   take it back over."
[01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:58.480]   But, and I, Zaihan didn't address that in this book, but it is a rather difficult thing
[01:29:58.480 --> 01:30:02.960]   to recognize on how vulnerable the global system is.
[01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:05.000]   You're not going to switch it back either.
[01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:06.000]   It is deglobalization.
[01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:09.240]   It's already deglobalized.
[01:30:09.240 --> 01:30:17.280]   And even if you have had this wonderful revelation and you are correct about what you so wonderfully
[01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:22.560]   illustrated verbally for everyone, there's not a damn thing you can do about it.
[01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:24.920]   You cannot throw a switch and get it back.
[01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:27.480]   It is gone.
[01:30:27.480 --> 01:30:31.600]   It's like you just turned 40.
[01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:33.480]   You can't get your 20s back.
[01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:36.600]   They're a decade in the past.
[01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:43.200]   Everything that you just mentioned took decades to build.
[01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:48.800]   And a whole different set of generations and attitudes and everything else.
[01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:53.520]   And you just are not going to get that back.
[01:30:53.520 --> 01:31:00.800]   And what this means is, is like a friend of mine said, when the pandemic started, he goes,
[01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:05.680]   this is a time when fortunes are made and lost.
[01:31:05.680 --> 01:31:15.520]   And what we're talking about now with deglobalization and Josh Sheets of radical personal finance,
[01:31:15.520 --> 01:31:19.440]   there are radical finance stuff for us to talk about.
[01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:30.720]   Because now of a time of everyone bringing it home is going to be a time of huge financial
[01:31:30.720 --> 01:31:39.200]   gain ability, especially in manufacturing, especially in the automation of manufacturing,
[01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:43.360]   especially and this goes all the way down to computer coding.
[01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:46.000]   But you were right.
[01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:50.720]   We were sacrificed as not the workers of the world.
[01:31:50.720 --> 01:31:52.840]   And so what did we become?
[01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:58.720]   We became the people who sent man to the moon and back a dozen times with the equivalent
[01:31:58.720 --> 01:32:04.800]   of slide rule calculations, not even computers.
[01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:06.720]   We did the 747.
[01:32:06.720 --> 01:32:09.200]   We did all the other stuff that we did.
[01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:16.160]   We invented the transistor, the silicon chip, the integrated circuit, everything else.
[01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:20.400]   We didn't become the workers of the world.
[01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:22.880]   We let other places do that.
[01:32:22.880 --> 01:32:27.120]   We became the intellectual property for the world.
[01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:34.720]   I mean, much of what the silicon foundries in Taiwan run off of is American intellectual
[01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:39.040]   property still held in the United States of America.
[01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:48.400]   When Shell and Halliburton and some of the other companies that are as big as those,
[01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:55.840]   there's two more, left Russia, they did not only took their workers, but those workers
[01:32:55.840 --> 01:33:03.680]   and the intellectual property of exactly which way does that drill bit go on to the
[01:33:03.680 --> 01:33:04.680]   drilling rig?
[01:33:04.680 --> 01:33:05.680]   Do you turn it left?
[01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:06.680]   Do you turn it right?
[01:33:06.680 --> 01:33:12.800]   You know, stuff as simple as that, the intellectual property got up and left.
[01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:19.120]   I mean, same thing when Venezuela had the full collapse of their system and the communism,
[01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:29.040]   the loss of power and rapid inflation, they couldn't feed people, massive starvation there.
[01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:38.040]   Everyone who could, including by foot, left Venezuela for Colombia, for Peru, for Mexico,
[01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:39.440]   for Brazil.
[01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:43.600]   The brain drain out of Venezuela was intensive.
[01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:46.960]   Yeah, a hundred percent.
[01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:48.520]   And guess what we got here?
[01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:50.920]   We got a lot of brain here.
[01:33:50.920 --> 01:33:53.480]   Right, right.
[01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:54.800]   Yeah.
[01:33:54.800 --> 01:34:05.960]   So, I guess if I were to try to connect these themes, we're living in a time where at its
[01:34:05.960 --> 01:34:11.640]   core the basic building blocks, right?
[01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:14.240]   You talked about mining, but we skipped over it very quickly.
[01:34:14.240 --> 01:34:21.000]   If explosives are much more expensive or much more difficult to come by and there aren't
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:26.560]   enough of them due to the shortages of the base materials, then that can substantially
[01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:29.520]   hamper mining and then you have less production from the mines.
[01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:33.120]   And then there's a knock-on effect of not being able to get the basic materials that
[01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:36.240]   you need out of the earth all around the world.
[01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:40.440]   And so we're living in, I guess, a more day-to-day experience.
[01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:48.240]   Basically every industry I talk to in the United States is right now, nothing is flowing,
[01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:51.080]   nothing is working like it's supposed to.
[01:34:51.080 --> 01:34:53.200]   And so they're constantly having to come up with workarounds.
[01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:57.920]   You have everything from car manufacturers, shipping cars where they have the buttons
[01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:02.960]   placed but because they can't get the chips, the function of the buttons doesn't work.
[01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:08.720]   I have a family member who's a boat dealer and he's got 30 outboard engines on order
[01:35:08.720 --> 01:35:12.840]   from his outboard engine supplier but he can't get them.
[01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:16.840]   They've been on order for a year and a half and so he's constantly taking this part apart
[01:35:16.840 --> 01:35:20.080]   and taking that one apart and putting on the lower unit from this one to make it work in
[01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:22.280]   this application, etc.
[01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:27.280]   And everything down to an electrician not being able to get enough plastic electrical
[01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:32.520]   boxes to put for the switch covers and every industry is disrupted.
[01:35:32.520 --> 01:35:37.760]   So the basic expectation that so many of us have had is that this is a disruption due
[01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:43.840]   to COVID, due to the government shutting down businesses, due to China manufacturing collapsing,
[01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:46.720]   due to weird shipping anomalies and whatnot.
[01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:54.200]   But the argument of Zaihan and other people would be this is COVID simply accelerated
[01:35:54.200 --> 01:36:00.080]   the already existing problems and the world of COVID and of toilet paper shortages was
[01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:05.040]   simply a harbinger of the world that we can expect to live in for the coming years and
[01:36:05.040 --> 01:36:12.160]   that these trends are not trends that can be fixed immediately in the same way that
[01:36:12.160 --> 01:36:18.840]   the food inflation is not exclusive, excuse me, the price inflation in the cost of food
[01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:24.140]   that we can see very visibly each week when we go grocery shopping.
[01:36:24.140 --> 01:36:27.680]   This is not exclusively a financial phenomenon.
[01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:32.440]   It may have some financial effects from the growth of the money supply, etc.
[01:36:32.440 --> 01:36:38.600]   But at its core, it reflects back, it's the harbinger of these fundamental issues that
[01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:42.720]   you're talking about going all the way back to the amount of natural gas in production,
[01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:46.480]   the flows of natural gas around the world, the availability of natural gas to be used
[01:36:46.480 --> 01:36:50.480]   for fertilizer and all of the knock-on effects.
[01:36:50.480 --> 01:36:53.800]   And that's a very sobering thing to think about, especially for someone like me, right?
[01:36:53.800 --> 01:37:00.120]   I don't know what year you were born, but I was born in the mid-80s, which means that
[01:37:00.120 --> 01:37:07.400]   for me, Stephen, the most difficult statement that I read in Ziohan's book, I'm going
[01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:12.600]   to pull it up here and read it to you, because it was for me just the most sobering thing
[01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:27.960]   because he said this, "The Halcyon days of 1980 to 2000," so let me back up, he
[01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:32.280]   was talking about birth rates and it's in a chapter called "History Speeds Up"
[01:37:32.280 --> 01:37:36.160]   and he says this, "But there was nothing about it that was normal.
[01:37:36.160 --> 01:37:40.000]   Globalization was always dependent upon the Americans' commitment to the global order,
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:46.680]   and that order hasn't served American strategic interests since the Berlin Wall fell in 1989.
[01:37:46.680 --> 01:37:51.200]   Without the Americans riding herd on everyone, it is only a matter of time before something
[01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:56.680]   in East Asia or the Middle East or the Russian periphery, like, I don't know, say a war,
[01:37:56.680 --> 01:38:01.280]   breaks the global system beyond repair, assuming that the Americans don't do it themselves.
[01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:05.680]   But even if the Americans choose to continue holding up the world's collective civilizational
[01:38:05.680 --> 01:38:10.160]   ceiling, there was nothing about the heyday of globalization that is sustainable.
[01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:14.100]   The Halcyon days of 1980 to 2015 are over.
[01:38:14.100 --> 01:38:18.360]   The collapse in birth rates that began across the developed world in the 1960s and across
[01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:23.520]   the developing world in the 1990s now has decades of steam behind it.
[01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:27.520]   The pipe bomb in the ointment is that what proved true for accelerated industrialization
[01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:30.860]   proved equally true for accelerated demographics.
[01:38:30.860 --> 01:38:34.680]   In 1700, the average British woman bore 4.6 children.
[01:38:34.680 --> 01:38:39.000]   That's almost identical to that of the average German woman in 1800 or the average Italian
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:44.520]   woman in 1900 or the average Korean woman in 1960 or the average Chinese woman in the
[01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:46.640]   early 1970s.
[01:38:46.640 --> 01:38:51.960]   Now in all these countries, the new average is below 1.8 and in many cases well below.
[01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:57.280]   This is a position the average Bangladeshi woman will likely find herself in by 2030.
[01:38:57.280 --> 01:39:00.400]   Now comes the other side of the hill, and it goes on and talks about.
[01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:07.080]   But the idea that, and I'll read this final paragraph, "By most measures, most notably
[01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:11.280]   in education, wealth, and health, globalization has been great, but it was never going to
[01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:12.280]   last.
[01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:16.520]   What you and your parents, and in some cases grandparents, assumed as the normal, good,
[01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:21.520]   and right way of living, that is, the past seven decades or so, is a historic anomaly
[01:39:21.520 --> 01:39:25.440]   for the human condition, both in strategic and demographic terms.
[01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:32.040]   The period of 1980 to 2015 in particular has simply been a unique, isolated, blessed moment
[01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:36.280]   in time, a moment that has ended, a moment that will certainly not come again in our
[01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:37.600]   lifetimes."
[01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:40.480]   And that isn't even the bad news.
[01:39:40.480 --> 01:39:46.080]   And for me, that's just, it's an incredibly difficult thing to understand or to absorb,
[01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:52.480]   even emotionally, because as a millennial, my entire lifespan has been lived in this
[01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:54.280]   globalized world.
[01:39:54.280 --> 01:40:01.760]   As a financial planner, virtually all of the techniques of my business have been developed
[01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:04.840]   and proven during this period of time.
[01:40:04.840 --> 01:40:09.520]   Yes, we hearken back a little bit to the history of the stock market since the early 1900s,
[01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:15.680]   and we put quotes since the Great Depression, and we look at that.
[01:40:15.680 --> 01:40:21.600]   But basically, the entire industry in which I've spent my entire career is built upon
[01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:22.900]   this period.
[01:40:22.900 --> 01:40:27.840]   And yet, we see the cracks in that period, and while I hope that Zaihin is wrong, because
[01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:35.080]   I like living in the globalized world, it requires me to fundamentally try to figure
[01:40:35.080 --> 01:40:39.720]   out where we go from here, and then how to find the opportunities in it.
[01:40:39.720 --> 01:40:45.320]   And by philosophy, I believe that times of great transition are the times of opportunity.
[01:40:45.320 --> 01:40:49.780]   It's been a thought that I've had, years ago I had a friend on Palm Beach who had made
[01:40:49.780 --> 01:40:52.960]   his fortune in the oil business, and he gave me his autobiography.
[01:40:52.960 --> 01:40:58.480]   And it was like he was this Texas wildcatter driving around Texas doing deals and wrapping
[01:40:58.480 --> 01:40:59.480]   things up.
[01:40:59.480 --> 01:41:02.240]   And I always loved his story, and I always thought, "Poor little old me, why can't I
[01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:06.800]   live in a world like that, where I can go out and live an adventure and make a fortune
[01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:08.080]   in a changing market?"
[01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:11.400]   Well, perhaps there'll be one coming in the next 10 years.
[01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:17.280]   But it is hard, as a young guy, it's hard for me to understand and to even figure out
[01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:23.240]   how to deal with the changing world, and then to sort through and say what things are true
[01:41:23.240 --> 01:41:26.560]   and what things are not, what things in the investment markets are true, what things are
[01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:28.600]   not, how does this apply?
[01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:32.400]   It's a pretty sobering thinking process for me.
[01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:42.400]   >>Adam: Zion's statement that the next five years will be a lot harder and rougher and
[01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:50.200]   a time of more transition than your grandparents went through in World War II from 1940 to
[01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:51.240]   1946.
[01:41:51.240 --> 01:41:57.120]   That is a statement that hardly any, I mean, me understanding World War II history exceptionally
[01:41:57.120 --> 01:41:58.120]   well.
[01:41:58.120 --> 01:42:01.880]   I understand it, but everyone else is going, "Huh?
[01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:02.960]   What?"
[01:42:02.960 --> 01:42:03.960]   They don't get it.
[01:42:03.960 --> 01:42:11.960]   And one of the things I said to you, probably, it was probably December of the year when
[01:42:11.960 --> 01:42:18.040]   I saw the stuff coming, and I was trying to get you to understand what the potential for
[01:42:18.040 --> 01:42:24.280]   famine was, was that I said, "Josh, understand this."
[01:42:24.280 --> 01:42:32.680]   I go, "Of the four children that you have, there is the possibility that your children
[01:42:32.680 --> 01:42:34.640]   can lose."
[01:42:34.640 --> 01:42:38.440]   I said, "The potential exists.
[01:42:38.440 --> 01:42:40.960]   The possibility is there.
[01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:46.520]   You might be rolling two or three dice for that possibility to come up, but nevertheless,
[01:42:46.520 --> 01:42:54.680]   it is a measurable possibility that you don't like, that your children could lose one of
[01:42:54.680 --> 01:42:59.480]   their parents and one or two of their siblings.
[01:42:59.480 --> 01:43:02.640]   That is a distinct possibility."
[01:43:02.640 --> 01:43:13.400]   I think it was then that you knew the seriousness of what I was trying to foreshadow nine months
[01:43:13.400 --> 01:43:16.480]   ago.
[01:43:16.480 --> 01:43:19.320]   No question.
[01:43:19.320 --> 01:43:24.840]   When you think about it, as we've talked since then, we spent a lot of time at the
[01:43:24.840 --> 01:43:27.840]   beginning of this podcast talking about the fundamental layers.
[01:43:27.840 --> 01:43:32.680]   But basically, the news every few months gets worse and worse.
[01:43:32.680 --> 01:43:39.760]   You go from massive regulations on price increases to natural gas, to basically the entire supply
[01:43:39.760 --> 01:43:44.480]   of natural gas from Russia being cut off from Europe for a time, to the potential of the
[01:43:44.480 --> 01:43:49.680]   entire natural gas supply of Russia disappearing due to the equipment failing to work and all
[01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:51.840]   of it being frozen in the pipes.
[01:43:51.840 --> 01:43:58.240]   Then you go to—you talk about food supplies being down because of localized drought and
[01:43:58.240 --> 01:44:00.040]   people putting on less fertilizer.
[01:44:00.040 --> 01:44:03.840]   And then you have the number one and number two—that's not true.
[01:44:03.840 --> 01:44:10.920]   Anyway, very high-ranking, very high-level wheat suppliers of Russia and Ukraine being
[01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:16.760]   completely cut off from the global markets due to sanctions and due to war and due to
[01:44:16.760 --> 01:44:20.640]   their ships not being able to get out and their product rotting in the streets.
[01:44:20.640 --> 01:44:26.680]   And so it's gotten worse and worse and worse every single week since for the last year.
[01:44:26.680 --> 01:44:32.760]   I can tell you right now, okay, the biblical part of the famine is really going to hit
[01:44:32.760 --> 01:44:34.280]   Arabia and Africa.
[01:44:34.280 --> 01:44:40.640]   If you go into Zion's videos on YouTube, and there's many, just type in Peter Zion,
[01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:43.000]   get ready to lose three days.
[01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.880]   Z-I-E-H-A-N.
[01:44:45.880 --> 01:44:53.400]   And he will show you maps of who produces what, who's self-sustaining, who's a net exporter,
[01:44:53.400 --> 01:45:01.760]   importer of everything from wheat to corn to energy and everything in and out that you
[01:45:01.760 --> 01:45:07.560]   can possibly imagine, metals, commodities.
[01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:12.120]   The guy has got to have an idyllic memory for all this.
[01:45:12.120 --> 01:45:18.840]   He's got to be like a functional Sheldon Cooper, literally, of the level that this
[01:45:18.840 --> 01:45:24.240]   guy is operating at is stupendous.
[01:45:24.240 --> 01:45:33.680]   Not to say there isn't anything, he's not fallible, but he's been working his entire
[01:45:33.680 --> 01:45:37.320]   life for these current years.
[01:45:37.320 --> 01:45:45.640]   And now is the time that he was put on this planet for to be the voice of education to
[01:45:45.640 --> 01:45:54.680]   all of those of us who will listen and comprehend what he is trying to say.
[01:45:54.680 --> 01:45:57.600]   And it is absolutely startling.
[01:45:57.600 --> 01:46:03.400]   And it's like, see, what else did I have in the outline that you wanted to talk about?
[01:46:03.400 --> 01:46:08.920]   Because we really need to get into some of the financial opportunities here for people,
[01:46:08.920 --> 01:46:12.920]   because this is called "radical personal finance," I don't want it to be "Harris
[01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:18.400]   End of the World Finance," but it's called "radical personal finance."
[01:46:18.400 --> 01:46:24.600]   I want to put some radical into that part of the personal finance aspect of your show.
[01:46:24.600 --> 01:46:25.600]   Right.
[01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:30.000]   So let's talk for a moment about the food situation, what practically can be done.
[01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:33.080]   Number one, most of us have access to food.
[01:46:33.080 --> 01:46:34.560]   And so at a minimum—
[01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:35.560]   Today.
[01:46:35.560 --> 01:46:36.560]   Correct.
[01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:37.560]   Today.
[01:46:37.560 --> 01:46:38.560]   Today.
[01:46:38.560 --> 01:46:41.360]   At a minimum, stockpiling for your family, your loved ones, your neighborhood, stockpiling
[01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:47.640]   the food that you have access to, and the largest quantities that you can make happen
[01:46:47.640 --> 01:46:50.120]   is a great idea.
[01:46:50.120 --> 01:46:54.520]   And the audience of radical personal finance, the numbers involved to do that are simply
[01:46:54.520 --> 01:46:58.400]   a rounding error in most of our financial lifespans.
[01:46:58.400 --> 01:47:04.880]   But if you went out and you spent $5,000 stockpiling food, then that's for most of us a rounding
[01:47:04.880 --> 01:47:09.760]   error, but yet that could be the stuff of life for those that you love for a significant
[01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:10.760]   period of time.
[01:47:10.760 --> 01:47:12.800]   And I'll get to the resources on that in a moment.
[01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:18.400]   Number two, I think it's important to think about supplies of food.
[01:47:18.400 --> 01:47:19.680]   What is available for me?
[01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:26.760]   And so if you're living in the downtown area of a city and you're far away from agricultural
[01:47:26.760 --> 01:47:30.960]   production, that's difficult because there's a lot of people between you and the agricultural
[01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:31.960]   production.
[01:47:31.960 --> 01:47:35.760]   So you want to be thinking carefully, "Is there a place or a way that I can get closer
[01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:40.560]   to local producers or local supplies of food?"
[01:47:40.560 --> 01:47:48.080]   I think on a global level, the place that is best positioned for this is North America,
[01:47:48.080 --> 01:47:50.760]   most importantly the United States and Canada.
[01:47:50.760 --> 01:47:54.680]   The United States is the world's largest agricultural producer and exporter.
[01:47:54.680 --> 01:47:57.960]   Anyway, a huge, huge production of food.
[01:47:57.960 --> 01:48:02.840]   And all of the natural materials, the natural gas, etc., are more abundant in the United
[01:48:02.840 --> 01:48:03.840]   States.
[01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:05.320]   They're cheaper in the United States than anywhere else.
[01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:11.120]   And so if you're looking on a regional level or a global level, the United States is best
[01:48:11.120 --> 01:48:18.080]   positioned of any country or region in the world to go through, to do better than other
[01:48:18.080 --> 01:48:19.560]   places.
[01:48:19.560 --> 01:48:25.880]   And there are other places in the world that also may do well, but the United States is
[01:48:25.880 --> 01:48:27.400]   best positioned.
[01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:33.360]   I think even within that, you can look to say, right, one of the pieces of advice that
[01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:38.520]   when Steve and I were talking about this privately, Steve told me, he said, "Go, you need to
[01:48:38.520 --> 01:48:41.200]   have a plan to go get food from the ocean."
[01:48:41.200 --> 01:48:46.720]   So since I have a fairly mobile family, maybe I buy a boat, a fishing trawler, or something
[01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:49.720]   like that that I could live on and have easy access to the oceans.
[01:48:49.720 --> 01:48:50.720]   Go ahead.
[01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:52.360]   We had two levels there.
[01:48:52.360 --> 01:48:59.560]   One, I said, "Start by getting to know the fishing industry in your local locale where
[01:48:59.560 --> 01:49:00.560]   you're living."
[01:49:00.560 --> 01:49:02.680]   And you go, "I love it."
[01:49:02.680 --> 01:49:11.080]   And I said, and another friend and I, we were kind of like war gaming for you.
[01:49:11.080 --> 01:49:12.080]   Okay.
[01:49:12.080 --> 01:49:15.440]   We were putting ourselves, which is something I do very well.
[01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:24.040]   I can put myself in your shoes mentally pretty well and try to like look out through your
[01:49:24.040 --> 01:49:31.400]   eyes and your ears and from your point of view and get a feel for things.
[01:49:31.400 --> 01:49:39.320]   And we were war gaming and I was talking with a buddy of mine, Scott, about this as like,
[01:49:39.320 --> 01:49:46.520]   I think the Gulf Coast, the Southern Gulf Coast would be a great place, especially the
[01:49:46.520 --> 01:49:53.000]   part that gets up, like the Ozarks and a few things, but close to the ocean.
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:50:01.160]   And my friend goes, "Oh, hell, tell him to go down and find like a working trawler that's
[01:50:01.160 --> 01:50:08.200]   not being used for fishing and just have him buy that or rent that and go live aboard the
[01:50:08.200 --> 01:50:09.200]   trawler."
[01:50:09.200 --> 01:50:16.200]   I go, "One, your anchorage is free to cheap, whether you're a dock or not a dock.
[01:50:16.200 --> 01:50:22.280]   You got a place to live, you're isolated, or you can be in a big community.
[01:50:22.280 --> 01:50:26.440]   You can literally fish off the boat and you're in the middle of the fishing community.
[01:50:26.440 --> 01:50:37.840]   So no matter what happens to nitrogen gas, nitric acid, ammonia, fertilizer, crop reports,
[01:50:37.840 --> 01:50:39.880]   the oceans are still going to be there.
[01:50:39.880 --> 01:50:45.000]   And as anyone who has fished a lot in the oceans, they go, "Oh, I can catch my dinner
[01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.640]   every night on the beach."
[01:50:47.640 --> 01:50:49.640]   It's very easy to do.
[01:50:49.640 --> 01:50:58.320]   Let alone using other methods of fishing.
[01:50:58.320 --> 01:51:06.160]   And see, it's like that way, it's like, let's say, you get the fishing trawler in Alabama
[01:51:06.160 --> 01:51:10.080]   and you want to move over to the Panhandle of Florida or Mississippi.
[01:51:10.080 --> 01:51:15.160]   It's like, fine, you and the kids ride in the trawler.
[01:51:15.160 --> 01:51:17.640]   It's a little expensive for diesel, but it's okay.
[01:51:17.640 --> 01:51:21.400]   You can move to a different spot that has more advantages to you.
[01:51:21.400 --> 01:51:26.720]   And your wife drives a car down the road and you meet up at the new port.
[01:51:26.720 --> 01:51:34.040]   So you still got your car, yet you got your mobile house, yet you got access to something
[01:51:34.040 --> 01:51:38.680]   that is completely unaffected by everything we just talked about.
[01:51:38.680 --> 01:51:44.120]   The fish are going to continue to do what fish do in the ocean, reproduce and grow and
[01:51:44.120 --> 01:51:46.960]   eat smaller fish to become bigger fish.
[01:51:46.960 --> 01:51:57.560]   And that's one of the things I wanted to put out there is if some of your people want this
[01:51:57.560 --> 01:52:08.720]   type of thinking brought to them for their family, for their rounding error corrections,
[01:52:08.720 --> 01:52:13.960]   I am available for a period of time to do this for them.
[01:52:13.960 --> 01:52:23.960]   Go to harris1234.com and or email me, Stephen, S-T-E-V-E-N@harris1234.com.
[01:52:23.960 --> 01:52:33.520]   And we can try to put some of this best practices, best thinking intelligence for you and your
[01:52:33.520 --> 01:52:36.720]   family and what you're concerned with.
[01:52:36.720 --> 01:52:41.360]   Because what Josh and I are talking about are, it's the 10,000 foot view.
[01:52:41.360 --> 01:52:48.040]   If you get the real 10,000 foot view, you're going to mess your diaper because it's scary.
[01:52:48.040 --> 01:52:52.680]   And it's going to become scary and a lot of uncertainty.
[01:52:52.680 --> 01:52:57.860]   Remember the early days of the pandemic, it will be 10 times scarier than that because
[01:52:57.860 --> 01:53:02.960]   there won't be nothing on the grocery shelves, potentially.
[01:53:02.960 --> 01:53:06.720]   Quite possibly.
[01:53:06.720 --> 01:53:14.360]   And that's an example of, that's some of the off the wall thinking that I've been known
[01:53:14.360 --> 01:53:20.280]   for, for think tanks and different communities and stuff like that.
[01:53:20.280 --> 01:53:26.760]   It's like, I can see the series of dominoes and the first one beginning to fall and I'm
[01:53:26.760 --> 01:53:32.400]   going, and the last one, which will take a half hour for them all to fall, the last one
[01:53:32.400 --> 01:53:37.560]   hits the stick of dynamite next to your favorite cat in a cage.
[01:53:37.560 --> 01:53:39.560]   It's like, ah, my cat's going to die.
[01:53:39.560 --> 01:53:42.400]   It's like, what do you mean?
[01:53:42.400 --> 01:53:47.120]   Because I see the person walking out of the bathroom, who's going to trip over the first
[01:53:47.120 --> 01:53:54.880]   domino that starts the whole chain going, that goes for a half hour, that hits the switch
[01:53:54.880 --> 01:53:58.440]   for the dynamite next to your cat in the cage drinking the cream.
[01:53:58.440 --> 01:54:00.400]   And I go, ah, your cat's going to die.
[01:54:00.400 --> 01:54:02.400]   It's like, you're crazy.
[01:54:02.400 --> 01:54:07.640]   No, and by the way, just a strong endorsement, Stephen Harris is an idea generating machine.
[01:54:07.640 --> 01:54:09.520]   It's his core skill.
[01:54:09.520 --> 01:54:14.000]   So he's very, very good at finding good practical solutions to specific scenarios.
[01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:17.760]   And I wholeheartedly endorse anyone who wants to work with him.
[01:54:17.760 --> 01:54:22.720]   You'll find excellent thinking and extremely knowledgeable and connected guy.
[01:54:22.720 --> 01:54:23.720]   Yes.
[01:54:23.720 --> 01:54:27.040]   And my rates are the same as the Mandalorian.
[01:54:27.040 --> 01:54:29.840]   My price is high.
[01:54:29.840 --> 01:54:37.800]   The only thing more expensive is walking around in the dark, blindfolded, in the minefield
[01:54:37.800 --> 01:54:42.840]   with pterodactyls with night vision waiting to try to pick you up off of the ground for
[01:54:42.840 --> 01:54:45.480]   food before you walk into the mines.
[01:54:45.480 --> 01:54:46.840]   Right, right.
[01:54:46.840 --> 01:54:50.560]   I think one of the things that is important to point out, we talked about though in terms
[01:54:50.560 --> 01:54:56.200]   of financial opportunity, I think there are very good reasons to believe that this next
[01:54:56.200 --> 01:55:01.400]   couple of decades will be, next couple of decades.
[01:55:01.400 --> 01:55:08.720]   First of all, if this trend towards deglobalization is proven to be correct and continuing in
[01:55:08.720 --> 01:55:14.920]   the fullness of time, again, this trend, it bears very strong possibilities for many regions
[01:55:14.920 --> 01:55:15.920]   of the world.
[01:55:15.920 --> 01:55:19.360]   In a separate episode, I'll probably go over some of the other regions that can win.
[01:55:19.360 --> 01:55:25.560]   But in the United States, for my primarily US American audience, in the United States,
[01:55:25.560 --> 01:55:31.280]   this potentially looks like a tremendous boom, a tremendous economic boom.
[01:55:31.280 --> 01:55:38.160]   If global manufacturing, excuse me, if global supply lines continue to face pressure, and
[01:55:38.160 --> 01:55:43.880]   if we see the continuing trends as far as the collapse of Chinese manufacturing, much
[01:55:43.880 --> 01:55:48.320]   of that manufacturing coming back to North America, then some of the long-term trends
[01:55:48.320 --> 01:55:53.920]   that hold huge possibilities are the growth of manufacturing in North America, the United
[01:55:53.920 --> 01:55:56.640]   States, Mexico, the interaction.
[01:55:56.640 --> 01:55:57.640]   Go ahead.
[01:55:57.640 --> 01:55:58.640]   It's more than that.
[01:55:58.640 --> 01:55:59.640]   It's more than that.
[01:55:59.640 --> 01:56:02.360]   And Zion gets into it.
[01:56:02.360 --> 01:56:10.480]   And it's like he gets into secondary smelting or recycled smelting versus primary smelting.
[01:56:10.480 --> 01:56:16.600]   And primary smelting is where you use a carbon product like coke or natural gas to reduce
[01:56:16.600 --> 01:56:25.920]   the primary ore into the virgin copper or the virgin steel or iron that is used.
[01:56:25.920 --> 01:56:30.840]   And Michigan is an iron ore and a copper ore state.
[01:56:30.840 --> 01:56:31.840]   And I'm in Michigan.
[01:56:31.840 --> 01:56:35.080]   And I got friends with the natural gas well.
[01:56:35.080 --> 01:56:36.520]   And I'm talking to them.
[01:56:36.520 --> 01:56:41.800]   And I go, "Oh, you want to know what's more profitable than making electricity with natural
[01:56:41.800 --> 01:56:47.400]   gas to go to cryptocurrency than it is to sell the natural gas outright?"
[01:56:47.400 --> 01:56:50.080]   I go, "We're going to smelt steel."
[01:56:50.080 --> 01:56:55.680]   Because, I mean, we're sitting right here next to the Great Lakes with the well.
[01:56:55.680 --> 01:56:57.440]   And they own a trucking company.
[01:56:57.440 --> 01:57:07.280]   And it's like we can get the raw iron ore off of the main Great Lakes freighters that
[01:57:07.280 --> 01:57:09.280]   drop it off in Toledo.
[01:57:09.280 --> 01:57:13.760]   And it's like we can make virgin iron.
[01:57:13.760 --> 01:57:19.120]   Even if it's virgin pig iron, we can make virgin pig iron from natural gas and iron
[01:57:19.120 --> 01:57:20.120]   ore.
[01:57:20.120 --> 01:57:32.000]   So, I mean, the opportunities are—the opportunities literally go from the Industrial Revolution,
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.720]   which started with Bessemer.
[01:57:34.720 --> 01:57:37.920]   Bessemer was a Gutenberg-type event.
[01:57:37.920 --> 01:57:45.480]   And I cover Gutenberg-type events in my second podcast, the one where I talk about APS.
[01:57:45.480 --> 01:57:47.520]   It's the theoretical division of Amazon.
[01:57:47.520 --> 01:57:53.000]   You know, Amazon made Amazon Web Services, which makes more money than Amazon does because
[01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:58.040]   they had spare computational and storage ability for Amazon.
[01:57:58.040 --> 01:58:01.480]   So, they started renting it out.
[01:58:01.480 --> 01:58:07.520]   I made something more profitable than Amazon Web Services called APS, Amazon Power Services,
[01:58:07.520 --> 01:58:14.600]   because they're going to a fleet of electric vehicles or trying to.
[01:58:14.600 --> 01:58:18.600]   And it's like I could talk for eight hours, four on positive, four on negative, about
[01:58:18.600 --> 01:58:20.560]   EVs and all the aspects of it.
[01:58:20.560 --> 01:58:25.920]   As a development engineer for Chrysler, Diamond Chrysler for 10 years, I understand the fundamentals
[01:58:25.920 --> 01:58:28.280]   of internal combustion operation.
[01:58:28.280 --> 01:58:33.960]   I understand how EVs can integrate and how they can decimate the grid, how they can prop
[01:58:33.960 --> 01:58:37.280]   it up and how they can decimate it at the same time.
[01:58:37.280 --> 01:58:42.640]   And knowing the way politicians and stupidity goes, it's going to go more towards decimation
[01:58:42.640 --> 01:58:44.600]   than it is positive.
[01:58:44.600 --> 01:58:51.560]   But I make in my second podcast, and it's going to be at harris1234.com or use the words
[01:58:51.560 --> 01:58:53.280]   I told you.
[01:58:53.280 --> 01:59:04.400]   I go over the idea of APS, Amazon Power Systems, and how you can stop environmental thinking
[01:59:04.400 --> 01:59:05.400]   completely.
[01:59:05.400 --> 01:59:08.880]   It's become the litmus test for everything.
[01:59:08.880 --> 01:59:11.640]   It's like, is it planet friendly?
[01:59:11.640 --> 01:59:12.640]   Shut up.
[01:59:12.640 --> 01:59:16.520]   Okay, stop environmental thinking, think smart.
[01:59:16.520 --> 01:59:24.480]   When you think smart, you answer your environmental goals you wanted and you go wildly beyond
[01:59:24.480 --> 01:59:25.480]   them.
[01:59:25.480 --> 01:59:29.000]   It's like saying, "Hey, can we put Sputnik in orbit?"
[01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:30.200]   It's like, "What do you mean?
[01:59:30.200 --> 01:59:31.640]   I'm talking to you from Mars."
[01:59:31.640 --> 01:59:38.160]   I mean, that is how much better smart thinking is than limited thinking.
[01:59:38.160 --> 01:59:44.560]   Because you just wanted Sputnik, but nevermind the moon, you got the Mars in the same thinking
[01:59:44.560 --> 01:59:45.560]   process.
[01:59:45.560 --> 01:59:50.960]   And it goes back to a system that I was a six person group that created at Chrysler
[01:59:50.960 --> 01:59:55.000]   called Speed the Market, which became the Chrysler Development System, which became
[01:59:55.000 --> 02:00:00.440]   the reasons the goddamn Germans bought Chrysler Corporation was to figure out how Chrysler
[02:00:00.440 --> 02:00:05.000]   made more money per vehicle than anyone else in the world.
[02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:10.920]   Now Toyota made more vehicles than anyone else in the world, and we made less, but we
[02:00:10.920 --> 02:00:15.480]   made more money per vehicle than anyone else in the world.
[02:00:15.480 --> 02:00:24.360]   And this started getting implemented with the radical changes that we did in '94, which
[02:00:24.360 --> 02:00:35.840]   culminated with the Red Blob commercial going through talking about a new day.
[02:00:35.840 --> 02:00:44.640]   But yeah, so anyways, I go through Amazon, and it's really kind of a fun story of the
[02:00:44.640 --> 02:00:52.960]   way I did this, but it's to show you what is possible when you think with no box.
[02:00:52.960 --> 02:00:54.160]   And not everyone can do it.
[02:00:54.160 --> 02:00:57.720]   I mean, I don't mean out of the, it's like, "Oh, he's an out-of-box thinker."
[02:00:57.720 --> 02:00:59.600]   No, it's on my resume.
[02:00:59.600 --> 02:01:03.120]   It says, "Steven Harris, ENTP, no-box thinker."
[02:01:03.120 --> 02:01:05.880]   I mean, that is the start of my resume.
[02:01:05.880 --> 02:01:12.880]   I do not have a box, nor do I have an ego where I'm concerned about, it's like, "Oh,
[02:01:12.880 --> 02:01:16.880]   I'm not going to defend any last idea as the hill to die on.
[02:01:16.880 --> 02:01:20.920]   I will come up with 12 ideas for you in five minutes."
[02:01:20.920 --> 02:01:26.800]   And it's going to be like, you're going to go, "No, no, done, did it, doesn't work,
[02:01:26.800 --> 02:01:31.480]   interesting, no," and it's like, "Oh, crap, what's that one?"
[02:01:31.480 --> 02:01:36.560]   And see, because I'm trying to generate that many ideas.
[02:01:36.560 --> 02:01:42.000]   So you get to the, "Oh, crap, I never thought of that one," where things that took three
[02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:49.360]   years happened in three days or three weeks, which is the fundamental behind the speed
[02:01:49.360 --> 02:01:53.560]   to market Chrysler development system philosophy.
[02:01:53.560 --> 02:01:59.800]   But when I apply that to you and your family, that's how we come up with Josh, buy a trawler
[02:01:59.800 --> 02:02:02.680]   on the southern coast of the United States.
[02:02:02.680 --> 02:02:04.760]   Right, right, absolutely.
[02:02:04.760 --> 02:02:09.880]   So question, what I wanted to wrap up with is finding ideas.
[02:02:09.880 --> 02:02:13.000]   Oh, we're a long ways from wrapping up.
[02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:14.720]   We're going to do the longest ever episode.
[02:02:14.720 --> 02:02:18.520]   This is called Joshua Sheets' Radical Personal Finance.
[02:02:18.520 --> 02:02:21.320]   There's not an ending time.
[02:02:21.320 --> 02:02:24.960]   They can just press pause and listen to the rest later.
[02:02:24.960 --> 02:02:28.080]   In the meantime, you get half a week off, buddy.
[02:02:28.080 --> 02:02:31.440]   So here's my thought.
[02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:36.280]   I have solved, in my mind, a lot of problems that we face, and there are very few problems
[02:02:36.280 --> 02:02:42.680]   that I ... That's why I retain huge amounts of optimism, because human creatures are fundamentally
[02:02:42.680 --> 02:02:47.920]   intelligent, creative, and capable of working together to come up with never-before-heard
[02:02:47.920 --> 02:02:48.920]   solutions.
[02:02:48.920 --> 02:02:55.120]   And times of great disruption bring opportunities to create tremendous solutions.
[02:02:55.120 --> 02:03:01.400]   And so even with talking about some of these deglobalization trends, this will be a time
[02:03:01.400 --> 02:03:07.000]   of tremendous growth and tremendous change, and that creates opportunity.
[02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:12.640]   When money is moving, when things are shifting, it creates opportunity for entrepreneurs to
[02:03:12.640 --> 02:03:17.120]   get in the way of it and grab some of it by bringing solutions to the marketplace.
[02:03:17.120 --> 02:03:22.800]   The United States is very likely to experience a strong growth in manufacturing.
[02:03:22.800 --> 02:03:28.200]   Mexico is very well positioned to have incredible economic growth supporting the United States.
[02:03:28.200 --> 02:03:33.680]   There are perhaps other regions ... We're going to have inflationary growth to
[02:03:33.680 --> 02:03:36.320]   quote Zion.
[02:03:36.320 --> 02:03:41.440]   And the United States doesn't have great demographics, but it has vastly better demographics than
[02:03:41.440 --> 02:03:45.720]   most regions of the world, which means that ...
[02:03:45.720 --> 02:03:47.520]   The United States has Mexico.
[02:03:47.520 --> 02:03:48.520]   Right.
[02:03:48.520 --> 02:03:54.680]   For us, meaning for us as people who are working, who are involved in the marketplace, unemployment
[02:03:54.680 --> 02:03:57.160]   I think will continue to be very low.
[02:03:57.160 --> 02:04:01.380]   There are jobs available for anybody who can retool, can retrain.
[02:04:01.380 --> 02:04:05.120]   You see all across the United States, you just see right now, "Help Wanted" signs everywhere
[02:04:05.120 --> 02:04:09.480]   that people are struggling to get workers, and that will continue, which means that ...
[02:04:09.480 --> 02:04:12.920]   Josh, there are jobs for anyone who can breathe.
[02:04:12.920 --> 02:04:13.920]   Yeah.
[02:04:13.920 --> 02:04:18.780]   And so even for our children, our children live in a world of tremendous employment opportunities
[02:04:18.780 --> 02:04:22.400]   and tremendous opportunities.
[02:04:22.400 --> 02:04:31.520]   From the food perspective, I think that fundamentally food shortages will lead potentially to massive
[02:04:31.520 --> 02:04:36.880]   increases in the amount ... Sorry, we said ... We're not supposed to use the word shortages.
[02:04:36.880 --> 02:04:37.880]   Famine.
[02:04:37.880 --> 02:04:39.640]   Josh, food outages.
[02:04:39.640 --> 02:04:40.640]   Food outages.
[02:04:40.640 --> 02:04:41.640]   Food ...
[02:04:41.640 --> 02:04:42.880]   It's gone.
[02:04:42.880 --> 02:04:46.920]   Food outages can lead to massive increases in the growth of food.
[02:04:46.920 --> 02:04:53.120]   And so here's my optimistic argument in face of food outages.
[02:04:53.120 --> 02:04:58.000]   Number one, in the modern world, because food has been so cheap, we pay no attention to
[02:04:58.000 --> 02:04:59.520]   creating food.
[02:04:59.520 --> 02:05:05.240]   But every single city, every single suburb, every single town is potentially some of the
[02:05:05.240 --> 02:05:08.360]   most productive farmland in the world.
[02:05:08.360 --> 02:05:13.560]   Years ago I interviewed, was it Curtis Stone I think it was, who was a backyard farmer.
[02:05:13.560 --> 02:05:17.360]   And if you're not familiar with him, Steven, he was a guy who started farming in people's
[02:05:17.360 --> 02:05:25.440]   backyards and he created a business where he was farming in ... I can't remember how
[02:05:25.440 --> 02:05:30.320]   many people's backyards, but literally he was sharecropping in people's suburban backyards
[02:05:30.320 --> 02:05:35.080]   and producing a business where he was making six figures a year from his farming operation
[02:05:35.080 --> 02:05:38.340]   and he was producing huge amounts of food.
[02:05:38.340 --> 02:05:39.340]   He was getting ...
[02:05:39.340 --> 02:05:41.120]   Oh, I remember this guy.
[02:05:41.120 --> 02:05:42.120]   I remember this guy.
[02:05:42.120 --> 02:05:43.300]   He was fantastic.
[02:05:43.300 --> 02:05:45.000]   And he was actually doing the entire thing.
[02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:46.000]   Hold on, let me finish.
[02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:50.640]   He was doing the entire thing exclusively with bicycle transportation.
[02:05:50.640 --> 02:05:56.600]   The only element in his system where he was dependent upon fuel inputs was he had a gasoline
[02:05:56.600 --> 02:06:02.680]   powered rototiller that he would put on a bicycle and he would transport it between
[02:06:02.680 --> 02:06:06.640]   his farms with a bicycle trailer for his gas powered rototiller.
[02:06:06.640 --> 02:06:11.280]   His production per acre on that kind of small scale was huge.
[02:06:11.280 --> 02:06:12.280]   So you look at the American ...
[02:06:12.280 --> 02:06:13.280]   No, no, no.
[02:06:13.280 --> 02:06:14.280]   Completely wrong.
[02:06:14.280 --> 02:06:15.280]   All right.
[02:06:15.280 --> 02:06:16.280]   Completely wrong.
[02:06:16.280 --> 02:06:17.280]   Go ahead.
[02:06:17.280 --> 02:06:18.280]   Why is that wrong?
[02:06:18.280 --> 02:06:26.120]   He was making an awful lot of food for people, but he was not feeding anyone.
[02:06:26.120 --> 02:06:27.120]   I don't ... I don't ...
[02:06:27.120 --> 02:06:28.120]   Okay.
[02:06:28.120 --> 02:06:29.120]   Hold on, hold on.
[02:06:29.120 --> 02:06:32.060]   So you're talking about the difference between staple crops and calorie crops versus vegetables
[02:06:32.060 --> 02:06:35.400]   and kind of ancillary stuff.
[02:06:35.400 --> 02:06:36.400]   Absolutely.
[02:06:36.400 --> 02:06:42.200]   Now, I have a little private group called Steve's Power Circle, okay?
[02:06:42.200 --> 02:06:46.760]   And it's very hard to get into it, okay?
[02:06:46.760 --> 02:06:48.960]   And we're very blunt in it.
[02:06:48.960 --> 02:06:59.440]   Now I have this member, her first name is Rachel, and she is role model in quality when
[02:06:59.440 --> 02:07:00.920]   it comes to ag.
[02:07:00.920 --> 02:07:05.880]   And I was so scared about what I wrote and what was going on.
[02:07:05.880 --> 02:07:10.480]   We were talking about this in January on the Power Circle.
[02:07:10.480 --> 02:07:12.400]   And she goes, "Steve, what should I plant?"
[02:07:12.400 --> 02:07:14.120]   I go, "Potatoes.
[02:07:14.120 --> 02:07:17.060]   Rachel, do potatoes."
[02:07:17.060 --> 02:07:22.360]   And she goes, "Well, also there were some like butternut squashes that go good in Michigan."
[02:07:22.360 --> 02:07:23.680]   Because she's up in Traverse City.
[02:07:23.680 --> 02:07:25.840]   And it's like, we need calorie crops.
[02:07:25.840 --> 02:07:32.880]   I mean, I was so scared that if I had the land, I would have planted potatoes because
[02:07:32.880 --> 02:07:36.840]   that guy was brilliant in what he was doing, okay?
[02:07:36.840 --> 02:07:38.680]   I saw the videos and everything else.
[02:07:38.680 --> 02:07:41.560]   I think Justin Rhodes endorsed him.
[02:07:41.560 --> 02:07:46.920]   And it was brilliant the way he was using other people's resources to make himself and
[02:07:46.920 --> 02:07:48.440]   them money.
[02:07:48.440 --> 02:07:52.800]   But he was doing a lot of what he did.
[02:07:52.800 --> 02:08:04.560]   I blame 20% for the billion that are going to die, I blame 20% on it of the crap he was
[02:08:04.560 --> 02:08:08.320]   feeding others and that he had swallowed.
[02:08:08.320 --> 02:08:18.360]   That was the all organic, non-GMO, non-this, non-that, with a magnet near the tomato pointing
[02:08:18.360 --> 02:08:26.360]   north for three days out of the week that only ended in Y, whatever, okay?
[02:08:26.360 --> 02:08:27.880]   And he made a lot of money.
[02:08:27.880 --> 02:08:28.880]   He did good.
[02:08:28.880 --> 02:08:30.840]   He did it smart.
[02:08:30.840 --> 02:08:34.400]   He did like the really good parts of permaculture.
[02:08:34.400 --> 02:08:38.880]   But he was, like you said, he was making the tomatoes and the vegetables and everything
[02:08:38.880 --> 02:08:39.880]   else.
[02:08:39.880 --> 02:08:46.280]   He wasn't making anything that people could have lived off of as a base.
[02:08:46.280 --> 02:08:54.800]   And Rachel did 10 gallons, she didn't weigh them yet, but she did 10 gallons of potatoes
[02:08:54.800 --> 02:08:59.360]   and less than a hundred square feet of fertilizer tubs.
[02:08:59.360 --> 02:09:01.440]   And they weren't even that close to each other.
[02:09:01.440 --> 02:09:07.400]   And all she did was she took rusher potatoes from the store and she chopped them up where
[02:09:07.400 --> 02:09:10.720]   their eyes were and she let them sprout.
[02:09:10.720 --> 02:09:18.480]   And then she lightly put them into the soil and put straw over them and she produced a
[02:09:18.480 --> 02:09:21.960]   potato crop beyond exception.
[02:09:21.960 --> 02:09:26.040]   But those two things are not fundamentally in conflict.
[02:09:26.040 --> 02:09:29.480]   I agree with you that Curtis Stone was not producing in his model.
[02:09:29.480 --> 02:09:34.800]   He was not producing high calorie foods that would easily keep someone alive.
[02:09:34.800 --> 02:09:35.800]   He was producing money.
[02:09:35.800 --> 02:09:36.800]   Exactly.
[02:09:36.800 --> 02:09:41.960]   He was producing arugula and herbs and whatnot that have very high prices.
[02:09:41.960 --> 02:09:44.960]   But he could switch over to a calorie.
[02:09:44.960 --> 02:09:45.960]   Yes, exactly.
[02:09:45.960 --> 02:09:46.960]   I fully agree.
[02:09:46.960 --> 02:09:47.960]   The guy's brilliant.
[02:09:47.960 --> 02:09:49.520]   It's fantastic.
[02:09:49.520 --> 02:09:54.240]   And so if you actually look at a place like the suburbs in the United States and many
[02:09:54.240 --> 02:10:00.280]   places of the world, there is so much potential for food production.
[02:10:00.280 --> 02:10:01.520]   It's just shocking.
[02:10:01.520 --> 02:10:08.720]   And the food production that that kind of land is suited for is high intensity gardening,
[02:10:08.720 --> 02:10:14.320]   which is not necessarily best for staple crops of potatoes and wheat, etc.
[02:10:14.320 --> 02:10:18.240]   It's for high intensity gardening that could be done.
[02:10:18.240 --> 02:10:23.240]   If any of our great grandparents came to the world today and saw how we despise land and
[02:10:23.240 --> 02:10:29.320]   how we despise food, literally choosing in most circumstances non-fruit bearing trees
[02:10:29.320 --> 02:10:32.640]   rather than fruit bearing trees because we don't want to clean up the fruit from underneath
[02:10:32.640 --> 02:10:34.560]   the ground, they would be shocked.
[02:10:34.560 --> 02:10:41.480]   And we live in that world that we live in is created because of globalization, that
[02:10:41.480 --> 02:10:46.960]   I can get my tomatoes from Chile in the northern hemisphere just like anything else.
[02:10:46.960 --> 02:10:48.800]   And it's created with cheap oil.
[02:10:48.800 --> 02:10:50.120]   It's created by all those things.
[02:10:50.120 --> 02:10:56.320]   And so we could, not in a season, but there could be a very quick transformation in terms
[02:10:56.320 --> 02:10:57.640]   of that kind of food production.
[02:10:57.640 --> 02:11:05.880]   The second thing that I have a real passion for is I believe that grass pastured animal
[02:11:05.880 --> 02:11:15.920]   production is one of the most powerful and most underutilized methods of meat production
[02:11:15.920 --> 02:11:22.040]   in the United States that we don't do because of the low prices of corn and soy.
[02:11:22.040 --> 02:11:28.440]   And so while you can't live exclusively on tomatoes, you can live exclusively on beef.
[02:11:28.440 --> 02:11:33.400]   And what we could do in the United States where we have huge amounts of land is we could
[02:11:33.400 --> 02:11:41.360]   turn so much of our unused land into animal food production because what animals are world
[02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:45.720]   class at is taking land that is unsuitable for farming because it's steep or it's
[02:11:45.720 --> 02:11:51.840]   rocky or it's anything like that, where you can't produce human food on it, and
[02:11:51.840 --> 02:11:56.440]   using the grass and vegetation on it to create human food, which because we can eat the animals
[02:11:56.440 --> 02:11:58.980]   and live exclusively on the animal meat.
[02:11:58.980 --> 02:12:03.880]   And so a outage of food.
[02:12:03.880 --> 02:12:09.140]   And in this case, I think there's excellent evidence to say that while it's not as
[02:12:09.140 --> 02:12:17.000]   productive in terms of the fast growth of grain fed animals, there are so many producers
[02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:23.840]   proving grass fed cattle, pastured pigs, etc, that you can produce excellent meat content
[02:12:23.840 --> 02:12:26.040]   without those inputs.
[02:12:26.040 --> 02:12:34.440]   And those production methodologies can be genuinely regenerative to the land.
[02:12:34.440 --> 02:12:36.120]   That's a huge untapped reservoir.
[02:12:36.120 --> 02:12:39.400]   And so I think that's a positive thing that could come out of it.
[02:12:39.400 --> 02:12:45.360]   The third thing that I think is, and this is where I don't have the expertise you have,
[02:12:45.360 --> 02:12:52.360]   but I would love to see food production spaces like farmland go back to producing food and
[02:12:52.360 --> 02:12:54.300]   not to producing fuel.
[02:12:54.300 --> 02:13:02.280]   And so things like the ethanol markets for corn, etc, if that cropland went back to producing
[02:13:02.280 --> 02:13:09.360]   food for humans and food for animals, instead of producing food that is being used to turn
[02:13:09.360 --> 02:13:17.080]   into gases and we just change those markets, I think that could also be a massive change
[02:13:17.080 --> 02:13:18.080]   as well.
[02:13:18.080 --> 02:13:21.600]   So those are just the things off the top of my head.
[02:13:21.600 --> 02:13:27.740]   All of the ethanol we need could be synthesized directly from natural gas.
[02:13:27.740 --> 02:13:31.320]   You can synthesize natural gas directly into ethanol.
[02:13:31.320 --> 02:13:35.800]   In fact, it's done for the perfume industry by the petrochemical industry.
[02:13:35.800 --> 02:13:40.760]   It goes directly to 200 proof ethanol.
[02:13:40.760 --> 02:13:46.360]   It's kind of like the Haber-Bosch, it's some temp and pressure and some catalyst, but yeah,
[02:13:46.360 --> 02:13:55.000]   it should be illegal to make ethanol fuel from corn because we got an abundance of natural
[02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:56.000]   gas.
[02:13:56.000 --> 02:14:01.160]   And I got a whole podcast coming up that will blow everyone's mind on what's called methane
[02:14:01.160 --> 02:14:03.920]   hydrates, methane clathrates.
[02:14:03.920 --> 02:14:10.120]   It absolutely eclipses the known amounts of natural gas that we have in the land that
[02:14:10.120 --> 02:14:11.880]   is under the ocean.
[02:14:11.880 --> 02:14:15.520]   Actually just on the bottom of the ocean, it's beyond imagination.
[02:14:15.520 --> 02:14:19.320]   And it's a fundamental of chemistry.
[02:14:19.320 --> 02:14:23.200]   But all of our vehicles, ethanol is not the problem.
[02:14:23.200 --> 02:14:24.200]   Ethanol is the solution.
[02:14:24.200 --> 02:14:26.760]   There is a big witch hunt on ethanol.
[02:14:26.760 --> 02:14:30.920]   "Oh, my car died, it must have been that damn ethanol!"
[02:14:30.920 --> 02:14:34.880]   And I call it the witch hunt on ethanol because my cow died, well, the witch must have done
[02:14:34.880 --> 02:14:35.880]   it.
[02:14:35.880 --> 02:14:38.320]   "Oh, my son got sick, well, the village witch must have done it."
[02:14:38.320 --> 02:14:42.640]   "Oh, my weed whacker died, well, it must be that damn ethanol fuel."
[02:14:42.640 --> 02:14:52.000]   And there's no reason why all of our transportation cannot run on pure ethanol made from natural
[02:14:52.000 --> 02:15:01.320]   gas as easily as we do right now on gasoline and diesel.
[02:15:01.320 --> 02:15:06.560]   It can do it just as easily and with the same or better efficiency.
[02:15:06.560 --> 02:15:12.280]   It's just an absolute lot of stupid—you know, there is a law that says all of the
[02:15:12.280 --> 02:15:17.880]   ethanol we put in gasoline, which was the octane replacement for something that was
[02:15:17.880 --> 02:15:23.320]   very nasty called MTBE, because I remember it from the '90s in Chrysler, and the raw
[02:15:23.320 --> 02:15:29.440]   stuff had to be handled very, very carefully because it was very nasty.
[02:15:29.440 --> 02:15:34.680]   But there is someone made a law that said all of the ethanol that goes into gasoline
[02:15:34.680 --> 02:15:43.200]   has to be a bioproduct, meaning agriculturally derived through a fermentation process that
[02:15:43.200 --> 02:15:49.120]   involves a biofeedstock, that they are prevented from actually synthesizing it.
[02:15:49.120 --> 02:15:52.720]   You take methane and you make ethylene, which is not hard.
[02:15:52.720 --> 02:15:54.800]   We do it all day long for the plastic industry.
[02:15:54.800 --> 02:15:59.280]   Then you do something called the hydration of ethylene, which is basically adding water
[02:15:59.280 --> 02:16:05.680]   to ethylene, but it's complicated like Harbor Bosch, and you make ethanol.
[02:16:05.680 --> 02:16:10.320]   And it is the most—it is not—it is—you know, people go, "Oh, it eats gas, gets
[02:16:10.320 --> 02:16:12.800]   it, beats valves, it causes this."
[02:16:12.800 --> 02:16:18.160]   You moron, you drink it, you pour it down your throat, it goes in your stomach.
[02:16:18.160 --> 02:16:21.760]   Just again, how caustic is this stuff?
[02:16:21.760 --> 02:16:23.600]   Well, whatever.
[02:16:23.600 --> 02:16:29.440]   But yeah, there is a great deal of stupidity in the energy field of what can be done, what
[02:16:29.440 --> 02:16:30.440]   is going to be done.
[02:16:30.440 --> 02:16:33.280]   Let me tell you, they're trying to eliminate natural gas.
[02:16:33.280 --> 02:16:39.720]   If you want a hydrogen future, myself, Roy McAllister, have said for a long time, natural
[02:16:39.720 --> 02:16:42.840]   gas is the gateway drug to hydrogen.
[02:16:42.840 --> 02:16:47.600]   Right, and I think that—and that's just the tip of the iceberg, right?
[02:16:47.600 --> 02:16:53.560]   So two other—of changes that when the incentives change can and will happen.
[02:16:53.560 --> 02:17:00.600]   But I see—my point is that I is simply I see—I believe that humans will change, and
[02:17:00.600 --> 02:17:06.040]   so it's almost certainly not as catastrophic as it could be because humans will adapt as
[02:17:06.040 --> 02:17:07.680]   quickly as possible.
[02:17:07.680 --> 02:17:09.400]   Two other points that I was going to make, right?
[02:17:09.400 --> 02:17:12.280]   We talked about being very cold in Germany.
[02:17:12.280 --> 02:17:20.360]   You—if we—if I gave you 30 minutes, you would list off dozens of techniques and tactics
[02:17:20.360 --> 02:17:26.920]   that could be implemented in any home in Germany to make sure that that dwelling, even with
[02:17:26.920 --> 02:17:35.120]   no external heating, was at least livable, if not in some cases comfortable, by changing
[02:17:35.120 --> 02:17:36.960]   the basic structure of the apartment.
[02:17:36.960 --> 02:17:42.240]   I know that because I bought your books on passive solar heating and on passive cooling,
[02:17:42.240 --> 02:17:43.240]   et cetera.
[02:17:43.240 --> 02:17:49.840]   Yeah, well, in Germany, they have 200 percent of their peak load in solar and wind, but
[02:17:49.840 --> 02:17:51.360]   Zion said it best.
[02:17:51.360 --> 02:17:54.520]   It is not windy nor sunny in Germany.
[02:17:54.520 --> 02:17:55.520]   Right.
[02:17:55.520 --> 02:18:02.320]   So they got 8 percent of their base load is from solar and wind when they have installed
[02:18:02.320 --> 02:18:06.800]   200 percent of their base load in wind and solar.
[02:18:06.800 --> 02:18:13.040]   The problem with the buildings in Europe, you know, Jordan Peterson says that, "Wonderfully,
[02:18:13.040 --> 02:18:15.400]   Europe is absolutely beautiful."
[02:18:15.400 --> 02:18:18.560]   Now, OK, fine.
[02:18:18.560 --> 02:18:22.800]   You take—you've seen some nice houses in like Portugal, Spain, and France, haven't
[02:18:22.800 --> 02:18:23.800]   you?
[02:18:23.800 --> 02:18:24.800]   Yes, definitely.
[02:18:24.800 --> 02:18:25.800]   Well, fine.
[02:18:25.800 --> 02:18:27.040]   Let's make that thing energy efficient.
[02:18:27.040 --> 02:18:32.080]   The first thing I'm going to do is put this beautiful stone mansion and everything that
[02:18:32.080 --> 02:18:33.080]   you've seen you've been in.
[02:18:33.080 --> 02:18:40.280]   Well, Harris is going to spray foam six inches of foam on the outside of that thing.
[02:18:40.280 --> 02:18:50.160]   I cannot make that dwelling energy efficient without destroying the beautifulness of the
[02:18:50.160 --> 02:18:52.580]   architecture of that building.
[02:18:52.580 --> 02:18:59.760]   I cannot make it more energy efficient without changing the fundamentals of how that thing
[02:18:59.760 --> 02:19:01.960]   was made 300 years ago.
[02:19:01.960 --> 02:19:02.960]   Right.
[02:19:02.960 --> 02:19:03.960]   That's the problem.
[02:19:03.960 --> 02:19:08.640]   I mean, what do you do right now for air conditioning?
[02:19:08.640 --> 02:19:09.640]   You open your window.
[02:19:09.640 --> 02:19:10.640]   Right.
[02:19:10.640 --> 02:19:14.280]   What do you do if it's getting too hot?
[02:19:14.280 --> 02:19:15.280]   You open your window.
[02:19:15.280 --> 02:19:16.600]   If it gets too cold, what do you do?
[02:19:16.600 --> 02:19:18.120]   You close your windows.
[02:19:18.120 --> 02:19:19.120]   Right.
[02:19:19.120 --> 02:19:21.320]   There's parts of the world that are like that.
[02:19:21.320 --> 02:19:28.120]   They don't have heating or HVAC or air conditioning or anything because they're in the perfect
[02:19:28.120 --> 02:19:29.120]   place to live.
[02:19:29.120 --> 02:19:35.000]   And there's nice temperate zones around the world that is like that.
[02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:37.600]   Europe does not get super cold.
[02:19:37.600 --> 02:19:38.600]   Russia does.
[02:19:38.600 --> 02:19:39.600]   Right.
[02:19:39.600 --> 02:19:46.720]   But I mean, southern France, Spain, Italy, Greece, they don't get super cold there.
[02:19:46.720 --> 02:19:47.720]   Right.
[02:19:47.720 --> 02:19:52.600]   It's like, yeah, go to the hardware store and try to buy screens for your windows in
[02:19:52.600 --> 02:19:54.160]   Europe.
[02:19:54.160 --> 02:19:55.880]   Right.
[02:19:55.880 --> 02:20:05.360]   So and I guess the final comment would be, at its core, our entire civilization can and
[02:20:05.360 --> 02:20:12.200]   will be redesigned based upon the products and the environment of the future.
[02:20:12.200 --> 02:20:13.200]   The reason...
[02:20:13.200 --> 02:20:17.640]   It's going to be the equivalent of the Black Death in Europe, though.
[02:20:17.640 --> 02:20:18.840]   Right.
[02:20:18.840 --> 02:20:20.520]   I'm not arguing or saying you're wrong.
[02:20:20.520 --> 02:20:23.480]   I'm just trying to focus on the opportunity.
[02:20:23.480 --> 02:20:29.260]   And that as human creatures, the Black Death was horrific.
[02:20:29.260 --> 02:20:34.160]   And it did also have its knock-on effects that led to a better society.
[02:20:34.160 --> 02:20:35.160]   And so...
[02:20:35.160 --> 02:20:38.760]   What do you think a billion people was going to be dead in less than five years?
[02:20:38.760 --> 02:20:39.760]   Right.
[02:20:39.760 --> 02:20:40.760]   I'm trying, Steven.
[02:20:40.760 --> 02:20:46.840]   I'm trying desperately to drag us to the positive side, and you keep dragging me back down.
[02:20:46.840 --> 02:20:52.280]   I don't know what to do except laugh and cry.
[02:20:52.280 --> 02:20:57.600]   I don't want to spend my time contemplating the death of a billion people.
[02:20:57.600 --> 02:21:03.240]   I want to work hard to try to find solutions for perhaps the 20 to 60 people that I can
[02:21:03.240 --> 02:21:04.240]   impact near me.
[02:21:04.240 --> 02:21:05.240]   You don't understand.
[02:21:05.240 --> 02:21:06.240]   Right.
[02:21:06.240 --> 02:21:09.840]   It is pretty much going to happen.
[02:21:09.840 --> 02:21:15.200]   All of your praying, all of your positive thinking, all of our "we're going to try"
[02:21:15.200 --> 02:21:22.000]   is pretty much not going to affect the death of a billion people around the planet.
[02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:25.760]   In the next single-digit years, less than five.
[02:21:25.760 --> 02:21:29.760]   It is pretty much inevitable.
[02:21:29.760 --> 02:21:35.240]   Like I said, the domino has already been knocked over by the person coming out of the bathroom.
[02:21:35.240 --> 02:21:40.120]   And X period of time, the last one is going to hit the switch that's going to blow up
[02:21:40.120 --> 02:21:45.880]   the cat in its cage.
[02:21:45.880 --> 02:21:51.080]   People say, "Let's hope for the worst, hope for the best, and prepare for the worst."
[02:21:51.080 --> 02:21:53.520]   Well, I've got news for you.
[02:21:53.520 --> 02:22:02.280]   That cat 4 hurricane setting off the Louisiana coast going right for, what's that crap hole
[02:22:02.280 --> 02:22:03.280]   in Louisiana?
[02:22:03.280 --> 02:22:04.280]   They got flooded out.
[02:22:04.280 --> 02:22:05.280]   New Orleans.
[02:22:05.280 --> 02:22:06.280]   New Orleans.
[02:22:06.280 --> 02:22:07.280]   Okay.
[02:22:07.280 --> 02:22:09.520]   I've got news for you.
[02:22:09.520 --> 02:22:10.520]   It's hitting.
[02:22:10.520 --> 02:22:11.520]   Okay.
[02:22:11.520 --> 02:22:12.520]   In two days.
[02:22:12.520 --> 02:22:15.000]   You're not going to change it.
[02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:26.000]   And people do not, you know, you got to take that head on that this is like rolling one
[02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:28.200]   through five on a six-sided die.
[02:22:28.200 --> 02:22:34.800]   It, you know, five out of six chances that this is going to happen now.
[02:22:34.800 --> 02:22:38.600]   My original odds were 20%.
[02:22:38.600 --> 02:22:41.240]   And now everyone is going, "F you, Harris.
[02:22:41.240 --> 02:22:45.160]   Damn it, you talked about this in November and now it's all about certainty."
[02:22:45.160 --> 02:22:47.320]   And it's like, "I'm sorry.
[02:22:47.320 --> 02:22:48.400]   I predicted it.
[02:22:48.400 --> 02:22:49.640]   I talked about it.
[02:22:49.640 --> 02:22:51.400]   It didn't mean I made it happen."
[02:22:51.400 --> 02:22:59.040]   But anyways, you know, they're getting to that realization and you got to hit this,
[02:22:59.040 --> 02:23:05.580]   you know, and it's almost unfathomable, unfathomable, but you know, that is going to happen.
[02:23:05.580 --> 02:23:08.520]   And now let's talk about how to make money off of it.
[02:23:08.520 --> 02:23:10.840]   But yeah.
[02:23:10.840 --> 02:23:13.680]   Maybe it's just my, I mean, it could just be my normalcy bias.
[02:23:13.680 --> 02:23:18.800]   One of the things that I have learned over the course of the pandemic has, was that I
[02:23:18.800 --> 02:23:25.400]   thought I would be less susceptible to normalcy bias because I had spent so much time thinking
[02:23:25.400 --> 02:23:29.600]   about disaster scenarios, far more than the average person.
[02:23:29.600 --> 02:23:37.980]   And then the pandemic hit and I experienced strong normalcy bias, basically a refusal
[02:23:37.980 --> 02:23:44.120]   to believe that the worst case scenarios that I had thought were going to happen, could
[02:23:44.120 --> 02:23:45.960]   happen, were going to happen.
[02:23:45.960 --> 02:23:51.560]   And so I could be continuing to suffer under the delusion of normalcy bias.
[02:23:51.560 --> 02:23:56.520]   Yeah, there's a saying in the security business, "Security is like oxygen.
[02:23:56.520 --> 02:24:00.320]   You don't realize you need it until it's gone and then you'll pay anything to get it back
[02:24:00.320 --> 02:24:01.320]   instantly."
[02:24:01.320 --> 02:24:04.120]   It's like being locked in a big bank vault.
[02:24:04.120 --> 02:24:05.880]   You go, "Well, I'm breathing fine.
[02:24:05.880 --> 02:24:07.160]   Everything is good.
[02:24:07.160 --> 02:24:09.240]   Everything is good until it's not."
[02:24:09.240 --> 02:24:10.920]   You're still locked.
[02:24:10.920 --> 02:24:15.160]   You've been locked in the bank vault, a big one.
[02:24:15.160 --> 02:24:16.900]   You are breathing the air.
[02:24:16.900 --> 02:24:19.920]   You are going to start getting carbon dioxide poisoning.
[02:24:19.920 --> 02:24:20.920]   You actually don't run out of air.
[02:24:20.920 --> 02:24:27.740]   You actually poison yourself with very high, like five, 6% carbon dioxide.
[02:24:27.740 --> 02:24:31.960]   But yeah, you are going to run out of air and you're not going to realize it until you
[02:24:31.960 --> 02:24:33.240]   start running out of air.
[02:24:33.240 --> 02:24:39.540]   And that is not going to be for hours or days, but nevertheless, you are now in the locked
[02:24:39.540 --> 02:24:51.320]   bank vault and the inevitable has got a very high percentage point of happening to you.
[02:24:51.320 --> 02:25:00.200]   And people that normalcy bias, which is probably one of the better things about human beings,
[02:25:00.200 --> 02:25:04.320]   is that you are going to be in the bank for a long time.
[02:25:04.320 --> 02:25:07.320]   You're going to be in the bank for a long time.
[02:25:07.320 --> 02:25:10.320]   You're going to be in the bank for a long time.
[02:25:10.320 --> 02:25:13.320]   You're going to be in the bank for a long time.
[02:25:13.320 --> 02:25:16.320]   You're going to be in the bank for a long time.
[02:25:16.320 --> 02:25:19.320]   You're going to be in the bank for a long time.
[02:25:19.320 --> 02:25:22.320]   You're going to be in the bank for a long time.
[02:25:22.320 --> 02:25:25.320]   You're going to be in the bank for a long time.
[02:25:25.320 --> 02:25:28.320]   You're going to be in the bank for a long time.
[02:25:28.320 --> 02:25:35.320]   We got experience and expertise, wisdom, judgment, decision-making abilities based upon that.
[02:25:35.320 --> 02:25:38.320]   That is not an opinion.
[02:25:38.320 --> 02:25:43.320]   Now, you are free to ignore the advice that we give you.
[02:25:43.320 --> 02:25:49.320]   You can take the advice, and I very much want you to take the advice, modify it for your
[02:25:49.320 --> 02:25:53.320]   own purposes, and implement it as you see fit.
[02:25:53.320 --> 02:25:56.320]   That's what I really think you should do.
[02:25:56.320 --> 02:25:59.320]   You are absolutely free to ignore it.
[02:25:59.320 --> 02:26:02.320]   Please just put my name in your will.
[02:26:02.320 --> 02:26:08.320]   So, let's wrap up with opportunities.
[02:26:08.320 --> 02:26:11.320]   The fun stuff.
[02:26:11.320 --> 02:26:14.320]   Yeah, exactly.
[02:26:14.320 --> 02:26:17.320]   I'll just pitch it to you.
[02:26:17.320 --> 02:26:22.320]   Where do you want to focus us for the last, as we wrap up the show?
[02:26:22.320 --> 02:26:29.320]   Okay, look, by now, you either think Harris is the biggest a-hole you've ever listened
[02:26:29.320 --> 02:26:36.320]   to, or you're going, "He's got a few points," or you're like Eric and Fresno going, "He's
[02:26:36.320 --> 02:26:40.320]   back on!"
[02:26:40.320 --> 02:26:42.320]   Which I hope is the latter.
[02:26:42.320 --> 02:26:48.320]   So, if you want some of the stuff, if you think I'm saying stuff that is intelligent,
[02:26:48.320 --> 02:26:56.320]   and you want to prepare your family, the best thing you can do, let's say your rounding
[02:26:56.320 --> 02:27:04.320]   error is in, what my budget is, is well within what Josh calls your rounding error, and you
[02:27:04.320 --> 02:27:06.320]   want Harris talent.
[02:27:06.320 --> 02:27:10.320]   You're better off going to my website and getting it all for pennies on the dollar.
[02:27:10.320 --> 02:27:17.320]   Get the 101 and the 201 from all the step-by-step videos I have, and I got some really smart
[02:27:17.320 --> 02:27:24.320]   stuff, like how to put 20 years of food into a freezer, and you don't care if the power
[02:27:24.320 --> 02:27:26.320]   fails.
[02:27:26.320 --> 02:27:28.320]   That one will really warp your mind.
[02:27:28.320 --> 02:27:32.320]   People have said, "Gee, Steve, you already made preparedness so simple, and now you went
[02:27:32.320 --> 02:27:35.320]   and made it even simpler."
[02:27:35.320 --> 02:27:42.320]   You might as well go there to harris1234.com, get the classes, and go through that, and
[02:27:42.320 --> 02:27:48.320]   then make yourself a list, and now you got, like, "Hey, Steve, we want a few hours of
[02:27:48.320 --> 02:27:58.320]   your time to help our family with primary things to do, secondary, tertiary, contingency,
[02:27:58.320 --> 02:28:01.320]   just like we did the thinking for you and other people.
[02:28:01.320 --> 02:28:04.320]   We want some of that intelligence applied to us."
[02:28:04.320 --> 02:28:06.320]   Fine, we can do it, okay?
[02:28:06.320 --> 02:28:11.320]   Whether you're going to hop on a golf string and go someplace else, we can get you all
[02:28:11.320 --> 02:28:16.320]   the communications and all the planning and everything else and where and when and how
[02:28:16.320 --> 02:28:20.320]   and what at both locations you can possibly think of.
[02:28:20.320 --> 02:28:28.320]   So, anyway, go to harris1234.com, and we're going to use RPF20 for radical personal finance.
[02:28:28.320 --> 02:28:34.320]   Not RFP, RPF20, no space.
[02:28:34.320 --> 02:28:39.320]   You will get 20% off for the next couple weeks of anything you want.
[02:28:39.320 --> 02:28:45.320]   You can go up there and buy one video and go, "I love it," and you go back and get two
[02:28:45.320 --> 02:28:47.320]   more, and then you go back and get a bundle.
[02:28:47.320 --> 02:28:49.320]   You can do whatever you want.
[02:28:49.320 --> 02:28:52.320]   There's no limitations on it, okay?
[02:28:52.320 --> 02:28:57.320]   And, yes, I am supporting Josh with this.
[02:28:57.320 --> 02:29:02.320]   A portion of what you purchase is going direct -- it supports me, and it goes directly to
[02:29:02.320 --> 02:29:05.320]   support radical personal finance as well.
[02:29:05.320 --> 02:29:14.320]   I'm doing this in cooperation with him and as a thank you to him as well.
[02:29:14.320 --> 02:29:18.320]   But the stuff is cheap, and it will benefit the heck out of you.
[02:29:18.320 --> 02:29:19.320]   100% guarantee.
[02:29:19.320 --> 02:29:20.320]   You can say, "Harris, you're an idiot.
[02:29:20.320 --> 02:29:21.320]   I hate it.
[02:29:21.320 --> 02:29:22.320]   Your stuff is horrible.
[02:29:22.320 --> 02:29:24.320]   Give me my money back."
[02:29:24.320 --> 02:29:25.320]   It's like, "Okay, fine."
[02:29:25.320 --> 02:29:27.320]   It's just money.
[02:29:27.320 --> 02:29:32.320]   It's, you know, the most common -- the most available commodity in the world is money.
[02:29:32.320 --> 02:29:36.320]   It's also the most worthless commodity in the world is money.
[02:29:36.320 --> 02:29:40.320]   So giving you back your money is not the problem.
[02:29:40.320 --> 02:29:42.320]   So RPF20.
[02:29:42.320 --> 02:29:44.320]   Now, I have something out there.
[02:29:44.320 --> 02:29:50.320]   If you want your mind melted again after you've gone through my free podcast, I have -- you've
[02:29:50.320 --> 02:29:56.320]   had this, Josh -- the three real methods of wealth creation, okay, from me, okay, which
[02:29:56.320 --> 02:30:02.320]   is how you take things that are outside of the GDP and you put them into what I call
[02:30:02.320 --> 02:30:05.320]   the real GDP, okay?
[02:30:05.320 --> 02:30:10.320]   And you're not going to find this on Google at all, anywhere.
[02:30:10.320 --> 02:30:13.320]   And it's not what you think it is either.
[02:30:13.320 --> 02:30:18.320]   But, you know, it's like what five or six words would you have to say about this three
[02:30:18.320 --> 02:30:20.320]   real methods of wealth creation class?
[02:30:20.320 --> 02:30:26.320]   I listened to it before you ever made it a product and we talked about it.
[02:30:26.320 --> 02:30:29.320]   And I thought it was excellent.
[02:30:29.320 --> 02:30:32.320]   It was something that was genuinely new to me that I had never thought of.
[02:30:32.320 --> 02:30:38.320]   And that's from someone who has not consumed everything, but I have read hundreds and hundreds
[02:30:38.320 --> 02:30:41.320]   of books on wealth building and listened to a lot of people.
[02:30:41.320 --> 02:30:47.320]   And I thought it was genuinely unique and an interesting way to look at the world and
[02:30:47.320 --> 02:30:49.320]   look at the aspects of wealth creation.
[02:30:49.320 --> 02:30:55.320]   So I thought it was genuinely good and unique and it's been filed away in the back of my
[02:30:55.320 --> 02:30:56.320]   brain.
[02:30:56.320 --> 02:31:04.320]   I haven't figured out how to actually implement it in detail, but I love having it there as
[02:31:04.320 --> 02:31:05.320]   part of my mental framework.
[02:31:05.320 --> 02:31:08.320]   And it's something I've never talked about on the show either.
[02:31:08.320 --> 02:31:11.320]   I got the Harris potential scoring system.
[02:31:11.320 --> 02:31:15.320]   So you don't score based on priorities of what you want to do.
[02:31:15.320 --> 02:31:20.320]   You score based upon the potential something has for you to decide what you do next.
[02:31:20.320 --> 02:31:28.320]   And I got a 63 item scoring system that you apply to every idea or thing that you want
[02:31:28.320 --> 02:31:29.320]   to do.
[02:31:29.320 --> 02:31:32.320]   You can pick the ones that you want or use them all or whatever you want.
[02:31:32.320 --> 02:31:37.320]   But when you put them all together and you look at it, this is a video, the wealth creation
[02:31:37.320 --> 02:31:39.320]   three real methods is just audio.
[02:31:39.320 --> 02:31:46.320]   So once your eyes have been blown open by the wealth creation class, you got so many
[02:31:46.320 --> 02:31:51.320]   ideas you want to go to the potential scoring system to decide what to do next.
[02:31:51.320 --> 02:31:53.320]   And you go, ah, I do it.
[02:31:53.320 --> 02:31:56.320]   That is, I've literally did this myself.
[02:31:56.320 --> 02:32:01.320]   And something a mentor of mine taught me that I have then extrapolated out further.
[02:32:01.320 --> 02:32:09.320]   I did this over a year ago and I'm doing successful things today based upon me doing this for
[02:32:09.320 --> 02:32:13.320]   myself last May.
[02:32:13.320 --> 02:32:19.320]   And I went out in the middle of nowhere for two weeks with my cat, my trailer and my power
[02:32:19.320 --> 02:32:21.320]   and my communications.
[02:32:21.320 --> 02:32:23.320]   And I just sat there.
[02:32:23.320 --> 02:32:26.320]   I went through 110 things.
[02:32:26.320 --> 02:32:28.320]   I only had 29 points scoring system.
[02:32:28.320 --> 02:32:31.320]   Then now it's like 63.
[02:32:31.320 --> 02:32:33.320]   But that's how you implement.
[02:32:33.320 --> 02:32:35.320]   That's how you decide what you want to implement.
[02:32:35.320 --> 02:32:40.320]   A good example is like it might be a priority for you to mow your grass because your significant
[02:32:40.320 --> 02:32:45.320]   other or will either yell at you or the city or your neighbors will bitch at you or the
[02:32:45.320 --> 02:32:46.320]   city will give you a fine.
[02:32:46.320 --> 02:32:49.320]   So it's a high priority for you to mow your grass.
[02:32:49.320 --> 02:32:55.320]   Now, unless you're Harris, you're making cellulistic ethanol off of your grass or your Josh and
[02:32:55.320 --> 02:32:58.320]   you're feeding it to your rabbits to make it into food.
[02:32:58.320 --> 02:33:00.320]   There is no potential.
[02:33:00.320 --> 02:33:04.320]   It's got zero potential to your life mowing the grass.
[02:33:04.320 --> 02:33:13.320]   It is a waste of time unless you want it for the exercise versus like reading Peter Zion's
[02:33:13.320 --> 02:33:16.320]   book or anything else on Joshua Sheets's reading book.
[02:33:16.320 --> 02:33:19.320]   That's got a lot of potential to you in the future.
[02:33:19.320 --> 02:33:24.320]   You're listening to this podcast right now, not because it's a priority, because it's
[02:33:24.320 --> 02:33:26.320]   got potential for you.
[02:33:26.320 --> 02:33:28.320]   That's why you're listening to this.
[02:33:28.320 --> 02:33:30.320]   So there's the potential class.
[02:33:30.320 --> 02:33:36.320]   But anyways, if you'd want just the three real methods of wealth creation class, if
[02:33:36.320 --> 02:33:43.320]   you use money seven, M-O-N-E-Y seven, you'll get it for seven bucks.
[02:33:43.320 --> 02:33:45.320]   Download it right then and there.
[02:33:45.320 --> 02:33:46.320]   Listen to it online.
[02:33:46.320 --> 02:33:47.320]   You name it.
[02:33:47.320 --> 02:33:50.320]   It's yours right then and there for seven bucks.
[02:33:50.320 --> 02:33:54.320]   Normally, I think it's twenty nine or thirty nine.
[02:33:54.320 --> 02:34:02.320]   But just only if you like really perverted thinking, you go, holy cow, I didn't realize
[02:34:02.320 --> 02:34:04.320]   that, then go get it.
[02:34:04.320 --> 02:34:13.320]   But my podcast or Harris1234.com, I'll put links to those or type in Stephen Harris,
[02:34:13.320 --> 02:34:21.320]   Science and Technology into your favorite podcast, Engine, Fountains, Picture, iTunes,
[02:34:21.320 --> 02:34:25.320]   iPod, Google Play, whatever.
[02:34:25.320 --> 02:34:27.320]   It's across all those.
[02:34:27.320 --> 02:34:30.320]   I copied everything that Josh did.
[02:34:30.320 --> 02:34:31.320]   Thank you, Josh.
[02:34:31.320 --> 02:34:34.320]   My pleasure.
[02:34:34.320 --> 02:34:40.320]   We need people who, one of the biggest opportunities we have today is the opportunity for people
[02:34:40.320 --> 02:34:48.320]   who are learned and people who are learned to share their wisdom with others.
[02:34:48.320 --> 02:35:01.320]   One of the great tragedies of past times is that huge vast amounts of knowledge, wisdom
[02:35:01.320 --> 02:35:07.320]   and experience have been lost to us as people have passed away.
[02:35:07.320 --> 02:35:10.320]   There are things that were once simple that we can't do today.
[02:35:10.320 --> 02:35:15.320]   You could look at a funny example of how did they make the pyramids or how did they make
[02:35:15.320 --> 02:35:16.320]   Machu Picchu.
[02:35:16.320 --> 02:35:20.320]   How did they drill these rocks perfectly straight?
[02:35:20.320 --> 02:35:22.320]   Well, that was lost to us as far as the techniques.
[02:35:22.320 --> 02:35:26.320]   Or you could come to much more recent of the knowledge that our grandmother had about how
[02:35:26.320 --> 02:35:27.320]   to do something.
[02:35:27.320 --> 02:35:33.320]   What's the name of the guy that did the front lawn and backyard gardening thing again?
[02:35:33.320 --> 02:35:34.320]   Curtis Stone.
[02:35:34.320 --> 02:35:40.320]   Okay, let's say Curtis Stone switched over, did everything, redid everything in six months
[02:35:40.320 --> 02:35:42.320]   and did nothing but calorie crops.
[02:35:42.320 --> 02:35:43.320]   Okay.
[02:35:43.320 --> 02:35:46.320]   And he made a YouTube video about it.
[02:35:46.320 --> 02:35:53.320]   And then one person like say Elon Musk, he's got 101 million followers.
[02:35:53.320 --> 02:35:54.320]   Okay.
[02:35:54.320 --> 02:36:01.320]   Let's say he tweets to 100 million Twitters, which would be what, 25 people?
[02:36:01.320 --> 02:36:02.320]   Real people?
[02:36:02.320 --> 02:36:03.320]   No.
[02:36:03.320 --> 02:36:04.320]   Okay.
[02:36:04.320 --> 02:36:15.320]   Let's say 20 million real people read and understand that tweet he sent to 100 million
[02:36:15.320 --> 02:36:16.320]   people or entities.
[02:36:16.320 --> 02:36:17.320]   Okay.
[02:36:17.320 --> 02:36:26.320]   And 20 million people go to YouTube and watch Curtis Stone growing squash and potatoes and
[02:36:26.320 --> 02:36:32.320]   sweet potatoes and everything you need to feed yourself and your neighbors.
[02:36:32.320 --> 02:36:34.320]   That's like, I got so many potatoes.
[02:36:34.320 --> 02:36:38.320]   Everyone come and pick them up for free.
[02:36:38.320 --> 02:36:48.320]   One person tweeting one thing to one piece of knowledge that is digested and like 15
[02:36:48.320 --> 02:36:53.320]   to 30 minutes or less, or it may be that 15 minutes goes.
[02:36:53.320 --> 02:36:57.320]   If you want the full class, go watch this video for three hours.
[02:36:57.320 --> 02:37:07.320]   One person can implement what Churchill tried to do with Victory Gardens and the BBC.
[02:37:07.320 --> 02:37:18.320]   One person can instantly, one learned person can instantly take tens of millions or hundreds
[02:37:18.320 --> 02:37:24.320]   of millions who weren't learned and make them learned in hours.
[02:37:24.320 --> 02:37:25.320]   Right.
[02:37:25.320 --> 02:37:28.320]   Now that is like a mind blowing concept.
[02:37:28.320 --> 02:37:31.320]   That's something we talk about lost knowledge.
[02:37:31.320 --> 02:37:38.320]   Well, I mean, lost knowledge is one thing, but they couldn't do that.
[02:37:38.320 --> 02:37:39.320]   No, no.
[02:37:39.320 --> 02:37:40.320]   Okay.
[02:37:40.320 --> 02:37:45.320]   This is a unique time in history and this is only going to advance quicker.
[02:37:45.320 --> 02:37:46.320]   Right.
[02:37:46.320 --> 02:37:51.320]   But I mean, the magicalness of that is like beyond exception.
[02:37:51.320 --> 02:37:52.320]   Right.
[02:37:52.320 --> 02:37:57.320]   And it's one of the many things that fills me with hope because then the knowledge is
[02:37:57.320 --> 02:38:02.320]   out there and as we get better and better at searching technology, archiving, etc.,
[02:38:02.320 --> 02:38:09.320]   we can dramatically improve the well-being of our billions of neighbors around the world.
[02:38:09.320 --> 02:38:12.320]   You're still after my personal library, aren't you?
[02:38:12.320 --> 02:38:13.320]   I am.
[02:38:13.320 --> 02:38:18.320]   I am still after it because it's only 40 terabytes.
[02:38:18.320 --> 02:38:22.320]   I am still after it because it makes all the difference in the world.
[02:38:22.320 --> 02:38:28.320]   The knowledge and then the application and what human brains are brilliant at is taking
[02:38:28.320 --> 02:38:31.320]   is building on the work of others.
[02:38:31.320 --> 02:38:35.320]   You talked about the Haber-Bosch process, right?
[02:38:35.320 --> 02:38:39.320]   You have one person does one thing, another person comes along and tweaks it and that's
[02:38:39.320 --> 02:38:43.320]   how we grow as human beings and as we build the world of the future, we need more and
[02:38:43.320 --> 02:38:45.320]   more of that.
[02:38:45.320 --> 02:38:52.320]   Speaking of which, someone was asking me, "Oh, the guy who invented explosives and everything
[02:38:52.320 --> 02:38:56.320]   else, did he win a Nobel Prize?"
[02:38:56.320 --> 02:38:59.320]   I go, "No, his name was Nobel.
[02:38:59.320 --> 02:39:03.320]   He's the one who created the endowment for the prize."
[02:39:03.320 --> 02:39:04.320]   Yep.
[02:39:04.320 --> 02:39:05.320]   Yep.
[02:39:05.320 --> 02:39:06.320]   Absolutely.
[02:39:06.320 --> 02:39:14.320]   Because I was talking about what makes us live here this long is not just the food production.
[02:39:14.320 --> 02:39:26.320]   The three real drivers are antibiotics, what Fleming did, he won a Nobel, fresh water treatment,
[02:39:26.320 --> 02:39:31.320]   well water, city water, and removal waste is what has gotten us to live this long.
[02:39:31.320 --> 02:39:37.320]   Now, you talk about your friends died in Africa because the price of the fuel went up for
[02:39:37.320 --> 02:39:43.320]   the transportation of the food plus the inflation made the food more expensive plus the transportation
[02:39:43.320 --> 02:39:50.320]   of the food that they couldn't afford that they died of starvation from, right?
[02:39:50.320 --> 02:39:55.320]   Well, what if you got 60 people in a village in Africa?
[02:39:55.320 --> 02:39:58.320]   I know it's a simplification, but I'll do it.
[02:39:58.320 --> 02:40:05.320]   So you got 60 people in a village in Africa and they got one well and that well runs on
[02:40:05.320 --> 02:40:12.320]   one gallon of gasoline or two gallons of gasoline a week and they run it once a day for a half
[02:40:12.320 --> 02:40:17.320]   hour to bring up fresh water for everyone for the day, okay?
[02:40:17.320 --> 02:40:25.320]   Now, the number one killer of people across the planet, other than stupidity, is intestinal-borne
[02:40:25.320 --> 02:40:29.320]   diseases from drinking surface-contaminated water.
[02:40:29.320 --> 02:40:35.320]   And that's what, so if that village, it's like how much do people make in Africa a day?
[02:40:35.320 --> 02:40:42.320]   I mean, it's literally measured pre-inflation to like 50 cents or a dollar a day, right?
[02:40:42.320 --> 02:40:44.320]   It's extremely low, yeah.
[02:40:44.320 --> 02:40:45.320]   Yeah.
[02:40:45.320 --> 02:40:52.320]   So, I mean, if your fuel price goes from, if your delivered fuel price in remote Africa
[02:40:52.320 --> 02:41:03.320]   went from $4 a week for that gallon of gas to $50 and that village can no longer afford
[02:41:03.320 --> 02:41:09.320]   that fresh water from the well that's like 80 feet down, run by the gasoline engine that
[02:41:09.320 --> 02:41:18.320]   pumps the water, and now they're all going to surface water, like ditch water and rainwater,
[02:41:18.320 --> 02:41:24.320]   not purified groundwater that was purified by the filtration method and time and everything
[02:41:24.320 --> 02:41:31.320]   going through the earth, what did you just do to the health and the intestinal infection
[02:41:31.320 --> 02:41:33.320]   rate of those people?
[02:41:33.320 --> 02:41:38.320]   I mean, the reason the Chinese used to live so much longer than the rest of the world,
[02:41:38.320 --> 02:41:44.320]   like the Eastern European, was because they drank tea as their primary source of water.
[02:41:44.320 --> 02:41:47.320]   And what do you do to tea to make tea?
[02:41:47.320 --> 02:41:48.320]   You pasteurize it.
[02:41:48.320 --> 02:41:49.320]   Heat it or boil it.
[02:41:49.320 --> 02:41:55.320]   You heat it or boil it, and that pasteurizes it, which is the same reason why they landed
[02:41:55.320 --> 02:42:02.320]   at Plymouth Rock on the ship was because they ran out of beer, because they didn't know
[02:42:02.320 --> 02:42:09.320]   have germ theory, but they knew if they drank beer, which was like a light ale, that they
[02:42:09.320 --> 02:42:10.320]   didn't get sick.
[02:42:10.320 --> 02:42:15.320]   And if you go to Feeding Nelson's Navy, which was a book written, I think in like 1820,
[02:42:15.320 --> 02:42:21.320]   it was about feeding the British Navy from like 1740 to 1810.
[02:42:21.320 --> 02:42:23.320]   They had like 12 major components.
[02:42:23.320 --> 02:42:27.320]   They carried food components with no refrigeration on the boat.
[02:42:27.320 --> 02:42:35.320]   And this was 750 men at sea for six months, no land, doing like 6,000 calories a day.
[02:42:35.320 --> 02:42:41.320]   They carried four times the beer that they did water because they knew if they drank
[02:42:41.320 --> 02:42:48.320]   beer for hydration, you know, there's a certain level of alcohol that dehydrates you, but
[02:42:48.320 --> 02:42:51.320]   low alcohol beer does not dehydrate you.
[02:42:51.320 --> 02:42:53.320]   It hydrates you.
[02:42:53.320 --> 02:42:57.320]   They knew that they could drink that safely, but the water might make them sick.
[02:42:57.320 --> 02:43:03.320]   So the water was used for other forms of cooking and/or drinking, et cetera, or, you know,
[02:43:03.320 --> 02:43:05.320]   what they needed fresh water for.
[02:43:05.320 --> 02:43:13.320]   But their water consumption was in the form of beer because they had to boil the wort
[02:43:13.320 --> 02:43:19.320]   in order to, you know, to add and add, to malt the barley, to add it in, to do the
[02:43:19.320 --> 02:43:23.320]   acidification, to do the fermentation, to make the beer.
[02:43:23.320 --> 02:43:26.320]   And, you know, thus it got purified.
[02:43:26.320 --> 02:43:29.320]   So, you know, we talk about taking food away.
[02:43:29.320 --> 02:43:31.320]   Well, what if we take that energy away?
[02:43:31.320 --> 02:43:37.320]   As Art Robinson says, there are people being held up on the bottom ladder of life.
[02:43:37.320 --> 02:43:46.320]   The lowest rung of the ladder that is life is being held up by affordable access to energy.
[02:43:46.320 --> 02:43:54.320]   And the most simplistic example is, you know, that gallon of gasoline for a week to run
[02:43:54.320 --> 02:43:59.320]   the motor that runs the fresh water well for the entire village.
[02:43:59.320 --> 02:44:02.320]   And you go, well, why can't they just use solar power?
[02:44:02.320 --> 02:44:09.320]   It's like you got no understanding of energy economics in order to, you know, in order
[02:44:09.320 --> 02:44:15.320]   to make that statement at this time in 2022 history.
[02:44:15.320 --> 02:44:23.320]   But, yeah, I mean, that can, I mean, that can kill a lot more than inflation and food
[02:44:23.320 --> 02:44:29.320]   and, you know, you start messing with people's water and the quality of the water, you can
[02:44:29.320 --> 02:44:31.320]   kill an awful lot of people.
[02:44:31.320 --> 02:44:35.320]   I mean, we're talking about controlling food to kill people, well, control water to kill
[02:44:35.320 --> 02:44:37.320]   people, and you can do a lot more.
[02:44:37.320 --> 02:44:38.320]   Absolutely.
[02:44:38.320 --> 02:44:39.320]   Absolutely.
[02:44:39.320 --> 02:44:41.320]   On a positive note.
[02:44:41.320 --> 02:44:42.320]   Yeah.
[02:44:42.320 --> 02:44:49.320]   God, we've gone down some great rabbit holes, hit some great discussions and gone completely
[02:44:49.320 --> 02:44:54.320]   off script, which is some of the best things about doing RPF with you.
[02:44:54.320 --> 02:44:57.320]   And I love it.
[02:44:57.320 --> 02:44:58.320]   Thanks so much.
[02:44:58.320 --> 02:44:59.320]   So go to Harris1234.com.
[02:44:59.320 --> 02:45:00.320]   Yeah, Harris1234.com.
[02:45:00.320 --> 02:45:06.320]   And let me ask you a question.
[02:45:06.320 --> 02:45:15.320]   Why are we having 10% per month inflation and gold and silver haven't moved?
[02:45:15.320 --> 02:45:23.320]   It's a good question.
[02:45:23.320 --> 02:45:27.820]   But there have been excellent, there have been excellent analysts for a very long time
[02:45:27.820 --> 02:45:35.560]   who have said that gold and silver are not a good, anyway, they're not perfect inflation
[02:45:35.560 --> 02:45:36.560]   hedges.
[02:45:36.560 --> 02:45:41.560]   I would say the first question would be, is it the fact that gold and silver hasn't moved
[02:45:41.560 --> 02:45:45.920]   on the spot price, or is it the fact that gold and silver hasn't moved on the physical
[02:45:45.920 --> 02:45:46.920]   price that you bring to the local market?
[02:45:46.920 --> 02:45:47.920]   Right.
[02:45:47.920 --> 02:45:52.240]   The real price is the price to acquire, not the spot price.
[02:45:52.240 --> 02:45:55.200]   The spot price of gold and silver is unreliable.
[02:45:55.200 --> 02:46:00.600]   As an indicator, you have to go with what you can actually get in your hand from a local
[02:46:00.600 --> 02:46:01.600]   dealer.
[02:46:01.600 --> 02:46:09.040]   A friend of mine, after he read my report, in January, started buying freeze-dried food,
[02:46:09.040 --> 02:46:12.680]   Mountain House, all of the different ones.
[02:46:12.680 --> 02:46:17.760]   He goes, this is the preparedness for myself and my family and everything else.
[02:46:17.760 --> 02:46:21.560]   The value of it has tripled from when he bought it.
[02:46:21.560 --> 02:46:28.760]   And he goes, well, either we'll end up eating it, or I'll end up selling it, or selling
[02:46:28.760 --> 02:46:29.760]   it and eating it.
[02:46:29.760 --> 02:46:33.160]   He goes, this is by far a better investment.
[02:46:33.160 --> 02:46:38.280]   It's light, it's cheap, I can eat it, which you can't do with gold or silver.
[02:46:38.280 --> 02:46:44.360]   It's light, it's cheap, it's tradable, it's edible, it's good for 30 years.
[02:46:44.360 --> 02:46:48.800]   And it was his investment of choice.
[02:46:48.800 --> 02:46:55.880]   He just took some money, and he kept on, like Bitcoin, he kept on throwing it at it, getting
[02:46:55.880 --> 02:47:05.000]   in cases of it, I mean, like box cases, not quite pallets, he's got pallets of it.
[02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:09.760]   And for $1 million, I will tell you where he lives.
[02:47:09.760 --> 02:47:17.240]   Anyways, and so he has used that as very legitimate.
[02:47:17.240 --> 02:47:24.040]   I got a full chest freezer that can do freeze-drying.
[02:47:24.040 --> 02:47:28.280]   And I've been trying to get someone to take it off my hands, and so I could show them
[02:47:28.280 --> 02:47:31.840]   how to do freeze-drying since 2019.
[02:47:31.840 --> 02:47:34.680]   And I've had like no takers.
[02:47:34.680 --> 02:47:38.720]   I mean, if anyone wants to start a freeze-drying business, we can do it.
[02:47:38.720 --> 02:47:44.360]   Oh, yeah, I mean, you know, they got those little Harvest Rite ones, they're like $3,500
[02:47:44.360 --> 02:47:45.360]   each.
[02:47:45.360 --> 02:47:50.760]   And I know God's gift, a cookie named Sonia, she's done miracles.
[02:47:50.760 --> 02:47:51.760]   She's got two of them.
[02:47:51.760 --> 02:47:55.920]   I mean, they've been running all the time for four years.
[02:47:55.920 --> 02:48:01.320]   But I mean, I got it on a much larger scale, because I understand the chemistry of the
[02:48:01.320 --> 02:48:02.600]   whole process.
[02:48:02.600 --> 02:48:06.920]   And I have a cryogenic freezer and a vacuum pump.
[02:48:06.920 --> 02:48:12.000]   And so I can get to minus 16, I can pull a vacuum and sublimate the water out, and then
[02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:15.000]   we can make freeze-dried food.
[02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:19.520]   But it's just been like, you know, I've been laying it down.
[02:48:19.520 --> 02:48:21.560]   There's a lot of people listening to this.
[02:48:21.560 --> 02:48:25.680]   It's like, I mean, how many people have we been laying it down for for 30 years have
[02:48:25.680 --> 02:48:26.680]   not picked it up?
[02:48:26.680 --> 02:48:27.680]   Right.
[02:48:27.680 --> 02:48:28.680]   That's true.
[02:48:28.680 --> 02:48:29.680]   Absolutely true.
[02:48:29.680 --> 02:48:30.680]   All right.
[02:48:30.680 --> 02:48:33.160]   We do it for the 1% that do.
[02:48:33.160 --> 02:48:34.160]   That's always what it is.
[02:48:34.160 --> 02:48:35.400]   It's always 1%.
[02:48:35.400 --> 02:48:40.760]   Every time I start a talk, when I talk to teenagers or present a class in person, I
[02:48:40.760 --> 02:48:43.360]   start every talk with, "I'm about to give you some good ideas."
[02:48:43.360 --> 02:48:48.320]   Basically, but I know that it's going to be a complete waste of time, because the vast
[02:48:48.320 --> 02:48:49.960]   majority are going to do nothing with it.
[02:48:49.960 --> 02:48:54.080]   But for those of you who do, I'm going to give you something really useful here.
[02:48:54.080 --> 02:48:58.960]   And if I was a college professor, I'd walk in on the first day, I go, "Everyone here
[02:48:58.960 --> 02:49:00.760]   has an A automatically.
[02:49:00.760 --> 02:49:02.680]   You all have A's.
[02:49:02.680 --> 02:49:05.080]   Anyone who doesn't want to be here, leave now.
[02:49:05.080 --> 02:49:06.080]   You'll still have an A."
[02:49:06.080 --> 02:49:08.080]   It's like, "Oh, okay.
[02:49:08.080 --> 02:49:11.080]   Well, the eight people that are left, we're going to have a lot of fun.
[02:49:11.080 --> 02:49:12.440]   You're going to learn something."
[02:49:12.440 --> 02:49:13.440]   Much more productive.
[02:49:13.440 --> 02:49:19.720]   All right, if you want to talk to Steven about any particular needs of yours or of his chest
[02:49:19.720 --> 02:49:24.160]   freezer, freeze dryer, Steven@Harris1234.com.
[02:49:24.160 --> 02:49:30.160]   Steven, S-T-E-V-E-N @Harris, H-A-R-R-I-S, 1234.com.
[02:49:30.160 --> 02:49:31.160]   1234.com.
[02:49:31.160 --> 02:49:32.160]   I'll put the podcast.
[02:49:32.160 --> 02:49:33.160]   Or Harris1234.com.
[02:49:33.160 --> 02:49:40.840]   Use code RPF20, RPF20 to save 20% on all of his classes there.
[02:49:40.840 --> 02:49:45.080]   And to get the Wealth Creation class using Money7.
[02:49:45.080 --> 02:49:46.080]   That's also at Harris1234.com.
[02:49:46.080 --> 02:49:47.080]   Steven, is that right?
[02:49:47.080 --> 02:49:49.960]   Steven: Yeah, that Money7 is there.
[02:49:49.960 --> 02:49:54.680]   The Wealth Creation class of the three real methods of wealth creation from absolutely
[02:49:54.680 --> 02:50:00.360]   perverted historical thinking is up there, but that's not the real – it's up there.
[02:50:00.360 --> 02:50:03.160]   That's not the actual title, but it's close.
[02:50:03.160 --> 02:50:07.360]   Yeah, go there and you'll be supporting me.
[02:50:07.360 --> 02:50:09.440]   You'll be supporting Josh.
[02:50:09.440 --> 02:50:13.000]   You'll be supporting – really, screw us, okay?
[02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:14.000]   Support yourself.
[02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:23.320]   I mean, go there because you want the knowledge of it for your own personal self.
[02:50:23.320 --> 02:50:24.320]   You can call me.
[02:50:24.320 --> 02:50:27.320]   It's like, "Harris, here at AHO, I want a refund."
[02:50:27.320 --> 02:50:30.800]   It's like, "You bought 432?"
[02:50:30.800 --> 02:50:33.400]   One that's hard to do on my website.
[02:50:33.400 --> 02:50:37.000]   It's hard to get that much stuff in the cart on my website.
[02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:41.720]   It's like, "Okay, fine.
[02:50:41.720 --> 02:50:44.840]   You got nothing to lose.
[02:50:44.840 --> 02:50:49.880]   You got the world to gain, but like I said, you want some perverted thinking for your
[02:50:49.880 --> 02:50:58.360]   rounding error for your family, we can do it worldwide by ship, by plane, by hook or
[02:50:58.360 --> 02:51:03.160]   by crook, or in the middle of nowhere on the 100th floor.
[02:51:03.160 --> 02:51:07.440]   Sometimes the 100th floor of an apartment is actually easier than being on the ground
[02:51:07.440 --> 02:51:16.400]   in the city, but we can absolutely do it for you.
[02:51:16.400 --> 02:51:20.800]   I think one of the things you said about the idea of having multiple locations around the
[02:51:20.800 --> 02:51:27.120]   world, so it's like we're going to go to Montana in the summertime and we're going to go down
[02:51:27.120 --> 02:51:33.520]   to Panama City in the wintertime, is really smart thinking and everything else.
[02:51:33.520 --> 02:51:36.440]   The nice thing is you can actually drive between the two of them.
[02:51:36.440 --> 02:51:43.480]   Tom: I am convinced that for many people, it is one of the best solutions that exists
[02:51:43.480 --> 02:51:46.920]   to many of the problems that people face.
[02:51:46.920 --> 02:51:58.520]   Let me flat out say, Andrew Henderson of his YouTube channel, he was like, "Oh, I've stocked
[02:51:58.520 --> 02:52:00.240]   my pantry and everything else."
[02:52:00.240 --> 02:52:01.800]   It's like he doesn't get it.
[02:52:01.800 --> 02:52:03.680]   You guys don't understand.
[02:52:03.680 --> 02:52:10.560]   When the harvest is gone and the next planting is not for four months, and then another six
[02:52:10.560 --> 02:52:14.280]   months of harvest, there is no more to get.
[02:52:14.280 --> 02:52:17.160]   It's like running out of moon dust on the earth.
[02:52:17.160 --> 02:52:21.200]   You got to go all the way back to the moon to get it and come back.
[02:52:21.200 --> 02:52:27.720]   That takes a Saturn V or a Starship to do it.
[02:52:27.720 --> 02:52:28.720]   People don't understand.
[02:52:28.720 --> 02:52:33.960]   Once it's gone, it's gone until the next season.
[02:52:33.960 --> 02:52:36.480]   Dave: Right, that's true.
[02:52:36.480 --> 02:52:42.320]   On this particular topic, I dearly hope, Stephen, that you are completely wrong and that a year
[02:52:42.320 --> 02:52:48.040]   from now we're laughing at some silly mistake that you made or I made in our thinking.
[02:52:48.040 --> 02:52:52.920]   Stephen: Let me tell you what my father used to tell me.
[02:52:52.920 --> 02:52:57.560]   My late father, he goes, "We were talking about safety and bicycle riding, going across
[02:52:57.560 --> 02:52:58.560]   streets and stuff."
[02:52:58.560 --> 02:53:03.120]   It's like, "Well, I got the right to the right away and everything else."
[02:53:03.120 --> 02:53:05.960]   He goes, "Yeah, you can be dead right."
[02:53:05.960 --> 02:53:08.800]   Dave: It's true.
[02:53:08.800 --> 02:53:12.640]   I hope that you're wrong, but I want to make sure that we take it seriously and that we
[02:53:12.640 --> 02:53:18.760]   do all we can to warn people and help people to understand about what's going on and to
[02:53:18.760 --> 02:53:19.760]   prepare accordingly.
[02:53:19.760 --> 02:53:21.160]   Thank you for coming on the show today.

[02:53:22.160 --> 02:53:27.840]   Stephen: Josh, thanks again.
[02:53:27.840 --> 02:53:37.440]   We got to do it more often than just do unconscious, competent dumps.
[02:53:37.440 --> 02:53:41.760]   There's so much radical finance we can get into with what's coming up.
[02:53:41.760 --> 02:53:42.760]   It's unimaginable.
[02:53:42.760 --> 02:53:48.120]   From primary smelting to lights out manufacturing.
[02:53:48.120 --> 02:53:53.480]   If you're a generation Xer, as Peter Zion says, now is your time.
[02:53:53.480 --> 02:53:55.440]   Josh: Absolutely.
[02:53:55.440 --> 02:53:56.680]   Absolutely.
