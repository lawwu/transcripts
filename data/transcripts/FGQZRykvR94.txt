[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.800]   - We're back one more time with guest Don Carson,
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.560]   and one of the things that impresses me
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.040]   about you and your ministry is your eagerness
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.360]   to share the gospel on college campuses.
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.920]   And given the difficulty of communicating
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.040]   biblical truth to post-moderns,
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.960]   here's my question for you,
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.920]   and it's a question we get quite frequently
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.180]   from listeners and from ministers, and it's this.
[00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.240]   Is it possible to explain original sin
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.400]   to an audience of non-Christian college students
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.400]   without appealing to biblical evidence?
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.360]   How would you do it?
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.080]   Where would you begin?
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.280]   And do you sense this challenge yourself?
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.440]   - The hardest thing to get across
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.360]   on a university campus today is the nature of sin, by far.
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.920]   If you start talking about the Trinity,
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.560]   or the incarnation, or the resurrection of Christ,
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.520]   and you explain as best you can
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.680]   in the time you've got what you mean,
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.620]   then the people who are biblically literate there
[00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.380]   will say, "Oh, is that what Christians believe?"
[00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.380]   Well, that's pretty weird.
[00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.500]   But yeah, I understand what you're saying,
[00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.960]   and they're not gonna push back on it, particularly.
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.640]   The people who ask the hardest questions
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.580]   at those sorts of meetings are not the non-Christians.
[00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.340]   They don't know enough to ask the tough questions.
[00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.540]   They're the Christians who show up
[00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.900]   and then try to use that forum
[00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.700]   to get their theological questions answered,
[00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.240]   which is not the best forum.
[00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.600]   But if you start talking at all about sin and evil,
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.940]   then you get immediate pushback.
[00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.640]   To my mind, one of the best ways of tackling that
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.600]   is to begin with idolatry.
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.480]   Idolatry involves betrayal.
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.780]   It involves the de-godding of God.
[00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.920]   Begin with the Bible storyline, and God made us.
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.840]   And because he made us, therefore we owe him.
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.000]   And to think that we don't owe him is already betrayal.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.520]   He knows what is best for us.
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.520]   So that sin is portrayed, first of all, as insult to God,
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.020]   as the de-godding of God, as the erection of other gods,
[00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.840]   as a form of selfishness.
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.840]   So that I find that many biblically illiterate,
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.860]   contemporary 2030-somethings can understand
[00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.500]   and sympathize with.
[00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.500]   They might not agree with you,
[00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.100]   but they understand it as a category
[00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.260]   more quickly than sin as transgression of law.
[00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.980]   Now, obviously, in a full-orbed biblical doctrine of sin,
[00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.340]   sooner or later you have to talk about idolatry
[00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.180]   and the fall and transgression of law
[00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.720]   and a bunch of other categories, too,
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.260]   falling short of the grace of God,
[00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.860]   of the glory of God, and many other things.
[00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.300]   But if you're talking about a place to start,
[00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.860]   then what I do is start often with the nature of idolatry
[00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.420]   and show how idolatry involves
[00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:58.900]   not only loving bad things,
[00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.500]   but loving good things to the point
[00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.240]   that they become God for you,
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.340]   because that's betraying God.
[00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.940]   That's making a false God.
[00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.460]   And that means your heart is following something
[00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.260]   that should not claim ultimate value.
[00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.500]   And so to begin, I mean, I've often preached Genesis 3
[00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.660]   in university campuses.
[00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.220]   And the people who give me most stick for it
[00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.780]   are rarely the non-Christians.
[00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.060]   They see the point right away.
[00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.820]   It's sometimes the Christians who want me to answer
[00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.920]   all of their technical questions
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.140]   and miss the big storyline.
[00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.820]   So that's where I go.
[00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.860]   I mean, ultimately, if you have enough time
[00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.500]   in the context of a local congregation
[00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.300]   where you have both Christians and non-Christians and so on,
[00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:42.860]   then you've got to unpack sin
[00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.500]   in its many, many different dimensions.
[00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.940]   It's helpful too to give some books to people.
[00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.620]   Cornelius' "Planting" is not the way it's supposed to be.
[00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.440]   For serious readers, it's not a bad place to begin.
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.500]   The book of essays edited by Robert Peterson
[00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.180]   and Chris Morgan called "Fallon"
[00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.740]   is not a bad place to begin as well,
[00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.700]   if you're dealing with people who are serious readers.
[00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.340]   But for people who are biblically illiterate,
[00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.020]   those books are usually too advanced.
[00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.040]   And in my view, it's better to start off with Bible studies
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.620]   and get people into the text
[00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.180]   and see how the texts portray the glory of God himself.
[00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.280]   - That's very helpful, Council.
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.780]   Dr. Carson, thank you for your time this week,
[00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.540]   and thank you for being with us.
[00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:28.920]   That was theologian Don Carson,
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.700]   who appeared in the last three episodes,
[00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.700]   and he appeared earlier in a special episode
[00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.540]   to help us think through the consequences
[00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.780]   of the SCOTUS ruling on same-sex marriage.
[00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.420]   You can find that episode in the archive
[00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.380]   most easily in the app for Apple and Android devices.
[00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.040]   And for links to the app and for really everything
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.480]   you need to know about this podcast,
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:52.480]   it can be found online at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.220]   Well, tomorrow is Friday,
[00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.800]   and we will hear from Matt Chandler and his wife, Lauren,
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.940]   about the challenges of living out God's design
[00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.120]   for marriage in today's world.
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.760]   I hope you'll tune in tomorrow.
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:03.760]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:04.800]   Thanks for listening.
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.380]   (upbeat music)
[00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.960]   (upbeat music)
