[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.560]   - Welcome back to the podcast.

[00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.180]   John Piper's sermons are now being curated
[00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.620]   in a new podcast from Desiring God
[00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.740]   called Light and Truth, Light and Truth.

[00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.580]   And I'm sure many of you already have.
[00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.100]   But on this Thursday episode,
[00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.820]   we're back in studio with Pastor John
[00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.260]   to field a question from Dustin in Indianapolis, Indiana.
[00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.180]   He writes this, "Pastor John, hello.
[00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.580]   "In light of 1 Timothy 2, verses one to four,
[00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.540]   "how are we to pray for unrighteous leaders?
[00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.660]   "How about presidents and other politicians?
[00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.980]   "How do you do it?
[00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.220]   "And what specifically do you pray for?"
[00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.060]   - Let's read the text that Dustin is referring to
[00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.060]   so that we can be specific.
[00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.020]   It's 1 Timothy 2, one to four, I'll read.
[00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.060]   First of all then, I urge that supplications,
[00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.900]   prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings
[00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.780]   be made for all people, for kings,
[00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.700]   and all who are in high positions
[00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.660]   that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life,
[00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.540]   godly and dignified in every way.
[00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.060]   This is good and it is pleasing in the sight of God,
[00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.660]   our Savior, who desires all people to be saved
[00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.300]   and to come to a knowledge of the truth.
[00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.860]   So Paul is calling for Christians
[00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.020]   to pray for all people.
[00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.660]   We focus on the kings, but it says all people.
[00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.700]   I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions,
[00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.900]   thanksgivings be made for all people.
[00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.620]   And then the kings and all those in high positions
[00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.820]   are a subset of all people.
[00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.780]   They are mentioned explicitly, I think,
[00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.580]   because they are especially relevant
[00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.840]   for the purpose of the prayer mentioned in the next clause.
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.420]   Namely that we may lead a life that's peaceful
[00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.700]   and quiet, godly, dignified in every way.
[00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.060]   So I take the all people to mean
[00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.060]   that wherever we look in the world
[00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.100]   and see people who might in some way make decisions
[00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.700]   that have a bearing on the circumstances
[00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.420]   in which Christians live,
[00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.820]   we should give thanks,
[00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.700]   underline that, thanksgiving for all people,
[00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.280]   we should give thanks for whatever proper role they fill,
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.280]   and we should ask God to incline their thoughts
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.440]   and incline their wills toward those decisions
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.720]   which carve out a space of justice and peace and freedom
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:14.480]   that allow Christians and others to live out our faith
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.880]   without physical resistance and without tumults
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.940]   and lawlessness and mob rule and war.
[00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.540]   That would include using their civil powers
[00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.660]   to restrain different forms of injustices.
[00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.660]   So there are two levels at which we pray
[00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.260]   for people in high positions.
[00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.680]   One is that they be saved.
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.660]   And Paul said in Romans 10, one,
[00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.740]   "My heart's desire and prayer to God for them
[00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.780]   is that they may be saved."
[00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.120]   And he was referring to his Jewish kinsmen,
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.960]   whatever their rank,
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.500]   whether they're a high priest or a synagogue ruler
[00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.680]   or just an ordinary Jewish person,
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.700]   he's praying, "God, save my kinsmen."
[00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.880]   So that's what we do for all people
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.280]   who come into our mind, we ask God to save them,
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.480]   to show them the truth and beauty of Christ
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.780]   and to incline their hearts,
[00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.380]   to believe and embrace Christ as their savior
[00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.540]   and Lord and treasure.
[00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.500]   Our hope as we pray this is that they will then,
[00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.940]   if they have any kind of authority at all,
[00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.260]   they will then see more clearly
[00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.320]   which decisions they have to make
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.680]   are just and peaceable and freedom loving
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.320]   so that some measure of freedom and justice and peace
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.700]   can be established so we can go about our lives
[00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.280]   without tumult or attack.
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.080]   That's one level, salvation.
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.160]   The other level of prayer is for leaders,
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.800]   even if the first prayer is not answered right away,
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.560]   "God, you're sending me for their salvation,"
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.720]   even if that's not going to happen right away,
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.120]   we keep on praying for them.
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.200]   Paul does not say to pray only for Christian leaders
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.680]   or only that leaders become Christian.
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.680]   In fact, it seems to me that Paul assumes in this context
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.520]   that most of the leaders Timothy would be praying for
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.280]   are not Christians.
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.800]   They're mainly Roman officials at various levels,
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.720]   emperor, governors, military leaders, town justices,
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.840]   as well as some Jewish synagogue leaders and so on.
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.320]   They're virtually all unbelievers.
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.060]   That's what he's mainly referring to.
[00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.300]   And the way we pray for unbelievers
[00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.360]   besides praying for their conversion
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.960]   is at the second level I'm talking about,
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.960]   namely the level of providence.
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.840]   At least that's one way to describe it.
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.020]   We know from Scripture, Proverbs 21.1,
[00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:11.960]   "The king's heart is a stream of water
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.720]   in the hand of the Lord.
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.760]   He turns it wherever he will."
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.880]   Now that's true of all kings, rulers,
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.520]   whether they're godly or not.
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:28.520]   So we pray that God in his all-governing providence
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.760]   over unbelievers and believers will incline the thoughts
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:38.760]   and the wills of non-Christian rulers to make decisions,
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.840]   even within their limited framework of right and wrong,
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:49.160]   that are just and freedom-producing and peace-producing
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:53.520]   so that those things that would enable Christians
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.040]   to proceed with their ordinary lives would hold sway.
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:02.040]   And I think the way Paul calls for prayer for leaders
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:07.360]   contains a warning for us of how not to think
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:11.540]   about the role of rulers in relation to the Christian faith.
[00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:17.080]   In spite of what I said about praying for their conversion,
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.240]   which is what we do for all people,
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.840]   that's not what Paul focuses on in this text.
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:26.960]   Paul is writing in a situation in which civil authorities
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.520]   are virtually all non-Christian.
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.040]   They may be ignorant of the Christian faith,
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.980]   they may be neutral, they may be hostile.
[00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:39.980]   So Paul's foremost thought is not that these prayers
[00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:44.000]   are prayers for Christian advocacy.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.560]   I think this is crucial.
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:50.660]   He's not telling us to pray that civil authorities
[00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:54.440]   would become a conscious weapon
[00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:58.780]   of explicitly Christian promotion of the faith.
[00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:04.780]   He's thinking about pagan rulers who remain pagan,
[00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:07.540]   but still are influenced by the providence of God
[00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:11.620]   to bring about in their limited, godless framework,
[00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:16.500]   some measure of justice and peace and freedom.
[00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:20.660]   Christians benefit from this, as others do,
[00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:25.460]   but this providence of God is not an example
[00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:29.820]   of Christians trying to turn state power
[00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:34.820]   into an explicit promoter of Christ's spiritual kingdom.
[00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:38.940]   Now, the reason I mention that warning
[00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:43.940]   is because Jesus said to Pilate at his trial,
[00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:49.260]   this is John 18, 36, "My kingdom is not of this world.
[00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:54.020]   "If my kingdom were of this world,
[00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:57.740]   "my servants would have been fighting
[00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:00.900]   "that I might not be delivered over to the Jews,
[00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:05.580]   "but my kingdom is not from the world."
[00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:10.580]   In other words, Jesus was eager that Christians
[00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:14.380]   not look to civil authorities for the establishment
[00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:16.220]   of his kingdom on earth.
[00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:20.100]   The way the state keeps the peace
[00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:23.860]   and the way Christ spreads his saving rule
[00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:27.060]   are radically different.
[00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:32.060]   So we don't pray that the state become an arm of the church.
[00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:35.740]   We don't pray as if the kingdom of God,
[00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:40.740]   the saving reign of Christ is of this world
[00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:43.360]   or that it would be advanced
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:47.460]   through an explicitly Christian use of the sword.
[00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:51.940]   Rather, we pray that God would have mercy on us
[00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:56.380]   and on the world whom he aims for us to evangelize
[00:09:56.380 --> 00:10:01.100]   in this text and would cause the hearts of presidents
[00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:04.420]   and governors and mayors and legislators
[00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:07.900]   to make decisions that bring about justice
[00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:12.400]   and peace and freedom so that we can go about our lives
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:17.400]   of worship and godliness and love and evangelism
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.100]   and world missions.
[00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:19.940]   - Amen.
[00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:22.220]   He has a good warning here about misreading this text
[00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:24.100]   as political advocacy.
[00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:25.700]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:27.380]   And thank you for joining us today.
[00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:29.780]   If you want to ask Pastor John,

[00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:43.360]   Next week, we have two questions about pastoring.
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:45.720]   Can single men pastor?
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:46.560]   That's on Monday.
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:49.080]   Can single men pastor?
[00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:51.600]   And then how much should pastors make?
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.200]   That's Thursday.
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.040]   I'm your host Tony Rehnke.
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:55.840]   Pastor John and I will see you next week.
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:56.880]   Have a great weekend.
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.460]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:02.040]   (upbeat music)
