[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420]   (soft music)
[00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:06.720]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.380]   of the Everyday Educator podcast.
[00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.280]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.540]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.900]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.880]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.220]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.360]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.980]   this homeschooling possibility
[00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.120]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.600]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.400]   But don't forget, although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.400]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.720]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.340]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.980]   Well, listeners, I have a treat for you today.
[00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.820]   I have a dear friend with me today as a guest, Brittany Lewis.
[00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.600]   Brittany is a longtime challenge director,
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.360]   a longtime homeschooling mom,
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.800]   lots of experience under her belt with her own children,
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.800]   as well as mentoring students and parents and families
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.000]   through her own local community for years.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.140]   I asked Brittany to come today because as we draw near
[00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.140]   to the end of the year, I know that lots of you families
[00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.400]   are maybe growing weary, maybe becoming anxious for,
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.480]   ooh, have we done it?
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.320]   Have we accomplished the goal?
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.600]   Are we running the race well?
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.920]   And then there's a special group of you
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.920]   who are coming around the final curve of the final year.
[00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.660]   Of your homeschool journey with one or more of your students
[00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.560]   and so I remember that and I know how tender your hearts are
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.560]   and I want us to try to cast a vision for this last year
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.960]   and especially for this last home stretch,
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.540]   kind of as a ministry to you parents who are pulling in
[00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.260]   to across the finish line for maybe the last time,
[00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.020]   but also, I want us to try to make sure
[00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.760]   that you know really for the parents who are close
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.740]   to the end of the journey but are wondering
[00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.360]   is the final lap really necessary?
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.480]   So Brittany, I've probably dug us a big hole to fill
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.360]   in 45 minutes, but I think you're the right person
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.980]   for the job and I really appreciate you coming on.
[00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.260]   - Oh, it's such a joy.
[00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.220]   This is one of my favorite things to talk about.
[00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.140]   - I'm so glad.
[00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.500]   I know you have a heart for parents and for students
[00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.100]   who are at the end of the journey,
[00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.220]   but I want people to know that you do have the credentials
[00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.780]   to talk about this, that it has been a tender place
[00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.920]   in your heart for a long time.
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.260]   Tell our listeners how long you've been a challenge director
[00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.840]   and why did you agree to ever become a challenge director
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:14.840]   in the first place?
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.540]   - I think this is my 11th year.
[00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.100]   This year I'm a challenge three tutor
[00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.260]   and it's my third time to do challenge three.
[00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.260]   I've tutored all the levels by God's kindness to me
[00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.940]   all the way from challenge eight to challenge four,
[00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.140]   but challenge three and four I've tutored the most.
[00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.280]   So I've tutored challenge three, this is my third time,
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.660]   and challenge four I've tutored four times
[00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.700]   and I am supposed to tutor challenge four next year.
[00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:45.780]   - Oh my word.
[00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.100]   - I'm super excited because it is really my favorite year,
[00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.560]   although three and four are full of such goodness.
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.320]   - Yes, yes.
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.740]   Well, I love that.
[00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.620]   So it seems like challenge four
[00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.240]   might really be your favorite.
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.100]   And so I wanna know what do you love
[00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.240]   about challenge four students,
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.240]   about the challenge four material,
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.560]   about the way y'all can approach the material?
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.180]   What is it that you love about challenge four?
[00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.760]   - Man, I think it is a super rare gift
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.960]   to get to have that final year with seniors.
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.860]   I think they're wrestling with lots of important questions.
[00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.560]   Everyone, whether they're in CC or outside of CC,
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.680]   if they meet someone at the grocery store
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.960]   or on the ball field, people are asking them,
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.280]   what are your plans next year?
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.900]   And so often students have mixed feelings
[00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.120]   about being asked that question all the time,
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.760]   but it's a good question to consider.
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.760]   And it's at a time when they really are listening,
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.760]   they're looking for answers.
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.840]   Many of them finally realize the education
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.280]   that they've been given and they have hearts of gratitude.
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.480]   They see how everything's integrated
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.200]   and they have learned to look for Christ
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.400]   in all of their studies.
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.600]   And it's just the sweetest year
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.800]   when we're studying some really ancient books
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.180]   that have been foundational for educated people
[00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.480]   for generations, books that Christians in particular
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.860]   have treasured, even though they're pagan books,
[00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:26.720]   many of them.
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.600]   So they're curious about that
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.020]   and they have the opportunity to,
[00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.760]   anyone could read those books alone,
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.860]   but to have a community of like-minded peers
[00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.360]   digging in together, persevering that last year
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.680]   and doing hard things together
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.440]   and getting to converse about big ideas
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:53.160]   and important questions and study theology together
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:58.160]   is just a rare gift, not easily replicated anywhere else.
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.280]   - I think you're right.
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.360]   And you love being,
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.220]   it sounds like you love being in a front row seat
[00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:09.720]   to watch that wrestling.
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:10.560]   - I do.
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.600]   I love the students.
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.480]   They are such a gift to me.
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.340]   They're a joy to pray for and serve.
[00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.260]   And their families often are wrestling
[00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.880]   through all kinds of hard circumstances
[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.240]   as God always in His kindness gives us to refine us.
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.260]   And it's a joy.
[00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:28.800]   I learned so much from them.
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.720]   I don't walk in knowing all the answers,
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.880]   but I know how to search for the answers
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.880]   and they want to search for the answers.
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:42.060]   And so it's just a joy to spend time with young men
[00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:47.060]   and women who want to have those kinds of conversations.
[00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:52.980]   - I think it's beautiful, Brittany, that they have you.
[00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:59.080]   A person who also loves to wrestle and search
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:03.980]   and who delights in watching their,
[00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:08.420]   whether it's fledgling searching or experienced searching,
[00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:11.020]   that you really enjoy and appreciate
[00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:14.240]   what they have to say about subjects too.
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:18.100]   I think that you are a gift to them and I appreciate you.
[00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:22.160]   How many students have you mentored
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.980]   through the end of your journey?
[00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:27.220]   I mean, you've graduated your own children,
[00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:30.900]   but if you've been directing for 11 years,
[00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:33.240]   you've mentored a lot of students.
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.360]   - Yeah, and when our challenge program
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.160]   was just starting out, we had older kids join us
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:43.160]   in younger years, and so they graduated early.
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:47.200]   So if I counted all of them, and plus I have three children,
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.280]   and so my youngest will be Lord Welling
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.960]   and Challenge Four with me next year.
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:56.960]   And I think it's about 40-ish students.
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:01.360]   It may be a little bit more, a little less.
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:06.320]   I was trying to count, one of my classes gave me a quilt
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.200]   with their names on it, which is super sweet.
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.900]   It's in my bedroom.
[00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:12.640]   Yeah, so there've been people that we've just had
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.860]   the blessing of having with us for a year or so,
[00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:17.560]   just because their family's removed
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:20.360]   or they just really couldn't homeschool or something.
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:24.060]   But it's been a joy to watch these young men and women
[00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:29.060]   seek Christ or be encouraged to seek Christ
[00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:31.140]   if they aren't doing so already.
[00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:33.020]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:36.700]   Well, clearly we have come to the right person for advice
[00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:41.700]   about how to encourage families who are in that last lap
[00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:45.840]   of the journey, and then also, Brittany,
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.400]   I want us to be sure that we have enough time
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.820]   to encourage families who are wondering
[00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:54.940]   if the last lap is worth it, if it's for them,
[00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:57.980]   or what could they, you know, I just really,
[00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:00.120]   my heart is a little heavy for communities
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.880]   all across our country that,
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:05.080]   where parents and students are saying,
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.740]   "I don't know if I wanna stay for challenge four."
[00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:10.120]   So I want us to address that.
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.940]   But let's talk for a minute,
[00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:15.060]   because about the end of the journey,
[00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:20.060]   about that final year, what is so challenging
[00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:23.300]   about the end of a journey?
[00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:24.820]   And you know, it's me and you,
[00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:27.420]   so we can talk metaphorically,
[00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:30.320]   and then we can talk specifically too.
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.380]   What is so challenging about the end of a journey?
[00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:36.900]   - I think if you're a homeschooling parent,
[00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.880]   you have devoted so much of your time, energy,
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:44.880]   and days to homeschooling, and it can be really,
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:46.860]   it could really pull at your heart
[00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:51.860]   to feel like you've got this last year with your kids,
[00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:53.980]   last year with your senior.
[00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:57.580]   It might feel like a season is coming to an end,
[00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:59.020]   or a journey is coming to an end.
[00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:03.020]   And so I think, rightly so,
[00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:05.700]   parents really do, because they love their kids,
[00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:06.820]   and they want what's best for them,
[00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:08.620]   and they want to serve them well.
[00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:13.600]   They think about how to spend that last year.
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.700]   Also, because you've been spending so much time
[00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:18.500]   homeschooling, you can be really weary.
[00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:21.220]   You can see so much growth that you think
[00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:24.580]   that they're really ready to launch out early.
[00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:28.720]   The world tells us, I think it's particularly hard,
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:34.020]   because we know that as members of CC,
[00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:37.580]   that our purpose, like Leigh reminds us so much,
[00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:42.460]   is that sound academics should glorify God.
[00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:44.880]   There's something missing if you don't have that
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.380]   in your curriculum, there's something huge missing.
[00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.060]   And it's not something you can just tack on,
[00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:50.220]   it's integrated throughout.
[00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:53.380]   And so our goal is to cultivate wise and virtuous
[00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:54.440]   young men and women.
[00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:57.520]   But we can forget that purpose,
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:00.780]   or perhaps we can be tempted by the allure
[00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:04.120]   of earning dual credits, or hurry up and grow up,
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:07.280]   or my child really wants to work a lot of hours,
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:10.180]   so I'm just gonna let them finish out,
[00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:12.600]   they've got enough credits, why keep going?
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:17.020]   And also just life circumstances that you can need
[00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:20.820]   fellow people like Moses needed to hold up your arms
[00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:22.020]   at the end of the journey.
[00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:23.860]   - Right, right.
[00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:28.620]   - And so I think there's a temptation to not move forward.
[00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:30.860]   Also, just the challenge for curriculum,
[00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:34.860]   if you look at it in a catalog, can feel kind of daunting,
[00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:38.800]   but I'm here to testify that it is for all of us.
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:43.660]   There's something about wrestling with math and physics
[00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:47.460]   that is humbling and wonderful to help us see the world
[00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:48.740]   a different way.
[00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:52.740]   There's something lovely about getting to the final year
[00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:57.380]   of Latin studies, six years, very counter-cultural to do that
[00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:01.320]   and you finally get to taste what it's like to read
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:06.200]   an epic poem that Christians valued for generations
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.940]   in the original language when we read and translate
[00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:13.940]   parts of the Aeneid, the parts we choose to translate
[00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:16.020]   bring up some really big questions
[00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:18.740]   about eternally significant questions.
[00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:20.740]   There's all kinds of beauty in there,
[00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:24.140]   there's books and opportunities to explore
[00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:27.420]   Jerome's Vulgate in Latin.
[00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:32.640]   It can feel like, wow, I don't know if I want to do that
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.520]   and then the senior thesis can perhaps,
[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:36.920]   maybe you're looking at your kid and you're like,
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:38.740]   I don't know if my kid can do this,
[00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:41.460]   but I can tell you I've seen all kinds of students
[00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:44.100]   with all kinds of giftings and challenges
[00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:49.100]   really have a victorious experience with the senior thesis
[00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:53.220]   and so I think looking at all those things
[00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:57.100]   because it's the last year, we just need to be prayerful
[00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:00.560]   about how we spend that time with our students,
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:04.420]   but we also need to remember that it's really the beginning
[00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:07.460]   of a new journey for them and it's a new,
[00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:10.940]   we transition from being their homeschooling parents
[00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:13.700]   to really their coaches and their friends
[00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:16.900]   and that's the best part of the year for me,
[00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:21.180]   that's why even if my daughter and I just have a small class
[00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:23.560]   this next year, I think it's worth the time
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:27.260]   because I wanna read and have those conversations with her
[00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:31.500]   about things that really matter before she's gone,
[00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:33.900]   before I just give her to the world.
[00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:38.060]   And so, but also I know that watching my other two,
[00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:40.940]   one's a Marine and one's in nursing school and married,
[00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:41.980]   they're both married,
[00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:45.460]   I know that there's a new journey too that begins
[00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:46.320]   and you know that Lisa,
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:49.540]   because you're such a wonderful mom and grandmother.
[00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:56.060]   So it's just the beginning, but it can feel like an end.
[00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:59.980]   - It can, it can.
[00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:04.980]   It is a beautiful, it is a beautiful way to end
[00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:10.340]   tying the loose ends up together, you know?
[00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:13.740]   I did love that and like you said, it's your,
[00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:17.140]   as the parent who has loved on and mentored
[00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:19.880]   and really worked yourself out of a job
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:24.220]   over all these years, it is beautiful to be able
[00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:29.220]   to tie a bow with your student on how you have learned
[00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:32.380]   and grown together through the years.
[00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:34.780]   And it is also very humbling
[00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:41.840]   to kind of let that position shift.
[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:46.840]   Like you said, you become a coach and a mentor
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:49.500]   instead of a straight teacher.
[00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:54.500]   And there is more almost camaraderie in the learning
[00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:57.780]   that last year and you learn from them
[00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:00.860]   and they learn from you and it really gives you
[00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:05.860]   an opportunity to help them see that they are ready
[00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:10.460]   to spring forward and that they are prepared.
[00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:13.820]   And you sort of spend that last year, you know,
[00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:17.380]   going around and visiting the things that you've spent
[00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:21.920]   so many years on and showing them that they are ready.
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:26.740]   And I think that that last joint visitation gives them
[00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:30.700]   a lot of confidence and maybe settles their nerves
[00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:32.460]   for going forward.
[00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:35.400]   - Yeah, I think you're exactly right.
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:38.220]   And I've had all kinds of students in my own family,
[00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:41.820]   I've had students that really struggled to do the work
[00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:44.520]   or didn't want to sometimes.
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:48.260]   I've had, I guess we all have times where we don't want to.
[00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:54.180]   I've had a really eager student who knew what she wanted
[00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:58.420]   and was going for it, couldn't wait to get to the next.
[00:15:58.420 --> 00:15:59.260]   - Yes.
[00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.440]   - I've had reluctant students who love to learn
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.060]   but they just kind of woke up mid year,
[00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:08.180]   even changed their senior thesis to say,
[00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:10.140]   I got to tell more people about this education
[00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:12.300]   I've been given and I've been missing it this whole time
[00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:14.440]   but I finally see it now.
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:19.440]   I've had a student who went on to become,
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:24.020]   you know, win all kinds of awards as a student scholar.
[00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:27.660]   And is pursuing seminary studies and he would say,
[00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:29.500]   don't miss that last year.
[00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:32.380]   That last year is so important and all those things
[00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:35.500]   I began to study then, I'm still studying now
[00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:39.260]   and it's so rich, I'm so grateful for those times.
[00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:42.060]   And I've had one student who was,
[00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:44.300]   he was actually, it was actually his junior year
[00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:49.300]   because of his age, he used his year to love a class
[00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:53.580]   of students who were so vastly different in their opinions.
[00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:56.140]   And as he dug in and asked his questions,
[00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:58.700]   he was wooing them toward the truth
[00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:00.120]   and blessing his neighbor.
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:02.100]   I mean, like, it was astonishing.
[00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:05.260]   I thought he and the other student I mentioned,
[00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.100]   I thought you guys are bound for ministry.
[00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:09.400]   The Lord is gonna do my things with you.
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:13.360]   And then another student really was struggling.
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:15.460]   Her family was really struggling.
[00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:17.740]   She didn't think she was smart enough for college studies
[00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:20.380]   and she dug in, her peers loved her.
[00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:21.660]   She asked hard questions.
[00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:25.460]   She wrestled with her senior thesis and felt so victorious.
[00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:27.060]   She went on to college.
[00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:29.500]   She's in some sort of scholarship program now.
[00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:31.260]   She's just thriving.
[00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:35.100]   I mean, like there's, there are testimonies.
[00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:37.860]   I've seen life changes happen that year.
[00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:39.820]   And I think that's why I'm so passionate about it.
[00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:43.300]   Why I want the students I love to go forward
[00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:46.220]   because I've seen so many different men
[00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:50.320]   and women really grow that last year.
[00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:53.140]   - I agree with you.
[00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:56.180]   I have seen both in my own home
[00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:58.700]   and in the communities that I have served,
[00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:02.980]   I have seen children, students that come into their own
[00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:07.900]   at the end of this journey and you think it's a butterfly.
[00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:11.060]   It's a butterfly, you've been growing this whole time
[00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:14.620]   and you did not believe that your wings would,
[00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:16.660]   that either that you would ever have wings
[00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:18.860]   or that they would be this beautiful.
[00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:22.740]   And as you kept pushing and wrestling
[00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:26.260]   and wiggling and persevering,
[00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:29.980]   you recognize, you come out and you are so changed
[00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:34.500]   and you are almost amazed at what God has done in you.
[00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:39.500]   And so that last year is beautiful for so many ways.
[00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:43.300]   And I appreciate you sharing the different ways
[00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:47.380]   that students respond to the end.
[00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:52.380]   So, okay, let's think about our challenge for students.
[00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:57.200]   We have talked a lot about them being challenged
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:00.180]   and stretched and having them grow.
[00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:03.780]   What are the things that stretch our challenge
[00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:07.420]   for students the most in that last year?
[00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:09.580]   And I mean, I want you to talk to us
[00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:12.280]   about the academics obviously,
[00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:15.940]   but I also want you to help us as parents
[00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:19.540]   and as community mentors to see how those students
[00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:22.980]   are being stretched socially and emotionally
[00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:25.880]   and maybe spiritually.
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:30.740]   - Yeah, I mean, there's lots of great opportunities
[00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:33.500]   for stretching that final year.
[00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:36.620]   Academics, I think students,
[00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:39.900]   because they're really growing the art of rhetoric
[00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:42.660]   and they're really stretching their study skills,
[00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:47.380]   they grow in some scholarly strengths or virtues.
[00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:51.060]   You learn to read really closely some challenging texts,
[00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:53.980]   you learn to discuss and lead conversations
[00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:56.260]   in three of those strands without notice.
[00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:58.060]   So there's some good accountability
[00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:02.180]   and opportunities to just practice
[00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:04.140]   talking about harder things,
[00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:06.700]   leading conversations on those hard things
[00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:09.260]   in a way that is gracious and loving.
[00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:12.460]   That said, there's some big questions
[00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:16.820]   that come up, we do study the Bible more
[00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:20.540]   and students often realize that they don't know it
[00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:21.980]   like they thought they did.
[00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:23.780]   They realize that they know what their churches
[00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:26.140]   have taught them or their parents have taught them,
[00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:27.400]   but they don't know where it is
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:31.180]   and often they've read stories from scripture,
[00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:33.540]   but they remember like parts of them
[00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:36.560]   or maybe they just got the parts
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:40.020]   without the dark challenging parts of scripture.
[00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:41.460]   And so wrestling with those things
[00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:43.180]   can bring some important questions
[00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:45.700]   and learning to listen to each other
[00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:48.180]   in all our different denominations
[00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:52.860]   is a really good way to practice loving rhetoric
[00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:55.100]   as we seek the truth together
[00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:59.700]   and that can be a good challenge.
[00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:03.660]   It's an investment to read these great books
[00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:08.700]   to sit at the feet of mere Christianity, C.S. Lewis,
[00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:09.820]   to sit at the feet at
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:11.820]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:14.100]   - Homer and Virgil and Daniel Boorstin
[00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:16.640]   who's a world-renowned wonderful historian
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:21.620]   to study and wrestle with math and physics
[00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:25.740]   and really see how we finally apply algebra
[00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:27.620]   and a little bit of trig to that studies.
[00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:29.580]   It transforms the way we view the world
[00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:32.540]   and so that can be a really good study.
[00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:34.240]   Often I've heard students exclaim,
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:38.060]   "Oh, that's why we studied that part of math.
[00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:40.140]   I finally get it, oh my word."
[00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:41.800]   I see how it comes together.
[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.440]   Those students who really love math
[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:47.520]   and who have really had a hard relationship with math grow.
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:48.360]   - That's cool.
[00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:54.380]   - Socially, I think everyone's asking big questions.
[00:21:54.380 --> 00:22:00.060]   They've got friends outside of CC and perhaps NCC
[00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:02.560]   and in their churches and on their sports teams
[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:04.700]   and who they work with who are wrestling
[00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:08.620]   with some big questions that we see our culture
[00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:10.620]   struggling with, that can be a challenge.
[00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:13.540]   Perhaps they're in new relationships
[00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:18.260]   or they're just wrestling,
[00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:19.920]   learning to love each other better
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:22.580]   because we come together in community to practice that
[00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:24.360]   and we fail and have to say we're sorry
[00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:26.060]   and ask for forgiveness.
[00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:28.580]   So I think learning just to be peacemaker,
[00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:33.540]   also just doing these hard things together
[00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:35.380]   for just lifelong friendships.
[00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:37.940]   I mean, I've seen the beauty of that.
[00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:42.740]   And emotionally, I think there's a lot of pressure
[00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:46.180]   on our students for perfection.
[00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:49.220]   Society tells us, students have testified to this.
[00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:51.340]   I always ask them to begin the year.
[00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:54.020]   What do you think the world is asking you to be?
[00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:56.100]   What would it look like if you were successful?
[00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:57.300]   What does that mean?
[00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:01.500]   And they're often like, well, if I look a certain way,
[00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:06.100]   if I'm physically strong, if I'm gifted in sports,
[00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:10.660]   if I'm gifted in academics, if I'm great at a vocation,
[00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:14.100]   there's all these things plus on top of that as Christians,
[00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:15.780]   we want to grow in Christ-likeness.
[00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:19.160]   I mean, it can feel if you forget the grace
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:23.660]   that God gives us and the perfect work of completion
[00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:24.980]   that His Son has done for us.
[00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:28.980]   It can feel like a lot to bear.
[00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:31.940]   - And also while you're wrestling with what should I do
[00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:32.780]   with my life?
[00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:34.540]   What are my callings?
[00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:35.720]   - Right.
[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:36.900]   - And the senior thesis actually,
[00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:39.080]   I think is a great opportunity for students
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:42.380]   to really figure out, dig in, take a personal inventory
[00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:45.340]   and figure out what am I interested in?
[00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:46.940]   What do I want to learn about?
[00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:50.540]   What would I like to study?
[00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:51.380]   - Yeah.
[00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:52.620]   - What are my next steps in life?
[00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:54.340]   What should I do with my life?
[00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:56.400]   - Yeah, that's really good.
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:00.900]   And that is actually a lovely segue into one thing
[00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:04.560]   'cause I really did want to ask you in detail
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:07.600]   about the senior thesis because I know
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:12.600]   even some long time CC families,
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:16.800]   maybe there was no such thing as the senior thesis
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:19.320]   when your student, when you and your student
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:22.360]   joined the classical conversations community
[00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:25.500]   and you started thinking down through the years,
[00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:28.120]   although I know when you start foundations,
[00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:30.560]   it's really hard to envision senior year
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:32.340]   as ever gonna come.
[00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:35.180]   But even for families who started a long time ago,
[00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:40.180]   they may not have been considering the senior thesis.
[00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:41.760]   It wasn't a thing.
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:44.520]   And so I know that lots of our listeners
[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:48.560]   probably have some questions specifically
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:52.020]   about the senior thesis and maybe some fears
[00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:54.360]   or some anxiety about the senior thesis.
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:56.000]   So I really wanted to talk to you.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.960]   So okay, okay, what is it?
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:00.160]   What is the senior thesis?
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:04.520]   - So the senior thesis is an opportunity
[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:08.280]   which I think is really rare for most students
[00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:10.280]   who aren't gonna go on to doctrinal work
[00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:14.840]   or have to write a senior thesis in college.
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:17.160]   In fact, I've had lots of college professors
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:19.960]   that have been our judges say, wow,
[00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:21.040]   my students aren't doing this.
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.600]   My students have never done this.
[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:24.720]   This is quality work.
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:26.680]   And so it's an opportunity
[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:29.040]   to bring all of the classical skills
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:34.040]   that we've been honing together and practice writing
[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:40.120]   or first researching a topic of the student's choice,
[00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:43.040]   anything they want to do that can be turned
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:48.040]   into a debatable thesis.
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:51.180]   So it needs to be something that has both sides,
[00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:53.240]   but most things are.
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:57.780]   I've seen a wide variety of thesis choices,
[00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:01.120]   but it's an opportunity for really most of a year
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:04.580]   to dig in and to research something
[00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:05.780]   of the student's choosing.
[00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:08.280]   And that's really important that it's their choice
[00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:11.640]   that they choose to decide
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:13.900]   to research this particular thing.
[00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:16.440]   And then they practice the canons of rhetoric on it.
[00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:20.160]   They invent, they research all that's been said
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:21.680]   about that thing on both sides
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:23.740]   and try to suspend their judgment
[00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:25.580]   of what their thesis is going to state
[00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:29.200]   in that debatable thesis.
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:34.580]   And then they arrange those thoughts
[00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:38.920]   and that good scholarly research into a good solid outline.
[00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:41.040]   And then they write a paper
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:42.940]   and it's not as long as you think.
[00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:48.180]   It's like 12 to 20 pages, I think.
[00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:50.100]   I haven't looked at it in a year,
[00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:51.680]   so I should go back and look at that,
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:52.600]   but it's not very long.
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:54.540]   It's 12 to 20 pages, I believe.
[00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:57.960]   Double spaced, one inch margins,
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:01.400]   like Times New Romans, like not super tiny.
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:02.500]   - Yes.
[00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:04.300]   - And then they've got a really good
[00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:07.160]   annotated bibliography of sources
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:11.800]   that they've collected and they practice.
[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:13.320]   After they've written this thesis,
[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:17.840]   they hand it over to some judges to read in advance.
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:19.360]   We give them a few weeks to do that.
[00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:21.820]   And then they show up to stand upon the thing
[00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:23.960]   that they have written and defend it.
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:28.180]   And the judges are often excited to do this.
[00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:30.600]   They're not there to grill the students.
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:32.920]   They are there to ask them good questions.
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:34.740]   And they often have all kinds of questions
[00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:36.540]   to ask the student, perhaps questions
[00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:40.100]   the student hasn't considered before.
[00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:42.820]   Yeah, and so it's a great opportunity
[00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:44.560]   for students to realize, wow,
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:47.740]   I know how to find out good things to say
[00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:50.700]   and to really evaluate and build an argument.
[00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:53.200]   I know how to persuade others to that argument.
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.120]   And I know how to defend that argument.
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:59.120]   So it's one more chance to bring all those skills together
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:02.220]   and to have just this victorious moment
[00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:06.080]   at the end of their journey all the way to the summit
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:07.900]   of the Challenge Leadership Program.
[00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:12.280]   And they realize, because the judges often say this,
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:14.880]   and I've seen judges move to tears
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:17.920]   and start asking the students for life advice.
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:19.700]   And the students are blown away by that.
[00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:21.500]   They're like, well, I'm not a father yet,
[00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:25.020]   or I'm not a expert on this,
[00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:28.380]   but if I were you, I would consider this question.
[00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:31.360]   You know, they learn that they have a voice that matters
[00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:34.300]   that adults in their community want to hear.
[00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:38.860]   And I think that's a great gift to give our students
[00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:41.180]   right before they launch.
[00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:43.020]   And that's not to say that every student
[00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:45.920]   is gonna write the perfect senior thesis
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:48.200]   or that it won't be super hard.
[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:51.080]   I mean, to be honest, and my son would tell you this
[00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:52.800]   if he was on this call with me,
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:56.260]   I mean, I was with him 'cause he needed company
[00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:58.540]   and someone to say, you can do this, come on.
[00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:01.120]   - Right, a cheerleader. - Here's the next step.
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:02.960]   And we were there working 'til the very end.
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:05.600]   And we have a really funny story of the last,
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:08.720]   when we were printing it out and trying to deliver it.
[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:10.620]   And we still laugh about that today.
[00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:13.620]   And I tell him, man, as much as we rustled together,
[00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:17.520]   I don't trade one of those hours where I really doubted
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:20.360]   he was gonna finish and I was the tutor.
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:23.120]   So he, but he did, he did.
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:26.360]   And he learned that, I mean, he was the one
[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:28.760]   that dad started asking for his advice
[00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:30.840]   about how he should spend time with his son.
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:33.600]   Jackson was so humbled by that and said,
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:34.980]   well, I'm not even a dad yet,
[00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:37.000]   but here's what I think is best.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.580]   This is what my dad's done for me.
[00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:42.840]   And I don't know, I've just seen that.
[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:48.140]   I've seen students really grow from this opportunity.
[00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:50.120]   But it's laid out in the guide really well.
[00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:52.380]   It's planned out for weeks.
[00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:55.940]   They start early first semester thinking about those things.
[00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:57.740]   And they do it together.
[00:29:57.740 --> 00:30:00.400]   They get peer feedback, the tutor's feedback,
[00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:03.700]   parent feedback, they're encouraged to choose a mentor
[00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:06.020]   to coach them who can also be their judge.
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:10.240]   So there's an opportunity really for students
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:13.800]   to explore a love they have, or a big question they have,
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:16.320]   or perhaps a future calling,
[00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:19.140]   and to really grow from that experience.
[00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:25.880]   - That's, I'm just, I'm so energized by that.
[00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:31.260]   I have to say, my girls went through,
[00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:38.680]   they graduated from challenge four before the senior thesis
[00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:43.920]   was a part, before it was a part of what we did.
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:51.100]   And I look at it and think, wow, that, yes,
[00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:56.280]   it looks daunting and it sounds like such a drag, man.
[00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:59.780]   It sounds like a hard thing to do.
[00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:04.780]   But as a parent and as a tutor, I look at it and think,
[00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:10.920]   just what you said, what an absolute blessing
[00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:15.920]   of an opportunity to both prove to yourself
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:22.840]   and to a wider community that the classical tools
[00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:27.840]   of learning work, that your students believe in.
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:33.840]   Do know how to research and invent and weigh things
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:39.480]   and then slice and dice and put them in ways
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:44.480]   that are clear and naturally follow and are persuasive.
[00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:50.760]   They've learned all about the modes of persuasion.
[00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:54.020]   So I think that that is a beautiful thing.
[00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:58.740]   But I love what you said about the students growing
[00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:03.740]   into the confidence that they are prepared.
[00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:07.340]   I think it's gotta be beautiful for students
[00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:09.700]   who kind of took their parent's word for it,
[00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:13.600]   that this was a good education and that this is all gonna,
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:16.840]   we're all trusting that this is gonna come out in the end
[00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:18.440]   and you will have a good education.
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:22.360]   But for those students to come through and at the end,
[00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:26.660]   see that, wow, I do know how to do this.
[00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:30.900]   I can tell if something is a biased source
[00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:32.500]   or an unbiased source.
[00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:36.900]   I do know how to weigh the voices
[00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:39.660]   in the research that I'm doing.
[00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:42.740]   I do know how to assemble an argument.
[00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:45.940]   I do know how to consider all the sides.
[00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:50.460]   That has to be so empowering for students.
[00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:53.360]   - Yeah, I think it's such a gift to our students.
[00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:56.160]   And I've had a few returning students say,
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:33:01.520]   wow, I was asked to do a senior thesis now
[00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:03.140]   in this Honors College program.
[00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:05.960]   And I'm so thankful that I had that experience
[00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:09.460]   and I get to try it again, but I know what to expect.
[00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:11.720]   And I'm ready because I have these tools.
[00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:14.420]   And they're reminded one last time
[00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:16.720]   because there's not a ton of other writing
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:18.120]   involved in Challenge Four.
[00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:18.960]   - Right.
[00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:21.280]   - I mean, students write speeches
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:23.700]   but they memorize and deliver those speeches.
[00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:26.880]   So there's a lot of emphasis on memory and delivery.
[00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:28.480]   And so this last point, I mean,
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:31.160]   they get to take it all the way to the end.
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:32.760]   They may have had all that experience
[00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:35.260]   writing IEW papers and essentials
[00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:36.640]   and they might've had all that experience
[00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:39.100]   with lost tools of writing and all the other writing
[00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:41.780]   we do in the Challenge program of various kinds.
[00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:44.680]   And they get one more time to practice those tools
[00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:47.280]   and it's a really memorable practice.
[00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:50.040]   So I think it's a gift to our students
[00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:51.860]   to be able to do that.
[00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:55.520]   - Yes, and I love just what you just said now
[00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:58.640]   that they have, you know, they worked
[00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:03.600]   and have been working on all of these skills for years.
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:07.800]   They've been working to become better writers,
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:10.580]   more organized writers, clearer writers,
[00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:13.560]   writers who know which word to use when
[00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:16.800]   and what kind of persuasion they are employing
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:21.160]   to speak to the specific audience that they are addressing.
[00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:23.140]   We've practiced so much of that.
[00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:28.140]   I really, I like that we are offering our students
[00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:34.840]   the dessert at the end of the banquet, you know?
[00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:39.640]   And they actually get to eat it and to celebrate it.
[00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:41.920]   We've taught them how to cook the banquet
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:44.680]   and how to prepare, but let's have the banquet
[00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:46.800]   and let's eat the dessert.
[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:48.980]   I wanna ask you a little bit,
[00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:53.240]   'cause you have mentored your own children
[00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:56.880]   and you have taught a lot of different levels of Challenge.
[00:34:56.880 --> 00:35:01.880]   How do the early years begin to prepare the students
[00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:08.440]   for this last capstone event?
[00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:10.880]   Because I'll tell you the truth, Brittany,
[00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:15.480]   I think that parents who are contemplating jumping ship
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:17.520]   after Challenge two or three,
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:23.400]   I personally think that they need to take a good hard look
[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:27.420]   at what they might be shortchanging their student over.
[00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:30.960]   So I want you to speak a little bit about
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:35.240]   how all the years of the classical education
[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:38.280]   have been about preparing our students.
[00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:41.560]   It has, I mean, it's so,
[00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:46.000]   I always just marvel at the way Challenge began,
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.860]   how it was begun first and then foundations
[00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:53.240]   and essentials was created out of a need that we saw.
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:56.680]   And my students in Challenge four
[00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:58.840]   have often relied upon memory work
[00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:01.400]   and you don't have to have been in Challenge four.
[00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:04.400]   I have had students join us in Challenge four even mid year
[00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:05.840]   and just excel.
[00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:09.640]   But it does help if you've got some of those memory pags
[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:13.540]   and that opportunity that you've had all those years
[00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:18.540]   to present your ideas in presentations and foundations
[00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:21.160]   and write and wrestle with ideas
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:23.040]   as you're writing all those essentials papers
[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:25.440]   and growing in your knowledge of language.
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:30.440]   And every single piece of it is this,
[00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:34.800]   it's a part of this beautiful tapestry
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:38.920]   and the finishing parts where you finally see the picture
[00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:42.320]   come together are in Challenge four
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:45.380]   after you've wrestled through the early parts
[00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:49.040]   of the Challenge program and done things like
[00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:51.000]   probably that you wouldn't have thought
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.740]   all your kids would do, I didn't.
[00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:57.560]   Science fair, mock trial, all the debate we do,
[00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:00.000]   all the writing and experiments
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.840]   and everything that makes it so rich,
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:04.000]   all those presentations and writing.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.060]   And then finally, to be really focused
[00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:10.280]   on the art of rhetoric and thinking about
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:12.380]   how I can lead my neighbor to the truth
[00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:17.240]   in a winsome, compelling way where I'm checking myself first
[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:19.120]   for my argument, the holes in my argument,
[00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:21.880]   and I'm applying the logic that I've learned
[00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:25.280]   that has given me a sharp mind and I'm thinking about
[00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:27.680]   how I can choose my words carefully
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:29.360]   and learn to listen really well
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:32.840]   and respond in the way that my audience needs
[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:36.480]   and craft something like that for my particular audience.
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:38.160]   It's such a gift.
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:42.520]   I look at our world and we're coming up in an election year
[00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:47.160]   and I hear the way that we throw words around like weapons
[00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:50.160]   and here we've been given an opportunity
[00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:53.240]   to train up our kids to use their words
[00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:58.240]   in a way that helps persuade their neighbor to truth
[00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:02.720]   and perhaps woo them to the kingdom, by the way,
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:06.980]   that we, and of course, the work of the Holy Spirit
[00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:10.400]   to do that, but it's a leadership program
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:14.960]   and so this is the final year of learning to lead well
[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:19.960]   and looking back on the challenge for graduates that I know,
[00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:27.920]   I'm encouraged by our future,
[00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:31.280]   my grandchildren and great-grandchildren's future.
[00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:33.960]   And my kids look fondly back on this
[00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:36.280]   and that's why my daughter, Lucy, is looking forward
[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:38.160]   and she's like, I've been waiting
[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:40.920]   since I was eight years old to do this.
[00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:42.660]   I can't wait to do this next year.
[00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:44.280]   I think it's exactly what I need.
[00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:46.700]   I need to wrestle with these things too
[00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:49.040]   and also share that with my brother and sister,
[00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:51.160]   that legacy and inheritance
[00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:53.840]   that we're trying to pass on with them.
[00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:58.840]   But I mean, even when we study the Greek and Roman gods,
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:02.800]   the students are singing that song for foundations.
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:04.600]   - Yes, yes, yes.
[00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:09.600]   - Everything really does build to prepare them for that.
[00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:15.220]   - Yes, and I can remember watching my own girls
[00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:18.440]   go through their challenge for a year
[00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:23.440]   and get so much out of their community discussions,
[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:29.640]   to go to class and to talk to classmates
[00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:33.580]   about what they read and sometimes to discover
[00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:37.160]   that their classmates had much different ideas
[00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:41.000]   or positions from the same reading.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   But by challenge four, it was beautiful in the way
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:52.560]   that they offered grace to one another.
[00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:56.700]   Oh, it wasn't, well, something must be wrong with you
[00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:58.680]   because you didn't arrive at the same conclusion
[00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:02.440]   that I did, it was more like, that is so interesting,
[00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:04.900]   will you help me to understand it?
[00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:05.940]   Will you help me see it?
[00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:09.820]   Oh, I never considered that or even, huh,
[00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:11.500]   well, what if you thought about it this way,
[00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:15.760]   would you still think the way that you originally reacted?
[00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:19.520]   It just the thoughtful give and take of questions
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:24.520]   and the whole idea that we could have discourse
[00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:31.260]   without dishonoring one another
[00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:36.560]   and that we can have discourse that included disagreement
[00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:41.160]   that did not sever relationships
[00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:46.160]   and did not halt a conversation or halt the learning
[00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:51.160]   is just, you alluded to it, it's not synonymous
[00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:54.560]   with what we see in the wider world today.
[00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:57.000]   - What our students do in class does not look like
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.920]   what people are mostly doing.
[00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:01.780]   - No.
[00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:06.740]   - As they discuss politics or religion
[00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:10.860]   or any other fraught with peril concern.
[00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:15.420]   - That's true, I think it's such an opportunity too.
[00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:19.640]   I mean, as in the history of classical Christian education,
[00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:23.160]   just as they're finishing right now,
[00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:25.020]   my students are studying philosophy
[00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:27.520]   and thinking about the big ideas
[00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:29.200]   and what thinkers have thought before us
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:31.060]   and asking big questions,
[00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:34.160]   which prepare them to apply these things
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:36.280]   to their study of the book of all books,
[00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:39.480]   the book of wonders, the Bible, God's very word
[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:43.400]   and that is to prepare them to study that together
[00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:48.400]   and so to have a year of, it's just a dessert year
[00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:50.960]   where you're really studying a lot of poetic language,
[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:52.920]   which helps you read your Bible better
[00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:55.600]   and you're really digging into scripture
[00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:57.200]   as part of the reasoning strand
[00:41:57.200 --> 00:42:00.040]   and having those conversations
[00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:02.240]   and learning to listen to each other,
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:04.080]   wouldn't that be a wonderful thing
[00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:06.240]   for the church at large to learn to do?
[00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:10.240]   And for families and relatives to learn to do that,
[00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:13.500]   neighbors to learn to do that, it's a gift.
[00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:16.800]   - Think how much we would learn from each other
[00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:21.040]   and I think how much happier we would be
[00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:24.080]   if we weren't afraid
[00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:32.200]   that our opinions or convictions
[00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:38.600]   were too flimsy to stand up to scrutiny.
[00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:42.560]   I think a lot of times we hold our positions
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:48.520]   in barbed fists because we are afraid
[00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:52.720]   that they are not well considered enough to stand up
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:55.320]   under quote unquote attack
[00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:59.520]   and so we just don't dialogue,
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:03.220]   we just monologue to people.
[00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:05.340]   People stand next to each other
[00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:08.280]   and just because they're both talking back and forth
[00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:10.220]   does not mean there's a dialogue.
[00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:12.440]   Sometimes there's completely closed mind
[00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:14.800]   on each side of that conversation
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:18.360]   and what I love about challenge four is
[00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:20.680]   that's not encouraged.
[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:25.240]   We are gonna have dialogues and not parallel monologues
[00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:30.240]   and it's beautiful and sometimes hard
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:35.240]   and sometimes messy and oftentimes uncomfortable
[00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:39.080]   but infinitely worth it.
[00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:39.920]   - I agree.
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:42.680]   I also think it's an opportunity to grow in humility.
[00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:47.700]   To be able to say I don't know
[00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:52.000]   or I was wrong or I think I believe this
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.960]   but what do you think, what does the Bible say?
[00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:56.920]   Let's look together.
[00:43:56.920 --> 00:43:59.980]   Let's go home and think about this question,
[00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:02.800]   ask our pastors, dig into the Bible
[00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:04.600]   and come back and revisit it next week
[00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:08.580]   and to see the students, they often tend to gravitate
[00:44:08.580 --> 00:44:11.720]   towards one big question sometimes or a couple
[00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:13.500]   and I'm not saying your student would graduate
[00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:15.920]   from challenge four with all their questions answered
[00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:18.800]   because you ask your whole life,
[00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:20.260]   they're big important questions
[00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:23.340]   and worth pursuing those answers to
[00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:28.340]   but having that practice together in a place
[00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:31.240]   where you can trust each other and learn from each other
[00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:35.240]   and try to practice virtue as you seek wisdom
[00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:36.720]   is really worth it.
[00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:37.640]   It's a rare gift.
[00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:40.640]   - It really is.
[00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:41.480]   It really is.
[00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:45.240]   Okay, so parents that are listening to this who think,
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:47.220]   man, I wish I had been able to do this.
[00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:50.400]   Can I personally sign up for challenge four myself?
[00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:55.400]   How can we as parents help our students?
[00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:57.120]   What's the parent's role?
[00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:02.880]   - I think the most important thing to do is to pray
[00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:04.920]   and to remember your purpose
[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:07.840]   and to seek God's kingdom first
[00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:10.920]   and to then encourage your students to coach them,
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:15.100]   especially important to listen to them
[00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:16.820]   with their big questions often,
[00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:18.820]   which are not convenient times for us.
[00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:21.880]   - Yes, oh my goodness, that's so true.
[00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:26.880]   - Just to be there and be willing to also let them disagree
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:31.480]   with us as parents and to seek truth together.
[00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:32.660]   I think that's important
[00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:38.500]   because they learn that their questions matter.
[00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:41.900]   So some kids are gonna need more coaching
[00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:43.820]   and more accountability.
[00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:46.680]   And you know your child best,
[00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:50.780]   like what your child needs and what you need to work on.
[00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:55.640]   One of my kids needed a lot of coaching for different,
[00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:57.840]   they all need a different coaching for different seminars.
[00:45:57.840 --> 00:45:59.360]   - They all need different kinds of things, yeah.
[00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:01.120]   - Yeah, we all have different giftings.
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:04.560]   We're all in different places of learning all the time.
[00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:09.560]   So encouragement and pointing them to Christ
[00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:11.480]   is the most important thing.
[00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:14.040]   And then just being there to disciple them.
[00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:17.720]   I think if you have the book, "The Conversation",
[00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:22.720]   my favorite chapter, which I try to read it every year,
[00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:25.580]   is the one called "Confident Parents".
[00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:27.580]   It's at the beginning of the "Conversation" book.
[00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:32.100]   And in there Lee reminds us that
[00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:36.360]   of what the point of this whole thing is,
[00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:39.760]   what we should be pursuing together.
[00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:43.760]   And I think going to practicum,
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:46.160]   meeting with like-minded people,
[00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:51.160]   talking to your tutor and seeking what's best
[00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:56.160]   for your student is really important.
[00:46:56.160 --> 00:47:00.920]   And reminding your student of the reasons,
[00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:03.600]   because we all forget, especially in February.
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:06.320]   - Yes, especially in hard times or when you're tired
[00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:08.400]   or when you're tired of it, yeah.
[00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:10.200]   - Yeah, yeah, talk to them.
[00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:12.640]   I mean, like I really want my students at home
[00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:15.960]   and my students in challenge to be able to articulate
[00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:18.640]   the kind of education that given and explain it
[00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:21.160]   to someone else 'cause they're asked all the time.
[00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:22.480]   - Exactly, yeah.
[00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:25.980]   - So help them, help them ask those questions
[00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:30.980]   and make time to talk to them, encourage them and coach them.
[00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:34.440]   - Well, I have to say, Brittany, you have given us
[00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:39.440]   so many good, inspiring, heartfelt reasons
[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:43.240]   to stick it out for challenge four,
[00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:47.200]   to pursue that glorious end
[00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:49.560]   to this beautiful educational journey
[00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:52.480]   that we've been on with our children.
[00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:54.880]   I really appreciate that.
[00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:59.880]   If you had one sentence to say to a family,
[00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:04.360]   who's trying to decide, am I gonna stay?
[00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:07.840]   Are we gonna stay this course for this last year?
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:10.080]   Or are we gonna go pursue something else?
[00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:12.080]   What would you say?
[00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:17.080]   - I would say, please consider prayerfully persevering
[00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:18.800]   for the last leg of the climb.
[00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:21.400]   Sometimes that takes a big leap of faith
[00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:23.880]   because we don't know what it's going to offer our students,
[00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:26.340]   our particular student, or we doubt that.
[00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:31.280]   But one of my favorite chapters from Wendell Berry,
[00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:34.240]   Standing by Words, he says that,
[00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:36.360]   and he's talking about marriage,
[00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:39.780]   but I think it could apply to just sticking and staying
[00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:42.480]   and not knowing what's going to happen.
[00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:44.520]   He says, "The faith rather is that by staying
[00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:46.900]   "and only by staying, we'll learn something of the truth,
[00:48:46.900 --> 00:48:48.700]   "that the truth is good to know,
[00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:49.920]   "that it's always both different
[00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:51.920]   "and larger than we thought."
[00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:55.140]   And I've found that students don't really know sometimes,
[00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:56.720]   or they doubt why they should be there,
[00:48:56.720 --> 00:48:58.640]   or if it's for them.
[00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:03.400]   But upon staying and digging in, they reap such a harvest.
[00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:06.040]   It's a practical preparation for a pilgrim's life
[00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:07.200]   and a secular world.
[00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:10.780]   It's a final capstone year of soul fattening education
[00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:13.300]   that's focused on growing Christian leaders,
[00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:14.900]   preparing them for the world's fight
[00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:17.000]   and the soul's salvation, as David Hicks says,
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:18.020]   in Norm's Inability.
[00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:22.540]   And I just wanna encourage you to check it out,
[00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:25.560]   find someone in your community who has done it
[00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:30.560]   and talked to them and go for it, don't leave.
[00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:35.380]   It's been such a gift to our family,
[00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:38.260]   and so that's why I feel so passionately about it,
[00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:40.680]   and a gift to me too, and to my husband,
[00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:43.940]   as we've grown alongside our kids and in our community.
[00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:47.900]   Trees, one of my favorite images
[00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:50.520]   that I used in a graduation speech a few years ago
[00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:52.180]   for my daughter, Isabelle's class,
[00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:56.780]   because my dear friends had recently bought property
[00:49:56.780 --> 00:49:59.220]   and they had these giant pecan trees
[00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:01.420]   growing around their house, and they kind of worried
[00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:04.660]   'cause they were so tall, like what happens in a storm?
[00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:06.380]   So they had an arborist out, and they said,
[00:50:06.380 --> 00:50:09.800]   "Well, those trees actually are stronger
[00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:12.160]   "because they've grown their roots together.
[00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:13.260]   "They stand in a storm."
[00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:15.600]   - Oh, yes!
[00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:18.580]   - So if you have the blessing of having trees
[00:50:18.580 --> 00:50:23.100]   that have grown together, it's worth staying
[00:50:23.100 --> 00:50:27.660]   and finding out the fruit that comes from that one more year.
[00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:29.660]   - Brittany, that is beautiful.
[00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:31.900]   Thank you so much for sharing.
[00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:35.780]   Families, I hope that you have been inspired.
[00:50:35.780 --> 00:50:40.260]   I hope that this has moved you to prayerfully
[00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:45.260]   and thoughtfully consider what God has for your family
[00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:47.460]   at the end of your journey.
[00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:51.940]   Brittany, thank you for sharing from your heart so very much.
[00:50:51.940 --> 00:50:56.940]   Parents, I know that we are all trying to do our very best
[00:50:56.940 --> 00:51:02.160]   for our children and for our families.
[00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:04.920]   And parents, you may be thinking,
[00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:07.100]   "I wish I knew better how to do this.
[00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:08.220]   "I wish I could be Brittany.
[00:51:08.220 --> 00:51:10.920]   "I wish I had the right questions to ask
[00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:14.460]   "or the right way to assess or the right way to help."
[00:51:14.460 --> 00:51:17.740]   I wanna tell you just as we break,
[00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:19.540]   I wanna tell you about something
[00:51:19.540 --> 00:51:23.100]   that I think might really bless your family
[00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:26.260]   and bless you as the lead learner in your home.
[00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:31.420]   It's the Classical Learning Cohort.
[00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:35.740]   You can join the Classical Learning Cohort
[00:51:35.740 --> 00:51:39.340]   and you meet online six times through a semester
[00:51:39.340 --> 00:51:42.380]   with a small group of other parents
[00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:45.060]   who are on that mission to grow their understanding
[00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:46.940]   about classical education.
[00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:48.740]   You and this small group of parents
[00:51:48.740 --> 00:51:52.540]   meet with an experienced mentor
[00:51:52.540 --> 00:51:57.420]   who can really give you some hands-on practical ideas
[00:51:57.420 --> 00:51:59.380]   of how to get better and better.
[00:51:59.380 --> 00:52:03.860]   If you want more information about this,
[00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:08.860]   go to classicalconversations.com/cohort.
[00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:12.260]   Registration has already begun,
[00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:17.260]   so don't wait and check out classicalconversations.com/cohort
[00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:24.020]   for more information on the Classical Learning Cohort.
[00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:28.180]   It will help you to become the lead learner
[00:52:28.180 --> 00:52:31.740]   that you want to be in order to help your children
[00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:34.020]   be all that God is calling them to be
[00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:37.420]   through this education that you're offering to them.
[00:52:37.420 --> 00:52:39.220]   Brittany, thank you again.
[00:52:39.220 --> 00:52:40.620]   I appreciate you, friend.
[00:52:40.620 --> 00:52:43.300]   I'm praying for you and for your band
[00:52:43.300 --> 00:52:47.340]   of Challenge 3 students as they hopefully become
[00:52:47.340 --> 00:52:50.060]   a posse of Challenge 4 students
[00:52:50.060 --> 00:52:52.860]   riding together to the end of that journey.
[00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:55.420]   - Thank you.
[00:52:55.420 --> 00:52:59.700]   - Families, I appreciate you and I'll see you next week.
[00:52:59.700 --> 00:53:00.540]   Bye-bye.
[00:53:00.540 --> 00:53:02.540]   Thank you.
