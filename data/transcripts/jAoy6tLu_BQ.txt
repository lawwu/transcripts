[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Well, when do we unfollow our Christian leaders?
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   When does our loyalty to God override our loyalty to a certain church?
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   We get the question from a listener named Peggy.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   "Hello, Pastor John. I have a burning question for you to answer.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   As Christians, do we pledge our loyalty to church or to God,
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   and when and how should that line be drawn?"
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   The way I answer Peggy will depend on what she is referring to
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   when she says "loyalty to church."
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   Does she mean loyalty to the people of God as a whole,
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   namely the church universal, consisting of all the children of God
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   who were ever born again through the Holy Spirit, through the gospel?
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   Or does she mean one particular local expression of that church?
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   She may not even be thinking of that distinction,
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   but it's an important one, so I'm going to answer her at both levels.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   So first, church universal, and then specific church.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Three different witnesses in the New Testament—Paul and John and Peter—
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   three different witnesses tell us that to be united to God in Christ
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   is to be united in principle and in love to the people of God.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   We're not permitted to choose between belonging to God and belonging to his people.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   They go together, always.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   To have God is to have the family of God.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   To have the Father is to have his children as brothers and sisters.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   No escaping about it. That's the way it is.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   And to love the Father is to love the children.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   So here's John's testimony.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   1 John 5:1, "Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God,
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   and everyone who loves the Father loves whoever has been born of him."
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   So you can't say, "I'm going to love God and be faithful to that relationship,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   and I'm going to have nothing to do with Christians."
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   It cannot be done. You cannot say that. That's a contradiction.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Here's 1 John 3:14, "We know that we have passed out of death into life
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   because we love the brothers.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   The very reality of being born again and thus belonging to God as our Father
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   can only be known if we love Christian brothers and sisters."
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   You don't love them, then you can't know that you belong to God.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   And here's 1 John 4:20, "If anyone says, 'I love God,' and hates his brother,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   he's a liar." John is clear. He cuts a straight row.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   The text goes on, "For he who does not love his brother whom he has seen
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   cannot love God whom he has not seen."
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   So you can't honestly claim to love God or have loyalty to God
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   where there's no love for his children, your brothers and sisters.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   So that's John's witness. Here's Paul.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   This is 1 Corinthians 12:12, "We, though many, are one body in Christ
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   and individually members of one another."
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   So to be grafted into Christ's body by faith, united to him,
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   is to be members of one another.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   So to be in Christ is to be attached to other members of the body.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   You can't have it any other way.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Here's Peter's testimony. This is 1 Peter 2:4, "As you come to him, Christ,
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   the living stone rejected by men but in God's sight, chosen and precious,
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   you yourselves are like living stones being built up as a spiritual house
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   to be a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices."
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   In other words, to come to Christ, the living stone,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   is to be built with other little living stones like yourself into a house.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   You cannot come to him on any other terms.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   So I conclude loyalty to God in Jesus Christ necessarily includes loyalty of love to his people.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   That's the universal church, Christians wherever you find them.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   Second, what about loyalty to a specific local church?
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   And my guess is Peggy's talking about this.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   I think all the New Testament language of membership in Christ and in the body
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   implies taking membership in a local church very seriously,
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   but this loyalty is not absolute like the loyalty to the people of God in general.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   And we know this because there are New Testament instructions
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   which imply that a church leadership can be unworthy of being followed,
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   which would imply no longer putting yourself under the ministry of that leadership.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   For example, 1 Timothy 5.19 talks about what happens when an elder ceases to be qualified to be an elder.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Here's what happens.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   "Do not admit a charge against an elder except on the evidence of two or three witnesses."
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   What suppose you do have three witnesses? And they are guilty.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   "As for those who persist in sin, elders who persist in sin,"
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   in other words, they're no longer qualified,
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   "rebuke them in the presence of all so that the rest may stand in fear."
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   Now that implies that if this principle of handling unqualified elders is not carried out,
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   the people may have no choice but to dissociate from unqualified elders.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   That's the meaning of unqualified. They can't lead anymore, so they're not going to lead us.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   And if they won't step down from leadership because of their disqualification,
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   then we have to step out from under their leadership in order to be obedient to that text, I think.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   I would say this is the case in thousands of churches who have pastors who do not believe in the basic truths of the gospel.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   Two more examples. In 1 Corinthians 5.11, it says,
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   "But now I am writing to you not to associate with anyone who bears the name brother if he is guilty of sexual immorality or greed
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   or is an idolater or reviler or drunkard or swindler, not even to eat with such a one."
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   Well, what if it's your pastor who is sleeping around guilty of greed, an embezzler, idolater, reviler, drunkard, swindler?
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   What if it's your pastor who's living in sexual immorality?
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   And what if the other elders are complicit and they're not bringing him to discipline?
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   Or no denominational structures are being implemented to discipline him?
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Well, then the text says you're not supposed to have anything to do with him, so you clearly wouldn't sit under his ministry anymore.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   One more example. 2 John 1.10, "If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, namely the apostolic teaching,
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   do not receive him into your house or give him any greeting, for whoever greets him takes part in his wicked works."
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   Okay, so what if it's your pastor who's not bringing the apostolic teaching and the elders are doing nothing about it?
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   The text says, "Don't even greet him."
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   And if you're not supposed to greet him, how much more would you not attend his church?
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   So my conclusion for Peggy is that she should realize that to belong to Jesus Christ and to be a child of her heavenly Father
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   binds her together in a love relationship, a loyal relationship with all true Christians.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   She may not be indifferent to loving them, and that means fellowshipping with them in some way.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   And she should delight in this and seek to find ways to live it out.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   But her allegiance to any specific local church depends on the leadership fulfilling its moral and spiritual and doctrinal responsibilities.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   Wow, some really careful thoughts here about when to unfollow our leaders.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for the great question, Peggy.

[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   Well, next time we meet, we're going to look at 1 Samuel 28 and how it was possible for Saul, the king of Israel,
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   to speak to a dead man through a witch.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   Is that even possible in the first place?
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   And no doubt we're going to get into a broader discussion of fortune-telling and necromancers and palm readers and the like.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   That's on Friday.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
