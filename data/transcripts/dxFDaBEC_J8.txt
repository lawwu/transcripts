[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.340]   All right, it's day three.
[00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.420]   I've been doing a lot of tests with video and audio
[00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.240]   to figure out like what's the best way to do this
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.080]   and how do I do it as cheaply as possible
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.960]   'cause again, I'm still unemployed.
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.800]   And so I did a few things.
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.960]   For recording the video, I'm using a MacBook Pro.
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.240]   This is just my personal machine.
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.520]   I'm using Zoom and I tested QuickTime.
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.880]   Zoom is cool.
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.160]   If you have the ability to record to your desktop,
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.000]   it's great.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.560]   You get an audio and video file.
[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:40.960]   I haven't done video edits yet,
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.240]   but I assume it'll be helpful
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.960]   once I get to that part of the process.
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.400]   And then I use QuickTime.
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.000]   QuickTime seems to be great.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.320]   So I think for my solo videos, I'm gonna do QuickTime.
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.960]   And then when I do my interviews, I'm gonna use Zoom.
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.640]   And that was the first part of it.
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.360]   I did some video tests
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.280]   and then it came down to equipment and lighting.
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.960]   Again, I wear glasses,
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.600]   so I can't do big green lights everywhere
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.680]   'cause you'll see it on my glasses.
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.000]   And my house is not very well decorated.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.840]   I don't have these really cool, interesting backgrounds
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.800]   like most YouTubers have.
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.280]   I'll probably need to figure that out
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.180]   and stage something or maybe get a green screen
[00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.480]   or a backdrop.
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.360]   So this, again, I'm gonna be in this room
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.960]   until I figure something better.
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.640]   And I'm not sure if the doors and the walls are too busy,
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.320]   so I might shoot some video
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.120]   with just maybe a solid background.
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.400]   Like maybe when I'm interviewing people,
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.360]   so it's less distracting.
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.200]   I don't know.
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.320]   Still trying to figure that out.
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.280]   I did realize also lighting was important
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.240]   'cause the natural light,
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.360]   obviously it differs by time of day.
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.520]   I'm finding that 10 to 11 a.m. is really, really good
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.440]   'cause the sun's not super hot or bright
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.320]   and seems to be the most consistent.
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.440]   So that's what I'm gonna do.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.520]   I think that's gonna be my window.
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.520]   So every day I'm gonna prepare as much as I can.
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.160]   The next day I know that this 10 to 12 slot
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.040]   is like my video shooting window.
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.840]   I have canned lights in the ceiling,
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.680]   like the recessed lights,
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.120]   and it's right above me.
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.360]   And so it casts a crazy shadow.
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.000]   And so I'm trying to figure that out.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.840]   You might be wondering,
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.200]   "Whoa, why not just take off your hat?"
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.120]   Funny story, I don't know how I never noticed before,
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.720]   I can't keep my hairstyle consistent.
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.280]   There's some days I wake up,
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.520]   I've got a cowlick and I can't get it down,
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.080]   doesn't matter how much product.
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.520]   There's some days where my hair looks amazing.
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.360]   It's like, "Oh my God,
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.560]   "if I can shoot all the videos at once, that'd be great."
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.280]   'Cause it's just perfectly coiffed.
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.160]   It's doing its thing.
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.840]   It's like, right?
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.520]   And then the most normal days,
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.520]   like it doesn't look like that.
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.040]   It's like, it's all inconsistent.
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.920]   So I might default to this hat situation.
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.920]   Maybe eventually I have a brand cap or something like that,
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.080]   but then this is just one less thing for me to worry about.
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.560]   I'm aware of things like shadow.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.000]   And so again, someone who's more of a video purist,
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.280]   like they might critique me on that.
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.240]   I did notice because my lights above me are really,
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.840]   really hot, my forehead shines.
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.440]   And so maybe I need to use like some powder
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.760]   from my wife or something.
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.080]   I did put a piece of paper over the can light
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.840]   to kind of soften it a little bit.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.120]   The first major purchase I made though was this.
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.960]   This is a Blue Yeti mic.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.400]   I got this off of Amazon.
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.920]   Again, I looked at all my options available.
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.160]   My budget, quite frankly, I was like,
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.440]   "Dude, I need to spend something that's $120 or less."
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.600]   And I'm at home, so I've always got people running around.
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.680]   Hi.
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.680]   Anyways, that's life, right?
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.760]   So basically, this Blue Yeti mic,
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.400]   it's about 120 on Amazon.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.960]   But then there's a sale right now for like $99.
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.760]   And then Best Buy price matched it.
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.080]   And so I got this one at Best Buy
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.480]   'cause if I wanna return to the store, maybe it's easier.
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.440]   It does allow me to change the gain and has different modes.
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.040]   So if I were to ever sit across from a guest,
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.160]   we would use the same one.
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.960]   It's just easy to do and has a mute button
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.920]   because I don't know, maybe sometimes I wanna scratch my nose
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.240]   or whatever it is, I bump something
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.400]   and I just need to mute it.
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.760]   Or I have kids walking around my room
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.280]   like they do right now.
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.960]   So that's my first major purchase.
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.240]   So far, I'm pretty happy with it.
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.200]   The quality of it seems pretty good.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.120]   I probably need to get a foam thing
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.920]   so it does my P pronunciations,
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.640]   don't shock the microphone.
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.320]   But this is where I'm at.
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.920]   This is my first purchase, guys.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.080]   [NO SPEECH]
