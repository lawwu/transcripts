[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480]   social wealth is all about your depth and breadth of connection to the people around you both your
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.120]   kind of inner circle of like true deep, what I call darkest hour friends, and then the broader
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.360]   circles of looser connections, your broader connection to communities that extend beyond
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.880]   yourself, spiritual communities, local regional communities, etc. And then social wealth is also
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.320]   about how you interact with others around wealth, the idea of status and how it plays into your
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.200]   life. Building social wealth is fundamentally what allows you to enjoy any of the other types of
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.880]   wealth. No one dreams of having a private jet and being alone. You know, no one wants to have a whole
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.680]   ton of money and no one to dote upon no one to create experiences with building social wealth
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.720]   is fundamentally at the core of living a happy, healthy, wealthy existence. There is scientific
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.320]   evidence at the strength of your relationships is the single greatest predictor of your health as
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.760]   as you age over time.
