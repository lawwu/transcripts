[00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.360]   Welcome, everyone, to the 33rd edition
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.060]   of Vogelheads on Investing.
[00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.480]   Today, our special guest is Jeff Patak.
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.720]   Jeff has been an analyst and manager at Morningstar
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.540]   for nearly 20 years.
[00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.440]   And today, we're going to talk about active management
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.720]   versus passive index investing.
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:38.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.720]   Hi, everyone.
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.600]   My name is Rick Ferry, and I'm the host
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.880]   of Vogelheads on Investing.
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.800]   This podcast, as with all podcasts,
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.040]   is sponsored by the John C. Vogel Center
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.840]   for Financial Literacy, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.840]   that you can find at vogelcenter.net,
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.920]   where your tax-deductible contributions are
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.680]   greatly appreciated.
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.200]   Today, our special guest is Jeff Patak.
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.200]   Jeff has been an analyst at Morningstar
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.000]   for almost 20 years.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.480]   He has in-depth knowledge of active management strategies,
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.600]   index versus active management, and Jeff knows the score.
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.800]   Now, some of the terms that you're going to hear today
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.200]   might be a little geekish, like five-factor model,
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.840]   three-factor model, regression analysis, and so forth.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.840]   We kind of throw them around a little bit,
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.920]   but try to bear with us.
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.440]   When we're talking about all of that,
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.640]   we're trying to decipher whether or not
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.440]   the active managers actually have skill
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.640]   in outperforming their benchmark.
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.020]   And if so, how many, by how much, and for how long?
[00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.000]   So with no further ado, let me introduce Jeff Patak.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.120]   Welcome to the Vogelheads on Investing podcast, Jeff.
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.960]   - Well, it's my pleasure.
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.080]   Thank you so much for having me.
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.080]   - Jeff, you've been in the portfolio management analysis
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.200]   business for just about 20 years,
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.180]   and you've been on all aspects of it.
[00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.160]   You've actually been a advisor for Morningstar.
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.640]   You're an analyst for Morningstar.
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.880]   You're an equity analyst for Morningstar.
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.660]   You have a tremendous background
[00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.120]   in the active versus passive debate.
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.760]   But before we dig into that debate,
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.000]   I'd like to get a little background on you.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.160]   Tell us a little bit about your history
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.200]   and some interesting facts.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.020]   - Sure, sure.
[00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.120]   I'm happy to, and thanks again for having me.
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.680]   Yeah, I'm a Chicago area product.
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.840]   They can't get rid of me.
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.920]   I was born and raised here, went away for four years
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.460]   to school up at the University of Wisconsin in Madison,
[00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.800]   where I earned my bachelor's degree in accounting
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.360]   and promptly returned to Chicago
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.560]   and entered the public accounting profession,
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.480]   which is where I spent the first eight years of my career,
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.520]   first two of which were kind of banging the balance sheet,
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.400]   so to speak, as a commercial line auditor.
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.480]   The last six of which were where I was part
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.120]   of a national technical accounting and auditing think tank,
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.680]   I suppose you would say, which was,
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.760]   it so happened based in the Chicago area.
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.720]   And then when Anderson met its untimely demise,
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.280]   that was actually the catalyst for me to move over
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.080]   to Morningstar, which is what I did in 2002.
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.840]   So the silver lining for me was finding Morningstar,
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.080]   which is where I've made my career ever since.
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.480]   And as you mentioned, I've done stints.
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.840]   Originally, I started out as a fund analyst
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.760]   and then I've done stints in equity research, ETF research.
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.500]   I spent some time in the investment management part
[00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.840]   of our business.
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.680]   And then more recently, I returned to research,
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.740]   heading up our global manager research team.
[00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.800]   And the way to put that into context is we've got a team
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.640]   of over a hundred analysts globally,
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.600]   whose job it is to assess active and indexed mutual funds
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.960]   and ETFs and their equivalents on a qualitative basis
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.420]   that culminates in a rating called the analyst rating
[00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:06.260]   that they assign.
[00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.660]   And so I work arm in arm, I suppose you would say,
[00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.440]   with them in helping them to assign those ratings
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.920]   and push thought leadership into the market.
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.520]   So that's been the tour to this point.
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.120]   And then more recently, they asked me if I could help out
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.360]   as chief ratings officer.
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.920]   So now I spend a little bit more time focused
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.640]   on our rating systems and making sure
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.040]   that they're as usable and effective as possible.
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.360]   - Well, thanks.
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.240]   I want to frame today's conversation
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.040]   because this is my area.
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.680]   Meaning I've written a number of books on index funds.
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.720]   My first one that I wrote was back in the 1990s
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.360]   and then books on indexes,
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.760]   asset allocation using index funds, ETFs,
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.000]   a history of index investing and so forth.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.800]   This is my thing, so to speak.
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.160]   So I'd like to just get into the conversation,
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.400]   but I want to frame it for you.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.320]   This is the way I framed it in a book I wrote
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.000]   called "The Power of Passive Investing."
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   That starting out with the history of mutual funds
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.800]   and why they were created to begin with,
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.520]   with the first mutual fund being created in 1924.
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.040]   And it was for a very different purpose.
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.480]   Everything was actively managed back then.
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.480]   And mutual funds were created basically to offer people
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:34.520]   the ability to have a diversified portfolio of securities
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.760]   that the otherwise maybe could not have afforded.
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.640]   But it wasn't, according to John Bogle's 1951 thesis
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.960]   from Princeton, it wasn't for the purpose
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.080]   of outperforming the market.
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.800]   It was a convenience thing.
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.000]   Is that how you see it?
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.080]   - That's right.
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.520]   I think that traces the beginning of the arc of the industry
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.400]   and basically giving investors the ability
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.840]   to pool their capital, so to speak.
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.840]   And it may be in ways where they don't court
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.560]   onerous trade-offs that they would have courted
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.200]   if they'd been trying to invest in individual securities,
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.800]   transaction costs, being an example.
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.480]   Not that it was a free ride in the early mutual funds,
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.720]   but I'm sure that there were some efficiencies
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.320]   that investors, in addition to the conveniences
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.680]   that they gained, there were efficiencies
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.520]   that they also reached.
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.120]   - Let's spring forward to, again,
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.720]   some of the early research on active mutual fund performance
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.400]   was done well before the first index funds were created.
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.760]   The work that I did in looking at data
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:42.720]   and studies that were done far back as the 1930s
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:47.720]   by Alfred Cowles, but by going forward over the years
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:53.240]   by Bogle and various academics in the 1960s,
[00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.920]   all seemed to point to the fact
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.600]   that these actively managed funds
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.440]   were, in fact, not outperforming the markets.
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.440]   In fact, some did, but most, by and large, did not.
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.400]   But again, it wasn't a concern at the time
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:13.560]   because the purpose for having mutual funds
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:17.240]   was to just get diversification in a relatively easy way
[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.600]   by pooling capital together, as you said.
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.560]   But it was these studies on active management
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.920]   that led to a lot of questions about,
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.120]   well, why isn't there an index fund
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.800]   that tracks, say, the S&P 500?
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:34.880]   Why do you suppose that was?
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:38.720]   Why did it take so long to create an S&P 500 index fund?
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.160]   Which, by the way, didn't get created until 1975
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.800]   and actually went public in 1976.
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:49.960]   - So, I think that maybe, not to widen out too much,
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.680]   but I think that maybe it's something
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.520]   that's innate to the American spirit.
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:59.480]   We're strivers, and I think that perhaps
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.320]   it just comes naturally to us
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:05.960]   to not just try to attain a goal, but to exceed it.
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.680]   And say what you will about active management,
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:12.360]   but the name of the game there is to try to clear the bar.
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:15.840]   And so, I think that that's probably one reason.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:20.760]   I think that incentives are probably another reason.
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:23.520]   There's probably a whole sort of litany of reasons
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.880]   that we can cite why it took a while.
[00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.880]   I would suppose another barrier
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:31.160]   was it just, it seems counterintuitive.
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:35.440]   And we still find ourselves having to dispel this notion,
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.680]   but there's sort of that whole idea,
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:42.680]   why would you settle for average in an index fund,
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:45.480]   which is literally what it strives to deliver you in
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.840]   so far as it does a good job of tracking
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.880]   whatever market segment it's seeking to track.
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:54.000]   Where it's above average is once you take fees
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.920]   into consideration and other frictions
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.680]   you would otherwise encounter in an active strategy,
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.240]   you end up doing better than average.
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:05.360]   And those excess returns compound over time,
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.920]   and that's one of the reasons why index funds
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:12.440]   are as formidable as they are in many market segments.
[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:13.800]   But that could be a tough sell.
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:16.120]   It doesn't intuit, I think, for a lot of people.
[00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:17.760]   And so, I think that when you take
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.120]   the three of those things together, we're strivers.
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.760]   There's incentives that maybe conspire against indexing,
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.640]   and it's also something that doesn't immediately intuit.
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:30.240]   That's probably three reasons why indexing took a little
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.240]   while to really take root.
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:36.280]   I'll add a fourth reason, and that is cost.
[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:40.960]   Meaning that prior to, I think it was 1975,
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:44.960]   there were fixed commissions in the exchanges
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:49.960]   where it cost a lot of money to buy 500 stocks in a fund.
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:53.440]   And if you had money coming in and out
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:56.320]   of a mutual fund like an index fund would have,
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.720]   they would have to go to the market,
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:01.280]   and in order to keep it somewhat balanced
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:06.280]   or tracking the index, they'd have to buy and sell
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:09.400]   a lot of individual securities, and with fixed commissions,
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:12.240]   I think it probably made it prohibitively expensive
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:16.640]   until, I believe it was 1975, when Congress did away
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:20.080]   with fixed commission costs, and that spawned companies
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:22.760]   like Charles Schwab and discount brokerage firms.
[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:27.000]   That's right, and then I think if we were to focus on,
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.760]   you know, maybe the last decade or so
[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:32.800]   when we've seen this torrential shift
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:36.280]   from commission-based to fee-based advice,
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:38.840]   I mean, changes in advice practices
[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:42.120]   are probably something else that have ushered in indexing.
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.080]   Now, indexing had arrived by then,
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:47.440]   and I think that some of the factors that we focused on
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:50.600]   explain why it had arrived, but I think if we're looking
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:54.640]   for one of the factors that explains why the demand
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:57.920]   for indexing has accelerated to the extent that it has
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.840]   in recent years, I think that that's probably
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:02.440]   a pretty pivotal shift to talk about.
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:04.960]   You know, the fact that for many advice givers,
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.720]   it was more about planning or what they might call
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:10.840]   behavioral modification or tax management,
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:13.320]   rather than going out and trying to capture alpha,
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.960]   and so then the name of the game became
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.760]   to try to lower the internal cost, investment cost,
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.840]   or whatever it is they were delivering.
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:23.520]   You know, that's a pretty pivotal development, I think,
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:26.880]   in the overall adoption of indexing,
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:30.040]   which is a bit unique to, I think, the last 10 or 15 years.
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:34.040]   - Now, I have a thesis, and I know you may not agree with it,
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:37.120]   that I wrote about in "The Power of Passive Investing,"
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:41.040]   and I've said several times, is that the evolution
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:46.040]   of mutual funds into indexing caused actively managed funds
[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:49.640]   to become obsolete, at least for the purpose
[00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:51.800]   in which they were created, which was simply
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.680]   to offer people a diversified portfolio
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:57.120]   of individual securities, not trying
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:00.360]   to outperform the market, but just to have a portfolio
[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:03.160]   that's diversified by pulling your assets together
[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:06.320]   in a fairly low-cost way, rather than going out
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:09.360]   and trying to buy a portfolio of multiple stocks
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.560]   with high commissions and so forth,
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:15.000]   that when indexing came along, it was a better mousetrap.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.320]   I mean, it did that better than actively managed funds,
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:21.520]   at least that portion of it, which is probably
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:26.520]   why Ed Johnson from Fidelity said this
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:32.200]   when John Bogle launched the first index mutual fund
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:34.520]   at Vanguard, now the S&P 500 fund.
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:37.480]   He said, "I can't believe that the great mass
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:40.080]   "of investors are going to be satisfied
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:43.640]   "with just receiving average returns.
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:46.720]   "The name of the game is to be the best."
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.440]   And this gets to your concept of, well,
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:53.680]   people have animal spirits and are trying to outperform.
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:57.040]   But to me, this was a big shift in active management.
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:02.000]   Up until the time indexing came along in the 1970s,
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.600]   it was more about being able to get
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:07.240]   a diversified portfolio of stocks
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:09.400]   at a relatively reasonable cost
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:11.480]   and not about beating the market.
[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:16.080]   But the introduction of index funds in the 1970s
[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.880]   caused this pivot in active management.
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:22.840]   Now the name of the game was to beat the market.
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.200]   Would you agree with that?
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.440]   - I would agree with that.
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:29.360]   Yeah, one of the predicates, like you point out,
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:33.600]   of active funds was to deliver that market exposure.
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:36.600]   So it was beta and alpha.
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.960]   And as you say, as some of these barriers
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:43.160]   and frictions were sanded away,
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.400]   as maybe some of the intellectual resistance
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:50.400]   to indexing fell away, then beta also fell away
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.000]   as a predicate for active.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.440]   And it became all about alpha.
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:57.280]   And so, like you say, the value proposition has changed.
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:00.160]   And as those expectations have shifted,
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:03.240]   I think that you can argue that it's become
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.320]   an even more stiflingly competitive environment
[00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:07.400]   for active funds than before,
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:10.840]   which somewhat turns on its head the early orthodoxy,
[00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:13.920]   which held that as more people embraced passive,
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:18.440]   it would create greater inefficiency in the market.
[00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:21.440]   And it would be a turkey shoot for active funds
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:23.360]   because they would have all these opportunities
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:25.000]   that they could easily pick off.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.880]   And I think that what research has found,
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:30.600]   work that we've done and a copious amount
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.600]   that's been done by academics and others,
[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:35.760]   is that if anything, it's becoming more difficult.
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:39.320]   So again, it sort of upends that early orthodox funds
[00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:43.520]   would have a better go of it once indexing made inroads.
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:46.280]   - I have to give a shout out to Larry Suedro,
[00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:50.160]   who co-wrote a book, "The Incredible Shrinking Alpha,"
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.000]   which highlights exactly what you're talking about.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.120]   You would think that with all of this indexing going on,
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:57.400]   that active managers would have an easier time
[00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:00.400]   of outperforming when in fact, it's become more competitive
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.360]   and more difficult to outperform.
[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:05.800]   And there's no evidence whatsoever that an increase
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:09.320]   in indexing has caused better performance
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:10.600]   in the active management space.
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.120]   In fact, you can make an argument that the opposite
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:14.840]   has actually occurred.
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:17.400]   Let me jump into some research that I did,
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:21.240]   and that is portfolios of index funds
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:25.280]   versus portfolios of actively managed funds.
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.320]   And here's a little bit different dynamic.
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:29.920]   Since it's so difficult for active managers
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:32.000]   to outperform the markets,
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.720]   it doesn't matter what the category is,
[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:35.040]   could be bonds, could be stocks,
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:37.720]   and we're gonna get into the data in a little bit here.
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:42.720]   But if all you had was a portfolio of a few index funds,
[00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:45.800]   the probability of that portfolio
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:50.480]   outperforming a portfolio of actively managed funds
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:53.120]   is higher than the probability
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:55.520]   of any of the individual index funds
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:59.880]   outperforming active funds in their particular category.
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:01.880]   So as we look at each individual category,
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:04.520]   we can see that U.S. stock, large cap,
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:08.040]   there's a X percent chance index funds will outperform,
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:12.000]   and then international, same way, and bonds, same way.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.800]   And so you have all these individual silos,
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:15.440]   individual categories,
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:18.000]   but when you're looking at portfolios,
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.800]   if all you did was put together a portfolio
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.240]   of all index funds,
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:24.720]   the probability that that portfolio
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:27.360]   will outperform a portfolio of all active funds
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:30.840]   actually goes up even higher than the individual silos.
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:32.920]   - It would make sense.
[00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:36.200]   I know we're not talking about taxable versus pre-tax.
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.280]   If it's taxable, then it's fairly academic.
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:40.160]   That's not something we talked about to this point,
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.960]   and maybe we will later in the conversation,
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:44.520]   but I know that you and we have done work
[00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:48.800]   looking at the performance of active funds after tax,
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.520]   and it's grim.
[00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:53.760]   You basically, as far as I'm concerned,
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:56.600]   if you're looking to invest actively,
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.680]   do it in a qualified account,
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:00.800]   because if you do it in a taxable account,
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:04.520]   you're likely to be eaten alive by taxes over time
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:07.360]   to say nothing of just the challenges that you face
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:08.720]   in succeeding with active.
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:11.320]   It's possible it's very, very difficult
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:13.640]   within a taxable account.
[00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:15.080]   As far as a qualified account
[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:18.200]   and kind of doing the kind of acid tests you described,
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:19.680]   that makes sense to me.
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:22.280]   The cost advantages compound.
[00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:25.560]   I wonder if, and maybe your research found this,
[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:29.680]   there was also some benefits to style purity
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:32.040]   and unadulterated market exposure
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:34.520]   that you would get through index products
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:36.680]   that perhaps you wouldn't get through
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:40.320]   a basket of comparatively messier active funds
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:42.200]   that have exposures to different styles.
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:44.200]   I know that our research has found that,
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.280]   generally speaking, you will find that active funds
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:50.040]   do a little bit better in markets that are selling off,
[00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.360]   and we can talk again about why that is.
[00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:54.600]   But in rising markets, generally speaking,
[00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:56.480]   index products will do better
[00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:58.480]   just because they tend to be a bit more style pure,
[00:17:58.480 --> 00:17:59.680]   and so I wonder if you're picking up
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:01.040]   a little bit of that as well.
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:03.280]   But generally speaking, if you keep the cost down,
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:06.080]   you keep it simple, and you keep your market exposures on,
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:08.000]   and the market cooperates with you,
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.360]   I would expect that kind of outcome.
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.280]   - Yeah, let's get into the style purity
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:14.840]   and also something called survivorship bias
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:16.480]   in a lot of the data.
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:20.320]   There is a concept called Dunn's Law.
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:22.160]   Have you ever heard of Dunn's Law?
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:23.000]   - I have, yes.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.200]   - Yeah, basically it just says exactly what you said,
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.040]   that when markets are going up,
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:30.600]   in that portion of the market that is outperforming,
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:33.480]   index funds tend to outperform
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:35.600]   because the managers are messy,
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:37.720]   and they're not style pure.
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:41.240]   But in that segment of the market that's not doing well
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:44.600]   is underperforming the rest of the market,
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:46.760]   the active managers tend to do better
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:49.560]   because the active managers are messy,
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:51.960]   and they're not holding to their style.
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:55.440]   Style purity and the consistency of active managers
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:58.480]   to maintain their style is a big factor
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:00.720]   and creates a big difficulty, does it not,
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:05.720]   in determining whether an active manager has skill or not?
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:06.640]   - It does.
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.520]   It does, and that's one of the reasons
[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:12.440]   why it can become valuable and important
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:15.960]   to look at performance through a number of different lenses,
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.920]   maybe not just raw returns, but risk adjusted,
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:21.960]   and maybe not just sort of a single factor regression,
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:23.520]   but a multi-factor regression.
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:27.200]   And so I think that things like Fava French 3
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:30.400]   or Carhartt 4, now we've got 5, 6, 7,
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:32.800]   I mean, pick your multi-factor regression,
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:36.640]   but those are ways to separate alpha from beta.
[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:38.120]   And as you rightly point out,
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:40.640]   because active funds aren't a style pure,
[00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:43.120]   they tend to be messier to other styles.
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:45.400]   You wanna control for those sorts of things.
[00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.560]   And that can be especially important
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:49.800]   over shorter periods of time.
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:53.040]   Markets are noisy, managers are messy.
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:56.760]   And so the nexus of those two things is,
[00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:59.760]   manager success rates can cycle up and down.
[00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:02.640]   You and I know from reading the press
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:06.560]   that this is the storyline that always keeps giving,
[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:09.560]   is that managers in one category,
[00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:10.920]   active managers, I should say,
[00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:14.200]   are prospering, others in another category
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:15.520]   are in a deep slump.
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.280]   And in many cases,
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:20.280]   the reason why you see those sorts of variations
[00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:23.000]   is done flaw, because you have managers
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.560]   that perhaps are in one area or one specialty
[00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:28.320]   where they've had a tailwind
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:30.680]   and that's propelled them past their index
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:32.600]   over some period of time.
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:34.360]   Whereas conversely, you've got managers
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:36.160]   that maybe do a different style
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:37.880]   or invest in a different way
[00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:39.560]   that have encountered a headwind
[00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:41.080]   and that explains their slump.
[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:45.080]   And so Dunn's law is a pretty handy concept
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:46.240]   to keep in mind,
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:48.880]   just as you're trying to make sense of it all.
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:50.920]   - What's the report that Morningstar has
[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:52.760]   that does some of this analysis?
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:56.240]   - My colleague, Ben Johnson and others
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:21:00.200]   on our passes team published this.
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:02.360]   It's called the Active Passive Barometer.
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:04.760]   We go category by category
[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:07.920]   and we see how many active funds
[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:12.920]   were able to outperform a composite of passive funds
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:15.040]   that make up that category.
[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:17.760]   And those categories are constructed
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:19.720]   based on holdings-based analysis.
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:22.800]   That's how we determine which funds to lump together
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:25.680]   into peer groups is by looking at the attributes
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.000]   of their holdings
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.160]   and then per our Morningstar category
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.640]   classification methodology,
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:32.840]   assigning them to a category.
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:36.640]   So like in the case of, let's say a large value fund,
[00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:38.600]   these are funds that are exhibiting the trades
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:40.040]   through their holdings of funds
[00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:42.400]   that favor the stocks of larger companies
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:46.160]   that are inexpensive by a number of measures.
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:48.640]   We do try to point out some of these puts and takes
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:51.480]   that you get for the reasons that you mentioned.
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:54.000]   Again, that's Dunn's Law, so to speak,
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.760]   the fact that if you have a manager,
[00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:00.480]   like if we focus on maybe the most recent decade,
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:01.880]   it's a large cap manager
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:04.160]   and they really skew towards mega
[00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:06.280]   and maybe lean towards growth.
[00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:10.040]   That's probably been a good fact over the past decade or so,
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:12.840]   just because that part of the style box
[00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:14.840]   has done quite, quite well.
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:17.440]   Conversely, if you had another manager
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:20.520]   that maybe it was in that large growth box,
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:22.280]   but they own quite a bit of mid
[00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:24.280]   and maybe they mixed in some core
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:27.240]   and even some sort of busted growth stories
[00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:30.480]   that are sitting in the value side of a ledger,
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:33.120]   a manager like that probably wouldn't have done as well.
[00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:34.760]   And so a simple success ratio,
[00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:37.560]   is it necessarily gonna do that attribution for you?
[00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:38.880]   But through our research,
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:40.920]   we've tried to make sure that we point those things out
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:42.840]   so that people understand what might be driving
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:45.200]   some of the trends that they're seeing.
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:48.000]   - So indexes have certainly changed.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.320]   Well, I shouldn't say they've changed.
[00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:52.840]   Indexes have certainly been expanded.
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:56.240]   What the definition of an index is,
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:59.440]   has expanded significantly in the past,
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:02.280]   I'll call it 15 years or 20 years,
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:07.280]   where prior to say 2003 or 2004,
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:13.560]   an index was the S&P 500 or the total stock market
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:15.560]   or the total bond market
[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:17.560]   or the total international market of some sort,
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:22.040]   they were very big, large gorilla type composites
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:27.040]   of securities from US and international and fixed income.
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:30.880]   But that has changed dramatically.
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:33.720]   And the definition of an index,
[00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:34.880]   I don't think it's a definition
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:37.320]   based on what John Vogel's standard would be
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:38.360]   of what an index is.
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:41.200]   But there have been, in my view,
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:43.200]   a lot of actively managed products
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:46.920]   that have now calling themselves indexing.
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:51.040]   And I believe that Morningstar calls them strategic indexes.
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:53.240]   Is that the name that you use?
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:54.720]   - Strategic beta, that's right.
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:57.400]   The industry refers to it as smart beta.
[00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:58.680]   We think that's a bit self-serving,
[00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:00.280]   so we call it strategic beta.
[00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:01.960]   It's exactly what you've described, Rick,
[00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:05.360]   which is that they're indexes, quote unquote,
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:10.360]   but what it really is is it's a rules-based implementation
[00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:13.000]   of active management.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   It's those rules which dictate
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.800]   which types of securities you will select.
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:23.360]   It's really not about faithfully tracking
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:25.080]   a given market segment,
[00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:27.960]   let alone sort of a wide swath of the market.
[00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:30.800]   Typically what it's about is sort of narrowing in
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:33.200]   on a specific set of securities
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:34.960]   that possess certain attributes
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:36.680]   per the rules that have been specified,
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:38.400]   and we call that strategic beta.
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:42.800]   - And my work I did on the ETF book that I wrote,
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:46.560]   I broke down these strategic indexes,
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:51.480]   and tongue-in-cheek, I called them special purpose indexes,
[00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:56.360]   SP indexes, or spindexes for short,
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:58.240]   because there was a lot of spin going on
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:24:59.200]   in the marketplace here
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:01.280]   about what these things actually were,
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:03.520]   but that was my opinion.
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:05.960]   So these strategic indexes have really expanded,
[00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:08.440]   but there's two things going on here.
[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:12.000]   It's not only the investment selection,
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.960]   and so what goes in the index that's different.
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:18.800]   Let's say you're gonna do some quantitative work
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:22.760]   to determine which individual securities
[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:25.840]   go into the strategic index,
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:30.560]   but it's also the weighting of those strategic indexes
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:31.920]   that have changed,
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:34.320]   where they're selecting securities
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:37.880]   based on some quantitative or qualitative factor
[00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:40.000]   like ESG or such,
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.440]   but how they weight those stocks or bonds in the index
[00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:48.440]   is also changed to using the same factors in many ways.
[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:51.320]   So you might have a factor weighted
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:53.680]   into how small-cap is it,
[00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:55.320]   or how value-y is it,
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:58.960]   or how ESG-prone is it.
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:02.080]   So it's not only individual security selection,
[00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:03.280]   it's individual weighting,
[00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:05.520]   and to me, I mean, this is active management,
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:10.520]   but the SEC allows these products to be called index funds
[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:14.080]   because they track, as you said,
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:18.520]   a model of some sort, or at least a methodology.
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:20.360]   To me, it's a little kind of unfair,
[00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:22.760]   and it's a little, it was a little bit of a way
[00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:24.200]   of which active management companies
[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:26.240]   to get back at the indexers.
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:27.600]   How do you feel about that?
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:30.440]   - You know, I do agree that
[00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:34.920]   there has maybe been a certain lack of discipline
[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:39.200]   when it's come to devising some of these strategies.
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:40.840]   I mean, I think that we can look at something
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:44.480]   that's fairly plain vanilla, like a value index.
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:46.080]   I mean, technically, one could argue,
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:49.280]   given the fact that it's literally factor tilting,
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:51.680]   that it's aiming to do something
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:55.280]   apart from the broad cap-weighted market.
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:56.840]   And I don't think that probably, you know,
[00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:58.560]   you or I would look at that and be like,
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:00.600]   okay, this isn't prudent at all,
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:03.760]   or there's not a body of research that undergirds this.
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:06.240]   So I think that, you know, what you're referring to
[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:08.920]   is this proliferation of products that we've seen
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:10.720]   that have targeted, you know,
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:13.360]   be very narrow market segments,
[00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:16.080]   or, you know, maybe data mine their way
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:19.040]   to a particular index methodology.
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:20.320]   And then they put that out there,
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:22.560]   and it kind of promptly rolls over.
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:24.520]   It's just a bit of gimmickry.
[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:26.280]   We have seen a lack of discipline
[00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:28.520]   in some of the products that we've seen come out there.
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:29.880]   And so that's why, you know,
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:31.560]   we've tried to take some steps
[00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:33.040]   through some of the methodologies
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:33.880]   that we've developed.
[00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:35.520]   Again, this is Ben Johnson and his team
[00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:37.520]   who have been at the forefront of coming up
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:40.080]   with strategic beta tags
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:42.880]   and different classification metrics that, you know,
[00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:45.040]   we can try to make available to investors
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:47.640]   so that they can make more informed decisions
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:50.520]   about what are, you know, they are active strategies,
[00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:53.760]   albeit those that are implemented through a set of rules
[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:56.720]   that, you know, are delivered in the form of an index.
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:58.800]   If you take the S&P 500
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:01.200]   and you divide it between value and growth,
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:04.160]   to me, the purpose isn't to recommend
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.200]   either value or growth.
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:08.680]   It's just simply to take an indice like the S&P 500
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:11.280]   and create a value and a growth segment of it,
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:12.520]   or take the total market
[00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:15.640]   and divide it into large cap, mid cap, small cap.
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:17.480]   When you put these things all back together again,
[00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:19.240]   it's still the total market.
[00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:21.520]   Similar with industries.
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:22.360]   In other words,
[00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:24.560]   you could take the 11 industry classifications
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:25.400]   and you could make,
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:27.640]   and they have made indexes or indices
[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:29.080]   out of each of the 11.
[00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:30.560]   But when you put them all back together again,
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:32.080]   it's still the total market.
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:36.080]   So that's one type of slicing and dicing.
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:37.840]   And I don't have any problem with that.
[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:39.200]   It's the other stuff.
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:43.240]   It's the stuff that is selecting securities
[00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:45.440]   and then weighting them differently.
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:48.120]   The active management stuff that's being called indexes
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:49.840]   that I have a problem with
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:52.000]   because it really has confused people.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.040]   You know, this idea that fundamental indexing, for example,
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:58.560]   is better than traditional indexing.
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:02.000]   Well, fundamental indexing is a selection process
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.720]   and then a weighting process.
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:05.320]   It's an active management process.
[00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:08.960]   It's not the same as buying the whole market.
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:10.640]   No, I think you're right.
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.880]   I think buyer beware is the right mentality
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:14.360]   to take into that.
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:16.280]   You know, the one thing that I could say
[00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:20.120]   in defense of a thoughtful smart beta
[00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:22.560]   or strategic beta approach,
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:25.800]   one that files a prudently constructed index
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:30.120]   that's maybe founded on robust research
[00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:33.240]   that's been conducted in a careful way.
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:35.440]   The index isn't gonna lose its nerve,
[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.120]   which sounds a bit glib.
[00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:41.360]   But one of the things that investors do have to confront
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:43.200]   when they invest with an active manager
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:46.040]   is agency risk or career risk.
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:47.520]   It's this notion that if things go
[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:49.200]   against the active manager,
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:53.280]   he or she might be likely to buckle under the pressure.
[00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:56.240]   And so maybe they are tilting sort of
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:59.760]   towards a set of securities that have been underperforming
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:02.480]   and the phones are ringing off the hook,
[00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:05.520]   clients are upset, they want a piece of the action
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.760]   and the action is not where that manager
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:09.480]   is investing at the moment.
[00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:10.480]   And so what do they do?
[00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:11.960]   They sell the underperformance
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:14.800]   and maybe they climb onto the index
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:16.720]   or buy into the part of the market
[00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:17.880]   that's been doing better.
[00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:21.280]   And what happens, you know, performance suffers
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:24.160]   because they tend to buy into the market segment
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:25.600]   that's about to roll over.
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:28.640]   And we see this repeat again and again and again.
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:31.680]   And contrast that with a strategic beta product,
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:33.320]   I'm not suggesting for a moment
[00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:35.720]   that they're all well-constructed or thoughtful,
[00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:38.200]   but the index shouldn't lose its nerve.
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:41.000]   It's gonna keep doing what it's designed to do.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:41.840]   You know, maybe again,
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:45.360]   take our sort of quintessential value index.
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:47.880]   It's gonna probably keep buying, you know,
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:50.760]   or rebalancing towards stocks that look cheap
[00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:52.920]   by price to book or what have you.
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:54.720]   Whereas maybe another manager
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:56.880]   who was tilting towards that style,
[00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:58.600]   maybe because of the agency risk,
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:00.040]   maybe because of that career risk,
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:02.600]   they might not be as committed to doing that
[00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:03.880]   when push comes to shove.
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:05.440]   So I think that's one thing that you could say.
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:09.600]   And then insofar as they're wrapped in the ETF structure,
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:11.520]   there are certain tax advantages,
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:14.080]   but that's more of a wrapper thing,
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:16.440]   ETFs versus open-end mutual funds
[00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:18.560]   that it is an indexing thing.
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:20.560]   I think they're probably something I would just focus on
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:22.880]   if you're evaluating a strategic beta product.
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:26.120]   - Let's get into the percentages.
[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:30.480]   These are the tables that you do and Vanguard has done.
[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:33.480]   Standard & Poor's does them through their SPIVA studies.
[00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:35.080]   There has been several academics
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:38.400]   who have put together performance tables
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:41.400]   to show the percentage of time
[00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:45.720]   that active management in each category outperforms.
[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:50.040]   These are usually done either annually or semi-annually.
[00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:51.280]   I look at all of these studies
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:52.720]   and I've been looking at them for years.
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:55.360]   Standard & Poor's have been doing them for 20 years
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:56.960]   and I know you've been doing them for a long time.
[00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:58.280]   And Vanguard, of course,
[00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:00.120]   has been looking at this data a long time.
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:03.120]   And there have been a lot of other academic studies
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:05.720]   and they all come out to, from what I see,
[00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:08.440]   just about the same numbers.
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:10.800]   And to me, that numbers are,
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:13.920]   or over any five-year period of time,
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:17.680]   if you start out with 100 funds
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:21.240]   that are trying to outperform, say, the market,
[00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:26.240]   that 25% of those funds will go out of business or merge.
[00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:31.800]   And usually that's because of very, very poor performance.
[00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:37.000]   The other, another 50% will underperform,
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.680]   of which half, or 25%, will underperform by more than 1%.
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:44.640]   And then the other 25% will underperform
[00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:48.240]   by maybe less than 1%.
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:52.520]   And then last you have the 25% that outperforms.
[00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:55.440]   And this generally will outperform by,
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:58.160]   call it a half a percent.
[00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:01.360]   There are 25% of the active managers
[00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:03.840]   who have in the past outperformed
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:05.040]   over a five-year period of time.
[00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:08.120]   And Bellman's figuring out who they're going to be
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:09.280]   before it happens.
[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:11.680]   So are my numbers fairly accurate,
[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:13.080]   at least on the equity side?
[00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:14.880]   - They are.
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:16.840]   And maybe I'll sort of back up a little bit.
[00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:19.680]   I did a little bit of sifting around in our database,
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:20.920]   going back in time.
[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:25.440]   And over time, there have been around 58,000 funds
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:26.960]   and ETFs in existence.
[00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:29.360]   And this includes all the different share classes.
[00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:31.840]   These are U.S. funds and ETFs.
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:36.840]   Of that roughly 58,000, around 31,000, or 53%, have died.
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:40.760]   So that just gives you a sense.
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:42.200]   I mean, if you go back through time,
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:45.160]   at some point, there has been a sum total
[00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:48.760]   of nearly 60,000 funds and ETFs.
[00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:51.480]   And around 31,000 of those have perished.
[00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:56.480]   They've been merged or liquidated, obsoleted in some way.
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:01.640]   And so that is one obstacle that you are facing
[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:05.280]   right off the bat, is just perishability.
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:08.640]   Many funds, it's basically, it's a coin flip,
[00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:11.920]   whether your fund is going to deliver or not.
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:13.400]   As far as the rest of your numbers,
[00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:16.200]   so you've got a certain percentage of funds
[00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:18.920]   that are going to perish, they're going to fall away.
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:21.440]   Yes, it breaks down around the way you described.
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:22.720]   For instance, in our most recent
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:24.440]   Active Passive Barometer Report,
[00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:26.040]   which is a report I referenced before
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:28.920]   that my colleague Ben Johnson and others
[00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:32.720]   on his passive research team conduct,
[00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:35.640]   we found in the large cap category,
[00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:40.640]   so this is U.S. equity, it was around 15, 20% of the funds
[00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:46.040]   in those categories beat the passive proxy.
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:49.880]   And so those are very sobering numbers.
[00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:52.320]   And as you can imagine, as you extend
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:57.240]   that time horizon further out to 10 to 15 to 20 years,
[00:34:57.240 --> 00:35:00.400]   it tends to telescope even lower.
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:03.160]   And so I think that it's not contradictory
[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:05.840]   to say that it's not hopeless to succeed
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:08.480]   with active investing, while at the same time
[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:11.520]   acknowledging that it's a very sobering picture
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:13.160]   when you look at the data,
[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:16.440]   the odds are not stacked in your favor.
[00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:19.040]   Different categories of active funds
[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:21.600]   do outperform for a while,
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:23.920]   and it might have to do with Dunn's Law,
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:27.000]   but that they don't tend to persist.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.040]   They tend to fall back.
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:30.840]   We've noticed this even in fixed income,
[00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:35.680]   and fixed income right now, when you look at it,
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:38.640]   you would say, "Gee, I should do
[00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:41.400]   "active management fixed income."
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:44.080]   But that would only be if you were looking at,
[00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:47.560]   say, the last 10 years of fixed income,
[00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:51.120]   because 10 years ago, you wouldn't have been saying that.
[00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:53.520]   You would have been saying, "I should just do index funds."
[00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:58.520]   So these things do streak, and it's hard to pick
[00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:01.200]   the category where you're going to have
[00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:05.040]   more active funds outperform, but it does happen.
[00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:07.280]   I could look at any data from any five-year
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:11.920]   or 10-year period, and there will be a category or two
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:15.560]   where the active funds have been outperforming,
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:17.560]   but it doesn't persist.
[00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:19.720]   So can you talk with us about persistence?
[00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:21.640]   - No, you're right.
[00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:25.560]   Yes, because when, over these shorter periods of time
[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:28.920]   where maybe you see a bunch of active funds
[00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:32.080]   in a category or a style outperform,
[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:35.800]   usually there's some sort of stylistic tailwind
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:36.640]   that they're enjoying.
[00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:39.960]   And that's not to denigrate active investors.
[00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:43.120]   They're a very sort of accomplished, educated,
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:47.000]   well-trained lot, but it's very competitive,
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.560]   and it can be difficult to unearth
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:51.000]   truly undiscovered ideas.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.560]   And so what you tend to find is that
[00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:56.880]   maybe they skew towards one style or another,
[00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:59.400]   and so when that style has the wind at its back,
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:01.200]   that's when you'd see them outperform.
[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:03.880]   Maybe I'll give you an example of kind of how the numbers,
[00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:06.120]   this will just sort of further, I suppose,
[00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:08.400]   underscore what you said before,
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:10.800]   using an actual category as an example.
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:14.200]   This is from our most recent Active Pass Abroad Report,
[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:17.600]   which was as of December 31st, 2020.
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:19.880]   And if you looked as of that date
[00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:22.320]   within the Europe stock category,
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:26.240]   so these are funds that invest primarily in stocks
[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:27.560]   that are domiciled somewhere
[00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:29.880]   on the broader European continent,
[00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:34.880]   74% of the funds in that category outperformed
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:38.480]   over the year ended December 31st, 2020.
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:40.640]   But then as you extend the time period
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:42.880]   to three to five to 10 to 15 years,
[00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:46.560]   what you find is that the numbers shrink way down.
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:49.320]   So for instance, over the trailing 10 years
[00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:52.000]   through December 31st, 2020,
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:56.640]   around a third of active European stock funds
[00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:58.280]   beat their benchmark.
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:01.600]   And so that's inclusive of the great year
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:03.520]   that they had in 2020,
[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:06.440]   that probably boosted the 10 year number a little bit
[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:08.480]   than it otherwise would have been,
[00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:10.200]   but it's still quite low.
[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:11.840]   And that's kind of a constant
[00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:14.480]   when you look across the different categories
[00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:15.760]   that we study.
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:17.600]   I mean, the category, for instance,
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:21.600]   over the trailing 10 years ended December 31st, 2020,
[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:25.080]   that had the highest success ratio was global real estate.
[00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:28.880]   And that was 48%, meaning that 48%
[00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:31.960]   of the active global real estate funds
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:35.760]   that existed 10 years before we began
[00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:38.920]   that December 31st, 2020 measurement period
[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:40.320]   beat their benchmark.
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:42.280]   And so it's very, very difficult
[00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:45.120]   as you extend this over longer periods of time
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:47.400]   and you experience mean reversion
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:51.520]   as a fund that stylistic tailwind becomes a headwind.
[00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:54.280]   And then other sort of realities intrude
[00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:57.360]   such as the economic viability of the product.
[00:38:57.360 --> 00:38:58.800]   If it doesn't reform,
[00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:01.720]   the manager probably is going to be tempted
[00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:04.480]   to mothball it, to merge it with something else
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:05.960]   or just to liquidate it
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:08.400]   so that it's got a better offering of funds to show.
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:10.240]   And so that's how those numbers end up falling
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:13.120]   and you end up with those low success rates that you see.
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:17.000]   Let's look at fees, how fees factor into this.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.400]   And there's been a lot of academic work
[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:20.720]   and you've done a lot of work on fees.
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:23.200]   You do your annual fee study every year
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:26.880]   and pretty much there is a very high
[00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:32.120]   persistent correlation among all asset classes
[00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:37.000]   between the fee that the active managers charge
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.400]   and their performance.
[00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:42.000]   There's a lot of closet indexing going on
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.280]   where a lot of managers are just buying
[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:45.440]   basically what's in the index
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:46.960]   and charging a higher fee for it.
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:50.160]   But can you talk about the correlation
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:55.160]   between fees and active returns versus the index funds?
[00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:57.400]   We've done quite a bit of work here.
[00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:58.680]   I would highlight some work
[00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:01.440]   that my colleague Russ Kinnell did some years ago
[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:05.080]   where he looked at a multitude of different factors
[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:07.680]   to determine which seemed to be the most predictive.
[00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:11.280]   And the factor that really stood out was fees.
[00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:12.480]   So the lower they were,
[00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:16.240]   the likelier it was that fund would succeed
[00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:17.920]   by different measures.
[00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:19.360]   To give you a more recent example,
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:22.000]   I might return to that Active Passive Barometer Report
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.320]   that I referred to before.
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:26.720]   And this is available to any of your listeners.
[00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:27.840]   If they Google for it,
[00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:29.200]   they should be able to pull it up
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:31.560]   and download it free of charge.
[00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:34.680]   It's available publicly so you can see for yourself.
[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:38.160]   But not only do we tally up the number of active funds
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:43.160]   that have beaten their composite benchmark over time,
[00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:47.360]   but we also break those categories into cost quintiles.
[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:52.000]   And so what we take a look at is how did funds
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.400]   that were grouped not only by style,
[00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:56.320]   but also by cost do relatively speaking.
[00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:59.320]   And what you find is that almost uniformly
[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:03.520]   the lowest cost quintile outperforms the index
[00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:07.600]   at a higher clip than the highest cost quintile.
[00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:09.640]   And usually you're talking about multiples of difference.
[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:13.840]   Now, granted, it doesn't necessarily upend one's thinking
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:16.200]   about whether it's better to be active
[00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:18.560]   versus indexed in these categories.
[00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:20.240]   But I think it does give you an appreciation
[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:24.000]   for how much cost can tilt the odds in your favor.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.760]   Just to give sort of a quick example,
[00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:28.920]   using a category that I think is familiar
[00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:32.160]   to a lot of investors, US Large Blend.
[00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:35.840]   The lowest cost quintile over the trailing 10 years
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:38.800]   ended December 31st, 2020.
[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:43.800]   17% of the active funds in that lowest cost quintile
[00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:46.120]   managed to beat their benchmark.
[00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:49.040]   Contrast that with the highest cost quintile,
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:53.600]   just 4% of those high cost Large Blend funds
[00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:56.960]   beat their benchmark over that trailing 10 year period
[00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:57.800]   I mentioned.
[00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:02.200]   The odds go from vanishingly small to slightly better
[00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:03.760]   if you focus on cost.
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:06.640]   But when you look across these 20 categories
[00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:08.920]   that we track as part of this report,
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:11.280]   with the exception of just a few,
[00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:13.760]   you find that cost does tilt odds in your favor.
[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:16.720]   And so certainly, if I were making my pecking list,
[00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:20.080]   that would be way up there on the list of criteria
[00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:21.440]   that I'd be focused on.
[00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:26.880]   - In the study that I did with Alex Bankey of Betterment
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:31.880]   at the time, on active mutual fund portfolios
[00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:34.880]   versus index fund portfolios,
[00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:39.880]   we did go in and carve out just the lower cost active funds
[00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:43.360]   and reran the numbers.
[00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:48.360]   These were the active funds that were in the 50 percentile
[00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:50.400]   or lower as far as fees.
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:52.000]   So they were the least expensive
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.280]   or lowest half of the funds.
[00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:57.040]   And we did find that it did make a difference.
[00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:59.920]   Say over a 10 year period of time,
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:03.200]   if you included all active funds in a portfolio,
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:07.000]   call it a five fund portfolio of different US stock,
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.760]   international stock, a couple of bond funds,
[00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:12.080]   and maybe a small cap fund of some sort.
[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:15.880]   If you included all active funds in there
[00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:19.040]   versus an all index fund portfolio of the same mix,
[00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:21.120]   that the index fund portfolio outperformed
[00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:22.600]   over 90 percent of the time.
[00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:26.640]   However, when you just use the lower cost active funds
[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:30.960]   in the study, the index fund portfolios outperformed
[00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:33.800]   the active funds about 80 percent of the time.
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:35.840]   So there was an incremental benefit
[00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:39.880]   to just using lower cost active funds.
[00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:41.680]   So that didn't really move the needle that much,
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:43.880]   but it did move the needle.
[00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:46.160]   But back to my other point that I made earlier
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:48.280]   is that what I found in a different research
[00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:50.400]   was that when looking at the funds
[00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:51.520]   that actually did have alpha,
[00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:53.240]   the managers that did outperform,
[00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:55.360]   and you could literally say they,
[00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:57.840]   using information ratios and other statistics,
[00:43:57.840 --> 00:43:59.440]   that they had skill,
[00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:03.600]   was that their funds were not the cheapest
[00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:04.800]   nor the most expensive,
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:09.160]   that they tended to run between 0.7
[00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:11.720]   and a little less than 1 percent.
[00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:13.840]   I imagine that would be almost required.
[00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:14.960]   If you really do have skill,
[00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:16.720]   you have to put some research dollars
[00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:19.600]   into finding those opportunities.
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:22.160]   - No, no, that makes sense to me.
[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:23.560]   I mean, when you consider the fact
[00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:25.760]   that you have some fairly accomplished,
[00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:27.440]   successful boutiques out there
[00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:29.720]   who are not gonna be the cheapest game in town,
[00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:32.280]   I would imagine that was probably part of your cohort
[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:34.280]   where you were seeing some high performers
[00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:36.600]   that weren't the lowest cost.
[00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:38.680]   Perhaps you had some in there
[00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:41.840]   that maybe were investing in styles
[00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:45.080]   that are a little bit more costly to implement.
[00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:47.200]   Maybe you would think of small company stocks
[00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:50.200]   or non-US stocks, especially EM.
[00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:54.320]   Typically, those charge a little bit more.
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:58.200]   So that does make sense to me that you would find that.
[00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:00.280]   I think that overall, though,
[00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:01.360]   when you're trying to think about
[00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:03.680]   sort of those odds of success,
[00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:07.720]   focusing on cost is something that a well-served investor.
[00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:09.520]   I wanna get into a couple of other areas
[00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:13.240]   where you have measured the gap
[00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:16.440]   between the performance of markets
[00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:19.760]   and the performance of investors in those markets.
[00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:21.480]   And you call it mind the gap.
[00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:23.440]   And these studies I found to be very interesting
[00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:26.080]   because they're performance gap studies.
[00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:30.280]   And I've seen an interesting trend here
[00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:34.120]   where it appears as though investors are getting better
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:36.680]   at managing their portfolios.
[00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:39.320]   Is that what these studies are telling me?
[00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:40.480]   - Yeah, so you're right.
[00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:42.120]   The report is called "Mind the Gap."
[00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:44.800]   It was pioneered by someone I mentioned before,
[00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:47.000]   Russ Kinnell, some years ago.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.880]   And then we've had other analysts
[00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:52.240]   that have been conducting the study since then.
[00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:54.600]   Amy Arnott, my colleague, most recently.
[00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:58.040]   We conducted our most recent "Mind the Gap" study
[00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:01.160]   for the period end of December 31st, 2019.
[00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:03.200]   We're in the process of updating the version.
[00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:05.520]   That'll be as of 12/31/2020.
[00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:07.440]   So stay tuned, be on the lookout for that.
[00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:09.400]   But when we did the most recent one,
[00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:12.760]   which again was as of 12/31/19,
[00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:15.640]   when we looked at that 10-year period ended then,
[00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:18.160]   we found that there was virtually no gap
[00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:20.960]   between the dollar-weighted return
[00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:23.880]   that investors earned in their funds
[00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:25.600]   and the returns of those funds.
[00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:28.000]   And for sake of clarification,
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.600]   when we talk about the dollar-weighted return,
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:33.520]   you'd liken that to an internal rate of return.
[00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:34.760]   So essentially what you're doing
[00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:36.800]   is you're taking into account
[00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:39.040]   the assets that were invested in funds,
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:41.960]   the cash flows over some period of time,
[00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:44.520]   and you're trying to solve for the return
[00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:46.360]   that would explain how you ended up
[00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:48.320]   with the sum of assets at the end
[00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:49.280]   that you ended up with,
[00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:51.800]   taking into account the beginning balance
[00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:53.520]   and the cash flows in the interim.
[00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:56.720]   And I would say that it's an encouraging story
[00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:58.720]   that we've seen the gap close,
[00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:00.960]   because I think that when we've conducted this study
[00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:02.400]   in the past,
[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:04.920]   we found that there could be a fairly sizable gap,
[00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:08.720]   a percentage point, even two percentage points
[00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:11.400]   that separated investors' returns
[00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:12.720]   from their funds' returns,
[00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:16.480]   meaning that they had inopportunely timed
[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:19.680]   their purchases and their sales.
[00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:21.320]   You know, and the most vivid example of this
[00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:25.000]   would be investors who are chasing performance
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.320]   and they end up buying high and selling low.
[00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:29.360]   In situations like those,
[00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:32.000]   you find that the dollar-weighted returns,
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:36.200]   the investor return, far trails the total return,
[00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:37.960]   that is the return of the funds.
[00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:40.000]   And so it's encouraging to see
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:43.480]   that these two numbers have converged over time.
[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:46.680]   And it does suggest that we're seeing better habits,
[00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:49.920]   or at least we're seeing some of the less
[00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:52.200]   self-harmful behaviors from investors
[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:53.880]   that we had seen before.
[00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:57.200]   Again, though, this was just through end of 2019.
[00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:00.520]   We haven't quite tallied up what we saw in 2020,
[00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:02.680]   and there was some evidence of misbehavior then.
[00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:07.120]   So we'll see what this next installment shows.
[00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:11.680]   - I'm curious if your data is able to separate out
[00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:16.680]   advised portfolios from self-managed portfolios,
[00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:20.920]   and if you're seeing different trends
[00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:24.040]   in advised portfolios than self-managed portfolios.
[00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:28.160]   - I wish we could, but we can't.
[00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:31.920]   It used to be, as you know, that share class
[00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:34.720]   would tell you, to a certain extent,
[00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:38.720]   which of the funds are advised,
[00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:42.200]   where there's a financial advisor that's involved,
[00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:43.840]   versus, say, a no-load share class
[00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:46.520]   or an institutional share class where we can safely say
[00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:49.280]   that it's an individual investing on their own,
[00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:51.640]   or doing so in a self-directed way,
[00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:53.920]   say, within a retirement plan.
[00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:56.120]   But those boundaries have basically been blown
[00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:59.360]   to smithereens, especially institutional share classes.
[00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:02.960]   Those are no longer the sole province of institutions.
[00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:06.280]   We've got many individuals that are self-directing
[00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:07.840]   and investing in those share classes,
[00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:09.680]   which they're able to access in their retirement plan.
[00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:11.840]   So it's a long-winded way of saying
[00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:14.960]   we can't separate it out quite that cleanly.
[00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:18.200]   What we can do is look at other dimensions,
[00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:21.200]   asset class, Morningstar category.
[00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:23.360]   We've done some work looking at it.
[00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:27.720]   High volatility level or cost of the funds concerned.
[00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:29.720]   You know, and there are some interesting findings there.
[00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:33.400]   I would say that probably the one that really jumps out
[00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:34.960]   is allocation funds.
[00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:36.840]   Allocation funds would include things
[00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:39.960]   like target date funds, which have become a mainstay
[00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:41.720]   in defined contribution plans.
[00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:45.720]   And over the 10-year period, end of December 31st, 2019,
[00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:48.040]   what we found is that the average dollar
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:51.240]   that investors in allocation funds put to work
[00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:53.280]   out-earned the funds.
[00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:56.480]   So they actually, by regularly contributing
[00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:58.320]   into these funds, as is the practice
[00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:01.640]   with the defined contributions plans, as you know,
[00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:04.240]   they ended up reaping a slightly higher return
[00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:06.440]   than their funds did to the tune
[00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:09.920]   of about a 40 basis point positive gap annualized.
[00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:13.080]   And so that's a really, really encouraging outcome
[00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:14.840]   to see just knowing the central role
[00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:17.320]   that defined contribution plans will play
[00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:19.920]   in the retirement future of so many folks
[00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:20.920]   who are in the workforce.
[00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:23.400]   So that was something that certainly did jump out
[00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:25.280]   from our most recent report.
[00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:27.800]   - I think that most of those funds are not advised,
[00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:31.680]   meaning that there's no extra fee being paid
[00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:34.480]   to any advisor on top of that.
[00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:37.920]   I think pretty much most of the money in those funds
[00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:40.960]   is going to be just quote unquote self-directed
[00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:42.200]   by the investor.
[00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:43.480]   Would you agree with that?
[00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:45.640]   - I would agree with that.
[00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:47.480]   And in a number of cases, as you know,
[00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:49.360]   we've got investors who are being defaulted
[00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:52.000]   in to a target date fund.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:55.280]   Now, generally speaking, the lion's share,
[00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:57.720]   I would guess of the assets that are in target date funds
[00:50:57.720 --> 00:50:59.840]   probably were not defaulted in
[00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:02.520]   just because it predated that practice
[00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:04.640]   and that's where the lion's share of the assets are.
[00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:06.480]   But you're right that I would expect
[00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:09.040]   the bulk of that is not advised.
[00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:13.120]   - So this investor gap that is shrinking
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:15.080]   or in some cases have gone away,
[00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:20.960]   at the same time, huge flows have left active management
[00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:24.040]   and gone to indexing.
[00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:24.920]   Is there a link?
[00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:28.760]   - Well, I don't know that I would necessarily say
[00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:33.760]   that indexing on its own would promote better behavior.
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:37.360]   I think that what we have to consider is context.
[00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:39.800]   In a number of these situations,
[00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:43.240]   what we have seen is that we had investors
[00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:46.800]   who had maybe a small basket of active funds
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:49.520]   that were targeting particular styles
[00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:52.160]   and they're switching into programs or strategies
[00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:54.120]   where they're better diversified
[00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:58.320]   and really the name of the game isn't to beat a benchmark.
[00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:01.200]   It's basically to construct an asset allocation
[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:02.880]   that helps to advance the objectives
[00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:06.680]   that are called for by a more encompassing financial plan.
[00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:08.560]   And I think that context is important
[00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:10.800]   because I think that if you have investors
[00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:13.280]   that are maybe less jumpy
[00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:14.680]   because they're not as focused
[00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:16.600]   on beating a benchmark over time,
[00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:19.480]   but rather seeing that they're making progress
[00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:21.200]   with their plan as implemented
[00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:23.440]   through a broader asset allocation framework
[00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:25.280]   that's implemented with passes,
[00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:29.000]   they're just gonna be less prone to buy and sell
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:32.280]   at inopportune times, they'll stick with the plan.
[00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:34.680]   And then there are certain mechanisms
[00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:36.120]   that enforce this, right?
[00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:39.200]   I mean, we talked about defined contribution plans.
[00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:40.840]   That's kind of the name of the game
[00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:44.000]   is you're just putting your money in, in a regular fashion.
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.160]   It goes into the target date fund
[00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:48.240]   and it takes care of everything for you.
[00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:49.400]   And in some of those cases,
[00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:53.440]   those target date funds are investing in index funds.
[00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:57.640]   And so I think that some of that context is important.
[00:52:57.640 --> 00:53:00.760]   I think that there probably is evidence,
[00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:05.480]   anecdotal or otherwise that index investors,
[00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:08.680]   they approach investing in a slightly different way
[00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:11.120]   they maybe are a bit more focused on the long-term
[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:15.160]   and managing what they can like cost and tax efficiencies.
[00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:17.320]   And therefore they don't have the same propensity
[00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:19.560]   to trade around their portfolio
[00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:21.240]   as maybe another type of investor
[00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:22.720]   is a different set of motivations,
[00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:24.480]   including beating the market,
[00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:27.200]   or maybe they're a little bit more fixated on performance
[00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:29.520]   and perhaps they're more tempted to chase.
[00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:33.320]   - Well, it makes me circle back to my original comment
[00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:35.440]   at the beginning of this podcast
[00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:38.800]   that the original purpose back in 1924
[00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:40.480]   for starting mutual funds
[00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:42.960]   was to give people a diversified portfolio
[00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:45.880]   and it wasn't necessarily to outperform the market.
[00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:50.880]   And now index funds have become a better mousetrap
[00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:54.440]   and made active funds obsolete.
[00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:56.920]   And to me, the performance gap data
[00:53:56.920 --> 00:53:59.880]   is showing that people are figuring this out.
[00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:02.120]   - Okay, one last question.
[00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:03.640]   We hear a lot of stories in the media.
[00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:05.880]   I think these come up all the time,
[00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:08.400]   negative stories about indexing.
[00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:12.480]   Indexing is, it's gonna blow up the market
[00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:16.000]   because so much of the market is in index funds now,
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:20.000]   it's causing the market to be way overvalued.
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:21.840]   Is there any relevance to any of these stories
[00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:23.400]   that we hear in the news media?
[00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:27.200]   - I think that's mostly bunk and self-serving.
[00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:30.440]   I think that the strongest proponents of arguments
[00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:33.920]   like those tend to be those that stand to gain
[00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:37.400]   from active investing, finding followers.
[00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:40.160]   And there's many thoughtful defenders of active investing.
[00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:42.080]   I don't wanna denigrate them too,
[00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:44.520]   but it tends to be a self-serving argument.
[00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:46.480]   I think the most important thing to keep in mind,
[00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:48.160]   and it's a point I know that you
[00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:50.640]   and other Bogle heads have made repeatedly.
[00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:52.640]   And I think it's a point well taken
[00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:55.640]   is that a cap-weighted index
[00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:59.760]   that does a good job of capturing a beta,
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:03.320]   of delivering a market exposure,
[00:55:03.320 --> 00:55:06.760]   by definition, it should be mirroring the other,
[00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:08.480]   the sum total of other participants
[00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:10.840]   that are investing in that same area,
[00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:12.720]   including active managers.
[00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:16.240]   And so sort of this notion that indexing
[00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:19.080]   is going to get so big that it's gonna be destabilizing
[00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:23.760]   or somehow fund house mirror distort markets.
[00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:26.480]   I mean, to me, that's self-contradicting
[00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:29.280]   insofar as an index is like holding up a mirror.
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:32.000]   And what you see is the sum total
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:34.960]   of what other participants are engaged in in that market,
[00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:36.520]   including active investors.
[00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:39.880]   And so I don't buy that argument.
[00:55:39.880 --> 00:55:44.320]   I continue to think that indexing is a prudent way
[00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:48.120]   for investors to get low-cost exposure to market segments
[00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:50.440]   as part of a more encompassing plan.
[00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:54.840]   I think that there can be a place for active investing,
[00:55:54.840 --> 00:55:57.560]   but I think that investors should be judicious about it.
[00:55:57.560 --> 00:56:00.600]   And one of the best ways to sort of really understand
[00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:02.160]   what your limits might be there
[00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:04.480]   is just to look at some of the data
[00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:06.120]   that we try to make available
[00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:07.840]   and that others have made available.
[00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:10.680]   That would give you a sense of what the odds of success are
[00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:13.160]   and know what sort of barriers stand in your way
[00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:17.080]   so that when you do put on an active exposure,
[00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:18.400]   you know what you're getting into
[00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:22.120]   and you've calibrated your expectations accordingly.
[00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:23.480]   Well, Jeff, it's been wonderful to have you
[00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:24.640]   on Bogle Heads on Investing.
[00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:27.000]   You're just a wealth of knowledge
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:28.800]   coming from an unbiased source, I would say,
[00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:32.600]   that Morningstar is not trying to manage money,
[00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:35.000]   not trying to outperform anything,
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:38.600]   just trying to put out there the data as they see it.
[00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:39.720]   And thank you so much
[00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:42.360]   for being on Bogle Heads on Investing today.
