[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240]   If you're staying at a boutique hotel where there's no loyalty program,
[00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.800]   there's no elite status, it might not matter as much.
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.340]   But if you have a lot of status and you want to earn points at Marriott,
[00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.580]   you might not want to book a Marriott stay through any of these programs.
[00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.180]   But there are some really lucrative options to earn points.
[00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.640]   And if you go to Rocket Miles's website, as an example,
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.940]   has some pretty decent ways to earn points.
[00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.800]   I just did a really quick search right here.
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.100]   I'm looking in New York City for a couple of nights,
[00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.700]   and I chose that I want to earn United Miles.
[00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.900]   You can obviously choose Aeroplan Delta Southwest.
[00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.400]   And it says, OK, I'm going to book this hotel stay for two nights.
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.440]   It's fourteen hundred dollars.
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.540]   And I'm going to earn fifteen thousand miles for this day.
[00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.140]   Not a bad redemption if you value United points at two cents.
[00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.300]   That's a three hundred dollars back.
[00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.980]   Three hundred dollars out of one hundred fourteen hundred dollars
[00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.440]   is like a 20 percent return.
