[00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:01.840]   Hey Flo, how's it going?
[00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:09.120]   I can't hear you. Hello, hello, hello. How's it going? I like your shirt.
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:16.240]   Yeah, thanks. Oh yeah. Wait, did I? I did. Okay.
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:26.640]   Yeah, I, um, the nano banana stuff is crazy. Okay, I know nothing about it. So if you want to,
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.640]   like, tell people what this thing is and all that when we get going, like, yeah, for sure.
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:40.240]   Oh, my goodness. I didn't talk, you know, who was that earlier that mentioned he's, he's a
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.440]   presented before Scott. So Scott mentioned earlier about him doing the nano banana thing. I don't know
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:52.640]   if you got a chance to check that out on his page. But yeah, I kind of I can do like a walkthrough of
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:59.200]   what he's done with his team page. And then like in the discord itself, like in the actual AI in
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:08.480]   action, I mean, a latent space discord server. We have a ton of examples of why nano bananas crazy.
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:17.760]   But I guess this could mostly be a nano banana thing. I tried to make an effort to get like us to a good
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:24.240]   place for the the vibe coding a bot a discord bot and it's like extremely complicated.
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.240]   But I think I have most of the details worked out minus the server thing and we can kind of like maybe
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.120]   talk about that as part of the AI in action this Friday.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.800]   yeah. Okay, you're on the job. You're on the job.
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.480]   It's all good. I mean, I'd love to not have not be on the job. Community run. Let's go.
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:58.320]   Yeah, this is that man. Well, this is how I try to run our team, too. I'm just like,
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.160]   all right, you got you all tell me what you need to do.
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.640]   Right, right. I want to step in as well. Like, okay, let me prompt a couple.
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.280]   We don't. Yeah, we don't need to do anything. We just like
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.000]   No, for sure.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:21.600]   So I guess to give everyone an introduction to what nano banana is, it is a new image generation
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.600]   model from Google. And I say new, but I think it's been out for a few weeks or so. How you actually
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.520]   access it, there's a couple different ways to access it, how I've been doing it. And I think
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.960]   I can show a pretty cool example if I share my screen.
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:43.120]   Oh, that's going to show you guys. If we share, we can move you guys over here.
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:53.360]   So I talked about some of the process I was going through to set up
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.360]   the test ding discord server or whatever. And I was like, Oh, this is be a great like
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.520]   one of the first steps is like name your bot and give it a picture.
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.880]   And I was like, Oh, this would be a great, you know, opportunity for me to see
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:11.040]   how nano banana performs. So I, of course, go to, you know, if I maybe if I start from scratch,
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.240]   it'll be better, but AI studio dot Google.com. And again, that's for the transcription, I guess I
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.920]   should say AI studio dot Google.com. And then over the on the right hand side, when you load it up,
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.720]   oh, they have a what's new button here that you can try nano banana. But if that's gone in the future,
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.160]   for anyone watching the recording, if you click over here on the right hand side, and select a new model,
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.800]   of course, if you go to all there's like Gemini, Gemini 2.5 pro and flash and all these great models
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:42.720]   that we've gotten to know, but nano banana is their image generation model. And it's technically the slug of it.
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:51.520]   if you're looking to use it as a developer in the API is Gemini dash 2.5 dash flash dash image dash
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.440]   preview. And that dash preview simply means that Google is going to screw us over at some point in
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:01.120]   the future, and we'll have to change the slug. So don't get attached to it. But but Gemini 2.5 flash
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.920]   has been trained to be an image generation model.
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.840]   Wait, so is this the same as nano banana.ai or different?
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.520]   I think I think someone's like been opportunistic with that domain name and took it.
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:21.040]   Um, if I'm if I'm not mistaken, nano banana.ai I remember seeing some like, if anyone can do
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:30.720]   do research on this in the background, I want to say looks context. Yeah, I want to say it coming soon.
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:37.040]   I want to say this is like not officially from Google, and that somebody snatched the domain name once they
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:42.000]   figured out that that Google was releasing a new model under the same name, and kind of like ran
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.080]   with it. So I believe that's what's happened here is like this is not actually officially from from
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.440]   Google, they just kind of like played on the name of the new model.
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:57.360]   Yeah, I see the copyright on, you know, banana 2025, not Google, the alphabet company thing.
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.320]   Yeah, yeah, I think you're right.
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.160]   So and that's funny, because like, I'm assuming cable, you like Googled it. And this is the one of the first
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.720]   things that came out.
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:14.080]   That's what that's what came up their privacy policy says it's done done AI limited from Hong Kong.
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:21.920]   So yeah, this is fascinating.
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.520]   Yeah, this is crazy.
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:31.760]   So yeah, I think it was just like, there was some hype around it. And like a lot of the new language
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:38.000]   models nowadays, as far as the rollout goes, as far as I understand, they basically started testing this
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.760]   image preview, or this image generation model on other services, like a flux or not a flux a um,
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:48.880]   oh my god, what's the name of the, there's a bunch of companies that do you know, image generation.
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.440]   And I think Google tested it with those services first, before they released it on their own
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:59.360]   platform, I think is how word got out, right? Like, so it leaks, and they're like, oh, this is code name,
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.200]   nano banana. And then somebody like went and registered the domain name, and kind of like,
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:10.320]   got ahead of the curve, I think is what happened. But officially, officially, okay.
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:17.280]   You broke up a little bit there from me, what would you say?
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:26.320]   Okay, nevermind, keep going.
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:33.920]   Yeah, yeah, no, you're in it. I understand. It's all good. If you can type that in,
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:38.720]   though, because it sounds like you were saying something about the process. But officially,
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:43.280]   what you can do is go to Google, like, you know, Google AI studio, and then find the nano banana
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:51.200]   model, and then type your prompt in. And it's much faster than I expected it to be. And the quality of
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:54.880]   it's been great. So I don't know if you guys have like, if anyone here in the audience has like a
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:00.720]   prompt or whatever that we can kind of throw into nano banana, and see what it comes up with. I just,
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.800]   what I ended up doing was, you know, tell it that I was trying to create a testing server
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:11.760]   for a weekly meeting called AI in action. And this is like an offshoot of the latent space podcast.
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:17.600]   And I asked it for a logo, and it actually came out really good compared to other services that I've
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:22.480]   tried because a lot of these super small intricate details end up getting jacked up. Like even here,
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:26.880]   once we zoom in, you can see that there's just like some inefficiencies and like,
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:31.920]   between what a model generates and like what a human would generate, if they're working with like
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:41.280]   vectors or whatever in a program like Adobe Illustrator or Figma or one of these other,
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:49.040]   you know, design applications. But this is like, really, really cool, especially for something that
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:54.080]   was done in like, you know, a couple seconds. So what I what I did was like, it really misunderstood
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:59.280]   the assignment, or maybe I just, I did a terrible job of prompting it, because I wanted a logo for the
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:03.520]   testing discord server and not the official discord server of AI in action. So I followed up with my
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:07.440]   prompt and said, Hey, that's, that's great. But I also need a logo for the AI and testing test
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:11.680]   discord server that I'm setting up. It's meant to host some of the discord bots we were testing as a
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:18.400]   community. So it responded by editing the original image by putting a bug in an in a spy glass here,
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:24.240]   or whatever this is, a magnifying glass, and, and then called it AI and testing about testing server,
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:30.560]   which I thought was crazy. And then so I was like, Well, you know, we're also coming up with this
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:36.480]   fictional character driven by an LL empowered agent named Artie short for artificial. And I asked for
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:43.200]   some help with creating another image for for that character. And it came up with this, which again,
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:48.640]   is like insane, like some of some of the intricate details, if you even six months ago, tried this with
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:53.120]   some of these models. I don't know if you guys have been playing with image generation over the course of
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:59.040]   this, like, you know, AI language model explosion, but like these super small details, like the lines almost
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:04.400]   always end up getting messed up. So the fact that it could get this detailed and have, like, have some
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:10.880]   kind of coherence from logo to logo to logo, it's also unheard of, it's very hard to pull off. As someone
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:16.880]   that's been using image generation models for a long time. But yeah, that that is nano banana. And there's
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:21.680]   a ton of examples in the discord, I can kind of pull up, if you guys have any comments, I can maybe pull up some
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:27.680]   of the cool ones that I saw in the discord. But that in and of itself is nano bananas. It's a new image
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:32.720]   generation model from Google. It's been kind of going viral over the last maybe a few weeks or so.
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:40.400]   Oh, the one example actually can pull up before we maybe turn it loose here is Scott Werner from the
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:47.040]   discord who is also I don't know Scott's on the call, but he has presented many times in an action. He did a
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:57.040]   really cool thing on his team page for his company. So if you go to the sub layer website, sublayer.com/team,
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:04.400]   he basically takes, I'm not sure how he's pulling this part off like what API endpoint he's using to pull
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:13.440]   up today in history. Let me zoom in just a little bit more. But on this day in history, on September 3rd in history,
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:21.440]   it says, in 1967, Sweden's famous Dagen H or H day smoothly switched traffic from driving on the left to the right
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:27.440]   side of the road, a massive national effort that improved road safety. I don't know why this is Lego related, but they, oh, okay, sorry. So this is the actual image generation prompt I've highlighted here to paraphrase. It just says,
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:49.440]   re-imagine this person as a smiley Lego style minifigure traffic officer in 1960s Stockholm with a bunch of other instructions. But what they're doing is like automatically generating both of these, as I understand it, the today in history and the generation prompt, and then feeding that to now Nano Banana to take their original team images and switch it over to, you know, the image that was
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:11:07.440]   inspired by these prompts. And he said previously they were using the open AI model, but Nano Banana is not only cheaper but faster. And they're playing around with giving this functionality to everyone in their Discord server as like a team. So I thought that was a pretty cool use of Nano Banana and almost like a testimonial because like it's cheaper and faster for them.
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:33.440]   right now I think is what he said in the in the in the Discord server. So I don't know if you guys have any other examples that you guys have seen or want to pull up but that's that's Nano Banana as I understand it. Me and Swix have been going back and forth in the Discord server just like sharing crazy links of like what people are able to pull off. There's some really cool like,
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:43.440]   3D stuff that I've seen when in a banana. But anyways, it's a cheap image generation model is kind of like what I've landed on here.
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:51.440]   And the other thing I guess I could kind of show off, I may need a second or two for this one.
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:57.440]   But if you guys have any, actually, I have not the entire time I haven't checked the chat. So maybe I should check that first.
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:19.440]   So what might be interesting actually would be to do so like take a test example and like there's questions about how, how long can it cohere for how good is that whatever can we like crowdsource with this group like a set of things we might want to do and see coherence on and like.
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:37.440]   See how it does like for example, I'm imagining like let's start with from a logo or something like this, but then say, Okay, you know, now generate me a background for a bunch of social media marketing integrate this integrate that okay now go and you know generate a web.
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:46.440]   You know some some additional assets for web maintaining this style, that type of thing and just see how well it does it at keeping coherence.
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:56.440]   Yeah, I think like so like a almost like an AI in action eval for like image generation and how long it can keep coherence.
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:13:05.440]   Yeah, just because I'm seeing, I'm seeing questions here about like how well can it keep coherence and I think that is one of the, you know.
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:16.440]   Big areas I think yikes raises a character consistency thing so like if we put a character in there will that character maintain consistency because that's a little bit more detail so yeah I would love to.
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:31.440]   Unless we have other things, but if we want to play with a thing that's a that's a dimension i'd love to test for sure character so like, can we see maybe because like i've actually seen prompts to this let's see if I can download the already had it downloaded.
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:39.440]   Let's go ahead and let's go ahead and throw in because you can add images let me drag and drop from my downloads folder.
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:41.440]   And say.
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:46.440]   You know something to the effect of this, how about this.
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:50.440]   We're in 2025 so maybe I shouldn't be doing too much.
[00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:55.440]   This is my character named already short for artificial.
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:56.440]   Oh.
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:05.440]   It's not working testing testing oh it is okay sorry user air.
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:18.440]   This is my character already short for already official, and I want you to put him in a spaceship hovering over the earth.
[00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:19.440]   Already.
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:25.440]   It's just reading you as having a southern accent or something.
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:26.440]   This is already.
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:27.440]   He's already ready.
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:40.440]   I do have a bit of a twang so that's fair.
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:44.440]   That's a bit of a wild request.
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:45.440]   But.
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:52.440]   Well, and then yeah we should like create a whole storybook or something like that and just see like.
[00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:53.440]   Yes.
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:55.440]   Do you have any good storybook prompt.
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:56.440]   Yeah, that's kind of crazy.
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:57.440]   That's wild.
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:58.440]   All right.
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:59.440]   Yeah.
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:00.440]   Oh, let's see.
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:01.440]   Let's let's just have like.
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:02.440]   All right.
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:07.440]   Take already on an adventure starting in his spaceship and then exploring a new planet.
[00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:20.440]   and see if it just see how it does.
[00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:21.440]   Yeah.
[00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:22.440]   I.
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:26.440]   So that level of coherence I just never seen in a.
[00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:27.440]   Okay.
[00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.440]   I mean this is definitely new planet.
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:30.440]   Maybe.
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:31.440]   Okay.
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:33.440]   I would like to see already from a slightly different angle.
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.440]   Maybe like.
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:37.440]   Top down bird's eye view.
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:38.440]   Yeah.
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:39.440]   I agree.
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:41.440]   Let's see if we can rotate him.
[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:44.440]   Et cetera.
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:52.440]   I remember seeing a demo from.
[00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:56.440]   Adobe, I think where they would, you'd like, have a.
[00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:58.440]   Just an image and it would.
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:02.440]   Let you vectorize it and then rotate it and see it.
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.440]   That was super cool.
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:07.440]   That's really cool.
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:20.440]   It is a different angle, but I don't know about.
[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:22.440]   Looks pretty similar.
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.440]   Yeah.
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:25.440]   This reminds me of when.
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:29.440]   you tried to get like a glass of wine to be completely full.
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:30.440]   In.
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.440]   Like a completely full glass of wine.
[00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:34.440]   And like, no matter what you prompt it like will not do it.
[00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:35.440]   Like the old.
[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:36.440]   This is like six months ago.
[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:38.440]   I think it's better now, but like, this is what's writing.
[00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:39.440]   Yeah.
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.440]   Let's show already from the side drinking wine.
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:42.440]   See what happens.
[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:50.440]   I wonder where the rate limits come in on this model.
[00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:54.440]   I think it's going to stop me at some point.
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:17:07.440]   I should have said a full glass of wine missed opportunity.
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:08.440]   Okay.
[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:09.440]   Okay.
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:10.440]   Blue wine.
[00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:11.440]   All right.
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.440]   Well, not bad.
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:16.440]   I'm not mad at that.
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:18.440]   They gave him a full body too.
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:20.440]   That's, that's what some of the examples have showed the most.
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:21.440]   I think is like that.
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.440]   You, you can do a lot of editing.
[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:27.440]   Uh, with like an original muse or whatever.
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:29.440]   Um, okay.
[00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:30.440]   Um, okay.
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:31.440]   So.
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:34.440]   The comments say, if you give me already, I can run one concurrently.
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:35.440]   Right.
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:36.440]   So, okay.
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:38.440]   Uh, what I did do is.
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:39.440]   Go.
[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:44.440]   Um, if you go into the discord server, uh, AI in the AI in action channel.
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:49.440]   I don't know if you post up and actually while I'm doing that, I'm just going to post a link to it in the thing.
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:50.440]   Boom.
[00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:51.440]   Copy.
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:52.440]   Not message ID.
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:54.440]   I want to copy message link.
[00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:59.440]   Uh, so, um, if you want to download already yourself, you can go to that link.
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:03.440]   I just posted in the chat and, and like, you know, use, uh, nano banana on your side.
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:04.440]   Again, that's AI studio.google.com.
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:09.440]   And then if you look at the top right-hand corner, you'd have to find the nano banana model.
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:16.440]   Um, any other like, uh, test prompts that you think would, would be cool.
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:20.440]   Isometric running or something.
[00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:26.440]   So I'm literally going to, I'm going to type that with no other context.
[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:29.440]   Cause I'm not sure what you mean by that.
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:30.440]   It's fine.
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:32.440]   I think it was like a fancy name for a different view.
[00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:40.440]   And I just want to see him like, see if they can like generate a different, completely different view, doing something completely different.
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.440]   Yeah.
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:42.440]   Yeah.
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:47.440]   What, what might be worth the effort here is for me to start over.
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:57.440]   Um, it's, it's, it's, it's a start over and then start with the original image and see if you could do it better.
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:00.440]   Cause they still have them on this random planet that we're now exploring.
[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.440]   But that's not, that's not terrible.
[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:04.440]   Is this what you had in mind though?
[00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:05.440]   Yeah.
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:06.440]   Yeah.
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:11.440]   I actually don't know what view isometric is, but it looks, it's.
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:12.440]   Yeah.
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:13.440]   That's yeah.
[00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:17.440]   The fact that they've kept already intact this whole time is what to me is impressive.
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:22.440]   Cause like before I think that was not a thing.
[00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:30.440]   Um, I really would like to pull up if I can.
[00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:31.440]   Okay.
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:32.440]   Give me one second.
[00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:35.440]   Go sub layer.
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:36.440]   Okay.
[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:37.440]   And then.
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:42.440]   I have a discord app.
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:43.440]   Generate an image.
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:45.440]   Oh, we got, we got one.
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:46.440]   So.
[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:47.440]   Oh, that's crazy.
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:49.440]   I got to pull that up on the screen.
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:55.440]   Um, so this is prompted by, uh, Oh, don't kill me if I, if I'm not pronouncing this right.
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:56.440]   You can correct me.
[00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:57.440]   Uh, if you type it out phonetically.
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:58.440]   Yeah.
[00:19:58.440 --> 00:19:59.440]   See, Joe, thank you.
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:00.440]   Thank you.
[00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:01.440]   Cause you knew I was about, I was about to mess that up.
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:04.440]   Uh, CJ prompted generate an image of RD.
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:08.440]   This character wielding a lightsaber and shooting forest lightning at a sit.
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:10.440]   Like that's kind of crazy.
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:12.440]   Uh, which is really cool.
[00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:13.440]   Um, so, okay.
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:16.440]   I boom, AI and testing.
[00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:18.440]   Just to give a, we were about 20 minutes in now.
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:20.440]   So just give to give a slight segue.
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:23.440]   If I click this one, this one, this one.
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:26.440]   Then I can go here and bring it back over.
[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:32.440]   I have created a test discord server that I can like invite everyone to, or I don't know
[00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.440]   how to do the whole invite thing.
[00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:35.440]   This is something I think could maybe help me with.
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:39.440]   Cause I've done zero moderation, actual moderation of, of discord servers.
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:44.440]   But I created a discord server called AI and testing as opposed to AI in action.
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:48.440]   And I think we could do a lot of testing here in the server for the discord bot.
[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:54.440]   Like every time we have an idea where we want to vibe code a thing, we could put it in this server.
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:21:00.440]   Um, I, I, I think there was already one created with the Zach and, um, and I forgot my boy's name.
[00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:06.440]   Uh, who, who created that the actual original discord bot, but I don't, I don't, I didn't have access to it.
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:08.440]   I'm not sure. I couldn't remember off the top of my head how to find it.
[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:12.440]   Um, so I, I figured I'd just, uh, make a new one cause they're fairly simple to make.
[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:16.440]   And with this, I've also invited, um, and already bought.
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:18.440]   So we could kind of like build on top of it.
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:20.440]   I, the one thing just to keep this brief.
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:28.440]   I think the one thing, um, that I, the one issue that I run into, cause I did figure out how to get, uh, the discord keys.
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:30.440]   There's like several keys you have to have.
[00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:33.440]   You had, you need a bis, a discord bot token and a discord guild ID.
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:34.440]   That's easy. That's shareable.
[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:43.440]   The one issue that I ran into was like the whole server thing and how I actually hosting the code that runs, um, you know, the services that, that kind of like power the discord bot.
[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.440]   So maybe we can like jam offline about that.
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:57.440]   But I, I would like to do some more testing and figure out like how, how to create a good platform that, uh, the community can have access to, uh, that, um, that will allow us to vibe code on, on a weekly basis.
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:01.440]   Whenever we don't have like a specific topic we want to, we want to talk about.
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:11.440]   Um, so with that said, I, I, I just wanted to kind of show that off and, uh, maybe I'll pull up some of these other, um, uh, images that are coming into the chat.
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:13.440]   This is, is this already as a dog.
[00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:20.440]   I want to know the prompt for this one.
[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:22.440]   Okay. Well, this is crazy.
[00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:26.440]   Um, so Manuel says, see how coherent it is across styles.
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:28.440]   So that's actually a good, a great prompt.
[00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:30.440]   And I'm going to pull up our original.
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:36.440]   Uh, I think this is like stretching probably the, the, the context window of, of the model.
[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:47.440]   But I would like to see, um, let's see already already in a completely different style with no other context.
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:53.440]   I don't, I don't know what else you're looking for specifically, but, um, while that's being generated.
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:57.440]   I was, uh, gonna ask for a character sheet for pixel graphics.
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:59.440]   Like character sheet is always interesting.
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:03.440]   Cause you get like four different views or so.
[00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:05.440]   What was the prompt for this one?
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:12.440]   It's a mini figure in the Lego movie.
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:13.440]   Nice, nice.
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:15.440]   We have another one here.
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:18.440]   K-ball generated already doing work.
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:23.440]   This is what K-ball actually wants for work for his meetings.
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:28.440]   It's like already to show up and just host, you know, do everything.
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:32.440]   I want to automate myself out of a job here.
[00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:40.440]   Yeah, Artie's closing the deals, Artie's taking on the, all the responsibility.
[00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:42.440]   What else do we have here?
[00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:45.440]   Oh, Artie got a promotion.
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:48.440]   Creating an image of Artie in a meeting with businessmen.
[00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:55.440]   Okay, let's go back and see if we, that's, I don't, this is not exactly a different style, but it's interesting.
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:24:01.440]   I want to see, what were the keywords that you said again, Manuel, Artie?
[00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:04.440]   Character sheet pixel graphics.
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:08.440]   Character sheet pixel graphics.
[00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:14.440]   Let's see how this one turns out.
[00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:21.440]   And while I'm doing that, I should also figure out how to.
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:29.440]   I like the Sith one, that the original that CJ put in there.
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:31.440]   Drop some more in the town.
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:34.440]   I'll pull them up as I'm trying to figure out how to.
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:36.440]   I feel like we got to be.
[00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:40.440]   Well, I mean, it says it's only like, was that roughly 10,000 tokens.
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:41.440]   Yeah.
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:49.440]   But I'd imagine like the coherence over the course of a, of a conversation is, is probably
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:50.440]   gets worse.
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:51.440]   Ooh.
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:55.440]   That is pretty impressive.
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:56.440]   Yeah.
[00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:57.440]   That's bad-ass.
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:58.440]   I liked it.
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:24:59.440]   Yeah.
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:00.440]   No, this is nice.
[00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:01.440]   Let me see if I can.
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:08.440]   So if I download it and then click this here, I should be able to show a full screen.
[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:09.440]   There we go.
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:10.440]   Wow.
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:11.440]   Level 99.
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:12.440]   That's fire.
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:13.440]   I didn't even think about that.
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:14.440]   That's cool.
[00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:19.440]   This is definitely, what are the, prompt golfing at its finest.
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:24.440]   Cause you literally said four words and got it to change the entire style.
[00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:25.440]   Which is really cool.
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:26.440]   Yeah.
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:27.440]   Do poker playing cards.
[00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:29.440]   Let's do another one.
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:33.440]   Poker playing cards.
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:37.440]   This is, I feel like, so, um, barbaric by typing in these.
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:38.440]   Prompts.
[00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:39.440]   Cause I'm always like hyping up the model.
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:40.440]   I'm like, Oh, great job, buddy.
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:43.440]   I appreciate the hard work, but like, it's not really necessary.
[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:45.440]   I just like to do it as a nice.
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:47.440]   This is impressive though.
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:49.440]   That like, I don't know how it works internally.
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:50.440]   Right.
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:55.440]   But like when I did image model prompting, like two years ago, or even one year ago, you
[00:25:55.440 --> 00:26:00.440]   had to really like work on your prompts and every word like counted.
[00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:02.440]   And then open AI does all this like magic transformation.
[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:04.440]   So you have like zero control.
[00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:06.440]   And I wonder how this one behaves, right?
[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:12.440]   Like if you add artist names or whatever, or like all kinds of weird stuff.
[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:13.440]   I'll have to play with it.
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:14.440]   This is amazing.
[00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:15.440]   Yeah.
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:16.440]   Yeah.
[00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:18.440]   It's been, it's been getting a ton of hype over the last few weeks.
[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:20.440]   And I just, I was like, we've got to talk about this in the, uh,
[00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:22.440]   Well, I got a, I got a big thing.
[00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:23.440]   I'm going to shoot it to you.
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:26.440]   I think in discord DMS, I should have enough text for it.
[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:29.440]   Um, and it's like a bunch of prompts.
[00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:30.440]   I asked Chad GBT.
[00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:31.440]   Okay.
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:32.440]   Yeah.
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:33.440]   I asked Chad GBT.
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:37.440]   Cause I'm, I got a weekend hack project that I'm doing D and D shit on.
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:49.440]   So I am, uh, we can have, um, uh, uh, uh, we can have, we can replace the person thing.
[00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:58.440]   The care up character thing up there at the top with already or whatever, but, um, or you could just like dump this and do panel one and then do panel two, et cetera.
[00:26:58.440 --> 00:26:59.440]   And see what happens.
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:08.440]   Um, but that this is, I asked Chad GBT to do some storyboarding, to test an image generation model.
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:10.440]   So you can use some of that if you want.
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:14.440]   And also I, there's something in the zoom chat too, that I dropped off earlier.
[00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:18.440]   That's like, uh, let's, let's remix already into, uh, into, uh, that.
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:19.440]   Yeah.
[00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:20.440]   There you go.
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:21.440]   Okay.
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:27.440]   So, so, uh, from, for me, from my understanding, you're saying that this image that you sent originally,
[00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:31.440]   that the, you are shined renegades, cyber slasher is like an example.
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:32.440]   Yeah.
[00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:37.440]   So that, that what I was going to say is let's feed that to the image and say, make Artie into this guy.
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:39.440]   Um, I see.
[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:42.440]   And then we can take that Artie and we can put him through those scenes.
[00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:43.440]   I sent you.
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:44.440]   Okay.
[00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:45.440]   Okay.
[00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:46.440]   Okay.
[00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:47.440]   Okay.
[00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:48.440]   Okay.
[00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:49.440]   So I'm going to go to lane space.
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:50.440]   I'm looking for on the other thing.
[00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:51.440]   It's just, it's in your DM.
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:52.440]   Yeah.
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:56.440]   I also, there was a thread that I was a part of.
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:28:01.440]   Not too long ago in the main channel that showed a bunch of crazy examples of.
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:02.440]   If we go.
[00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:03.440]   Okay.
[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:04.440]   There we go.
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:05.440]   I found it.
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:08.440]   Oh, it's still active as like a couple of days ago.
[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:10.440]   So yeah, there's this one.
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:12.440]   And there's also another one, but I'm not worried about it.
[00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:15.440]   I'm just going to click these two.
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:19.440]   High quality character generator puts hangover in the gear.
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:20.440]   I like it.
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:21.440]   I like it.
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:28.440]   Here's a thread and I'll share the links to these threads.
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:31.440]   So you guys can also check them out yourself.
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:33.440]   But there's a bunch of crazy examples.
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:40.440]   And this, this thread, as well as copy link.
[00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:41.440]   I'm going to put.
[00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:43.440]   So threads in the chat.
[00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:44.440]   First one.
[00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:46.440]   And then there's another one that I was looking for.
[00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:58.440]   That was originally in the Jen media.
[00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:01.440]   Did I miss it?
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:05.440]   I might have went back too far.
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:07.440]   There you go.
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:08.440]   Yeah.
[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:13.440]   But between both of these, you should have like more than enough inspiration that you can find here.
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:15.440]   And I just put that in the chat.
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:18.440]   But both of those are threads in the latent space discord server.
[00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:23.440]   And then let's go back to all crap.
[00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:26.440]   I forgot where I put the.
[00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:29.440]   I want to see those poker cards.
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:31.440]   Okay, found it.
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:36.440]   And this can actually go right next to that tab.
[00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:39.440]   Ooh, already LLM agent.
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:40.440]   Oh, all of them say LLM agent.
[00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:42.440]   They're just as different.
[00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:51.440]   So Jack, Queen, Ace, Queen and King.
[00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:54.440]   I want interesting.
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:57.440]   I wonder why not a joker.
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:59.440]   Like why.
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:02.440]   It chose the images it chose for the for the playing cards.
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:04.440]   That's another one I'm going to download.
[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:06.440]   It's at the cards are totally messed up, right?
[00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:07.440]   Like it's got Q.
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:08.440]   K.
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:09.440]   K.
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:13.440]   Yeah, I just realized I just realized that.
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:16.440]   I just realized that.
[00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:19.440]   I'm just to see.
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:20.440]   I have.
[00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:21.440]   I have.
[00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:27.440]   No shot this works again, right?
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:30.440]   Like if I go.
[00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:31.440]   Chat.
[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:33.440]   We're still on nano banana.
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:39.440]   I typed that prompt in and then I go pull up my downloads folder, which has the original already.
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:42.440]   I'm going to drop that in what happens.
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:43.440]   Okay.
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:44.440]   In the background.
[00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:45.440]   We.
[00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:46.440]   Go to.
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:48.440]   Yikes DM.
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:58.440]   Okay, that's an interesting take on the.
[00:30:58.440 --> 00:30:59.440]   I think.
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:00.440]   They're not playing cards.
[00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:03.440]   They're not playing cards of him, but he is playing cards.
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:04.440]   Exactly.
[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:05.440]   Yeah.
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:06.440]   Exactly.
[00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:07.440]   No, exactly.
[00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:08.440]   Okay.
[00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:10.440]   Let me check my DM real quick.
[00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:11.440]   Sorry.
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:12.440]   I'm gonna check the chat as well.
[00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:17.440]   Cause I haven't, I've not kept up at all.
[00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:22.440]   Oh, I like this one too.
[00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:25.440]   I don't know what the, what was the.
[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:28.440]   Oh, it left.
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:29.440]   Yeah.
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:32.440]   It does seem like it left already the same, but then introduced like this other.
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:35.440]   Art style.
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:40.440]   Um, but I'm, I'm curious what the prompt for that one was, Evan.
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:41.440]   Dooply.
[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:42.440]   Artie.
[00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:44.440]   I like this one as well.
[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:50.440]   It says, um, CJ said to make Artie this character into, into a watercolor sorcerer.
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:55.440]   And I really, I like that.
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:57.440]   Okay.
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:03.440]   Um, it rejected, uh, image request related violence, but it doesn't seem to reject referencing
[00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:05.440]   at least famous individuals.
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:06.440]   Which is interesting.
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:07.440]   Ooh.
[00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:08.440]   I don't know what.
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:12.440]   They'll probably neuter it at some point.
[00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:13.440]   Um, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:14.440]   For sure.
[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:21.440]   Um, this is another one of the reasons why I wanted to, um, kind of like give, give, or, you
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:27.440]   know, do some demos on this, uh, as quickly as possible because, uh, yeah, they, they always
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:30.440]   neuter the, they lobotomize the models.
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:37.440]   So, um, apparently it has no barriers barrier on referencing the Simpsons.
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:42.440]   I'm just not seeing that image punk rock concert flyer.
[00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:43.440]   Ooh.
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:44.440]   Already.
[00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:52.440]   As a copy and pasted your prompt and let's see what happens.
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:58.440]   Anyone tried prompting nano banana with json formatted prompt.
[00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:15.440]   Oh, I like, so it, it, it gave you, so you gave it one prompt and it gave you multiple images.
[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:16.440]   Uh, Evan.
[00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:17.440]   That's, that's really cool.
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:18.440]   Yep.
[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:19.440]   Yeah.
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:20.440]   That's really cool.
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:22.440]   I didn't know it could do that either.
[00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:23.440]   Yeah.
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:25.440]   What do you think about this man?
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:31.440]   I am noticing also the, the length of time to generate.
[00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:35.440]   I'm just doing this all in one long thread and each time it takes longer.
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:39.440]   So it's doing something with all the different, uh, images.
[00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:40.440]   Yes.
[00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:47.440]   The content, the context as which is, yeah, that's, I have no clue how this works behind
[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:50.440]   the scenes, but, but.
[00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:51.440]   Yeah.
[00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:52.440]   Yeah.
[00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:53.440]   Yeah.
[00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:54.440]   Yeah.
[00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:55.440]   Yeah.
[00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:58.440]   That was pretty funny.
[00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:01.440]   Well, the multiple generations here, cause you have curry.
[00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:03.440]   Wait, who is, who, who is this supposed to be?
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:04.440]   Number six.
[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:06.440]   I asked it to do bill Russell.
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:09.440]   I don't think that's an accurate image.
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:12.440]   I mean, bill Russell's old, right?
[00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:17.440]   So young pictures of him are probably like from a long time ago, but I don't know who that
[00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:18.440]   actually is.
[00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:20.440]   I don't think it's bill Russell.
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:21.440]   Yeah.
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:22.440]   Yeah.
[00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:23.440]   Yeah.
[00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:24.440]   Yeah.
[00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:25.440]   Agreed.
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:26.440]   That's bill Russell's beard.
[00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:27.440]   Yeah.
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:29.440]   His facial hair.
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:31.440]   Um, what, what was pixel?
[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:35.440]   What was the, the, the, the, the keywords you told me again, man?
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:36.440]   Well, pixel.
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:40.440]   I wonder if we can get like, get back into that line of like, it was pixel something.
[00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:41.440]   Yeah.
[00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:42.440]   Pixel graphics character sheet.
[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:43.440]   Yeah.
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:43.440]   Yeah.
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:44.440]   Yeah.
[00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:45.440]   I guess something to play with.
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:52.440]   It's just like, you know, being mindful of the context of like whatever you put in it before.
[00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:57.440]   I think last time we tried this, we were like 15 images deep or generations deep.
[00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:02.440]   Um, I want a different, so like, and it definitely takes into context, whatever you've been talking
[00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:07.440]   about because it took the pixel graphics character sheet and now like put it into the form of this
[00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:12.440]   punk rock, uh, concert flyer, which is, which is super interesting.
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:16.440]   Um, so yeah.
[00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:21.440]   It doesn't actually understand character sheet the way I want that to understand it.
[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:27.440]   It does this like weird mix of RPG character sheet and like, so maybe try animation character sheet.
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:30.440]   Can you like rewind the prompt?
[00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:32.440]   So how about this?
[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:38.440]   Uh, we, oh, I'll start from the top and instead of poker playing cards, I can do, um, animation
[00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:42.440]   animation character sheet.
[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:46.440]   And then rerun this turn, which eliminates.
[00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:48.440]   Oh, it doesn't eliminate everything below.
[00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:52.440]   This is, I like that.
[00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:54.440]   Uh, we've talked about this a lot.
[00:35:54.440 --> 00:36:07.440]   Um, there's a guy named, um, Jeremy Howard, who has talked about this, like editing the, the responses of the LLM to make it more, um, in line with like what you're, what you actually want.
[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:13.440]   Um, and I think this is like a case of that, uh, within AI studio and Google.
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:15.440]   Oh, it's taken a super long time.
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:19.440]   I wonder why.
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:29.440]   Maybe it's doing multiple images.
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:31.440]   I'm trying to, if I could quickly find the other.
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:32.440]   I thought this was really cool.
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:36.440]   Um, that, that nano banana has a world knowledge.
[00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:42.440]   So, uh, the prompt it gave, it was like, uh, you are a location based AR, AR experience generator.
[00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:46.440]   Highlight the point of interest in this image and annotate relevant information about it.
[00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:48.440]   I thought that was really cool.
[00:36:48.440 --> 00:37:02.440]   Um, see if I can zoom in a bit, but it's just taking like real world images and highlighting them, which I thought was pretty cool.
[00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:12.440]   Um, yeah, this was really cool too.
[00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:21.440]   Um, as far as like 3d goes, but you, it basically prompted nano banana to make an image daytime and isometric with the building only.
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:24.440]   And as you can see, like this image is not exactly high quality.
[00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:26.440]   It's probably taken on like a somewhat older phone.
[00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:28.440]   There's a blurry car in the image.
[00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:30.440]   The background is not even the focus.
[00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:32.440]   Like the building in the background is not even really the focus.
[00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:34.440]   It's more so these lights here.
[00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:45.440]   Um, but just based on this image, it was able to generate an isometric image of the building, which I think is insane.
[00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:55.440]   Um, so yeah, there's just like we're using it for fun for the most part in this, uh, you know, like the demo that we've had so far in the first 40 minutes or so.
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:38:01.440]   I think it can do some really serious stuff, uh, based on what I saw on those, those, um, those threads.
[00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:04.440]   So I thought this was really cool too, but I'll, I'll skip that one.
[00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:06.440]   It's more of a main good thing.
[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:15.440]   I think, um, speaking of coherence, I don't know if you guys seen this one, but it's a guy talking originally.
[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:18.440]   And I think you, it was prompted initially.
[00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:24.440]   Um, I don't know.
[00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:25.440]   Maybe I misunderstood this.
[00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:27.440]   I thought it was, oh, he, he goes into details here.
[00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:28.440]   He started with a selfie.
[00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:34.440]   He dropped it into nano banana, um, swapped clothes, switch styles, even turned myself into an animated character.
[00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:39.440]   Um, and he used free pick.
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:42.440]   So free pick is one of the platforms that Google at, we talked about this earlier.
[00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:48.440]   Google launched this, um, this, this model in stealth on these other platforms.
[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:50.440]   And from what I understand, free pick was one of them.
[00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:52.440]   I didn't even know they had a platform.
[00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:55.440]   There's another like AI based platform that I can't think of to save my life.
[00:38:55.440 --> 00:39:02.440]   But, uh, it, it launched on that platform as well before, before they announced nano banana and said, Hey, come use it in Google AI studio.
[00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:03.440]   But this is one of them.
[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:05.440]   I just thought this.
[00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:08.440]   He's doing that as video.
[00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:15.440]   So do you think, did he decompose that into a bunch of frames or did they just, they do that for him under the covers?
[00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:19.440]   Um, so I, I, I think he used runway cause runway does video.
[00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:21.440]   So I believe he used runway in this instance.
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:25.440]   Um, but I'll, I'll actually share this link directly in the chat.
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:27.440]   And he goes into the details.
[00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:31.440]   I think here in the, in the rest of the thread, as he's like answering questions and stuff.
[00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:36.440]   But, um, if I'm not mistaken, he used together as one of the platforms.
[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:39.440]   That's not the platform I'm thinking of, but together is another like image generation platform.
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:42.440]   If I remember correctly, where they, they do like hosted models.
[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:47.440]   But, uh, I think this is a combination of nano banana and runway for, for this particular video.
[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:51.440]   Um, if I remember correctly, I thought this was fire.
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:54.440]   I do a bunch of e-commerce stuff with my, my younger brother.
[00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:56.440]   And I thought this was really cool.
[00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:59.440]   You can do, um, product placements.
[00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:03.440]   So, you know, took a selfie of this guy that I think is a stock photo from what I can tell.
[00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:06.440]   If not, it's maybe like a high, high quality image.
[00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:10.440]   And, uh, took, uh, a product image as you can see here.
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:12.440]   That's obviously done in a studio or something like that.
[00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:13.440]   That's super high quality.
[00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:19.440]   And he was able to combine both of them into this product placement image, just using a nano banana.
[00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:21.440]   So, yeah.
[00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:23.440]   Um, lots of cool examples in the thread.
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:25.440]   I don't know if you guys have anything else.
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:26.440]   I have, I need to catch up on the chat.
[00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:32.440]   If you guys, anything else you guys want to cover here in the last 20 minutes, I'm going to kind of open the floor.
[00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:39.440]   Um, I've yet to try this one, but I really, I saw this one and started freaking out.
[00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:41.440]   Cause I'm like, man, this is so cool.
[00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:54.440]   Um, but it basically turned any image into, uh, uh, an AR HUD, uh, because of the world knowledge.
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:57.440]   Apparently this technology has been around since 2017.
[00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:00.440]   It's just Google never really released it.
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:05.440]   Um, yeah, just a ton of examples, a ton of examples.
[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:08.440]   Uh, let me open up the chat.
[00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:13.440]   Um, Evan, the, the, the characters that it created is insane.
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:16.440]   Like that, that one for sure is crazy.
[00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:21.440]   That one for sure is crazy.
[00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:26.440]   David Gutman said, I've been trying to, oh, David, that's what I was trying to think of earlier.
[00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:30.440]   Um, trying to get nano banana to do something like this.
[00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:33.440]   This is like the, the sprite thing that you were talking about earlier, right?
[00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:40.440]   Um, Slono, I mean, well, it's a character sprite sheet.
[00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:41.440]   Uh, hold on.
[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:43.440]   I, I'm not seeing your screen.
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:44.440]   Oh yeah.
[00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:45.440]   Oh, that's crazy.
[00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:49.440]   So, so I, I don't think this is actually a, a nano banana generation.
[00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:53.440]   I think David was saying that he's been trying to get it to do something like this.
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:54.440]   Yeah.
[00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:55.440]   Gotcha.
[00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:56.440]   Yeah.
[00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:57.440]   Yeah.
[00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:58.440]   Yeah.
[00:41:58.440 --> 00:41:59.440]   This seems, cause I was like, this seems very unrelated.
[00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:00.440]   Yeah.
[00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:09.440]   Um, Ooh, and CJ got it to do this, which is interesting.
[00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:12.440]   I like the color palette in the top right hand corner.
[00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:13.440]   Yeah.
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:14.440]   Not exactly.
[00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:15.440]   It looks more like what I wanted.
[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:16.440]   Yeah.
[00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:19.440]   What was the, what was the, I'm curious.
[00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:24.440]   So CJ said that the prompt for this was generate a pixel animation character of this.
[00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:28.440]   No, a general, a pixel animation character sheet of this character already.
[00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:38.440]   And this is from, Ooh, pull this character out and have him jumping out of a van and checking
[00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:41.440]   his gear with the rest of the goons.
[00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:42.440]   Yes.
[00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:53.440]   If you guys have anything else that you want to cover, we can, oh my, no way.
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:55.440]   I must've broke it.
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:59.440]   Um, it's like five minutes later and this thing is, uh, still generating the animation
[00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:00.440]   character sheet.
[00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:02.440]   And, and Google AI studio.
[00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:03.440]   Okay.
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:07.440]   So, um, oh my God, that's a great point cable.
[00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:12.440]   So cable says, uh, they're going to have to neuter it with regard to celebrate, uh, celebs,
[00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:13.440]   celebrities.
[00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:14.440]   Oh my God.
[00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:15.440]   And then product placements.
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:17.440]   Cause they got Obama endorsing liquid death.
[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:26.440]   Um, yeah, no, that's insane.
[00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:27.440]   And the rock's so big.
[00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:29.440]   He's holding two of them in one Palm.
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:31.440]   Keanu Reeves.
[00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:32.440]   Keanu Reeves.
[00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:33.440]   Yeah.
[00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:37.440]   And Keanu Reeves is like, I don't have anything.
[00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:38.440]   True.
[00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:39.440]   True.
[00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:40.440]   The sizes there.
[00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:42.440]   I think have gotta be wrong.
[00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:44.440]   Like Barack Obama is six feet tall.
[00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:49.440]   I don't think Taylor Swift is six, five.
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:54.440]   The rock might be realistic, but like, and I don't even know who I'm bad with celebs.
[00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:55.440]   I don't know who that last one is.
[00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:58.440]   I just told it generate, you know, five celebrities holding liquid death.
[00:43:58.440 --> 00:43:59.440]   And this is what it got.
[00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:03.440]   I can't think of product placement, liquid death, five celebrities.
[00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:04.440]   Okay.
[00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:05.440]   That's not bad.
[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:11.440]   Um, actress, if I remember correctly, I just can't remember a name off the top of my head.
[00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:12.440]   Well, like Spider-Man, right?
[00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:15.440]   I want to ask.
[00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:17.440]   Actually, let's see if it can answer.
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:18.440]   Oh yeah.
[00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:19.440]   That's a good question.
[00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:20.440]   Um, new chat.
[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:29.440]   Let me download that specifically into my downloads folder.
[00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:31.440]   Open my downloads folder.
[00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:35.440]   I was able to ask it just like, who are the celebrities?
[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:36.440]   So I got it.
[00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:37.440]   Yeah.
[00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:38.440]   It says Zendaya.
[00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:39.440]   You're right.
[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:40.440]   Yeah.
[00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:41.440]   Yeah.
[00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:42.440]   That's crazy.
[00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:45.440]   Okay.
[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:46.440]   Okay.
[00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:48.440]   So yeah.
[00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:54.440]   Can, can you, can you also like reprompt me on what we were doing with this?
[00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:58.440]   Cause I, I'm, I'm, I'm in my DM now and I see the prompt and we've got like 15 minutes left.
[00:44:58.440 --> 00:44:59.440]   Oh, let's see.
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:02.440]   Uh, we were, I was gonna hit, let's see.
[00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:13.440]   Uh, uh, give it, why don't you get, uh, give it a picture of Artie and then give it that first thing in the care, the character block thing at the very top.
[00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:14.440]   At the very top.
[00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:18.440]   And then, and then prompt it through those scenes, like one through 12 or whatever.
[00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:19.440]   Okay.
[00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:24.440]   So the first one will, the first prompt to look something like this.
[00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:25.440]   Yeah.
[00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:26.440]   Yeah.
[00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:31.440]   And so, but attach Artie to that and be like, make Artie this.
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:34.440]   Got it.
[00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:41.440]   And then new line, make Artie this.
[00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:42.440]   Is that?
[00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:43.440]   Yeah.
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:44.440]   Okay.
[00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:51.440]   And then you can, after that, we can test the consistency with, see if, see how it doesn't seem.
[00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:52.440]   Okay.
[00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:53.440]   All right.
[00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:54.440]   Starting over.
[00:45:54.440 --> 00:46:04.440]   Well, you did use the word stabby, so it might not work.
[00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:05.440]   Hmm.
[00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:06.440]   Violent.
[00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:07.440]   Oh, cringe, dude.
[00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:10.440]   I don't like it, but whatever.
[00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:17.440]   See, then try and throw it in scene one and see what happens.
[00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:18.440]   Okay.
[00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:19.440]   So, okay.
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:23.440]   So panel, panel one model sheet.
[00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:26.440]   Or, yeah, there you go.
[00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:27.440]   The story, the storyboard prompt.
[00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:28.440]   Should I be doing that one instead?
[00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:29.440]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:30.440]   Probably.
[00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:31.440]   Probably.
[00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:36.440]   Let me, let's take a, I think, let me see what that prompt looked like in a sec.
[00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:39.440]   It was a storyboard prompt pack 12 panels.
[00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:41.440]   Each entry is a complete prompt.
[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:42.440]   Okay.
[00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:43.440]   Yeah.
[00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:44.440]   Yeah.
[00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:48.440]   So we, yeah, we can do like maybe the first two panels and see, see what, you can do one
[00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:49.440]   at a time if you want.
[00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:50.440]   Cool.
[00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:51.440]   Yeah.
[00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:53.440]   Character reference sheet of care of car.
[00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:59.440]   You could add, you could try referring to, you could try using that care character block
[00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:02.440]   thing and see if it will take that as like a variable.
[00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:06.440]   It could be interesting to see what it remembers.
[00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:13.440]   And what, so when you say using it as a variable, are you saying to like, cause I, I just removed
[00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:20.440]   the, like just copy, like copy paste completely from panel one down and don't replace that
[00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:22.440]   like a little block that's in it.
[00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:23.440]   Like, got it.
[00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:24.440]   So like this more.
[00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:29.440]   So do I, do I leave the, where it says like little, quite literally prompt, like P R O M P
[00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:31.440]   T or, or take that out.
[00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:32.440]   Yeah.
[00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:33.440]   Let me see.
[00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:34.440]   Um, yeah.
[00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:35.440]   Just send it like that.
[00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:36.440]   You're good.
[00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:37.440]   Okay.
[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:38.440]   Okay.
[00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:39.440]   Okay.
[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:45.440]   And then see if it'll do the next one.
[00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:48.440]   And, and I'm curious about what kind of, okay.
[00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:49.440]   Okay.
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:51.440]   So we got a couple options here.
[00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:53.440]   Wide skyline of, of the dystopian.
[00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:54.440]   Yeah.
[00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:55.440]   Yeah.
[00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:56.440]   Okay.
[00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:57.440]   I'm going to do the next one.
[00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:58.440]   There you go.
[00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:04.440]   ID 404.
[00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:04.440]   Not bad.
[00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:09.440]   We got a little bit of detail there.
[00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:10.440]   Yeah.
[00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:11.440]   Yeah.
[00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:16.440]   It's a little like stale for me, but the, but I was trying to get it to do stylized earlier
[00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:20.440]   and it doesn't really, it really like gloms onto the stuff it's already seen.
[00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:21.440]   Okay.
[00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:22.440]   Okay.
[00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:23.440]   I'm with it here.
[00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:24.440]   Yeah.
[00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:25.440]   That's not bad.
[00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:26.440]   That's not bad.
[00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:27.440]   Yeah.
[00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:28.440]   Yeah.
[00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:30.440]   And we got the little details and stuff.
[00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:31.440]   Okay.
[00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:32.440]   Yeah.
[00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:33.440]   I'm digging it.
[00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:36.440]   Instead of having one little companion on the shoulder, it has two of them.
[00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:37.440]   Now it looks like.
[00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:38.440]   That's true.
[00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:39.440]   That's true.
[00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:40.440]   Yeah.
[00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:41.440]   But, but for the most part.
[00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:42.440]   Okay.
[00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:43.440]   So hold on.
[00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:44.440]   I'll go to the next one.
[00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:45.440]   Panel three.
[00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:49.440]   And we're changing aspect ratio here too, which is kind of nice.
[00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:55.440]   Oh, I just realized that you're saying.
[00:48:55.440 --> 00:49:00.440]   Oh, yeah, that's crazy.
[00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:03.440]   I just realized you, you did the aspect ratio thing.
[00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:04.440]   Okay.
[00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:05.440]   So let's see the next one.
[00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:06.440]   Okay.
[00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:07.440]   So four bucks.
[00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:12.440]   So it's, it didn't, it looks like it didn't pick up the aspect ratio on this one.
[00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:14.440]   Tight portrait rain droplets.
[00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:15.440]   Okay.
[00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:16.440]   Got that.
[00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:17.440]   We got a little smirk.
[00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:30.440]   That's a terrifying grin, but I have to refer back to the chat and see if anyone else has
[00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:36.440]   any questions or, or has seen some cool examples of, of, so I'm on panel four number, panel number
[00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:42.440]   four now, but just seeing if anyone has characters, I mean, questions about nano banana or I've seen
[00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:43.440]   really cool examples.
[00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:44.440]   Okay.
[00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:45.440]   So we're changing aspect ratio.
[00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:48.440]   Oh, so it's got like a little very, okay.
[00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:52.440]   So are we, we, we didn't get a lot of variation on the camera angle here.
[00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:53.440]   Right.
[00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:56.440]   I've noticed that, that it does seem to struggle with camera angles.
[00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:57.440]   Yeah.
[00:49:57.440 --> 00:49:58.440]   Okay.
[00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:01.440]   We got, we got some pose action.
[00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:02.440]   Yeah.
[00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:14.440]   I'm wondering, could it, could you like, I like how, if you look closely at the details right here, the gun fire, like goes over into the next panel, like the bottom panel.
[00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:15.440]   Like the bottom panel.
[00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:21.440]   I wonder if you could tell it, can you ask it, ask it for a wire frame of those three shots.
[00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:27.440]   Create a wire frame of the last three shots.
[00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:28.440]   Does that sound about right?
[00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:35.440]   No, just like, give me a wire frame of that so I can animate it.
[00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:50.440]   So far, I really like this character development though.
[00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:51.440]   Right.
[00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:52.440]   Right.
[00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:53.440]   Good job.
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:56.440]   I told it to go research the setting and everything.
[00:50:56.440 --> 00:50:59.440]   It's, it's, it's staying on track.
[00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:09.440]   The, the one thing I noticed that's missing here in AI studio is like with the, you know, text language models, the text generation models, you can actually, you know, put Google grounding.
[00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:12.440]   And so it can be like use Google to go search things and add that to the conversation.
[00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:14.440]   Whereas here, like with the image generation.
[00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:15.440]   Okay.
[00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:16.440]   Yeah.
[00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:17.440]   I didn't get it.
[00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:18.440]   Yeah.
[00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:23.440]   What I was looking for was like a, a little like a skeleton.
[00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:25.440]   Like you would drag it around in unity or something.
[00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:26.440]   Okay.
[00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:27.440]   Okay.
[00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:28.440]   Okay.
[00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:29.440]   I follow what you're saying now.
[00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:30.440]   I follow.
[00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:31.440]   It's a bit of a tricky problem.
[00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:32.440]   It's all good.
[00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:33.440]   Yeah.
[00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:34.440]   Yeah.
[00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:36.440]   But, um, that also makes me curious.
[00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:41.440]   Like if we fed it something like this, could it create a wire frame from the original image?
[00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:44.440]   Like if, if it doesn't, cause I, I do feel like it loses.
[00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:50.440]   Um, like almost intelligence over time because it's trying to keep into context, the entire conversation.
[00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:53.440]   And that's one, you know, prompt by prompt by prompt.
[00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:56.440]   I do like by probes example in chat here.
[00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:57.440]   That's really good.
[00:51:57.440 --> 00:52:01.440]   The, uh, show the woman wearing the outfit and you just send it a picture of the outfit.
[00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:03.440]   And that's it.
[00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:04.440]   I got it.
[00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:05.440]   I love it.
[00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:06.440]   What else can you do with that?
[00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:09.440]   I wonder until they neuter it.
[00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:11.440]   You could show whoever you want.
[00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:12.440]   Yeah.
[00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:16.440]   I feel like this is really bad for models.
[00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:21.440]   Cause I feel like every clothing company is now going to like hire a model once and then
[00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:22.440]   just.
[00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:24.440]   They've already been doing that shit.
[00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:34.440]   I mean, well, if I was, uh, yeah, if I was doing, if I was in that business, it would be
[00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:35.440]   over.
[00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:36.440]   I do.
[00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:37.440]   I do agree with you though.
[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:38.440]   It's, it's unprecedented.
[00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:42.440]   Like, I think Google opening it up to everybody for free makes it like the, the barrier super
[00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:43.440]   low.
[00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:46.440]   And yeah, I do think there, there will be a lot of that stuff.
[00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:47.440]   Yeah.
[00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:48.440]   That's true.
[00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:50.440]   Even normies could probably get over here.
[00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:51.440]   Uh, yeah.
[00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:52.440]   Do you guys.
[00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:56.440]   So, uh, cable, when you, when you were getting denials on your requests on your, on your prompts,
[00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:59.440]   do you have the, uh, safety settings turned all the way down?
[00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:01.440]   I don't know.
[00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:03.440]   I have not tinkered with my settings at all.
[00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:09.440]   The only prompts that the only prompt that it denied was when I asked it to show already
[00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:11.440]   punching Donald Trump in the face.
[00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:16.440]   It, it all, it denied a couple for me.
[00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:22.440]   One of which was, I told the, uh, that original van prompt was like kicking down the door to
[00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:23.440]   a Wendy's or something.
[00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:28.440]   And it didn't, uh, it did not, uh, go for that.
[00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:35.440]   I play with a dog replacing chrono.
[00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:38.440]   So, so David, what are your thoughts on this?
[00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:43.440]   Like this generation when it like did half the job or like didn't do the whole.
[00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:44.440]   That's interesting.
[00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:45.440]   Yeah.
[00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:50.440]   I've been, I mean, I've been trying to get into various, uh, models to, to do the animations,
[00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:52.440]   uh, for a while.
[00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:59.440]   I, I don't know if this one is any, any closer, uh, but it's totally possible that with the right
[00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:06.440]   prompt it, it could be, or doing it frame by frame, uh, would be able to do it, uh, instead
[00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:12.440]   of trying to get it to do a whole spreadsheet at once.
[00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:22.440]   Uh, bite probe, um, posted a link to levels.io, uh, tweet and said, uh, prompt a show a women,
[00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:25.440]   show woman wearing the outfit and, and a picture of this outfit.
[00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:30.440]   And, uh, we're coming up on the last couple of minutes here, but it didn't output a woman
[00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:34.440]   wearing like the outfit, uh, that was shown before.
[00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:37.440]   And I think that's really cool.
[00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:40.440]   And then we had a response from CJ saying that this would be great for my e-commerce site.
[00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:41.440]   And I absolutely agree.
[00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:44.440]   I think that it's super powerful for the, for the e-commerce stuff.
[00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:49.440]   If we're talking like real life use cases that could help make money, you know what I mean?
[00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:54.440]   So I do want to actually, since we've got only five minutes left, you know, as awesome
[00:54:54.440 --> 00:54:59.440]   as it is to get flow up here, like jamming on the news of the week, which is great.
[00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:00.440]   And I appreciate you flow.
[00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:05.440]   Uh, it would be cool if we got back to some sort of prepared stuff a little bit.
[00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:10.440]   So does anybody, maybe we can spend a couple of minutes here, like jamming on possible topics.
[00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:16.440]   Um, we, I don't know, maybe in the AI world, we can count on there being enough news of the
[00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:18.440]   week that we could just jam on news of the week each week.
[00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:24.440]   But I, I think maybe we should do a little bit of a call for topics who has something they
[00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:29.440]   think would be fun for us to do a session on, um, or a session they'd like to see that maybe
[00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:34.440]   they can put out a request for.
[00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:41.440]   I'm curious, uh, kind of if, uh, if anybody's like taken any episodes of AI in action, or I
[00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:45.440]   guess you could, you could generalize it more, but I'm curious, like of the stuff that we've
[00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:51.440]   kind of gone over so far, has anybody like updated their workflow?
[00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:56.440]   like pretty significantly and like something like significantly impacted them.
[00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:57.440]   And this is kind of what they're doing with it.
[00:55:57.440 --> 00:56:00.440]   Kind of thing is, uh, something I'm wondering about, I guess.
[00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:10.440]   I, I switched to only using GPT-5, so I'm, I'm happy to talk about that.
[00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:11.440]   Yeah.
[00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:12.440]   Only?
[00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:13.440]   Are you in Codex now?
[00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:15.440]   Are you still in Cursor?
[00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:16.440]   Uh, both.
[00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:17.440]   Yep.
[00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:21.440]   Same, same line of thinking for me.
[00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:26.440]   It seems like a lot of people have become like Codex CLI fanboys overnight or using Codex and
[00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:27.440]   Cursor.
[00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:29.440]   And I, I would love to hear more about that.
[00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:33.440]   Um, I, I tried to prep like for this call so we could like actually vibe code the thing,
[00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:37.440]   but, but yeah, without having, um, the server or whatever set up.
[00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:40.440]   It's like, wasn't, wasn't, uh, able to really pull it off.
[00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:44.440]   But I, I do want to hear more about, I think the most interesting AI in actions for me is
[00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:45.440]   when someone shows their workflow.
[00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:48.440]   Um, and I think there've been a couple of cases in the, in the channel of like people
[00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:49.440]   talking about it.
[00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:51.440]   So I would, any, any, any workflow that could be shared.
[00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:53.440]   Like Scott gave a good one a couple of weeks ago.
[00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:55.440]   We have one from Oliver a few weeks ago as well.
[00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:57.440]   I, I just love stuff like that.
[00:56:57.440 --> 00:56:59.440]   Yeah, those are really nice.
[00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:02.440]   Um, I just thought was I thinking.
[00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:03.440]   Okay.
[00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:04.440]   Okay.
[00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:05.440]   What about you?
[00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:20.440]   What are you thinking in terms of like what you would want to see is in terms of a prepared.
[00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:21.440]   Is there anything?
[00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:24.440]   So what, what I would be interested in if we could do it.
[00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:26.440]   So, um, a little backstory.
[00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:31.440]   So I'm trying to help my wife with some agentic content generation for something.
[00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:35.440]   And so I actually referenced like Olivia's talk cause she has a very structured thing.
[00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:38.440]   And I was like, Hey, you should like check this out, build out your sub agent, do whatever.
[00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:42.440]   She, I got her set up today with Claude code saying where we'll see where that goes.
[00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:49.440]   Um, but I'd actually be interested if anyone else is doing agentic content.
[00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:58.440]   Um, creation, you know, something with that, like if somebody would wanted to share their workflow, how they're approaching things, how they've got stuff structured and that sort of thing.
[00:57:58.440 --> 00:58:02.440]   Right? Like, cause I live in the coding world mostly, but I think, um, you know, content is another very interesting place.
[00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:11.440]   And the tools that I've seen out there, like she had been trying to just use the Claude web UI and it works for relatively simplistic things.
[00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:19.440]   But you can, if you have like a very large amount of stuff that where you want to go structured, like it doesn't give you any exposure to sub agents or swatch swapping.
[00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:21.440]   Like the level of control is minimal.
[00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:24.440]   And so like, we're trying to use coding tools to see if, cause they're based.
[00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:26.440]   I mean, these coding tools are all trying to solve.
[00:58:26.440 --> 00:58:28.440]   Okay. Let's give you a good agenda.
[00:58:28.440 --> 00:58:29.440]   Carnus.
[00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:30.440]   Yeah.
[00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:31.440]   Right.
[00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:40.440]   Well, and that's kind of my project for this weekend is, uh, I want to, uh, uh, with, uh, cause there's the L the LTX video.
[00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:42.440]   I don't know if there's going to be a video model.
[00:58:42.440 --> 00:58:58.440]   It's quite fast enough, but basically I want to like do a thing where I can more or less kind of run like a D and D ish game via like a Twitter space and then just get like the transcript and then extract prompts out of that.
[00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:06.440]   And just start dumping that into a video generation model and see if I can stitch something together where people can like watch their D and D people do shit.
[00:59:06.440 --> 00:59:10.440]   Um, but I don't know if I'm gonna be able to get that done over the weekend.
[00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:17.440]   So, um, and I also, and that'll be like a fairly code heavy, but content oriented workflow.
[00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:28.440]   So, I mean, if we don't, and if we don't end up with anything else, I could just like, you know, the hack on that and then see if I get anything worth showing to anybody.
[00:59:28.440 --> 00:59:35.440]   Um, as a, as a last resort, I suppose, but it seems like people are still pretty interested in, uh, Codex and CC.
[00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:37.440]   I know we've done, we've done like a good bit of that.
[00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:45.440]   It's always good to get more, but it's like, um, I think the content angle is an interesting, uh, uh,
[00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:52.440]   So my, my CTO does this, I can try to see if he was willing to present next week.
[00:59:52.440 --> 00:59:53.440]   I don't know.
[00:59:53.440 --> 00:59:59.440]   I'll, I'll, I'll, I can ask him like now so we can have an answer by Monday if people want.
[00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:00.440]   Yeah.
[01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:01.440]   Yeah.
[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:02.440]   When you say this, do you mean like those content?
[01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:03.440]   He does.
[01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:06.440]   He generates content algorithmically using AI somehow.
[01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:07.440]   Yeah.
[01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:13.440]   Uh, I think he has like some level of workflow that maybe is like probably interesting to look at too.
[01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:19.440]   So I can see if he was willing to present or if he's willing to make me present on it.
[01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:20.440]   Perfect.
[01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:21.440]   Whatever works.
[01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:22.440]   That sounds awesome.
[01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:24.440]   Can I sign you up?
[01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:25.440]   Sure.
[01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:26.440]   Yeah.
[01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:27.440]   All right.
[01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:32.440]   We're gonna, we're gonna sign you up via our discord bot, which now lets me sign someone else up.
[01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:35.440]   Uh, what's, what's your discord handle?
[01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:36.440]   It's Baruch.
[01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:38.440]   B-A-R-U-C-H.
[01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:39.440]   Right.
[01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:40.440]   That's you.
[01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:41.440]   Yeah.
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:42.440]   Yeah.
[01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:43.440]   Yeah.
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:44.440]   Baruch.
[01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:48.440]   Baruch, not Baruch.
[01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:53.440]   All right.
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:54.440]   All right.
[01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:56.440]   I think we are at time.
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:57.440]   Um, that's a good one.
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:03.440]   We'll, we'll go with Baruch, uh, Ben or Benjamin, um, for next week.
[01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:05.440]   But other folks, sign up.
[01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:11.440]   You can use Artie, who is still called AI in action bot, but we should change that name to Artie at some point.
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:13.440]   Uh, and sign up for talks.
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:14.440]   Thank you.
[01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:15.440]   Appreciate you, Flo.
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:16.440]   Thank you for driving this.
[01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:17.440]   Oh, good.
[01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:18.440]   It was really fun.
[01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:20.440]   I had a lot of fun looking at this stuff.
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:21.440]   We'll see you guys next week.
[01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:22.440]   Later.
