[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320]   - Welcome to Huberman Lab Essentials,
[00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.380]   where we revisit past episodes
[00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.560]   for the most potent and actionable science-based tools
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.340]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.080]   My name is Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.120]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.840]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.400]   Let's talk about neuroplasticity.
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.660]   More specifically,
[00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.480]   let's talk about how we can optimize our brains.
[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.180]   Neuroplasticity is this incredible feature
[00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.400]   of our nervous system that allows it to change itself,
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.960]   even in ways that we consciously decide.
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.680]   Now, that's an incredible property.
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.520]   Our liver can't decide to just change itself.
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.340]   Our spleen can't decide to just change itself
[00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.720]   through conscious thought
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.880]   or through feedback from another person.
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.840]   The cells in those tissues can make changes, sure,
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.520]   but it's our nervous system
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.000]   that harbors this incredible ability
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.760]   to direct its own changes
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.760]   in ways that we believe or we're told will serve us better.
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.540]   Today's podcast is really directed
[00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.320]   toward answering your most common questions
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.780]   and the bigger theme
[00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.620]   of how does one go about optimizing their brain
[00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.900]   or even think about optimizing the brain?
[00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.940]   What is this thing that we're calling optimizing the brain?
[00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.440]   In doing so, I'm also going to share
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.880]   some of my typical routines and tools.
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.020]   I share them because many of you
[00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.580]   have asked for very concrete examples of what I do and when,
[00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.740]   and so I want to open up the discussion today
[00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.220]   by emphasizing something that's fundamentally important,
[00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.900]   which is that plasticity is not the goal.
[00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.120]   The goal is to figure out how to access plasticity
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.420]   and then to direct that plasticity
[00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.400]   toward particular goals or changes
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.840]   that you would like to achieve.
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.180]   Let's start by talking about the different systems
[00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.220]   within the nervous system that are available for plasticity.
[00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.420]   And in doing so, I'll frame them in the context
[00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.980]   of what I do on a daily basis,
[00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.740]   on a weekly basis, and on a yearly basis.
[00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.080]   First of all, there are several forms of plasticity.
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.280]   The best way to think about it is in terms of short-term,
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.820]   medium-term, and long-term plasticity.
[00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.900]   Short-term plasticity is any kind of shift
[00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.980]   that you want to achieve in the moment or in the day,
[00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.820]   but that you don't necessarily want to hold onto forever.
[00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.780]   And I'd say, well, what kinds of things are those?
[00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.860]   Well, for instance, short-term plasticity might be
[00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.360]   you wake up earlier than you would like to catch a flight,
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.920]   you're not feeling particularly alert,
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.420]   and you want to use a protocol
[00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.140]   or you decide to use a protocol, which could be coffee,
[00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.860]   or it could be a certain form of breathing,
[00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.140]   or it could be some other tool,
[00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.760]   to become more alert at a time of day
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.560]   when normally you aren't that alert.
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.100]   But your expectation is that when you return home,
[00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.780]   you will discard the need to do that at 5.30 a.m.
[00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.500]   because you'll be asleep at 5.30 a.m.
[00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.780]   So there's short-term plasticity, behavioral plasticity.
[00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.740]   Then there's medium-term plasticity.
[00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.740]   For instance, if you go on vacation to Costa Rica
[00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.700]   and you don't know your way around Costa Rica,
[00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.100]   you want to learn the different town and the routes there,
[00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.100]   but you don't have any intention of going back,
[00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.000]   it's just medium-term.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.260]   You want to just program it in for sake of your time there,
[00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.860]   and then you want to discard it.
[00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.420]   Most of the time when we think about
[00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:20.800]   or talk about optimizing the brain,
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.200]   we're talking about long-term plasticity.
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.920]   We're talking about the kinds of changes
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:25.760]   that people want to make
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.240]   so that their brain reflexively works differently.
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.520]   Long-term plasticity is almost always the big goal.
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.320]   It's I want to know how to speak that language.
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.080]   I want to be able to do that skill.
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.760]   I want to be able to feel this way.
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.840]   I'm going to frame all this in the context of the daily life,
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.420]   the weekly life, and the yearly life.
[00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.820]   And that's because neural plasticity
[00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:53.820]   and optimizing your brain rides on a deeper foundation
[00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.440]   of this thing that governs plasticity,
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.840]   and in fact, governs all our life called autonomic arousal,
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.440]   which is that we're asleep for part of the 24-hour cycle
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.080]   and we are awake almost always.
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.680]   I've said it before, but I'll say it again.
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.560]   The trigger for plasticity and learning
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.660]   occurs during high focus, high alertness states,
[00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.480]   not while you're asleep.
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.460]   And the focus and alertness are both key
[00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:19.540]   because of the neurochemicals associated with those states.
[00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.300]   But the actual rewiring and the reconfiguration
[00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.860]   of the brain connections happens
[00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.880]   during non-sleep deep rest and deep sleep.
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.180]   So you trigger the change and in sleep, you get the change.
[00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.220]   So some of the things that we'll talk about today
[00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.940]   about optimizing the brain are centered around not sleep,
[00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.620]   but around the autonomic arousal system.
[00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.300]   We have this system of neurons in our brain and body
[00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.860]   that's just incredible that wake us up and make us alert.
[00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.580]   And when we're not accessing that system well,
[00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.220]   we cannot access plasticity, we cannot optimize our brain.
[00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.180]   Likewise, if we cannot sleep well and we can't rest well,
[00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.780]   we will not access plasticity and rewire our brain
[00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.660]   because that's when the actual configuration
[00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.860]   between the connections occurs.
[00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.620]   So to set this in context, I wake up each day
[00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.300]   and I'll be totally honest,
[00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.540]   I usually don't feel like bouncing right out of bed.
[00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:22.460]   I wake up generally more tired and groggy than I would like
[00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.680]   because I tend to go to sleep too late.
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.540]   What it means is that I'm not really matching
[00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:33.540]   my hardwired needs of going to bed probably at 8.30 or 9
[00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.900]   and waking up at 4 a.m.
[00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.540]   So neuroplasticity will allow me
[00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.060]   to optimize my wakefulness,
[00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.220]   but I have to do something in order to access that.
[00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.220]   And some of you may already be anticipating
[00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:47.540]   what I'm about to say, which is,
[00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.820]   oh no, he's going to tell us to get sunlight in our eyes
[00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.540]   in the first 30 minutes of the day.
[00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:52.780]   I am going to tell you to do that,
[00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.540]   but I'm going to also tell you two things
[00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.920]   that I have not discussed before,
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.340]   which relate to the plasticity
[00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.220]   between the melanopsin cells,
[00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.980]   these sunlight detecting, bright light detecting cells
[00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.320]   in our eye and the circadian clock.
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.060]   I've never said this before on this podcast,
[00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.860]   but it turns out that the connections
[00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.000]   between these melanopsin cells and the circadian clock
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.260]   are plastic throughout the lifespan.
[00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.020]   So there's an opportunity for short-term plasticity.
[00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.780]   So that's why I view sunlight first thing in the day,
[00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:21.100]   it helps me wake up.
[00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.360]   The other thing that I do is that there's a circuit
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.300]   that exists between the circadian clock
[00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.460]   and our adrenals that I've talked about before
[00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.180]   that triggers the release of cortisol
[00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.380]   first thing in the morning that wakes us up,
[00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:34.180]   especially when we view light.
[00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:35.500]   So if you're groggy in the morning,
[00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.420]   that's why viewing light is helpful.
[00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:41.420]   The other thing that I do is I delay my intake of caffeine
[00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.420]   for the first two hours that I'm awake.
[00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:46.220]   Earlier, we talked about the adenosine system
[00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.540]   and how the accumulation of adenosine makes us sleepy
[00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:53.900]   and caffeine suppresses adenosine, it makes us feel alert.
[00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:55.400]   And so by delaying caffeine
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.700]   until about two hours after waking,
[00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:01.460]   I'm able to capture and reinforce to potentiate
[00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.220]   the neural circuit that exists between the circadian clock
[00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.380]   and the cortisol release in the adrenals,
[00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:10.580]   as well as leave those adenosine receptors unoccupied
[00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:14.540]   so that I can then use the caffeine to get a natural lift
[00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:16.660]   in alertness and focus two hours later,
[00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:18.140]   as opposed to using it
[00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:21.260]   just to wake myself up out of sleepiness.
[00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.580]   I also make sure I hydrate first thing in the morning.
[00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.660]   There's plenty of data now showing
[00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:28.860]   that even a slight increase in dehydration,
[00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:30.700]   meaning just when you're lacking water,
[00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.660]   can make people have headaches,
[00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.100]   it can provide some additional photophobia.
[00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.200]   For those of you that are migraine prone,
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.780]   bright light can trigger migraines.
[00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:40.020]   That's no surprise to those of you
[00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:41.200]   that get headaches and migraines,
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:45.620]   but dehydration can compound the vulnerability
[00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:46.700]   to migraine and headache.
[00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:49.300]   So I drink water, I drink black coffee, or I drink mate,
[00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:51.780]   which is just because I have Argentine lineage,
[00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:54.140]   which is just a high caffeine drink
[00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:54.980]   first thing in the morning,
[00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:58.460]   but I delay it until two hours after I wake up.
[00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:01.520]   And that's because I want the circuits
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:05.100]   between my eye and my circadian clock and my adrenals
[00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:07.220]   to be functioning in a particular way
[00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.580]   so that then later the caffeine is an addition,
[00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:11.340]   it adds more alertness.
[00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:14.660]   Now, this is a discussion about how to optimize your brain.
[00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.940]   Many people who wake up quickly
[00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:19.500]   and just naturally feel like bouncing out of bed,
[00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.300]   I envy these people,
[00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:25.440]   they will do just fine by going into a learning bout
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.560]   or taking care of whatever it is
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:28.500]   that they need to take care of.
[00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.780]   Sometimes that's kind of more mundane tasks
[00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:33.380]   like email and whatnot.
[00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:37.900]   Here's more or less a rule about how the brain functions
[00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:41.280]   vis-a-vis focus, learning, and creativity.
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:43.960]   Generally, states of high alertness,
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.780]   when we're very, very alert,
[00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:49.180]   are great for strategy implementation,
[00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:51.380]   the sort of thing that we are very good at
[00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:54.020]   when we're well-rested and we're focused.
[00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:56.740]   And our autonomic arousal, or our alertness rather,
[00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:58.700]   is at a high level.
[00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:00.500]   If you are somebody who is hitting
[00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:03.420]   that alertness phase of your day very early,
[00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:04.860]   right after you wake up,
[00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:08.500]   that's a great time to move right into things that,
[00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:10.040]   at least the research says,
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:11.940]   you already know have the strategy
[00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:14.100]   and you just want to implement the strategy.
[00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:15.980]   But for me, for instance, I get up,
[00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:18.220]   I'm not terribly alert first thing.
[00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:20.420]   And so I try and just get my brain
[00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:21.940]   and my thoughts organized.
[00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:23.980]   It's not a time for me to be responding
[00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:26.020]   in a very linear fashion to emails
[00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:28.020]   or carrying out calculations.
[00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:29.620]   That comes about two hours later.
[00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:31.760]   And I think many people out there will relate,
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.740]   mid-morning is when we tend to,
[00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.660]   when many people tend to achieve their peak
[00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:37.460]   in alertness and focus.
[00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:41.220]   Now, many times I get the question,
[00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:42.780]   and this is what I'm about to say
[00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:45.060]   is directly related to the hundreds of questions
[00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:46.460]   I got about this.
[00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:49.760]   Should I use background music in order to learn?
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:53.220]   So as a rule of thumb, if you're feeling too keyed up,
[00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:56.060]   then silence and quiet is going to be helpful.
[00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:57.820]   In fact, if you're very keyed up,
[00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:02.320]   a particular circuit related to the basal ganglia
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.340]   starts getting triggered more easily.
[00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:06.500]   It's called the go-no-go circuit.
[00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.900]   We have circuits that connect our forebrain
[00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:11.340]   to a structure in our brain called the basal ganglia,
[00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:13.380]   which is actually a collection of structures.
[00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:16.900]   And the forebrain, which is involved in rational thought
[00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:18.400]   and thinking and planning and action,
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.180]   is always trying to plan what should I do
[00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:22.660]   and then implement that action.
[00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:24.980]   And the basal ganglia are intimately involved
[00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:25.820]   in that discussion.
[00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:28.340]   There's a reciprocal loop of communication
[00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:30.220]   between basal ganglia and cortex.
[00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:33.980]   The basal ganglia has one set of connections to the cortex
[00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:36.100]   and the cortex back to the basal ganglia
[00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:38.620]   that facilitates go.
[00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:41.020]   It facilitates action.
[00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:44.620]   And the molecule, the neuromodulator dopamine,
[00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:46.620]   triggers the activation of go.
[00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:49.140]   It tends to make us want to do more things.
[00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:52.220]   It tends to make us biased toward action
[00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:54.140]   by the way that dopamine binds
[00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:55.820]   to something called the D1 receptors,
[00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:57.940]   just a particular type of dopamine receptor,
[00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:00.220]   for those of you that want to know.
[00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:02.020]   The no-go pathway,
[00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:05.180]   the pathway in the basal ganglia and cortex
[00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:06.740]   that suppresses action
[00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:10.700]   involves dopamine binding to this other receptor
[00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:12.660]   called the D2 receptor.
[00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:15.380]   Now, D1, D2 receptors, you can't just consciously decide,
[00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:17.020]   oh, I only want my D1 receptors
[00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.340]   and my D2 receptors to be active.
[00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:24.260]   You have to think about which sorts of states of mind
[00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:29.260]   and body facilitate go and which ones facilitate no-go.
[00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:34.300]   There are three sort of levels of autonomic arousal,
[00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:39.300]   of alertness that bias us more toward go, no-go, or both.
[00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.220]   So here's how it works.
[00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:43.060]   Let's say I'm very alert.
[00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:44.700]   Maybe I got a particularly good night's sleep
[00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:47.580]   the night before, I had a little too much coffee
[00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:50.020]   and I'm going to sit down to some work.
[00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:52.780]   The thing to know, and what I always tell myself,
[00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:57.780]   is when I'm very alert, I am very prone to go to action,
[00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:03.100]   but I'm also prone to not no-go, right?
[00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:05.740]   I'm not going to be very good at suppressing action.
[00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:06.900]   So those are two different things,
[00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:08.060]   being biased toward action
[00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:10.380]   and being biased towards suppressing action
[00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:12.820]   are two different things, okay?
[00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:16.440]   So those are push-pull, toward action, suppress action.
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:19.020]   So if I'm very alert, I'm aware
[00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:21.880]   that I will have a bias toward action.
[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:24.540]   It'll be hard for me to suppress non-action,
[00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:26.900]   but that it's very non-specific.
[00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:29.980]   When you are very alert, the best situation for learning
[00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:31.860]   is going to be silence.
[00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:34.300]   It's going to be complete quiet.
[00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:37.180]   If you are low arousal and you're tired
[00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:39.500]   and you're kind of sleepy, a lot of people find
[00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.180]   that having some background chatter
[00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:43.980]   and some background noise can help elevate
[00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:45.400]   their level of autonomic arousal.
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:48.780]   For most people, three hours after waking,
[00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:51.180]   those three hours tends to be the period
[00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:53.020]   in which they're most alert throughout the day.
[00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:56.260]   So that morning three hours is quite vital.
[00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.920]   Now, many of you might ask about exercise
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:00.260]   and when to exercise.
[00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.260]   In terms of rising body temperatures
[00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:06.620]   and matching body temperature to mental alertness, et cetera,
[00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:10.020]   it's pretty clear that exercising early in the day
[00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:12.820]   not only biases us towards waking up earlier,
[00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:15.240]   but that it also triggers the release of things
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:18.200]   like epinephrine and other neuromodulators
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:21.540]   that lend itself to a situation
[00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:24.360]   where we have heightened levels of arousal
[00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.880]   and mental acuity in the late morning
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.560]   and even into the afternoon.
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:31.420]   This can be very good because if you want to restrict
[00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:33.880]   most of your focus learning to the early part of the day,
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:36.120]   exercising early in the day does set
[00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:39.700]   a neurochemical context or milieu for go.
[00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:42.640]   It tends to trigger activation of the go pathway.
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:44.400]   And so for those of you like myself
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:45.960]   who have a hard time kind of engaging
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:47.800]   and getting into action early in the day,
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:50.480]   early morning exercise within an hour of waking
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:53.440]   and certainly no later than three hours after waking
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:57.120]   will give you quote unquote more energy throughout the day.
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:00.160]   So in kind of reviewing what I've set up until now,
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:01.800]   I do the morning light thing,
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.780]   I delay my caffeine two hours after waking,
[00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:09.200]   and then I generally try and get exercise in the first hour
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.720]   or ideally within the first three hours of waking up,
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:14.480]   and then I'll move into a focused learning bout.
[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:16.040]   If I find that I'm too alert,
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:19.080]   and then I generally will tend to eat
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:21.400]   and kind of bring down my level of alertness
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:22.800]   and we'll continue working.
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:26.500]   I typically eat my first meal right around midday,
[00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:29.320]   whether or not I've exercised or not.
[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:32.360]   In general, I rely on a low carbohydrate meal.
[00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:34.580]   I'll eat meat or salad or some variation of that
[00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:37.200]   and nuts and fats and things like that
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.200]   because of the choline content for focus.
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:42.120]   I'm just going to continue to march through my day.
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:44.960]   And this is of course what I experienced.
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:46.420]   Some people are quite different,
[00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:49.200]   but what I find is around two or 3 p.m.
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:52.240]   I start getting a little groggy, a little bit sleepy.
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.720]   I will tend to shift my work
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:58.040]   from work that requires a lot of duration path outcome,
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:02.240]   really careful analysis and activation of the no-go pathway
[00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.160]   around early afternoon,
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:08.120]   I find I can do kind of typical more mundane tasks
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:12.240]   because those tasks require less cognitive load
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:15.800]   and they can be done more or less in and out of sequence.
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.200]   I can answer a couple email here,
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.760]   maybe answer that email there.
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:23.640]   And then typically around 4 p.m. or so, I do two things.
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:25.840]   One is I make sure I hydrate
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:29.880]   and then I always do a non-sleep deep rest protocol
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:31.000]   sometime in the afternoon.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.960]   This is sometimes a 10 minute yoga nidra type protocol
[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:36.640]   or a 30 minute yoga nidra type protocol.
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:40.640]   And I do that because for me by about 4.30 in the afternoon,
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:43.040]   I'm capable of doing basically nothing.
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:46.560]   I personally find it a mistake to at that point
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:49.800]   down a double espresso and charge really hard.
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:50.920]   It just doesn't work for me.
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:52.980]   I end up really disrupting my sleep schedule.
[00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:54.680]   I end up disrupting a lot of different things.
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:57.880]   So for me, I do the non-sleep deep rest protocol.
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:59.800]   I usually emerge from that
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:03.800]   feeling like I have another whole day second wind,
[00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:05.600]   like I could just work, work, work, work, work.
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:09.240]   And then I'll do a second bout of learning.
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:10.640]   I'll do some sort of work
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:14.200]   that either involves linear analysis of something.
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:18.580]   So maybe numerical work or I'm trying to learn something.
[00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:20.080]   This learning bout is very different
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.600]   than the morning one.
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.360]   This is a work bout or learning bout
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:25.720]   that's more in the clear common focus regime
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:28.480]   because I've come out of this non-sleep deep rest.
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:29.920]   I'm not ingesting caffeine
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:30.760]   because I want to make sure
[00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:33.280]   that I can sleep later that night really well.
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:37.120]   And this tends to be more when I do creative type work.
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:40.040]   Creativity is a very interesting state of mind
[00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:42.680]   in which we're taking existing elements,
[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:44.960]   things that we already know
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:48.640]   and rearranging them in ways that are novel.
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.340]   Creativity has two parts.
[00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:54.040]   It has a creative discovery mode
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:55.760]   where you're kind of shuffling things around
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:58.000]   in a very relaxed way and kind of being playful
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.600]   or exploring different configurations.
[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.900]   And then creativity also has
[00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:05.880]   an absolutely linear implementation mode
[00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:09.200]   in which you take the idea or the design you've come up with
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:12.640]   and you create something very robust and concrete.
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:15.480]   And so creativity is really a two-part thing.
[00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:17.060]   And the first part
[00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:19.900]   of actively exploring different configurations,
[00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:21.560]   sometimes in a playful way,
[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:25.240]   sometimes in a way that's almost random
[00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:27.340]   and just kind of exploring,
[00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:31.340]   that state is definitely facilitated
[00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:34.960]   by being relaxed and almost sleepy.
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:35.900]   When you find yourself
[00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:38.140]   in that kind of clear, calm, and focused mode,
[00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:41.100]   creative works tend to come about very well
[00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:42.640]   in those regimes.
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.020]   Now, I know that a lot of people out there
[00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:46.740]   rely on substances to access creative states.
[00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:49.060]   I'm not a marijuana user.
[00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:52.640]   It's just not the drug for me for a variety of reasons.
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:54.100]   I'm not a drinker.
[00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:57.340]   It's not the substance for me for a variety of reasons.
[00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:00.900]   The problem with using substances to access creativity
[00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:05.060]   is that generally the substances that relax people
[00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:08.940]   will allow them to get into that creative brainstorming mode
[00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:13.140]   but not so good at the linear implementation mode.
[00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:16.260]   So that afternoon block is when I try and access
[00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.900]   the freer kind of looser mindset
[00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:20.220]   that's associated with the fatigue
[00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:22.340]   that comes later in the afternoon.
[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:25.300]   For some of you, that state that favors creativity
[00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:28.220]   and creative learning might be better in the morning.
[00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:29.040]   I don't know.
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:29.880]   You're going to have to decide.
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:31.860]   For some of you, you're going to be late shifted.
[00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:33.500]   Some of you are going to be morning shifted.
[00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:34.900]   But where we have alertness,
[00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:37.020]   generally we are good at linear implementation.
[00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:39.260]   We're good at activating the no-go pathway
[00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:40.380]   and suppressing action.
[00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:43.820]   And we are good at pursuing particular goals
[00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:45.980]   and strategy implementation.
[00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:48.140]   And where we tend to be more relaxed
[00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:50.240]   and we tend to be almost in a kind of sleepy mode.
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.440]   So for me coming out of one of these
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:53.960]   non-sleep deep rest modes or sleep,
[00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:55.780]   that's when we tend to be better
[00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:58.820]   at novel configurations of existing elements
[00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:00.300]   which is creativity.
[00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:04.420]   And this brings about a question that I get all the time
[00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:07.460]   which is what about psychedelics?
[00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:11.020]   On psychedelics, people report being able to smell colors
[00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:14.620]   or to hear trees, et cetera.
[00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:16.660]   And that's because there's a lot of sensory blending.
[00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:19.260]   However, that's led to the misconception
[00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:22.900]   that sensory blending itself is a creative process.
[00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:26.080]   There's nothing creative about sensory blending.
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:29.020]   The essence of a creative process
[00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:32.220]   is new ways of configuring things that lend themselves
[00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:36.500]   to a bigger or greater or deeper or novel understanding
[00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:38.400]   on the part of the observer.
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:41.620]   And just sensory blending is not going to accomplish that.
[00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:45.220]   Now, I think that there may come a time
[00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:46.540]   and certainly there are clinical trials
[00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:47.600]   that are happening now
[00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:48.940]   where psychedelics are leveraged
[00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:50.900]   toward particular clinical goals.
[00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:54.540]   These are clinical studies done with a psychiatrist present
[00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:56.140]   that is authorized to do that,
[00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:58.820]   that can help people through depression, trauma, et cetera.
[00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:01.340]   So all of this is to say that no,
[00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:04.300]   I don't take psychedelics to access creative states.
[00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:07.740]   That's not where I think the major role,
[00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:10.180]   the important role of psychedelics might show up
[00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:11.620]   if it's going to for humanity.
[00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:14.360]   I think that it may have these important roles
[00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:15.660]   in the clinical context
[00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:18.260]   provided it's done legally and safely.
[00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:21.380]   I think that the creative process
[00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:22.800]   being a two-stage process
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:25.800]   means that I am personally best served
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:30.340]   by having this period of non-linear exploration of concepts,
[00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:33.540]   whatever it is I happen to be working on in the afternoon,
[00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:35.860]   but then I'll actually shelve that work.
[00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:37.220]   I'll just set it aside
[00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:40.340]   and then I'll revisit it the next day or even the next day
[00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:44.420]   to see whether or not the work itself is ready
[00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:46.440]   for deliberate linear implementation,
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:47.280]   which I would want to do
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:49.400]   during one of these highly focused states.
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:52.100]   So the long and short way of saying this
[00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:55.540]   is that when we're very alert, do linear type of operations.
[00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:58.260]   When we tend to be more sleepy and more relaxed,
[00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:02.020]   that's when creative works can first be conceived,
[00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:06.340]   but their implementation requires high levels of alertness.
[00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:11.220]   Now that gets us more to the kind of late afternoon evening.
[00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:13.260]   Now I am, as I've mentioned before,
[00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:17.420]   I'm a proponent of getting sunlight in the evening as well.
[00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:18.940]   By getting light in the evening,
[00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:20.540]   it accomplishes two things for me.
[00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:23.300]   First of all, it makes sure that I don't get up too early,
[00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:25.340]   that I'm not waking up at three or four in the morning
[00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:27.180]   because it's going to shift my clock,
[00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:28.940]   it's going to delay it a little bit.
[00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:30.940]   And so this is really important.
[00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:34.860]   If you want to keep your schedule on a normal routine
[00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:37.380]   on a regular 24-hour cycle
[00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:39.860]   and not have your circadian rhythms of sleep and wakefulness
[00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:41.020]   drifting all over the place,
[00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:42.340]   and you want some predictability
[00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:43.840]   to how your mind is going to work
[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:46.100]   in order to optimize learning and performance,
[00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:48.380]   well, then you need to get morning light and evening light.
[00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:50.220]   The morning light is going to advance my clock,
[00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:51.980]   make my system want to get up earlier,
[00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:54.820]   and the evening light is going to delay my clock a little bit
[00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:56.660]   so that on average, it kind of bookends
[00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:58.340]   my circadian mechanisms,
[00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:00.340]   and I'll basically want to go to sleep
[00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:03.020]   at more or less the same time each night and wake up
[00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:05.300]   more or less at the same time each morning.
[00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:06.500]   That's how it works.
[00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:09.080]   And that's a hardwired mechanism.
[00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:11.580]   That's not some subjective thing that I tell myself,
[00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:13.800]   that's a hardwired mechanism.
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:16.180]   So that gets us to the evening.
[00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:17.420]   And generally in the evening,
[00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:19.180]   I'll get that light by going outside,
[00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:20.960]   and then I'll start to dim them for the evening
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:22.500]   'cause as I've mentioned many times before,
[00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:24.120]   and I'm not going to belabor the point,
[00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:26.340]   you want to minimize your light exposure,
[00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:28.380]   especially overhead bright light exposure
[00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:30.940]   in the evening from about 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
[00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:35.020]   So for me, it screens off, it's dim lights,
[00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:37.380]   and that's what favors falling asleep
[00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:38.840]   in a good night's sleep for me.
[00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:40.300]   Since we were talking about food earlier,
[00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:42.860]   I'll just revisit a little bit of what I said before.
[00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:45.940]   My evening meal tends to be more carbohydrate rich.
[00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:48.340]   So I'm not one of these people that's keto
[00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:51.380]   or high meat only or anything like that.
[00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:53.680]   Remember, fasting and low carbohydrate states
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:55.780]   facilitate alertness.
[00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:59.700]   Carbohydrate rich foods facilitate calmness and sleepiness.
[00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:01.400]   They stimulate the release of tryptophan
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:03.180]   and the transition to sleep.
[00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:05.940]   I tend to achieve that state using carbohydrates
[00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:08.060]   and it also replenishes glycogen.
[00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:10.860]   The next piece of scientific data that I'm going to describe
[00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:13.420]   is a very important piece of scientific data
[00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:15.660]   for sake of understanding how to optimize your brain
[00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:16.780]   and access sleep.
[00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:20.120]   It also can help avoid a lot of anxiety issues.
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:24.740]   The peak output of the circadian clock for wakefulness,
[00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:26.980]   in other words, the peak of our wakefulness
[00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:30.140]   and the suppression of the sleep signal
[00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:33.340]   actually happens very late in the day.
[00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:36.620]   So we have this trough of activity
[00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:39.720]   and body temperature is lowest right before waking.
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:41.980]   Then as we wake up, our body temperature goes up
[00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:44.340]   and into the afternoon, it continues to go up, up, up, up,
[00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:46.500]   and then it tends to fall in the evening
[00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:48.180]   and towards bedtime.
[00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:53.000]   But there's a brief blip of release of peptides
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.980]   and other substances from the sleep centers in the brain
[00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:59.260]   that signals the peak of alertness and wakefulness
[00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:02.160]   about an hour before bedtime.
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:05.060]   Now that's often the time when people start stressing
[00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:06.900]   about the fact that they have something to do the next day
[00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:08.420]   and they worry about not being able to sleep
[00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:10.440]   and it can cascade into a whole set of things.
[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:15.200]   I anticipate a peak in alertness and activity
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:16.780]   and I don't worry about it.
[00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:19.020]   I use that perhaps to get organized for the next day.
[00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:20.900]   But basically I just go through,
[00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:21.780]   if I'm going to do anything,
[00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:23.820]   it's going to be very mundane tasks like cleaning
[00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:26.500]   or things that require almost zero effort.
[00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:29.500]   And that probably speaks to my cleaning abilities too.
[00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:31.540]   I tend to go to sleep somewhere around 10, 30, 11.
[00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:35.620]   And if all goes well, I stay asleep for four or five hours.
[00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:37.820]   Typically it's three or four and then I wake up.
[00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:42.340]   What it probably reflects is that the real time,
[00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:44.440]   meaning the time that I should go to sleep
[00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:46.060]   is probably closer to eight o'clock.
[00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:49.380]   The word midnight was literally supposed to mean midnight.
[00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:52.200]   We were meant to go to sleep and wake up
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:54.100]   with the setting and arising of the sun.
[00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:55.740]   So I think that's the natural pattern
[00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:58.180]   and we've just deviated from it with artificial lights.
[00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:00.220]   So waking up at 3 a.m. or 4 a.m.
[00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:01.540]   doesn't necessarily mean
[00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:03.340]   that there's something screwed up about you.
[00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:04.980]   What it likely means is that you were supposed
[00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:06.260]   to go to bed much earlier.
[00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:07.740]   And because of this asymmetry
[00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:09.040]   in the autonomic nervous system,
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:11.960]   where it's much easier for us to push
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:13.740]   and to delay our sleep time
[00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:16.140]   than it is to accelerate our wake up time.
[00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:18.220]   In other words, it's easier to stay up
[00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:19.300]   and hang out at the party,
[00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:20.340]   even if you don't want to be there,
[00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:22.240]   than it is to wake up when you're exhausted
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:23.400]   and you're fast asleep.
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:26.620]   Most people are pushing through
[00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:28.860]   into the late hours of the evening and night
[00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:29.940]   and going to bed much later
[00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:31.760]   than they naturally would want to.
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:34.540]   And so I personally don't want to go to bed at 8 p.m.
[00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:39.340]   A lot of good things happen between 8 p.m. and 11 p.m.
[00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:41.040]   And so I want to enjoy those
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:43.520]   and I push through the evening hours.
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:46.340]   But as a consequence, I'm running out of melatonin.
[00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:49.280]   My melatonin release is basically subsided
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:50.340]   by about 3 or 4 a.m.
[00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:52.700]   And so it makes sense that I would wake up.
[00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:53.940]   If I wake up in the middle of the night
[00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:55.520]   and I'm anxious for whatever reason,
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:58.100]   and my mind is looping, I have a couple rules.
[00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:01.700]   One is I don't trust anything I think about
[00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:03.700]   when I wake up in the middle of the night, any of it.
[00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:07.020]   There's just nothing either for me terribly creative
[00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:10.020]   or worth linear implementation at that time.
[00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:12.100]   But one thing that has been very helpful
[00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:13.840]   is to sometimes do one of these
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:15.580]   non-sleep deep rest protocols
[00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:17.620]   as a way to go back into sleep.
[00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:20.020]   Those for me have been very useful
[00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:22.900]   at helping me turn off kind of looping thinking
[00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:25.020]   in the middle of the night and fall back asleep.
[00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:27.840]   In reviewing my schedule for you,
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:29.980]   just as a context for how to implement
[00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:33.340]   certain types of tools for optimizing learning,
[00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:35.140]   realize that it gives the impression
[00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:36.500]   that there's a 90 minute bout
[00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:38.180]   of learning and work in the morning,
[00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:39.660]   and then a 90 minute bout
[00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:42.380]   of creative type work in the afternoon, and that's it.
[00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:44.100]   There are a lot of hours in between, of course,
[00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:45.860]   and I just want to be very clear.
[00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:48.420]   Those hours for me are occupied by pretty,
[00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:52.540]   not mundane tasks, but things that are kind of random.
[00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:55.700]   Those are things like email or attending to Zoom meetings
[00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:58.380]   or meeting with colleagues and students
[00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:00.020]   and things of that sort.
[00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:01.860]   I mentioned those two 90 minute bouts
[00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:03.800]   because those are the two 90 minute bouts
[00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:07.520]   where I'm trying to expand on the mental capacities
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:08.880]   that I already have.
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:10.520]   They're really where I'm trying to stretch
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:12.080]   and grow what I'm able to do
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:13.840]   on a regular basis reflexively.
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:16.120]   And so for many of you out there who are in school
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:18.380]   or have family demands or other demands,
[00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:21.800]   the key is to slot in those brain optimization segments
[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:25.400]   of about 90 minutes, one or two, or maybe more per day.
[00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:27.680]   You're trying to slot those in wherever you can
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:30.360]   amidst your other obligations
[00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:31.960]   and things that you need to do.
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:34.560]   But you want to do that in an intelligent way
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:36.480]   that's anchored to your biology,
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:37.920]   and then you want to do a number of things,
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:39.000]   which I've talked about today,
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.960]   in order to optimize those sessions
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:42.560]   to get the most out of them.
[00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:46.800]   I think the way to look at any tool to modulate
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:49.660]   or measure the nervous system is ask whether or not
[00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:52.280]   it's going to move you up or down
[00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:54.080]   the state of autonomic arousal,
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:56.500]   whether or not it's gonna make you more alert or more calm,
[00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:58.080]   more focused or less focused.
[00:27:58.080 --> 00:27:59.800]   That's kind of the two axes here
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:01.360]   is that we need to think about.
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:05.120]   I think the subjective reading of whether or not one
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:09.080]   is alert or calm and whether or not that alertness
[00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:11.320]   or calmness matches the goal
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:13.080]   or the thing that we're trying to achieve
[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:15.340]   in terms of learning, including sleep,
[00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:19.960]   is the most valuable internal tool and recognition
[00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:20.840]   that we can all have.
[00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:23.920]   But ultimately it's about tailoring that alertness
[00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:26.240]   and calmness to the specific types of learning
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:29.160]   and activities that you are going to do and perform.
[00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:32.760]   And it's reciprocal, meaning some of those activities
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:34.960]   like exercise early in the day will increase
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:37.680]   your level of autonomic arousal and alertness.
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:40.520]   Certain foods will tend to wake you up.
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:42.560]   Certain foods will tend to make you more sleepy.
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:44.960]   And the volume of food and the timing of food
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:46.160]   is a factor also.
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:47.940]   So it's a huge parameter space.
[00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:50.120]   It's a huge set of variables that impacts
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:52.120]   whether or not we're feeling well, performing well,
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:54.280]   learning great or not learning great.
[00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:57.340]   And the key thing is to become an observer
[00:28:57.340 --> 00:28:59.740]   of your own system and what works for you.
[00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:03.120]   And to recognize that there are two bins of tools
[00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:06.360]   for optimizing learning and brain performance.
[00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:08.620]   One are tools that are really anchored
[00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:09.940]   in biological mechanism.
[00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:11.840]   And we are certain of what those are.
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:12.840]   I've talked about some of those.
[00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:14.360]   The other, the more subjective tools.
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:18.280]   For some of you, visualization might work terrifically well.
[00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:20.800]   For some of you, one song might really wake you up
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:22.920]   because of the associations you have with it.
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:24.760]   And for me, I might just, you know,
[00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:27.280]   it might repel me from the room 'cause I don't like it
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:29.200]   or it might put me to sleep.
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:31.960]   But of course, volume is kind of a universal.
[00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:33.560]   Loud music tends to wake people up.
[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:36.640]   Soft music doesn't tend to wake them up quite as much.
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:40.320]   So part of today is really getting you to think about
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:42.840]   in a scientific way, in a structured way
[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:46.780]   about the non-negotiable elements,
[00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:48.560]   which are that you're going to have a period
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:50.840]   of every 24-hour cycle when you tend to be more awake
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:52.520]   and a period when you tend to be more asleep
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:53.780]   and how to leverage those
[00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:56.240]   so you're not fighting an uphill battle to wake up
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:30:00.640]   when you actually would want to be and should be sleepy
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:02.600]   and not trying to go to sleep
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:06.200]   when you are naturally, you know, going to be most awake.
[00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:07.880]   So a lot of it is really anchors back
[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:09.840]   to those core mechanisms of biology.
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:11.880]   And then you start layering on the different protocols
[00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:14.080]   of food and supplementation, et cetera.
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:15.740]   And I think it's important to recognize
[00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:20.100]   that some people are just more go, go, go, go, go and no go.
[00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:23.360]   And some people are just calmer
[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:26.000]   and have a harder time getting into action in an activity.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.560]   It's just the way that we're wired.
[00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:29.240]   Some of us have autonomic nervous systems
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:32.320]   that are more geared towards parasympathetic calm states.
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:34.720]   And so there are people like that too.
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:36.400]   And so you have to know where you are
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:39.280]   and what particular goals you're trying to pursue.
[00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:41.760]   As always, thank you for your interest in science.
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:44.340]   [upbeat music]
[00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:46.920]   (upbeat music)
