[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   (music)
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Well, what's the big deal with fearing man?
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   What's the problem with trying to impress one another? The desire for
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   pure approval. That dopamine hit that we get when
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   we impress others. That desire to be admired.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   What's the problem with it all?
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   Well, on Monday we looked at 1 Peter 3.15 and there we saw that the commission that we
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   honor Christ or revere Christ in our hearts. It's a text
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   about fearing God. And it brought back to mind a sermon Pastor John preached
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   42 years back in the fall of 1980.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   I wanted to share a clip from that old sermon today that we talked about
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   on Monday. Here's 34 year old Pastor John to explain this
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   connection between revering Christ and dying to the approval
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   of others. What is this reverencing
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   the Lord Christ in our hearts? What's this
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   amazing thing that has the power to turn the fear
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   of man into hope and the power always to give us a
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   reason for the hope that is in us that we can
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   speak to others? Now, to answer that question
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   in accord with the immediate
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   context, what we need to do instead of importing
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   our ideas in there and say, "Well, everyone knows what reverence is," is to
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   notice what Peter's doing. Peter is quoting
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   from Isaiah. He's quoting from Isaiah
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   chapter 8 verses 12 and 13. And I'd like you to
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   look at that with me. Isaiah chapter 8 verses
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   12 through 13. He's taken this quote that God
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   gave to Isaiah for his day and he's adapted it
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   for his own situation. God gave Isaiah
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   a warning in these verses about how he should
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   feel about his adversaries and about how he should feel about
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   the Lord God. We'll start reading at verse 11 of Isaiah
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   8 and you'll hear immediately the similarity to 1 Peter.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   "The Lord spoke thus to me with his strong hand upon me and warned me
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   not to walk in the way of this people, saying, 'Do not call
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   conspiracy all that this people calls conspiracy, and do not fear
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   what they fear, nor be in dread. But reverence the Lord
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   of hosts; let him be your fear, and let him be
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   your dread.'" You can see clearly that Peter was alluding to this text.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Not an exact quotation, but an adaptation for his own
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   situation. God had warned Isaiah, "Don't fear what men fear.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Fear me. Reverence me in your hearts." Peter takes it, adapts it
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   to the people who are being persecuted in his own day and says, "Don't fear what
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   men fear. Reverence the Lord Christ." He puts Jesus right in the place
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   of Jehovah in the Old Testament, which is done more than once
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   in the New Testament. So if we can find out what Isaiah meant
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   by reverencing or regarding as holy or sanctifying,
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   depending on which translation you have, the Lord in his heart
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   then will have a sound and solid foundation for determining what Peter
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   meant when he said, "Reverence the Lord Christ in your hearts."
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Now, verse 14 of Isaiah 8 makes it very
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   clear what Isaiah means by reverence God.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   It means, "Fear him
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   instead of fearing men, or dread him
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   instead of dreading men." It says,
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   "Reverence the Lord of hosts; let him be your fear;
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   let him be your dread." So that's
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Isaiah's, or God's, explanation of what it
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   means to reverence the Lord in your heart.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   But now, probably, if you're really with me, you're saying,
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   "But surely God doesn't want
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   his chosen people to walk around
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   filled with the emotion of fear
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   towards God." That wouldn't be a very
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   exciting invitation, but only one of
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   misery. But that's not what God meant here, and we can
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   see that it's not what God meant if we just look at the next phrase in verse 14
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   where he promises that those who do fear him, for
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   then he will become a sanctuary.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   And then he goes on and talks about what he will become for those who don't believe
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   him, but he will become for those who fear him a sanctuary. Now, a sanctuary
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   is a place where you feel peace
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   and security and hope.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   So I don't think it would be fair to say this text is
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   teaching that we're always cringing when God is
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   our God. That sounds kind of paradoxical.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Let God be your dread, and he will become your sanctuary.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   But that's what it says. But it's not really as paradoxical
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   as it seems if we take verse 14 to mean not
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   be filled with the emotion of fear
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   towards God all the time, but rather take it to mean something
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   like this. If you reverence
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   God, you will consider the
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   prospect of displeasing him as a more fearful
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   prospect than displeasing men.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   That's what it means to let the Lord be your fear. The
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   prospect of offending or displeasing God
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   will be a more dreadful or a more fearful prospect to you
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   than worrying about what men can do to you.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   The degree of Isaiah's reverence
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   for God was the same as the degree of his desire
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   not to displease God.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Now, what in this particular context in Isaiah 8
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   displeased God? What here in these
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   several verses did God want Isaiah to avoid?
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   Because it would have displeased him. And the answer is given in verse
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   12, "Do not fear
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   what they fear, and do not be in dread."
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   God would have been displeased with Isaiah
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   if Isaiah had feared men
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   or feared what men could do to him.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   Why? Why is God so displeased when
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   we, his people, fear men?
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   Why does that offend God? Isn't the answer this?
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   He has made promise upon promise
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   upon promise that he would take care
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   of us, and if we believe those promises, it should
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   take away fear of men. It should fill us with
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   confidence and hope if we believe those promises.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   But if we fear men,
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   then it's a sign, isn't it, that we're not believing
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   those promises to take care of us. And when you
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   don't believe an honest man, he ought to be offended
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   and displeased because you don't trust him.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   And so it is with God. God had said to Isaiah, for example,
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   in chapter 41, "Fear not." And he
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   gives some reasons. "For I am with you. I am your God.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   I will strengthen you. I will help you. I will hold you up with
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   my victorious right hand. For I, the Lord your God, hold
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   your right hand. It is I who say to you, 'Fear not.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   I will help you.'" You can just see God pleading with
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Isaiah and the people of Israel, "For goodness sakes, believe me."
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   Chapter 35, "Say to those who are fearful,
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   who have a fearful heart, 'Be strong. Fear not.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   Behold, your God will come with vengeance, with
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   recompense. He will come and save you.'"
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   Now, there are many, many such promises
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   in Isaiah and in the whole Old Testament. And therefore,
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   if Isaiah fears the threats of men, he is casting
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   his vote against the trustworthiness of God.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   And he does not reverence God in his
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   heart. But if he does not fear men,
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   but instead fears to displease God
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   and thus trusts in God's promises, then he is reverencing
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   God in his heart. Yes, if you reverence
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   God, you will consider the prospect of displeasing Him
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   as a more fearful prospect than displeasing man.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   Sobering. That's a lesson we are all learning,
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   I guess. This was a clip from John Piper's sermon way back on
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   October 19, 1980. It's titled, "Make a Case for Your Hope."
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   The whole audio recording is online at DesiringGod.org.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   And Pastor John reflected on the making of this sermon, a process he
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   has not forgotten all these many decades later, as we heard him recount
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   on Monday in ABJ 1840. Check that out, too, if you didn't hear
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   that. And if you have a John Piper sermon clip to share, email me.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   Give me your name, hometown, the sermon title, the time stamp of where the clip

[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   in studio with Pastor John when we return on Friday.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   We'll see you then.
