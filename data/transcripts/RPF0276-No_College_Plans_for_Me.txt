[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480]   The Hartford Small Business Insurance knows that running a small business is a big-time commitment.
[00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:14.480]   So this holiday season, they're celebrating hard-working small business owners with a chance to go to I Heart Radio Jingle Ball in Miami on December 16th.
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.000]   Nominate yourself or another small business owner for a chance to win a trip for two.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.680]   Includes airfare, two-night hotel, tickets to the show, plus $1,000 in spending cash.

[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.240]   I am a young father of two young children. I have a two-year-old son and a six-month-old daughter.
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:44.960]   Education is very important to me, both formal education and informal education.
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.480]   I have a master's degree, a bachelor's degree, a high school diploma.
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.600]   I'm also a professional financial planner with a high degree of expertise in financial planning.
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.960]   I'm a certified financial planner. I actually have a master's degree in financial planning.
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:06.720]   But I refuse to establish a college savings account for my kids.
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.920]   Now, it's not because I don't know anything about them. I'm actually a subject matter expert in that area.
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.520]   But I just think they're stupid and a waste of money.
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.720]   And today I'm going to try to convince you to join me.
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:38.720]   [Music]
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.720]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast. My name is Joshua Sheets and I'm your host.
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.240]   [Laughter]
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.240]   Thank you for being with me today.
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.800]   Today we're going to deal with this question and the inspiration comes from an email I've received
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:57.440]   from a friend of mine who's a young father asking me, "Joshua, should I open an account for my kid?"
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:03.200]   And my response is obviously unemphatic, "Absolutely not."
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:11.200]   [Music]
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.000]   Now, perhaps if you're not familiar with Radical Personal Finance,
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.240]   perhaps you're surprised by an opinion like this.
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.960]   "Oh, why would a financial planner not do that?" And no, I'm not wasteful with my money.
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.800]   I'm actually a dedicated saver. I do plan and prepare for the future.
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.920]   I think carefully about all the opportunities that are facing me.
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.600]   So it's not just that I'm a spendthrift. I'm really not.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.600]   But I have some reasons and ideas that I want to share with you.
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.760]   But let's start with this email that I received from my friend, a personal friend of mine.
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.000]   He wrote me this note. He said, "Joshua, my wife suggested I reach out to you for advice
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.920]   as we plan to start saving for our soon-to-be-born son's education.
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.320]   It's hard to believe it's going to be just a few weeks now.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.800]   I've looked into our state's 529 plan but wasn't sure if there were better options.
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.560]   Any advice would be greatly appreciated, and I'll obviously check the Radical Personal
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.600]   Finance archives as well because I'm sure you've put some content up there. Thanks for any advice."
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.120]   My response to my friend was, "Don't open one."
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.360]   But I've got to defend that a little bit, and so I told him I'll record a podcast episode.
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.840]   And lucky you, you get to listen to my episode. Because here's the deal.
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:24.400]   Although I am massively in favor of education, my position is that education is of utmost
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:30.880]   importance. And although I'm in favor of some formal certification, my position is that
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.320]   formal certification can be useful for at least some people in some careers.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:45.760]   I don't believe that college plans are a good idea for the majority of people who are in
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.760]   situations like me as a young father or situations like my friend.
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:59.360]   In today's world, college rarely equals education. Can it? Yes, it can, but it rarely equals
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.920]   education. And college certification is rapidly losing value in the marketplace.
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.760]   And so when you are sitting down and looking at a situation with limited resources,
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:17.280]   in my opinion, saving for your kid's college represents about the worst of your potential
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.400]   options. And if it's not the worst, it's certainly at least the most inefficient choice,
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:29.040]   the most inefficient way for you to deploy your capital. The specific college accounts are of
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:34.640]   limited value, and the opportunity cost of participating in those accounts is simply just
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:41.840]   too high in my opinion. And so I'm going to try to convince you to come over to my side,
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:48.640]   which is that parents should not save and invest for their kid's college. Rather, they should save
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:56.640]   for and invest in their kids. And there's a big, big difference between those things.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.200]   So I'm going to give you four major overarching reasons at the beginning of this show that I
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.320]   believe this position to be a good one for many people to consider. I'm also going to give you
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:17.200]   five specific ideas on alternatives, better uses of the dollar that you can use instead of opening
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:22.240]   up a 529 plan or a Coverdell educational savings account. And finally, I'm going to give you,
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:27.600]   if you insist on saving for college, I'm going to give you three options that I think are
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:38.240]   better to consider first than a 529 plan or a Coverdell ESA. Please note, I am not ignorant
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:44.560]   of the benefits of specific college savings accounts. If you would like to hear an in-depth
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:52.000]   discussion of what they are, how they work, the major overarching function and structure of
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:59.040]   these plans and the specific little hacks that you can apply to them, there's about 15 to 20 hours of
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:05.120]   content in the Radical Personal Finance archives. Just search the website for 529 plan. You'll find
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:12.320]   all kinds of detail. I am not ignorant of those benefits. And I'm also not saying that nobody
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.480]   should consider using these accounts because they are a useful tool in the tool belt of a
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:22.320]   competent financial planner. And in those shows, I clearly describe where I think they are useful.
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:30.000]   But for somebody like me or for somebody like my friend, prudent young parents saving for their
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.400]   kids, I don't believe they're useful. So I hope you'll stick with me and give me a chance to
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:44.080]   present my opinions to you. Before we get through to the details of those reasons, I want to talk
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.880]   about our sponsors for today's show. And appropriately, today's sponsor number one is
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:55.760]   Jay Fleischman. Jay is a student loan attorney, a bankruptcy attorney, and host of the Student Loan
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:01.040]   Show, Student Loan Show podcast. He's been interviewed on Radical Personal Finance twice.
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:06.720]   And if you have student loans or if you know anybody who has student loans or if you're
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:11.280]   considering getting student loans, you should go and listen to those two episodes. They're episodes
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:16.880]   214 and episode 258. Just search the website or look back in the feed on your mobile device.
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:21.520]   You should listen to those shows because you'll learn more about student loans over the course of
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:27.040]   about that three hours than frankly you probably ever have known. But more importantly, if you
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:32.000]   have student loans, you should consider sitting down with Jay for a personal option. He is a
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.680]   consultant, a very competent consultant, travels all over the country, teaches other student loan
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:42.560]   attorneys how to actually work through their options. And he's made available his consulting
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:46.800]   services at a reduced price for listeners of the Radical Personal Finance podcast.
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:52.640]   For details on that, go to studentloanshow.com/radical. But if you have student loans,
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:08:01.120]   as we begin 2016 here, make sure that you at the minimum sign up for a email review of your student
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:07.520]   loans with Jay Fleischman. Details on those packages are at studentloanshow.com/radical.
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:10.640]   And also while you're there, make sure you subscribe and listen to his podcast.
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:16.080]   Sponsor of the day today, number two, is Trade King. Trade King is my choice
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:22.560]   and my personal recommendation and endorsement for who you should consider housing your brokerage
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:28.480]   accounts with. Trade King is a wonderful discount broker. You can make trades with them for $4.95
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:36.640]   on stock trades. And they will give you a great deal on the price of your trades and the price
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.840]   of holding your accounts. But they'll also give you great customer service.
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:45.760]   And the key thing to recognize with opening a brokerage account is in many ways, the actual
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:51.040]   substance that you own, the investment is a commodity. One share of Apple stock in a Trade
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:56.000]   King account or one share of Apple stock in a Merrill Lynch account or one string of Apple
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.880]   stock in a Charles Schwab account, those all function exactly the same. It's one share of
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:07.040]   Apple stock. So what can you look for? Well, you got to look for a good price. And that's where
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:12.240]   Trade King is among the cheapest of the options out there. They're not the cheapest, but you got
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:18.000]   to correspond that with good value. And Trade King prizes themselves on customer service.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.080]   I've been to the Trade King offices. I've met the CEO. I've spoken in depth with some of their
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:28.080]   executives. And I am confident that they are an excellent resource for you to work with for your
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:32.320]   brokerage. So if in 2016, you're thinking about opening a trading account, giving your hand,
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:36.000]   whether that's short-term trading or just buy and hold investing, consider going to
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.800]   TradeKing.com/radical. If you sign up through that tracking link, not only will it help me,
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:44.960]   it'll help them to measure the performance of their advertising relationship with me here on
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:49.920]   the show. Thank you very much. But you'll also get $100 in your account if you follow the
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:52.960]   conditions there. And basically, you've got to fund the account with $1,000, and then they'll
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:57.440]   do three trades. And you can read all the fine print there, but they will give you an extra $100
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:02.640]   bonus for opening an account through that link. So if you've thought about establishing a trading
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:06.240]   account, purchasing some shares here, you want to get yourself started or at least get your
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:10.160]   account funded and start to look at your investment plan here, please go to TradeKing.com/radical.
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:19.600]   Claim your $100 offer. So let's get to my reasons why I think that you are ill-served
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.240]   by opening college savings accounts for your kids. And reason number one,
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:31.280]   it's my opinion that the market value of college certification and screening is declining and
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:36.160]   will continue to do so. Now, those of you who are familiar with data and statistics should
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:41.440]   instantly say, "Well, prove your case, Joshua. Where's your evidence?" And I would say, "Well
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:45.200]   done. I definitely need to prove my case with a statement like that." Because we're all familiar
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:50.000]   with the chart that shows that the higher your level of formal education, the higher your earnings
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.360]   ability. Whether it's a high school graduate, a high school dropout earns the lowest amount,
[00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:59.120]   high school student earns a little bit more, and the median wages absolutely do rise based
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:03.840]   upon your level of formal education and your level of certification. So if I'm going to make
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:06.960]   a statement that the market value of college certification and screening is declining and
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:12.720]   will continue to do so, you should demand some good evidence. I do not dispute the fact that,
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:19.600]   on average, college graduates earn more than non-college graduates. I do not dispute that.
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:24.400]   And I don't even dispute the fact that the college degree can be very valuable,
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:29.040]   very valuable in the marketplace, even especially for somebody with a technical degree. Details on
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:34.080]   that later in the show. But I do dispute the fact that for the majority of college graduates
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:39.840]   gaining some kind of miscellaneous liberal arts degree, that their college education is what
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:44.320]   really makes the difference for their level of educational attainment. Number one, go back through
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:50.640]   the data and do some research and compare the number of people who start college versus the
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:55.600]   number of people who finish college. And all of a sudden you find that the numbers change a little
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:01.920]   bit. And what you find is that college graduates who earn well are the ones who finished their
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:08.640]   college degree. They were the ones for whom college was a good choice. And yet there are
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:13.120]   many people who, based upon data and saying, "I got to go get a degree," put themselves in very
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:17.360]   difficult positions. And they're calling Jay Fleischman, where they're deeply in student loan
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:23.760]   debt, for a degree that they didn't finish that has zero market value, and college just wasn't
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:33.520]   right for them. Next, I personally believe there's much more correlation between the type of people
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:40.800]   who finish college degrees and their career success than causation. And consider me as a
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:44.880]   sample set of one as I illustrate my own personal experience with college.
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:50.240]   The highest level of formal academic certification that I've achieved is a master's degree. I think
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:55.440]   at some point I will wind up earning a PhD or doctorate degree in some discipline,
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:13:00.960]   possibly in financial planning, possibly in some completely different unrelated field like
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:07.040]   philosophy. I have an interest in those types of things. But I don't expect that PhD or doctorate
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:12.960]   to make any impact on my earning ability. It's just simply the type of thing that fits my character
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:17.280]   set. I'm the type of person who finishes things. And if you put a challenge in front of me that
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:23.360]   has graduated steps to it, then I'm the kind of person who will just go ahead and try to achieve
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:28.960]   the highest that I can. And many people, especially those people who are good earners, have similar
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:34.160]   character traits. I can give you an example from my youth that will illustrate this more clearly
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:39.280]   than even a college education. I'm a licensed amateur radio operator, ham radio operator.
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:45.120]   And when I got my first amateur radio license, I think when I was 11 or 12 years old, 10,
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:50.240]   somewhere in that, before I was a teenager, I had very little interest in radio. I had a little bit
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:54.240]   of interest, but not a ton of interest. But I got it simply because I had a wallet. And the only
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:57.200]   thing I had in the wallet at that time was cash. And I didn't have anything else to put in the
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:01.200]   wallet. So I thought it'd be cool to put some kinds of licenses in the wallet. So my dad was
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:05.600]   an amateur radio operator. He said, well, get a ham license. So I got a ham license. Well,
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:10.000]   at that time, there were five levels of amateur radio licensing. There was a novice class,
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.480]   a technician class, a general class, an advanced class, and an amateur extra class, which is the
[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:19.920]   equivalent of bachelor's, master's, and PhD. Today, there are three levels of licensing--
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:25.520]   technician, general, and amateur extra. So at that time, I quickly got my novice license.
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:29.680]   And I quickly got my technician license because what I really wanted to be able to do was to be
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:35.760]   able to talk in the local area on something in amateur radio terms, which is called the 2-meter
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:42.320]   band, which is a local VHF, very high-frequency radio waves that are suitable for your local area.
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:45.840]   And that's what I wanted. And I needed a technician license. But I'm the kind of
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:51.840]   person who likes to finish things. Now, the major benefits to increasing your level of licensure
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:57.680]   in amateur radio are simply that you have expanded operating frequencies on the amateur radio bands.
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:02.160]   You can use more of the frequency spectrum. And you can use additional bands if you get a higher
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:06.880]   level of licensing. But this is primarily applicable in what are called the HF, the
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:12.080]   high-frequency bands. And I didn't really do much of anything in the high-frequency bands.
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:18.240]   But I wanted to finish things. I went as high as I could in the licensing classification to that
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:24.080]   time. But my constraining factor was my speed with being able to communicate using Morse code.
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:31.280]   And as you went up in the licenses, your speed had to increase. I believe it was up to 30 words
[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:37.120]   per minute. And I wasn't dedicated enough to get my speed past about the 15 words per minute
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:44.400]   that I needed for the general class. Well, a few years later, the amateur radio rules changed. And
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:50.720]   they eliminated the higher speed necessary for the higher levels of licensing. Well, I immediately
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:55.440]   went out, got a book, studied it for a few hours, went and took my amateur extra test, and got the
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:16:00.880]   highest level of licensing as soon as it became easy enough for me to do so. And I didn't have
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:09.040]   to do the long time-consuming Morse code thing. I had zero benefit or zero practical use for the
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:13.360]   additional licensing. It was just bragging rights. And I wanted to have the highest level. I checked
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:17.600]   the box. I went on with my life. Didn't touch a radio until recently. Didn't touch a radio for
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:21.360]   five or six years. Just never bothered with it. But I still keep that license because I'm the type
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:26.320]   of person who wants to finish things. Now, that same thing has been evident in my life through
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:33.680]   other areas. So the nagging thought of, "I want to get a PhD," is simply a calculation of the hard
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:41.040]   work of it versus the interest and a desire to go as high as I can. Many people who have college
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:48.240]   degrees are similar. When you apply those things over into the work field, it shows a character
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:53.280]   ability. And you bring somebody who had academic ability, that person is likely to go higher.
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:58.880]   And when the path into college is relatively easy in today's modern U.S. American society,
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:05.520]   most people like me are going to do what I did and just take the easy path, easy route,
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:10.480]   go into college, have that as a backup plans. And because college was so instrumental in
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:16.960]   my parents' generation, as far as being that mark of success, that mark of a guaranteed source of
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:21.840]   income, even though the market has changed, people still do it. And it's not that college
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:27.680]   causes that financial success per se. It's just that the type of person who's likely to be skilled
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:32.320]   in college is also likely to be skilled, more likely to be skilled, in a modern technical
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:38.800]   workforce. So filter that data for me in terms of causation versus correlation.
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:46.160]   And prove me the case. I believe it's much more correlative than causative. But more important
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:52.000]   than either of those two reasons, the marketplace is changing. As the best evidence of that,
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   consider the news stories back in 2014 when Google, one of their key employees that was head
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.960]   of HR, some high-level dude, I think the guy's name was Block or Bok or something like that.
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:07.920]   Google came out and started talking about how they, at this point, were generally disregarding
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:16.880]   college degrees, certifications, and GPA because there was no predictive value from those factors
[00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:21.600]   that would indicate the level of success and the level of effectiveness that an employee would
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:27.760]   have. And they were looking for people who had established their own path, who had demonstrated
[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:31.920]   other skill sets. Thankfully, as I understand it from the news reports I read at the time,
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:37.200]   they were also dumping some of the weird questions they would ask interviewees. The
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:41.920]   Google interview process was always legendary. I was always offended by it. I thought it was stupid.
[00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:46.240]   But they had their reasons. I never understood them. But thankfully, they were shifting away
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:52.320]   from some of the wacky questions that became so famous. But the point of the college degree was
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:19:02.320]   that it wasn't predictive of success. Now, it's easier to see that in a quickly moving tech
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:09.600]   company that has to be at the vanguard of an industry that is, in and of itself, very fast-paced.
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:17.600]   But even though that pace of change is harder to see in other industries, the same thing is
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:25.360]   happening. And the idea that you can prepare a student in today's world with 12 years of studies
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:30.640]   to be well-equipped for what the world is going to look like 12 years from now is laughable.
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:35.600]   And the idea that you can teach content in four years of university studies that's going to be
[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:42.080]   applicable to the world that exists in almost any industry four years from now is, I wouldn't say
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:49.600]   laughable, but it's a hard pill to swallow. There are very few hard sciences in which that may be
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:58.240]   the case. And there might be some degrees that teach principle and have a well-developed body
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:04.560]   of knowledge, but most of the degrees that many of the students are earning today, these soft,
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:13.440]   squishy liberal arts degrees, very little benefit. And the world is marching on. College is not going
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:21.680]   to be predictive of career success. The whole formal structured career plan
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:26.000]   that was supposedly going to be based on college has disappeared.
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:30.080]   And if your industry is not being affected by that, I believe it will be.
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:36.240]   So we've got to do something completely different. Those are forward-looking statements.
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:39.760]   I believe there's good evidence for them, but you've got to look at it.
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:49.360]   Just ask yourself, is your career success based on your college degree? And are you still using that
[00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:55.600]   for predictive purposes in your business? Now, there are businesses that will still use that
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:21:01.440]   as a screening tool. So in my initial opening statement of my position, I do think that formal
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:06.960]   certification can be useful. In my business, for example, financial planning, college certification
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:16.880]   is still a screening tool. But the presence of a college degree is not the guarantee that it
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:22.000]   possibly was years ago. Still benefits. If you want to know all my benefits, my reasons, my in-depth
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.800]   discussion, go listen to episode 227 of the show entitled "The Five Benefits of College and Radical
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:32.720]   Ways to Exploit Them." There are other benefits of college. But when you take those industry changes,
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:38.480]   those technical changes, and they look forward, and you combine that with the fact that any person
[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:45.760]   can now effectively market themselves using digital tools and can market themselves into a digital
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:51.360]   market, can market themselves into a job, into a career, into a specialization, that is truly
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:57.840]   powerful. And that demonstrates, that type of marketing is the type of thing that companies
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:03.360]   are looking for. They're looking for people who are self-starters like that. So point number one,
[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:07.440]   the market value of college certification and screening is declining. And my prediction,
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:13.360]   it will continue to do so at an ever-increasing speed. Don't put your hopes for your child's
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:21.280]   future in a college degree. My argument number two, the cost of college is declining and will
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:27.280]   continue to do so. Now here again, I'm at odds with the majority of news articles that you read
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:32.080]   about the constant never-increasing cost of college. But read those articles and ask yourself
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:37.040]   this, what are they using as the metric for the cost of college? And you'll usually find a couple
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:42.480]   of factors. Number one, they use the retail cost of college. What's quoted in the school's catalog
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:49.360]   is their retail price, rather than the actual cost that students are paying. Number two, they don't
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:55.040]   include the cost of classes. They include the cost of classes and room and board and tuition.
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:23:01.920]   And so yes, you're subject to the same factors. And then often, if you look at it, just because
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:06.320]   the general cost is increasing, doesn't mean that the alternatives are not there.
[00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:10.800]   Today, the best one I've seen, I think it was, what was it called? University of the People?
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:16.960]   I can't remember. But I saw one college, one online university that is offering college degrees,
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:23.760]   accredited certified college degrees for about $4,000 total. There are a bunch of options
[00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:30.080]   that will offer you an accredited online degree for $10,000 or $15,000 total.
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:37.200]   You compare that to the cost of $15,000 a semester, and there better be some significant
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:42.160]   economic benefits on the other side to make you be willing to pay $120,000 total,
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:46.960]   if you're comparing $15,000 a semester to $15,000 total. Big difference there.
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:53.760]   And when you compare the cultural dissatisfaction that recent college graduates have with the price
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:59.280]   that they paid for college, the price competition is only going to get more and more severe.
[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:04.560]   Now, we're stuck with all the legacy costs of the ridiculous system that exists. We're stuck with
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:11.360]   way too many professors earning way too much money, way too many big fancy ivy-covered buildings,
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:16.320]   and the world has gone technical and online. If you want to support that system, go for it,
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:21.200]   but I'm going where the future is. If I were doing it today, not a chance in the world I
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:24.960]   would spend the money it costs to go to a traditional brick and mortar university,
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:33.600]   when I can massively cut those costs and punch that certification ticket with an online-only
[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:38.080]   school. So the first factor that the cost is declining is that there are newer, cheaper
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:45.200]   options. The next factor is look at the political winds. By the time your or my child gets to the
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:52.240]   age of college entrance, the majority of college educational options are likely to be free,
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:56.640]   as in paid for by your fellow taxpayer as part of state benefits.
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:02.880]   So why on earth should you bother to waste your time and money saving for something
[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:05.440]   that the political winds say is going to be free?
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:16.000]   Do you really see anybody arguing against that? The majority of you who are in the listening
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:23.760]   audience, the majority of US American citizens have their children in a state paid for school.
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:27.760]   Your fellow taxpayers are sending your kids to school. So most of you are not saving for
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:35.600]   your own kids' private education. You didn't need to plan for it, so you're planning for college.
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:40.960]   Well, look at the political winds that are in this country. My best guess, Hillary Clinton
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:46.000]   will be elected our next president. Bernie Sanders has obviously gained a huge foothold.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:54.320]   None of the Republicans have any really serious objections to the expansion of state-sponsored
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:26:02.400]   education. So why would the trend not continue? Over the last few years, you've got people
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:09.280]   striking on the street. You've got all kinds of dissatisfied people with their student loans.
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:14.240]   Government is already heavily involved with the establishment of expansion of federally
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:19.600]   guaranteed student loans, stabilization of interest rates. It's this cultural thing.
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:22.960]   It's the only state-sponsored religion that we have in the United States of America. It's the
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:30.480]   religion of state-run schooling. So why would it not be expanded to the college age? So could I be
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:37.040]   wrong? I could be. But my guess is by the time my two-year-old is there, it'll be free. And thank
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:41.920]   you all for paying for it, if I ever send my kid to that. Who knows? We'll have to see what happens
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:49.840]   in 15 years. But it's going to be free. The number of people you say, "Well, if I have money, I'm
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:53.760]   going to vote against it being free because then it wasn't fair." Well, the number of people who
[00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:58.320]   are going to vote against it is very small versus the number of people who will vote for it.
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:05.120]   The trend in most of Europe is to have free college tuition payments. I don't see any
[00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:09.680]   practical, serious indications that it's going to be any different in the United States of America.
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:15.440]   So my prediction, it'll be free. Why bother to save for something that's going to be free?
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:21.600]   Interesting question there with regard to macroeconomics. I'll leave it for you to consider.
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:29.520]   But even if it's not free, paid for by the state, for good students, college today is free
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:37.520]   and can be free. And if your child is not a good student, then why on earth should you torture them
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:43.200]   by going to college? The people who do well in college are the people who are good students.
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:49.280]   And the people who are good students already have tons of options to get paid for for school.
[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:54.800]   I was a good student in high school. If I had made different choices, I could have gone to a
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:59.360]   state-run school and just gone to a traditional state-run school and with scholarships, grants,
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:05.280]   academic stuff, fully had that entire thing paid for. I had to pay for some out of pocket because
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:11.600]   I chose to go to a private university instead of a public university. But why torture your child
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:15.520]   with college expectations if they're not a good student? And if they are a good student,
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:21.440]   there are already tons of options to go to school for free. So argument number two, the cost of
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:26.000]   college is declining and will continue to do so, especially for those people who are good students,
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.920]   especially in the cultural environment that we have, and especially as the entire world
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:35.280]   transitions to the delivery of educational materials over online. Number three, the
[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:43.280]   financial and tax benefits of college savings accounts are minimal for most families. The tax
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:49.920]   savings are minimal and the investment options are mediocre, generally speaking. Why are the tax
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:55.680]   savings minimal? Number one, most people don't put much money in them. Generally, people like my
[00:28:55.680 --> 00:29:00.000]   friend. I don't know. I haven't asked his specific situation, but people like my friend are going to
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   set up an account and they're going to put $100, $200 a month in there. Well, when comparing that
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:13.360]   amount of savings to the total retail cost of a tuition bill, it's meaningless. In my financial
[00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:20.480]   planning career, meeting with over a thousand people, I couldn't count dozens who had fully
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:28.240]   funded educational accounts. There were not that many. There were some, but there were not that
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:35.040]   many. Generally, the only people who had those fully funded accounts were people who had done a
[00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:42.320]   prepaid tuition program, paying a tuition only approach, things like that. But what person is,
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:46.560]   I mean, most people are not going to set up, setting aside $700 or $800 a month into a college
[00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:50.880]   savings account, which is probably what they need in order to pay the tuition at the prestigious
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:58.720]   Ivy League school. So most people aren't saving very much. Number two, the tax benefits on college
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:06.880]   savings accounts are slight. There's no upfront tax deduction for contributions to an account.
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:13.760]   So you fund the accounts with after-tax dollars. The only tax benefits that you get is the year
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:21.040]   by year deferral on gains and the possible tax-free distribution when those gains are
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:29.200]   used for an accredited certified college program. So how much money is that actually?
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:33.760]   Well, if you want to hear some detailed calculations, go back and listen to all my
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:40.240]   shows on 529s and ESAs. It's not that much, especially when you factor in the volatility,
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:45.520]   which leads you to the fact that you generally are funding these accounts with mediocre investments
[00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:50.320]   that aren't very aggressive. By mediocre investments, I mean many of the accounts
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:56.880]   are restricted to mainstream investments. We face at least a much more difficult headwind in the
[00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:02.240]   forthcoming decade, much more difficult economic headwind in the United States,
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:09.760]   especially for mainstream investments. And these investments, due to the relatively short duration
[00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:15.280]   of planning for college as compared to planning for retirement, you have to be much more conservative,
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:22.000]   which automatically lowers your returns. And worse, many of the investments in these types
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   of college plans are overladen with fees and expenses. What I mean about time horizon is that
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:37.360]   if I'm planning for my two-year-old's college tuition payments, and I'm going to assume that
[00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:42.000]   he's going to go the traditional route of going to school at the age of 18, going to school from 18
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:50.320]   to 20, my total prospective time horizon is 16 to 20 years. That's longer than the five-year time
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:56.960]   horizon that we financial advisors tell people to plan for with their investments. So I've got,
[00:31:56.960 --> 00:32:03.840]   okay, I've got 16 to 20 years. But what happens when my kid starts to become 15 years old and
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:09.200]   we're going around doing the great college tour? I'm going to be looking pretty carefully at my
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:15.120]   accounts. And especially if I'm facing a big tuition bill, I'm going to start to pull that
[00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:23.840]   account back in terms of volatility. And I've got to manage it much more carefully than a stock
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:27.520]   account that I've got set aside for my retirement where I've got an investment time horizon of 30
[00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:34.560]   to 40 years. So when you compound these factors, I don't believe the tax benefits to be all that
[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:40.960]   great for parents who are going to be setting aside $100, $200 a month. Tax benefits can be
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:46.720]   great for parents or grandparents who are setting aside massive lump sums early in their child's
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:52.160]   life. For details on those strategies, again, go listen to all of my previous shows. But for me,
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:57.520]   for my kids, tax benefits are minimal. Investment options are often poor.
[00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:02.400]   Reason number three to avoid the accounts. And number four,
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:11.520]   when you calculate the opportunity cost of saving money for my kid's college,
[00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:17.120]   the opportunity cost, what I'd be giving up with that money is simply too high,
[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:24.800]   especially given the fact that I can't know the future, and I especially can't know the future
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:31.120]   for my child. I don't know what the college situation is going to be like in 15 to 20 years,
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:35.600]   neither do you. I don't know what the economic value of a college degree is going to be like
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:40.480]   in 15 to 20 years, neither do you. I could be right about the political wins or I could be
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:45.280]   completely wrong about them. None of us know, we'll have to wait and see. And I don't know
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:50.960]   if college is going to be appropriate for my child. I think the system will look dramatically
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:56.560]   different in 15 years. I see the market forces at work and I don't see how the entrenched bureaucracy
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:02.240]   can withstand those market forces. So I think the situation will be different, but I just don't know.
[00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:08.880]   When you add all of that uncertainty to all of the uncertainty with investment choices,
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:14.880]   all of the uncertainty with tax codes, all of the uncertainty with all of those other factors,
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:20.000]   there's so much uncertainty. And when you look at some of the alternatives that I'm going to lay out
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.240]   for you and the benefit those can have in your child's life, I believe the alternatives are
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:30.480]   much more certain. So when you compare all that uncertainty with some of these much more certain
[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:38.080]   alternatives, I am not willing to give up the things that I can do with the money now to invest
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:44.560]   in my children in order to segregate it into a separate account that is specifically earmarked
[00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:50.720]   for college expenses. And let's go on to those five alternatives that are big picture alternatives
[00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:55.600]   I'd like you to consider. Before I do that, I need to correct myself on one thing I misspoke
[00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:59.840]   on the previous point where I said the financial and tax benefits of college are minimal and I
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:06.000]   stated that you get no upfront deduction. Let me clarify that. These details are totally clear in
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.840]   the extensive shows that I've done previously, but let me clarify because some of my sharp-eared
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:15.680]   listeners will catch me in that mistake. There are no upfront federal tax deduction benefits
[00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:21.520]   for contributing to most college savings accounts. It's possible that there can be some
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:30.000]   state income tax deductions for some 529 plan contributions. So check your state. Those vary
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:35.200]   dramatically across states and they may or may not have value depending on the state that you live in,
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:39.760]   but they're minimal. But there's nothing on the federal level. So just that quick correction and
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:46.160]   let's go on to my alternatives. Alternative number one, better use for the money that you would save
[00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:53.680]   in a college account is this. Switch your focus from helping your adult children to helping your
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:36:02.480]   children children. So number one, if you just change from focusing on the four years of your
[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:10.080]   child's life from 18 to 22 to focusing on the four years of your child's life from zero to four,
[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:17.680]   I believe you'll have much better results. Time will tell. You're welcome to look at my children
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:23.280]   in 20 years and we'll find out together. But I think the argument is compelling and here's
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:29.120]   some ideas for how to do that. Number one, take the money and if you have to use the money to do
[00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:37.680]   this, get mom home with the kids. Get mom home with your little babies and your young kids.
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:44.960]   That is much, much tougher for mom, but it has dramatic benefits for the child. Now, I'm always
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:50.880]   interested in personally, this starts first with a religious conviction because much of the
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:55.520]   character formation from children comes in the first few years and I'm not willing to surrender
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:37:03.440]   that over to paid caregivers of questionable reputation. But whether or not you share my
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:07.680]   personal religious convictions, I'd encourage you research the subject. I'm always interested in the
[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:14.560]   intersection of the modern secular social sciences with my own personal convictions.
[00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:21.120]   And there's a bunch of interesting data on this. I'll link over to, well, I just got a book as an
[00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:25.200]   example. I just got a book called Home Alone America by Mary Eberstadt, the hidden toll of
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:30.320]   daycare, behavioral drugs and other parent substitutes. One past, I guess she wasn't a
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:35.920]   guest. I had scheduled an interview but it didn't work out. Penelope Trunk, formerly associated with
[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:41.680]   the brazen careerist is a woman who has written extensively about this from a secular perspective.
[00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:46.560]   So whether or not you share my perspective or not, check it out from a social development,
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:51.440]   a social science development. And it's fascinating. Most families would enjoy that.
[00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:56.320]   Most moms want to be with their children, especially during those early formative years.
[00:37:56.320 --> 00:38:04.160]   I don't particularly care if I can finance or fund my child's college education if I've already
[00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:11.600]   invested in them for the first few years. So take the money and get mom home. Even better,
[00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:18.000]   take the money and get dad home. Get both parents involved. Downsize your lifestyle.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.880]   And if you downsize your lifestyle or you take that money that you would otherwise save and you
[00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:28.080]   use it for less overtime, less weekend work, less travel, transition to a job that gives you more
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:32.400]   flexibility, transition to a job that you can integrate your children in, transition to a job
[00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:40.400]   that helps with you to have a relationship. Now you've got the ultimate. And it really bothers me
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:45.520]   when I see parents who are trying to set aside money for their child and what your child is
[00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:53.920]   craving is not money but time. So get mom home and get dad home. And then invest that time and money
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:59.920]   into training their character and into early childhood education, whether that's formal
[00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:04.560]   education or informal education. Go and do the research. The best one to research would be if
[00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:10.160]   you want to talk about the formal education side, research all the Montessori schools. They're the
[00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:14.880]   most vocal with their research on early child education. Spend the money you would spend on
[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:19.920]   four years of college on an early Montessori education for your child or create your own option
[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:29.280]   of experiences. One of the biggest things that for me is if you study the amount of knowledge that a
[00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:36.080]   child learns from the amount of the character development, their worldview, their vocabulary,
[00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:40.960]   their perspectives on life, so much of it is determined in the first three, four, five,
[00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:50.480]   six years of life. So if you're raising your child in front of a TV or you're paying a minimum wage
[00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:55.840]   daycare worker to care for your child so that you can go off and earn a bunch of money and save it
[00:39:55.840 --> 00:40:00.960]   for your child's college education, don't think that's the most efficient use of your money.
[00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:08.640]   So switch your focus from helping your adult child to helping your child child. And if you do that,
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:14.000]   you won't need to bother with paying for your child's college education because they'll have
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:21.200]   the ability to figure it out themselves. I didn't need my dad to pay for my college education.
[00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:30.560]   I was easily able to figure it out myself. Many of you were as well. But would I have had the
[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:37.600]   character and the discipline to do that if my mom and dad hadn't been there in those first few years?
[00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:43.440]   If I hadn't learned to read and to study at an early age, if I hadn't developed those academic
[00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:48.480]   skills, if mom and dad hadn't poured their lives into me in those first four years?
[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:56.640]   Consider it. Number two, switch your focus from college education to primary education.
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:05.040]   It's very difficult for me to understand why anybody would save and bother to save and buy
[00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:10.240]   college schooling for their child if they haven't created some kind of better option
[00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:17.600]   in the primary and secondary years. Now, we can argue night and day about what option is best,
[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:23.600]   whether it's unschooling, homeschooling, self-directed education, Montessori,
[00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:32.080]   your local charter school, a private school, Thomas Jefferson education, or whatever the latest
[00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:40.240]   thing is. You got to deal with that. But any option like that is going to be better than
[00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:44.960]   government schooling. Now, it's a little bit scary because if you invest in those options,
[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:49.760]   your kid might not need the college education because they might be financially independent
[00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:54.960]   by the time they're 25 or they might have enough money to pay cash for their own house by the time
[00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:58.880]   they're 23 or they might have a business that they started in their spare time when they were 15 that
[00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:05.680]   has them earning $100,000 a year by the time they're 18. It's a little scary, but all of those
[00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:12.240]   things will be much better for the economic future of your child. So simply switch your focus from
[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:17.680]   college education to primary education. And here's the fun way to do that. Calculate what you think
[00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:25.360]   is the cost of college and then ask yourself, "How could I spend that money now on their earlier
[00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:29.440]   educational opportunities?" And then figure out what's right for you and your family.
[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:35.680]   It's not my place to tell you what's right, but figure out what's right and be willing to put
[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:42.800]   the money there. Number three, switch your focus from social and societal acceptance to the
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:49.680]   individual development of your child. Switch your focus from school to education. And then even
[00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:53.920]   better, switch your focus from school and education even to character development.
[00:42:53.920 --> 00:43:00.960]   Switch your focus from social indoctrination to personal empowerment and ask yourself,
[00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:08.640]   "How can I spend money on the actual individual development of my child?" And if you're writing
[00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:13.600]   the checks, you might care a little bit more about the content of your child's curriculum.
[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:17.680]   You might throw out a bunch of the time-wasting stuff that really is irrelevant because every
[00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:21.440]   single one of us with a high school diploma and a college degree would look back and easily
[00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:26.000]   recognize how much of what we studied was irrelevant. And you might work on things
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:31.760]   that are a little bit more relevant to actual social career success.
[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:38.960]   Focus on the actual development of the child.
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:46.800]   I guess my next one, number four, I just jumped the gun, but invest your money in your child's
[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:51.760]   education, not their schooling. What if I gave you a budget? Here are just some ideas that I've had
[00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:55.360]   working through these with my own children. What if I gave you a budget? Let's say I'm going to
[00:43:55.360 --> 00:44:01.120]   save $300 a month into a college account for my child. That'd be a good starting point. At this
[00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:05.840]   age, I could fund a state school at the retail price and my financial planning software if I
[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:13.440]   set it aside at $300 a month. So what if I took that $300 a month and I said, "I have to spend
[00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:22.160]   this money now on my child. I can save a little bit of it up and I can take some of that money,
[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:29.440]   but I've got to spend it at least, say, once a year." What if I had to spend $300 a month once
[00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:38.160]   a year on my child each year? Well, if they show some particular skill, some particular talent,
[00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:44.800]   I'd have the money to invest in a world-class tutor for that skill or talent instead of just
[00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:52.320]   taking whatever we're around and hoping that somehow the local state school has a good
[00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:58.320]   professor. I can choose a world-class tutor. I could send that child for a week to go with some
[00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:04.080]   world-class tutor in their area of interest. I could buy a lot of books. So if my child
[00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:10.560]   demonstrates a real interest in a subject area, we can cancel a lot of the time-wasting stuff
[00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:16.160]   in the government school system and I can buy a lot of books with $300 a month,
[00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:22.080]   especially buying used books off of Amazon. I can afford my high-speed Internet connection so
[00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:26.400]   they can have access to the world's greatest tutors there. I can pay for some web hosting
[00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:31.840]   fees to help my child develop an online presence. I can buy my child whatever gear and equipment
[00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:36.080]   that they need so if they're demonstrating an interest in a technical field and they want to,
[00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:40.160]   you know, it was that kid that was building, excuse me, young man who was building
[00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:47.680]   robotic arms for his middle school classmate, I could afford to buy the computers or the material
[00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:53.600]   that he need for him and give him the money that way. I could take the money and instead of wasting
[00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:58.720]   a summer working a minimum wage job, I could send my kid to Washington DC and tell him to spend
[00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:07.680]   weeks wandering the free museums all across the city. Which of you had the time when you were
[00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:12.640]   young and your parents did something like that? Dozens and dozens and dozens of world-class free
[00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:18.560]   museums. You think that might help the exposure? See, one of the major problems with college is
[00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:24.240]   people are going to college to figure out what they want to do. That's an expensive stupid way
[00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:28.800]   to figure out who you are and what you want to do. Much better to figure out who you are and
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:34.960]   what you want to do early and cheap and then when you go to college and you know this is what you
[00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:40.880]   want to do, you have a purpose behind it and now you're much more likely to be successful at
[00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:45.360]   following through, finishing school and you're much more likely to actually use the knowledge
[00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:50.320]   and education that you gained. For me, my own personal story is an example of this.
[00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:55.760]   My undergraduate degree is in international business. I use nothing. Nothing from that,
[00:46:55.760 --> 00:47:01.360]   no specific knowledge from that degree. Perhaps I use study skill, perhaps I use generalized
[00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:05.840]   ability to write or to read or to study or to manage my time. I certainly had formative
[00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:11.120]   experiences during those years, but in terms of actual content, I use nothing of that degree.
[00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:16.480]   But then when I got a master's degree in financial planning, I use far more of that
[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:21.760]   because I was a financial planner and many of you the same thing. For example, my friend who
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:25.840]   wrote me this note is an engineer and just finished a master's degree in engineering.
[00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:30.080]   Getting a master's degree in engineering when you are an engineer is far different
[00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:40.880]   than being a sheltered, unexposed 18-year-old wandering into a college classroom trying to
[00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:43.920]   figure out who you are, what you want to do and what you believe about the world.
[00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:52.560]   So take the money that you would invest in your child's schooling, especially college schooling,
[00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:57.040]   and invest it in their education now. And you probably won't even need to buy any college
[00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:03.200]   tuition down the road. And that way, whether or not college is the appropriate fit for your kid,
[00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:08.880]   you've at least got some… they have a lot more options.
[00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:18.720]   A lot more options. And number five, switch your focus from equipping your child with a
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:25.760]   college certificate to equipping your child with economically valuable skills.
[00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:34.400]   My best example of this, I interviewed in the past Jonathan Harris, the site member of 10k to
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:38.080]   talent. Jonathan and his wife Renee are members of the community. They're involved in the Facebook
[00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:43.520]   Irregulars group. And they do a great job. But they have a bunch of kids. And I follow one of
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:50.320]   their children, a young man named Caleb, who is an amateur knife maker. I follow his stuff on
[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:54.240]   Instagram. And Caleb, I'm actually going to be giving him some advice. I intend to release it
[00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:59.040]   as a future episode, but on starting a podcast. But Caleb, I think, is 17 years old. And he's
[00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:05.280]   built for himself an incredible platform as an amateur bladesmith, helping and encouraging other
[00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:09.760]   amateur bladesmiths. And the work that Jonathan is doing at 10k to talent, helping your child to
[00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:16.960]   actually develop and build talent is truly, truly… it's awesome. Now, Jonathan and Renee
[00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:20.880]   haven't told me about what they've spent or haven't spent. It's none of my business. But
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:24.800]   I'm pretty confident that they've had to spend some money to help Caleb get established.
[00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:32.400]   But if you take the money that you would be putting into a 529 plan,
[00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:39.760]   and you take it and use that to buy your son a forge and an anvil, and the special metal that
[00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:45.280]   he needs to forge blades while he's blowing through the stuff, screwing up the first 250
[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:51.920]   versions of it, if you take that and make that investment, then you wind up with a 17-year-old
[00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:58.080]   young man who is nationally known as a young and up-and-coming amateur bladesmith.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:04.880]   That's what I mean by opportunity cost. What if you were putting the $300 a month into the 529
[00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:15.760]   plan? Well, guess what? Anvils and forges and metal are not approved qualified distributions
[00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:23.600]   from a 529 plan. Which of those is going to make a bigger difference? Now, if you've got the money,
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:29.840]   can you do both? Sure. But I don't at the moment have the income where I can do both.
[00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:36.560]   And most people who are in my bracket, young families, don't have the money and the income
[00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:45.440]   to do both either. And so we rob the now in order to fund the future for a system that's
[00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:58.640]   out of date and broken. If you shift the attention from the four years of 18 to 22,
[00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:03.520]   and you shift that from the years of zero to, I don't know, 12, 15, 18,
[00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:08.160]   you won't need to do all that hard work from 18 to 22.
[00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:18.080]   It'll already be done. And instead of investing in the financial markets where the value will go
[00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:21.840]   up and down and your investments will wander around and you're subject to the latest vagaries
[00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:25.920]   of the government regulation and a bunch of bureaucrats who write laws, you've invested in a
[00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:33.360]   person with whom you have a relationship. And guess what? Whatever the world is in 15 or 20 years,
[00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:40.720]   that person with whom you have a relationship will be competent to fend for themselves.
[00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:47.600]   And I think this is one of the best ways that parents can fulfill the old axiom of
[00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:51.200]   teaching a man to fish instead of giving him a fish.
[00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:58.560]   My dad didn't fund my college education. He offered to let me live at home rent-free
[00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:02.880]   during the years of college if I wanted to, but he didn't fund my college education.
[00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:07.680]   Never regretted it, never was bitter towards him, never needed it.
[00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:13.680]   I looked at my friends who were dependent on their parents and had this weird
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:18.640]   controlling relationship with their parents where they had to go show their parents their
[00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:25.200]   report cards at 21 years old because their parents were funding their college. I'm like,
[00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:32.160]   "Why don't you just do it yourself?" It's probably a useful concept to talk through. I'm not prepared
[00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:38.160]   to discuss it today. But as far as the dependency that continues on and the control that parents
[00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:43.840]   probably try to exercise too late because they're financing something. But I just looked at my
[00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:47.680]   friend and was like, "Why don't you do it yourself? Have some self-respect. You're an adult."
[00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:55.120]   When you look at the options, there are many more effective uses of the money now,
[00:52:55.120 --> 00:53:03.200]   and it's a much more secure investment. The very few ideas I've laid out here are just the tip of
[00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:11.440]   the iceberg. Now, let's say that my arguments are not compelling to you, or let's say that
[00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:16.560]   my arguments are compelling, and you just say, "Well, I've got the money. I want to do both. I'll
[00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:20.880]   fund what's now, but I also want to fund the future." Awesome. Here are three final ideas.
[00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:28.320]   Number one, don't dilute your wealth-building efforts and fool yourself with the idea that
[00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:32.560]   by funding various accounts on a minimal basis, you're somehow going to become rich.
[00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:37.840]   Start by getting rich and then paying for the stuff that you want. Here's what I mean.
[00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:43.600]   Many people do a little here, a little there. Put a little bit of money in a savings account to save
[00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:48.960]   for Christmas, pay a little extra on their credit cards, put a couple percent on the 401(k),
[00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:52.880]   put $100 a month into the 529 plan because that's what we can afford,
[00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:58.400]   and they don't make much progress because they don't really focus on anything.
[00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:04.880]   Do a little here, there. As Ziegler used to say, "They're wandering generalities."
[00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:12.960]   I believe the impact is far higher if you become, as again, Ziegler used to say,
[00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:21.360]   a meaningful specific, focusing on clear, specific goals. It doesn't mean you can't
[00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:27.600]   use those accounts. It means that you have a plan. The best behavioral finance guy I know
[00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:33.280]   is Dave Ramsey. If you look at the power of the Dave Ramsey plan for people who are in debt,
[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:38.160]   where he focuses them in, laser focused on, "You're going to get out of debt." Guess what
[00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:44.960]   happens? People get out of debt. It works because they're focused. One bill, one credit card,
[00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:50.000]   one baby step at a time. Take that same thing and fast forward it to your wealth plan.
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:56.160]   So many people would be much better served by saying, "I'm going to get my debt paid off.
[00:54:56.160 --> 00:55:00.640]   I'm going to get my house paid off. I'm going to get the down payment saved up for a rental
[00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:06.880]   house to buy. I'm going to get this account fully funded." Much better to focus on one of
[00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:09.920]   those things one at a time than try to do a little bit here and a little bit there.
[00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:17.440]   And if you're rich, you can pay for college. So start by just having a clear plan to get rich
[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:20.880]   in a short period of time, as is appropriate to your situation.
[00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:28.240]   Those things are not necessarily mutually exclusive. You can work a good job. You can say,
[00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:32.160]   "I like this job. I'm happy with it. I'm just going to fund these accounts and do fine if you
[00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:36.160]   have enough time." It's not mutually exclusive, but make sure you have a clear plan and a clear
[00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:44.320]   focus as appropriate to you. That kind of generalized plan, it could be personality
[00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:51.360]   or it could be effectiveness. I don't know. It doesn't work for me. I'm rather obviously
[00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:56.400]   something of an extreme guy. The reason this show is called the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:55:56.400 --> 00:56:02.800]   But I just find it far more effective to focus. If you're going to work, work. If you're going to
[00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:08.160]   play, play. So number one, don't dilute your efforts and do a little everywhere.
[00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:14.640]   Have clear financial goals that are measurable. Number two, before you fund a college plan,
[00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:21.280]   if you at least recognize that there is at least some uncertainty with the future value of these
[00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:28.320]   accounts, consider some type of cash flow plan rather than a savings plan. Here's what I mean.
[00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:36.320]   If I'm right about my predictions of college and things that are going to happen and the potential
[00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:41.280]   challenges, the limited benefits from the tax perspective, the fact that you're diluting your
[00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:45.520]   efforts, blah, blah, blah, all that stuff I just spent 56 minutes going over with you.
[00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:52.560]   If I'm right about that thing, that stuff, then having a few thousand dollars in a college
[00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:59.600]   savings account is not going to be really that impactful. But if you focus on other things first,
[00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:06.320]   specifically having free cash flow, then if you want to just pay for college when your kids are
[00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:12.480]   older, you can do that. So take that focus and focus it in on paying off your cars and not
[00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:15.840]   borrowing money on cars. Focus it in on paying off your credit cards and not borrowing money
[00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:24.320]   on credit cards. Focus it in on getting your mortgage paid off. If you arrive at the time
[00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:28.640]   that you have an 18-year-old heading to school and you don't have a mortgage and you don't have
[00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:33.520]   car payments and you don't have credit cards, even if you're just working a job, you can just
[00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:39.680]   simply cash flow the college benefit, the college payment. Since there's an economic benefit to all
[00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:44.560]   of those things that works whether your child goes to school or not or whether they go to an
[00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:48.480]   expensive school or whether they get scholarships or not or any of those other factors or whether
[00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:55.600]   school is free or not, you're going to be better off either way. So plan ahead and plan on a cash
[00:57:55.600 --> 00:58:02.800]   flow plan. Another option is just simply plan on a cash flow plan with regard to your investments.
[00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:07.600]   So my point number three here is fund your retirement accounts first. Please don't open a
[00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:16.640]   529 account or an ESA until you have first funded fully your retirement accounts, 401ks, Roth IRAs,
[00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:24.160]   whatever accounts you're eligible for because it'll give you far more flexibility and you might
[00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:31.600]   be able to use the money for college or you can pursue the cash flow plan. So with a Roth IRA,
[00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:36.400]   what I would do is first fund a Roth IRA for you and then if you want to pay for college,
[00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:40.800]   then just take your basis distributions tax-free out of the Roth IRA and use that to pay for
[00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:47.920]   college. First fund a 401k as aggressively as you can until it's full and then probably the
[00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:54.960]   best move would just if you have to cut your contributions to the account while your child
[00:58:54.960 --> 00:59:01.680]   is in school and/or cut them to at least the level of the employee match and then pay cash for
[00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:07.600]   the college tuition payments. At least in those situations you have options and from a financial
[00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:11.920]   aid perspective you have options, your child has options, if you've encouraged your child
[00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:16.400]   and your child is academically excellent, you're not stuck with $15,000 in an account and say,
[00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:20.240]   "Well, you got to get a master's degree now." You've got the money in a retirement account,
[00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:22.960]   which is a little more flexible and a little bit more useful to you.
[00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:29.840]   So fund your retirement accounts first. Then only after all those things are done,
[00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:35.120]   you got to plan to get rich, you got to plan to be debt-free. If you're going to pursue
[00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:39.280]   retirement accounts, those retirement accounts are fully funded and you're investing in all of
[00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:44.000]   your everything that you can see now that's going to help your child now, whether that's the
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:49.600]   exclusive $40,000 a year private school tuition, there's a reason you don't see the elite in our
[00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:54.080]   society sending their kids to local government school. There's a reason they go off to the
[00:59:54.080 --> 01:00:00.000]   boarding school. It's a very different educational approach. If you're not aware of that stuff,
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:06.560]   go and research, research, research, research. But after you've done all those things,
[01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:13.360]   then you can consider the retirement account. And hey, good luck to you.
[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:19.920]   I hope this has been useful to you. I hope you've enjoyed it. I know I'm presenting some very strong
[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:26.640]   opinions. I'm doing that because A, I hold strong opinions, but I'm also doing that simply because
[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:32.720]   I'm fighting against the general tide of advice and information that comes at us in our society.
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:37.600]   And you got to see through it because otherwise the peer pressure is all around.
[01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:41.600]   You're a bad parent because are you saving for your kid's college because don't you know the
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:46.640]   college tuition is going up? Most people are out of touch with the actual facts of what's going on
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:50.880]   in society. Most people are out of touch with the benefit of a college degree. Most people are out
[01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:54.960]   of touch with the college degree costs. Most people are out of touch with the options. Very
[01:00:54.960 --> 01:01:00.080]   few people are in touch with the changing roles of many industries. There are always exceptions to
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:04.080]   all these things that I've said, but you got to recognize that most people are out of touch. I
[01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:09.200]   could be out of touch. You got to be the judge of that. But go and research these things heavily.
[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:16.080]   Read a book on Maria Montessori. Go and visit with your average 18 year old government school
[01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:23.440]   graduate and ask yourself if you want your kid to look like that. Do some research and make an
[01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:29.680]   educated decision. But this is my go-to resource now as to why I refuse to save money for my kid's
[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:34.640]   college. I think it's a dumb system. It's antiquated out of date. It was never that
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:39.760]   effective to begin with. I think it's a bad use of the dollar. Too many risks and uncertainties.
[01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:46.880]   If you disbelieve all that stuff, hey, I got 15 or 20 hours of free stuff to tell you how to
[01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:51.040]   exploit all those accounts with all the loopholes and everything like that. So go search the website.

[01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:14.560]   helpful. But this is how I have the money to invest in my kids. And the primary means for
[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:21.120]   that is the crowdfunded listener support method through the Patreon page. Details for that at
