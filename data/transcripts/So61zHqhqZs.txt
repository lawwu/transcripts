[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380]   [Music]
[00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.920]   We stand on the doorstep of a new year and with a new year, new resolves and with new
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.200]   resolves and new determination to read the entire Bible for ourselves.
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.020]   And knowing this is on the minds of many listeners this time of year, we enter 2019 with a series
[00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.480]   of episodes to address your questions about daily Bible reading.
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.600]   And here is the first one from a listener named Dave.
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.400]   "Hello Pastor John, and thank you for this podcast.
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.800]   My question is about Bible reading plans.
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.960]   Some plans are familiar, plans to read the entire Bible canonically or just the Old Testament
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.800]   or just the New Testament, and then chronological reading plans, and then two or three year
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.400]   reading plans as well.
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.860]   My question is what Bible reading plan do you recommend a first timer to use when he
[00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.200]   has never read the Bible entirely before?
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.560]   And can you offer some tricks to keep in mind on first read?"
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.560]   Before I actually make a concrete, specific recommendation about a Bible reading plan,
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:06.320]   which I will do, let me make six or so observations that might fit into the category that Dave
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.920]   asked when he says, "Any tricks to keep in mind."
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.320]   I'm not just thinking he asked about, "Give me a program," but rather, "Any tricks to
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.640]   be in mind?"
[00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:22.580]   So here's what I think he might be getting at and what I would offer in that category.
[00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:28.400]   Number one, what I would recommend for Bible reading through the Bible is it's going to
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.320]   depend on at least five things that I don't know about Dave.
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.960]   In other words, I'm qualifying my recommendation because I don't know him.
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.140]   How disciplined is he?
[00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.740]   How much time does he have available?
[00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.080]   What skill does he have in reading?
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.760]   What speed and comprehension?
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:54.560]   How familiar is he with all the parts of the Bible, even those maybe even he hasn't read
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.680]   at all?
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.520]   What level of curiosity does he have that might drive him to slow down and figure things
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.040]   out that are puzzling to him?
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:10.640]   So taking all those into account, I will recommend a Bible reading program, but I just want him
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.840]   and others to know people are really different.
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:22.160]   And our capacities for reading and comprehending and speed and our life situation.
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:28.720]   So what I recommend may not fit everybody, but I'll make a recommendation anyway.
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.480]   So that's my first thing I wanted to say about when you're thinking about tricks, know yourself
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.480]   well.
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:42.040]   Number two, be sure to belong to a good Bible reading church, Bible preaching church, and
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.840]   Bible reading church.
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.440]   If you possibly can.
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:52.520]   Few things are more helpful in grasping the totality of Scripture than a steady week in,
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:58.680]   week out, month in, month out, year in, year out, decade in, decade out, feeding on the
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.200]   preached Word of God.
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.880]   Oh, so important.
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:11.840]   If your pastor doesn't preach Bible texts and explain to you what they mean, please
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:21.520]   try to find another church, because the decades of your life will be gloriously transformed
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.840]   if you sit under the preaching of the Word like that for a long, long time.
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:33.360]   Number three, get into a group, a small group of people where you expect each other to be
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:41.880]   reading your Bible and taking or talking to each other about what you've seen there.
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:48.880]   Number four, pray earnestly over your Bible reading before you read, while you're reading,
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:55.720]   after you read, that God would show you what's really there and make it real for you.
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:02.160]   Five, set aside a place and a time where you're going to read your Bible every day.
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:09.080]   If you don't have a set place and a set time, Satan will almost certainly, along with your
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:15.960]   own flesh, more easily push your Bible reading right out of your schedule and out of your
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.680]   space.
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:24.120]   And number six, reading through the Bible in a year involves about four or five chapters
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.520]   a day.
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:32.120]   If you think you have to remember all you read while you're reading those four or five
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.080]   chapters, this will feel absolutely overwhelming and pointless.
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:46.120]   So I want to encourage you, when you think you have forgotten 95% of what you just read,
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.720]   that's true in the short run.
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:56.800]   God's Word nevertheless is lodging itself in your mind and your heart in ways you cannot
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.240]   comprehend.
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:04.880]   The so-called forgotten language, the forgotten paragraphs, the forgotten words, the forgotten
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:13.040]   stories, the forgotten points are becoming a repository from which the Holy Spirit can
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:19.120]   draw out things you do not even know are there.
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:25.960]   So when you walk away from your Bible reading in the morning, don't fret that you can't
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.960]   recite an outline of every paragraph you read.
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.120]   You won't be able to, unless you're a genius with a photographic memory.
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:43.480]   Instead, take one crisp, clear sentence with you, something encouraging, something motivating,
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.760]   something strengthening, something guiding.
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.280]   Write it down on a little piece of paper, stick it in your pocket, stick it in your
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.920]   purse, whatever.
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.760]   Say it to yourself over and over again during the day.
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:06:03.320]   Those same sentences, accumulated, 365 of them, an amazing power and stockpile of truth
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:04.440]   over time.
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:10.000]   So now here's my recommendation for the Bible reading program that he asked for.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.960]   And I'm going to recommend the one that I use because that's why I use it.
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:13.960]   I love it.
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:14.960]   I think it's valuable.
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.640]   It's called the Discipleship Journal Reading Plan.
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.560]   Just Google it, you'll find it.
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.600]   Or Google best Bible reading programs through the year, it'll be one of them.
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.240]   It's called the Discipleship Journal Reading Plan.
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.680]   It has two unique features that make me love it.
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.780]   One is that every day you're reading in four different places in the Bible, which means
[00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:42.280]   that if one of them leaves you scratching your head, another one might be perfectly
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:45.440]   exactly what you need for the day.
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:51.800]   And the other unique feature is that you only are required to read 25 days out of the month,
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.720]   not 30 or 31.
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:59.680]   The main reason is because all of us know people tend to fall behind in their reading.
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:04.680]   And if you fall behind and there are no catch-up days, then in February, you're 10 chapters
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.760]   behind and you give up.
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:12.040]   But if you have five days at the end of every month for catch-up, you tend to take heart
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.440]   and keep going.
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:18.080]   Or if you're quite a disciplined reader and you never fall behind, you have this glorious
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.560]   five-day moment when you can memorize.
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:23.000]   This is what I do with them anyway.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   I pick a Psalm.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   I'm working through Psalm 25, Psalm 103.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.840]   I re-memorize Romans 8.
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.480]   I re-memorize Philippians.
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:34.080]   This is what I do with my five days at the end of the month.
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:41.480]   So this morning I was reading in Gospel of John, Book of Revelation, Job, and Amos.
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.480]   No, that was yesterday.
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:46.200]   This morning I was in Jonah.
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:54.360]   And even though I can't remember the details of what I read in all three passages, what
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:08:03.000]   I saw in John 17 and what I saw in Jonah at the end, shouldn't I pity this city, 120,000
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.720]   people don't know their right hand from their left.
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:05.720]   I remember that.
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:09.520]   I remember that, but I don't remember what I saw in Job.
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:10.520]   What was that in Job?
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:11.520]   What was Elihu saying?
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:14.600]   I can't remember what Elihu was saying.
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:21.480]   But okay, I forgot Job, but I remembered a sentence that I need about being merciful
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.600]   to people who don't know their right hand from their left.
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.160]   So you get the idea.
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.800]   I love the Scriptures.
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:33.440]   I love to encourage people to read the whole Bible, because if we leave out big parts of
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:38.120]   the Bible, we probably won't know God the way we should.
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.120]   Amen.
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.720]   The entire book is important to our spiritual lives.
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:45.520]   Thank you for speaking these words and for not only speaking these words, but modeling
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.960]   a love for the Bible for so many decades, Pastor John.
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:48.960]   Thank you.
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:54.620]   And speaking of years, in six years, we have generated about 1,300 total episodes.
[00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:58.400]   Thank you for your interest and for your questions over those six years.
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:02.080]   You can search all those episodes, read full transcripts, and send us your own question
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:07.580]   as well at our online home at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:12.640]   We are going to ring in the new year next time, talking about Bible reading again, specifically
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:16.540]   the desire, the act, and the reward of daily Bible reading.
[00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:18.800]   Some motive questions are on the table next.
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.640]   That's on Wednesday when we return.
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:21.640]   Until then, I'm your host Tony Reinke.
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:21.640]   We'll see you then.
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:22.720]   We'll see you then.
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:32.720]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
