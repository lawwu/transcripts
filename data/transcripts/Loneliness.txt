[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai.
[00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.960]   And with me today I have my wife, Sydney, and we're going to talk about the loneliness
[00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:13.420]   epidemic and some surprising solutions that I thought about that I didn't really realize
[00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:14.420]   until now.
[00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.260]   So, Sydney, how are you doing?
[00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.840]   And do you feel lonely or not?
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:19.920]   I'm doing great.
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.720]   I don't feel lonely lately, which is good.
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.320]   How about you?
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.920]   I don't feel lonely because I'm playing a lot of pickleball, I'm playing tennis, and
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.560]   we have our children to keep us busy 24/7 if we want.
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:42.900]   But they seem to be latching onto you more as the mama, especially since they're sick.
[00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.360]   And so it might be a little overwhelming.
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.920]   What are your thoughts?
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.120]   Yeah, I was kind of laughing when I read your article because for me sometimes it feels
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.680]   like the opposite.
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:01.280]   I feel like I have so much time devoted to other people that I don't have enough time
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.080]   to myself to just kind of decompress and self-care.
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.760]   I am not upset with that because it is what it is.
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:19.400]   Being a mom can be tough, but it's also rewarding to be able to help the kids and help you and
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.040]   just keep on going.
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.760]   Yes, indeed.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.960]   So let me ask you this something.
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.000]   Back in 2012, do you remember when I first left the industry, the finance industry, how
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.200]   many times I said I was bored?
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:41.240]   Yeah, it was a lot to take because it was just so different from how you were when you
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.240]   were working.
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.160]   It was a big lifestyle adjustment for you.
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.540]   It was hard because I was still working at the time, so my schedule was limited when
[00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:55.560]   all of a sudden you had so much flexibility in your day-to-day and I still had to go to
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.280]   work and stick to my regular schedule.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.920]   So yeah, it was a huge adjustment for you.
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:07.280]   I remember when I left, I would still wake up by 6 a.m. every morning and even though
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.040]   you had to go to work, what time were you waking up?
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.680]   I am not a natural morning person, so I would stretch it as late as I possibly could and
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.720]   still make it in the door on time.
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.080]   So what time was that?
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.360]   I don't even remember.
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.920]   I'm guessing I was probably waking up around 7, 7.30.
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:25.920]   No way!
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.720]   I think you were waking up more like 8 and getting to work at 9.30.
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.880]   2012, I was still full-time.
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:38.080]   I didn't have the flexibility of consulting hours, so I'm pretty sure I had to be in by
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.080]   8.
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.080]   Really?
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.960]   Maybe this is a revisionist history.
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.800]   I remember waking up and...
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.120]   You were always awake first.
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.120]   I don't deny that.
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:55.560]   Yeah, but I remember waking up first and then after an hour of writing or commenting or
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.560]   doing something...
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.600]   Yeah, so 6 to 7, that would be your hour if I'm waking up at 7.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.080]   I remember working for an hour and then checking in and you'd still be sleeping.
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.080]   I'd be like, "La la la la la."
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.040]   I'd be twiddling my thumbs.
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.040]   I felt lonely.
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.560]   I was like, "I want you to wake up to spend time with me."
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.560]   I know.
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.640]   We've always had opposite schedules.
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:24.800]   So when you were going to bed at, I don't know, 10.30 to be able to wake up at 6, I
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.720]   was staying up until typically 12.30 to 1 a.m., sometimes 1.30.
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.960]   And so I've just always been a night owl.
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.280]   I've never been a natural morning person like you.
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.440]   So I guess the good thing about that is from an efficiency perspective, I could do a lot
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.520]   of work in the morning and then once I go to sleep, you can do a lot of work at night.
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.800]   And so if we're running a business or we're parents, we have more coverage and more productivity
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.800]   and health.
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:54.800]   Yeah.
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:00.040]   When our kids were babies in the very early months, we definitely utilized that in terms
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.520]   of getting through the night.
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.880]   We each had our night shift.
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:10.280]   If you remember those days when we didn't have an extra adult around to help us, we
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.600]   had to have our shifts.
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.320]   And so you'd take the first night shift and then I'd get us through the rest of the night.
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.320]   Right.
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.840]   So one of the bummers about the pandemic, besides not being able to see our loved ones
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.340]   as often, is the rise of loneliness.
[00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.440]   In my post in the show notes, you'll see this chart from the Washington Post and the American
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.660]   Time Use Survey by the BLS.
[00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:39.240]   And it shows since 2013, Americans 15 and older are spending nine hours more alone a
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.560]   week today.
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:46.720]   Americans also spending four to five hours less time a week with friends and companions.
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.960]   And then there's this other chart from the Financial Times.
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:55.120]   And it says that male and female Americans ages 15 to 33 are spending about 100 more
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.400]   minutes alone.
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.520]   That's 50% more alone time a day compared to in 2011.
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:08.520]   And loneliness really starts to tick up between the ages of 38 to 40 and doesn't stop until
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:09.800]   we die.
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:15.160]   And then finally, more women start spending time alone after age 60.
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:21.040]   And I understand the last bullet point because women have longer life expectancies than men.
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.600]   So if their partners die, they spend more time alone.
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.120]   What's also interesting though, is why?
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.680]   Why is there a huge uptick in loneliness starting around age 38 to 40?
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.080]   I'm 45, you're 42.
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.320]   And I don't think we're very lonely.
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.300]   I feel like we're often overwhelmed in parenthood.
[00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:47.840]   So the data does make me feel sad about the loneliness situation.
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:53.260]   Because people who are lonely are just, I mean, like life is not as fun or as interesting
[00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:54.760]   without someone to spend time with.
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:55.760]   Yeah, it's totally true.
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.720]   I know my mom and my dad are divorced.
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.080]   You know, they each live alone.
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.280]   And you know, there's times that my mom has told me, you know, you don't get it.
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.120]   You know, you don't know what it's like to live alone.
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.240]   And I feel for her.
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.520]   You know, there's thousands of people out there who live alone.
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.080]   And that's not easy.
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:19.860]   I would have a very hard time with that if I was by myself all the time.
[00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.660]   Maybe not thousands, maybe millions.
[00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:22.880]   Yeah, probably.
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:28.500]   But even as an introvert, I think you have a greater capacity to be alone and be okay
[00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.360]   with being alone than I do.
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.920]   Yes, I agree with that.
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:40.680]   However, I think there's a difference between being completely alone and having someone
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.160]   that you live with, but not socializing outside of your home.
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.160]   Right.
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.160]   Oh, I just realized something.
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:51.520]   So one of our issues is that since I left work in 2012, and you left in 2015, we're
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.120]   always at home, you more than me.
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.120]   So that's the funny thing.
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:00.360]   There's like this whole joke where like, I don't know, in Japan and Japanese culture,
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:05.800]   the wife will say don't come back until you go out for dinner and drinks and get the business
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:06.800]   done.
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:12.560]   And then in American culture, you know, guys will sometimes joke and say, wow, my wife
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.680]   wants me out of the house as much as possible.
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.200]   And she can't stand me being retired.
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.480]   And what are your thoughts on that?
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.720]   There definitely needs to be a healthy balance.
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.360]   And the pandemic made that really hard when we were all stuck inside.
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.800]   And we couldn't even go to parks at one point.
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.360]   It was it was crazy.
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:34.520]   So now that we have our freedom back, it's just about finding the right balance the right
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.520]   mix.
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.200]   How about finding a bigger home like a mega mansion?
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:47.160]   Well, I don't think that will help in terms of I don't know, when you have kids are going
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:52.080]   to find you no matter where you are, whether you're in, you know, 100 square feet or, you
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:56.120]   know, 10,000 square feet, they will, they will find.
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:57.120]   Okay.
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.680]   So let's talk about the solutions to loneliness.
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.520]   There's several solutions that I came up with.
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:07.000]   The one surprising solution is to have children later.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.120]   You know, as an older parent, one of my greatest regrets was focusing too much on making money
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.120]   and my career.
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:17.480]   However, I've come to realize we older parents can actually spend way more time with our
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:22.000]   children than if we had children earlier, because we had children earlier, we'd be working
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.120]   all day.
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.520]   And they'd be in daycare.
[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.200]   Right, right.
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:30.040]   And we couldn't homeschool our son for 18 months as we did during the pandemic.
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.080]   Well, not as well.
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:37.840]   And the second realization I have as a writer, and as an older dad is that since 2017, there's
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:41.320]   almost never been a moment of loneliness.
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:46.880]   I do feel lonely when our kids would rebuff me and my affection when I wanted to play
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:47.880]   with them.
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.400]   That was pretty hard.
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:55.960]   But I would say all of my free time can be sucked up by our children.
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:56.960]   If I wanted it to be.
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:03.560]   Yeah, I do feel that we have been fortunate that, you know, we've been able to stick together
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:07.800]   and have, you know, had the kids through the entire pandemic, our daughter was born right
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.080]   before it started.
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:17.480]   You know, to have our family unit together has been very, very helpful in terms of us
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:21.240]   not having to struggle with loneliness that much.
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.240]   Right.
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.960]   So one of the things that I was wondering was why is loneliness?
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.840]   Why does that curve really shoot up after age 40?
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.920]   And I realized why that is.
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:32.960]   So let's say you have your first child at 25.
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:36.480]   They will be potentially out of the house by the time you turn 43.
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:41.680]   But it's not like, you know, your kids through 18 are going to want to spend time with you.
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:47.360]   It's like something around age 12, 13, where they would rather spend time with their friends,
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.360]   right?
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:54.200]   So you take five years off of that, and bam, that is the reason why there's more loneliness
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:59.080]   because the kids are out of the house or wanting to spend more time with their friends once
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:01.800]   you're 38 to 40 years old.
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:09.160]   And so the solution, the solution to less loneliness after 40 is to simply have your
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.120]   first child later.
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:16.040]   So if you have your first child at age 35, so first, you're you're working hard, you're
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:22.200]   socializing, you're dating, you're meeting people and networking through your age 35,
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:25.520]   you're pretty, I would say less lonely.
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:30.440]   And then once you have a kid at 35, the earliest they'll be out of the house will be when you
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.440]   turn 53.
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:36.160]   And maybe the earliest you'll start feeling lonely because your kids don't want to spend
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:40.320]   time with you is age 48 to 50.
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.320]   That makes a lot of sense.
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:43.080]   What else are you thinking?
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:47.320]   Oh, well, I'm also thinking, but don't wait too long to have children because there are
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:51.160]   significant risks after about the age of 35.
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:52.160]   What else am I thinking?
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.160]   Hmm.
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.160]   Oh, yes.
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.320]   Solution to loneliness number two, retire later.
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:02.800]   So I have postulated that the ideal age to retire is not before 40.
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:06.200]   It's closer around 45, the age I am right now.
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:10.080]   And I first came up with this thesis five years ago at age 40, saying, look, I would
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:15.280]   kind of regret it leaving at 34, 35, because I left a lot of money on the table.
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:18.040]   I didn't make as many connections as I could have.
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:22.280]   Maybe I could have relocated to another office and had a lot more fun and be wealthier.
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:23.280]   Right.
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:24.400]   That's one of my regrets.
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:30.560]   But five years later, I still think 45 is like the optimal age, because it gives you
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:35.080]   20 plus years to save and invest aggressively.
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:38.120]   It gives you a lot of experience and wisdom.
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:43.480]   And at 45, I think a lot of us want to take things down a notch and spend more time doing
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.120]   other things.
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:52.540]   So when I left work in 2012 at age 34, I felt lonely a lot because not many people could
[00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:53.540]   come out to play.
[00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:56.920]   And people were just working and doing bigger and better things.
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:57.920]   I had to fight FOMO.
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:02.880]   I had to really try to make an effort to get people to meet me for lunch.
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:06.720]   And what ended up happening was I just started hanging out with more traditional retirees
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.480]   like my friend Richard.
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:13.480]   He's 67 now, but we would start hanging out and he was like 57 and I was 34.
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:15.520]   So there's a huge age difference.
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:20.960]   And that's why if you retire at 45, there will be more people your age with similar
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:23.560]   interests that you can hang out with.
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:29.040]   So when you retired at 35, did you feel lonely?
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:33.360]   Did you feel it was difficult to, you know, make friends and hang out with people your
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.360]   similar age?
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:38.200]   I don't have any vivid memories of being lonely.
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:44.760]   I just remember being able to breathe again because prior to when I left, I was just going
[00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:47.240]   through so much stress.
[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:52.560]   And so I used that time initially to just kind of take a breather.
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:58.800]   And then I got busy with freelancing and we also had the luxury to finally travel, you
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:04.840]   know, with the freedom of no strict schedules and we didn't have kids at the time.
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:11.880]   So we filled up our days with a lot of traveling and you and I spent a lot of time together
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:13.920]   just going out on hikes and things like that.
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:18.680]   So I don't remember being lonely because the days went really fast back then.
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:19.680]   That's fascinating.
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:23.280]   That's fascinating that you don't feel a moment of loneliness.
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:25.740]   Whereas when I first left, I did.
[00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:28.480]   And I guess when you left, it's because you had me.
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:31.600]   I had you but we also have personality differences, right?
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.880]   You're definitely more social than I am.
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:44.000]   So I didn't have a significant change in my lifestyle minus, you know, not having my day
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   job.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   Right.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   That's right.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   It's very interesting.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.600]   I'm just gonna chalk it up to me always being there for you in your time of need.
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:53.600]   You were.
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:54.600]   Thank you.
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:55.920]   Oh, you're welcome.
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:59.640]   So solution to loneliness number three, find an in-person hobby.
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:07.340]   This is not surprising at all, but it is absolutely one of the best ways to combat loneliness.
[00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:13.200]   For example, I've played league tennis my entire life since I was 12, 13 years.
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:18.040]   Great way to work on something like a skill, a tennis skill.
[00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:23.080]   And then you join a team, you battle it out, you trade messages in terms of strategy and
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.540]   what other people are doing.
[00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:26.240]   So to me, it was so much fun.
[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:30.320]   And now we're doing pickleball.
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:34.280]   And I brought you in and it seems like you've been able to meet some fun people as well.
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:35.480]   I have.
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:42.560]   And I've had the most fun with a group of retired school teachers.
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:46.640]   They're just so happy and they're always having so much fun out there.
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:54.420]   So yeah, you do tend to connect with older people when you have more free time during
[00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:57.180]   the weekday as an early retiree.
[00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:59.020]   And I think it's been great.
[00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:01.220]   It's been great to expand my network.
[00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:07.180]   Yeah, the one thing that I recommend not focusing on is online relationships.
[00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:08.580]   You know, it's better than nothing.
[00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:14.500]   But I think an online friendship is equal to no more than 5% of an offline friendship.
[00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:21.260]   So you could have 20 online friendships, but that maybe is equal to one good offline real
[00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:22.460]   relationship.
[00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:25.060]   There's really no substitute for in person relationships.
[00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:27.820]   All right, fourth solution to loneliness.
[00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:30.940]   Frankly, I think you got to add more value.
[00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:35.820]   The more value you add to society, the more people may want to spend time with you.
[00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:38.820]   You'll be invited to more parties, gatherings, events.
[00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:43.780]   And then from there, you'll grow your network and potentially find more companions with
[00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:45.220]   shared interests.
[00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:46.220]   What do you think?
[00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:48.260]   I think I agree with all of that.
[00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:52.980]   I shared a story in the post about playing pickleball with a woman named Shannon.
[00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:56.860]   Just random mom has a 13 year old daughter.
[00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:58.220]   And she's great player.
[00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:01.020]   And it was the first time we met and she asked what I did.
[00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:02.660]   And I told her I'm an author.
[00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:04.500]   And she asked about the title of my book.
[00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:06.940]   And I mentioned by this not that.
[00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:10.020]   And then she immediately said, I know that book.
[00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:12.500]   Other parents at my daughter's school were mentioning it.
[00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:14.100]   And I said, really?
[00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:16.100]   Are you sure you know my book?
[00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:17.300]   It's not called something else?
[00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:18.300]   Are you getting confused?
[00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:20.700]   He said, Oh, yeah, yeah, I know that book.
[00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:23.180]   Because it talks about education, marriage and divorce.
[00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:27.220]   And I was like, wow, that's a small world.
[00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:30.780]   And I'm always surprised when someone in the real world says they've heard of financial
[00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:35.980]   samurai or my book, because it's just it's kind of I separate the two.
[00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:41.380]   And so what I realized from that incidence is that the more value you can add, the more
[00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:43.900]   people will want to spend time with you.
[00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:49.020]   Shannon invited me over to his parents gathering to see if we can do like a book talk.
[00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:51.300]   And you know, I was flattered.
[00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:56.660]   I said, Oh, let me think about I'll get back to you because it takes a lot of effort.
[00:16:56.660 --> 00:17:02.420]   But again, if our daughter wants to go to Shannon's daughter's school one day, and if
[00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:07.900]   I did this book talk, and I met the administrators and 20 parents, surely something positive
[00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:09.380]   could come out of that.
[00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:12.500]   And I want to conclude by talking about the final solution to loneliness.
[00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:16.420]   You know, there are other solutions, volunteering, going to church, going to meetups.
[00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:22.220]   But the final solution really is to make a bigger effort.
[00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:27.260]   We know the data on how much more lonely we are, we can be more intentional to counteract
[00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.020]   the loneliness as a result.
[00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:33.140]   For example, since the start of the pandemic, we are spending at least three more hours
[00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:35.740]   a week by ourselves.
[00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:40.220]   If we have a problem with this, then we can intentionally plan for three more hours with
[00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:42.780]   friends and companions a week.
[00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:48.460]   You can maybe go on a couple lunches, you can reach out to your friends for a hike,
[00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:52.100]   or you can go to a sporting event, or we can do date nights, we really need to do more
[00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:53.100]   date nights.
[00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:55.260]   Yeah, it definitely takes making an effort.
[00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:56.820]   I totally agree with that one.
[00:17:56.820 --> 00:18:01.540]   You know, we went to a holiday party recently, which was really fun.
[00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:06.180]   And then a friend of mine reached out to me a couple weeks ago to arrange a coffee.
[00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:09.620]   And if you don't make the effort, then the opportunities just don't arise.
[00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:11.340]   So I really agree with that one.
[00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:12.340]   Yeah.
[00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:16.340]   And if you start telling people, you know, you're too busy, people are going to eventually
[00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:17.780]   end up stop asking you.
[00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:19.860]   Right, or they'll just go ask someone else.
[00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:25.060]   So as excited as I was that my friend asked me out to coffee, now it's my turn to find
[00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:28.020]   a time to get that on the schedule with her.
[00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:30.500]   Get it on the schedule, reciprocate, take action.
[00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:34.660]   You know, recently, I was super impressed with a fellow parent who met me and my son
[00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:38.140]   at a San Francisco playground at 2.45pm.
[00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:42.380]   His son and my son, they used to go to preschool, really good friends.
[00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:46.580]   But he and his son were in the East Bay an hour away, and they've been out and about
[00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:48.340]   since 9am.
[00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:50.140]   And I didn't know that at all.
[00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:53.300]   He was just like, during the text message, he was like, "Oh, yeah, we'll try to make
[00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:54.300]   it.
[00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:55.300]   We'll keep you updated."
[00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:59.540]   But what turns out happening was that he got on the BART subway system, rode his bike to
[00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:02.900]   the playground, like 10 minutes from the subway system, and met up.
[00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:05.220]   This was after like being out for six hours.
[00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:08.220]   That's a long time with a four-year-old.
[00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:10.140]   Yeah, with a four, four and a half-year-old.
[00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:13.580]   I was like, "Damn, that is huge effort.
[00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:14.580]   Props to you.
[00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:15.740]   I'm going to make it up to you.
[00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:17.380]   We're going to do something fun together."
[00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:20.980]   We had some great conversations about being a dad and work-life balance.
[00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:25.940]   And the thing is, he made an effort also because his wife was on a business trip.
[00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:30.500]   So like anything, good things take a lot of effort.
[00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:36.540]   So I don't believe that if we're lonely, we're always going to be lonely or feel lonely.
[00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:38.620]   We need to make an effort.
[00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:43.820]   And one of the comments, actually, several commenters mentioned something very interesting,
[00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:45.940]   and I didn't really think about it.
[00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:53.180]   These commenters believe that there is a correlation with emotional intelligence and loneliness.
[00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:58.500]   And it sounds a little harsh, but the commenters were saying, "The lower your emotional intelligence,
[00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:00.100]   the higher your loneliness."
[00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:01.780]   What are your thoughts?
[00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:03.100]   I could understand that.
[00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:05.220]   I could see that.
[00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:13.060]   Because it does take effort to be thoughtful, to reach out, to gift, to invite, and to plan.
[00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:16.380]   Yeah, and friendships are built on trust as well.
[00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:22.140]   And if you suffer from a lack of emotional intelligence, you're probably going to have
[00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:25.980]   difficulties in building trust with someone and vice versa.
[00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:28.980]   So I think that's a valid point.
[00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:29.980]   Right.
[00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:36.480]   Well, in conclusion, I do believe the loneliness epidemic should worry us all, especially those
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:39.540]   of us who have kids.
[00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:46.740]   Loneliness can lead to anger, hate, attacks, depression.
[00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:50.940]   If you look at the mass shootings and the profiles of the people who conducted these
[00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:54.420]   atrocities, it seems like they were lonely.
[00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:57.900]   Like nobody paid enough attention to them.
[00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:00.320]   Nobody gave them enough love.
[00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:05.420]   And as a parent now, I feel really disheartened by that.
[00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:10.700]   And it makes me really want to spend more time with my children and to try to be more
[00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:12.140]   empathetic.
[00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:15.360]   So hopefully we can all be more patient and loving to one another.
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:18.420]   We never know what's going on behind closed doors.
[00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:19.420]   Life is difficult.
[00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:25.180]   The pandemic has made life difficult for so many and we need to have more kindness and
[00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:26.180]   empathy.
[00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:31.060]   I know firsthand experience, it can be very hard when people are attacking you.
[00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:35.860]   This is one of the downsides of running Financial Samurai and recording this podcast.
[00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:41.480]   No matter how much you don't want to offend anybody, someone seems to always be offended.
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:46.180]   And a lot of times there is a projection of the way the person feels because there's something
[00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:47.780]   going on.
[00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:51.540]   And in the past, I would be much more defensive, much more combative.
[00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:58.160]   But now as a father, I just try to think about what is going on and to either show kindness
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:21:59.780]   or just move on.
[00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:03.740]   If you enjoyed this episode, we'd love a positive five star review.
