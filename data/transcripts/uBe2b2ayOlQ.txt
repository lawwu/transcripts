[00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:05.900]   So I recently heard a term that I really liked on the Chris Williamson podcast.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.100]   The term he used was productivity rain dance.
[00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.100]   So I think this idea actually gets at something critical,
[00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.900]   a critical concept about work and productivity and technology.
[00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.800]   It's a concept that I think is exploring because it might explain
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.200]   some of both your frustrations and confusions
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.500]   about trying to produce stuff that matters.
[00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.500]   So what we'll do is I'm going to load up the clip.
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.800]   So we'll hear Chris actually talking about it himself.
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.700]   Then we'll get into a little more detail what he's talking about,
[00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:35.400]   why I think it's a problem,
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.200]   and then give some advice for how to get around it.
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.700]   All right, so let's start with the clip.
[00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.000]   This comes from, I think he was interviewing,
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.800]   Chris Williamson was interviewing Sahil Bloom,
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.500]   but the person talking here in the clip is Chris himself.
[00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.500]   So let's load up that audio.
[00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.800]   Look, I come from a productivity background.
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.500]   When I first started the show, I was chatting shit about
[00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.900]   Pomodoro timers and Notion external brains
[00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.800]   and Ebbinghaus forgetting curves and all of that.
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.800]   I've been through the ringer, which is why I'm allowed to say it.
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.200]   And you realize after a while
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.400]   that it ends up being this weird superstitious rain dance you're doing,
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.300]   this sort of odd sort of productivity rain dance
[00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.800]   in the desperate hope that later that day
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.200]   you're going to get something done.
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.100]   And some of that stuff does really help.
[00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.900]   And you kind of need to go through this process of,
[00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.300]   "Ah, it wasn't the 15 push-ups before I do my calls.
[00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.200]   Oh, it wasn't, it was this thing."
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.300]   That's the highest point of learning.
[00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.200]   All right, so that's the clip I wanted to point out there.
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.600]   That studio, I've been there, Jesse.
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.800]   That's one of the studios Chris uses in Austin.
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.300]   I did a show last spring.
[00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.400]   It has the two weird fluorescent lights
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.300]   that look like they're coming out of you.
[00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.600]   So I love that idea, this notion of productivity rain dance.
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.700]   So I started looking into it.
[00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.100]   Chris has talked about it before.
[00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.500]   So then I found this post,
[00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.700]   which I'll load up on the screen here
[00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.100]   for people who are watching instead of just listening.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.200]   This post is from last summer.
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.900]   And he elaborates more on this idea.
[00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.200]   I'm going to read some from this post
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.800]   because I think it's going to help us get closer
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.100]   to what the key idea is here.
[00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.500]   So in this post, Chris says,
[00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.000]   "During my interview review, I asked myself two new questions.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.300]   What do I do that I think is productive but isn't?
[00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.600]   What do I do that I don't think is productive but actually is?
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.600]   These were surprisingly easy to work out.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.100]   Sitting at my desk when I'm not working,
[00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.700]   being on calls with no actual objective,
[00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.600]   keeping Slack notifications at zero,
[00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.100]   sitting on email trying to get the unread number down,
[00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.400]   saying yes to a random dinner
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.800]   when someone is coming through town,
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.200]   organizing meetups with friends from different social groups,
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.500]   walking around without anything in my ears,
[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.600]   reading, visiting new places.
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.500]   After six months of reflecting on my answers,
[00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.400]   I realized I had a fundamental oversight.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.800]   I hadn't been properly linking inputs to outcomes.
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.000]   I had basically created a productivity rain dance."
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.700]   All right, I think this elaboration is useful
[00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.400]   because if we think about the various examples
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.600]   that Chris gave here talking about these rain dances,
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.600]   they seem sort of different, right?
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.000]   We had on one hand him talking about things
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.400]   like external brains or Ebenhaus forgetting curves,
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.300]   these sort of overly wrought productivity systems
[00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.600]   or tools you're trying to build.
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.400]   But here he's also talking about things
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.200]   like just being in his email inbox too long
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.800]   or like trying to get the Slacks all cleared out
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.900]   or just sitting at his desk like sort of acting,
[00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.600]   like playing at working because it sort of feels productive.
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.700]   He is somehow unifying all of that
[00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.600]   under the same term of productivity rain dance.
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.100]   And the way he does it and the way I want to focus on here
[00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.600]   is by saying what unifies all those examples
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.900]   is focusing on input instead of output.
[00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.600]   So when you focus on input,
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.400]   you're focusing on activity,
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.700]   you're focusing on the potential for future activity.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.600]   So sitting at your desk checking email,
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.800]   you're doing something.
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.500]   The productivity, I'm putting lots of inputs
[00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.300]   into my productivity equation, that must be good.
[00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.500]   When you're doing something
[00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.500]   like building a complicated productivity system,
[00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:01.800]   again, this is like inputs.
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.300]   I'm working on my productivity function.
[00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.000]   I'm building up my opportunities
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   for finding information or getting things done.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.700]   But what you're not looking at is the output.
[00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.500]   What am I actually producing that matters?
[00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.700]   And am I producing enough of it?
[00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.300]   So when you look around the modern office environment
[00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.500]   and see everyone frantically answering emails
[00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.300]   as they jump on and off Zoom meetings
[00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.300]   or watch the solo entrepreneur lose a morning
[00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.600]   to optimizing their chat GPT-powered personalized assistant,
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.700]   you're observing rain dances.
[00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.000]   Everyone's busy, but no one is asking
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.900]   if all these gyrations are actually opening the clouds.
[00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:45.900]   So the danger with rain dances is that they are easier
[00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.600]   than the actual work of producing stuff.
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.700]   It's easier to sit at your desk and jump on calls
[00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.600]   or answer emails than it is to actually do something hard.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.700]   It's easier to work on your chat GPT-powered assistant.
[00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:01.300]   It's kind of fun.
[00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.000]   You're watching YouTube videos and scripting things together.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   That's easier than actually writing the thing
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.500]   that the assistant was going to help you with.
[00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.300]   And because it's easier, we tend to gravitate towards that.
[00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.800]   We want to spend much more time on it.
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.700]   We're going to gravitate towards what's easier
[00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.400]   versus what's harder if we're not differentiating
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.600]   between inputs and outputs.
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.900]   And soon you get yourself to a point where you're super busy,
[00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.600]   but very little is actually getting done.
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.100]   Here's a quote from William Sim on this.
[00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.900]   "Obsessing over process while being detached from outcomes
[00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.800]   gives you all the pain of hard work
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.200]   with none of the actual results."
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.900]   So this is what a productivity rain dance is.
[00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.000]   It's when you focus on inputs and ignore outputs.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.800]   And the reason why they're dangerous
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.500]   is that they're more fun and satisfying
[00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.100]   or easy to get started with in the moment
[00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:49.200]   than the actual hard work.
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.700]   And so paradoxically, the stuff you produce gets worse.
[00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.900]   So what is the right response to this?
[00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.000]   Because I think a lot of people
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.500]   feel the frustration of their productivity rain dances
[00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.700]   without realizing what that frustration is coming from.
[00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.300]   And there's two responses that I think are natural
[00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.500]   that I both think are flawed.
[00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.500]   We hear these often, though,
[00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.100]   in sort of online discussions of productivity culture.
[00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.500]   The first response is to just demonize work itself.
[00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.900]   Like, I don't know, I'm doing stuff all the time.
[00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.000]   I'm feeling exhausted.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.800]   Not much is being produced.
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.500]   Maybe the problem is like work itself is kind of meaningless.
[00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:24.900]   It's constructed.
[00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.900]   It's like a mirage of late-stage capitalism.
[00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.200]   It's all just hustle culture.
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.000]   So you could just try to demonize work itself
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.400]   and lean into some sort of like quiet quitting type mentality.
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.700]   But this is not going to solve your problem.
[00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.200]   Just doing your work worse
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.100]   or just doing overall a lot less work
[00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.000]   is going to just get you into other types of problems.
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.600]   Your business is going to falter.
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.400]   Your boss is going to move on from you.
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.500]   The other common response to this is to say,
[00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:51.300]   ah, the problem here is just thinking about productivity itself.
[00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.800]   So let's just get rid of all attempts to organize my efforts.
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:54.400]   That's the problem.
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.100]   But this becomes a problem, too,
[00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.700]   because if you have no attempts to organize your efforts,
[00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.500]   other people organize them for you.
[00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:04.200]   Your life will just become this exhausted slurry
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.600]   of answering other people's requests
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.200]   and trying to make other people's lives easier.
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.800]   So we still need some organization.
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.000]   So what is the right response
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.200]   to the productivity rain dance phenomenon?
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.800]   I think it is, as Williamson suggests,
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.400]   to turn your attention from inputs to outputs.
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:24.000]   To identify the most valuable thing you do in your job
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.400]   and then figure out
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.200]   what helps you do that better.
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.000]   And this should be what matters.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.400]   Above all else, this should be where your focus is.
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.600]   Now, here's the thing.
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.900]   The answers to these questions,
[00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:37.600]   like what really matters
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   and what is actually helping me do that thing better,
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.600]   you know, at a higher level of quality and output,
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.200]   the answers to those questions aren't necessarily simple.
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.600]   But they're also different.
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.400]   The things you come up here are different
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.200]   than what productivity rain dances will produce.
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.400]   They're different because they're not symbolic.
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:57.800]   They're different because they're not
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.400]   busyness for the sake of busyness.
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.600]   They're instead focused on clear, measurable goals
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:04.700]   of producing more results that matter.
[00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:07.400]   So when you start focusing on outputs,
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:12.000]   you begin to build an approach to productivity
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.200]   that just works and it's not exciting
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:19.100]   and it's hard and it's simple
[00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:20.900]   and it's probably, you know,
[00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.500]   there's only so much YouTube content you could get out of it,
[00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.200]   but it's the stuff that actually works.
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:26.100]   Hey, it's Cal.
[00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.200]   I wanted to interrupt briefly to say that
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.800]   if you're enjoying this video,
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.100]   then you need to check out my new book,
[00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:33.900]   Slow Productivity,
[00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:37.600]   The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout.
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.600]   This is like the Bible for most of the ideas
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:43.200]   we talk about here in these videos.
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:48.500]   You can get a free excerpt at calnewport.com/slow.
[00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.200]   I know you're going to like it.
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.300]   Check it out.
[00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:52.600]   Now, let's get back to the video.
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.500]   So let me give you a couple of specific examples here.
[00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.200]   What are the types of less flashy,
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.800]   get-it-done type things that show up
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:08:59.600]   when you start asking
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.800]   what actually gets the important stuff done?
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.500]   You find things like work quotas.
[00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:07.800]   All right, for each of these type of things
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.500]   I am expected to do in my job,
[00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:12.000]   I have a quota on how many I do at the same time.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:12.800]   Why?
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.700]   Because if I have too many things going on,
[00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:15.900]   I get overloaded.
[00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:16.700]   If I get overloaded,
[00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:18.600]   I can't do the hard stuff well.
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.000]   I want to do the hard stuff well,
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   so I only take on one project of this at a time.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.400]   I only do this many committees at a time.
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.000]   I only do this many pay-per-views at a time.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.200]   It's not exciting.
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.900]   There's no AI involved.
[00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:31.400]   There's no cool notebook and a new pen involved,
[00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:32.300]   but it works.
[00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:35.400]   Separating active versus waiting projects.
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.200]   This also works.
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.300]   A big concept from my book Slow Productivity.
[00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:40.800]   Here's the things you have to do.
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.400]   Just look at the first few
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:43.800]   and say I'm actively working on these
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.700]   and everything else is in a waiting state.
[00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:46.600]   And if you ask me about it,
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:47.700]   I'll say it's in a waiting state
[00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:49.300]   and I'll tell you as soon as it gets to active.
[00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:50.800]   But as long as it's in a waiting state,
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.000]   I'm not doing meetings or emails or calls about it.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.100]   This prevents the totality of the things
[00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:57.100]   that you have to do
[00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:59.300]   generating concurrent administrative overhead.
[00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:00.800]   Now suddenly you can spend more time
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:01.900]   working on the stuff that matters.
[00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:03.700]   Again, this is not an exciting system.
[00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:05.100]   I can't build a software tool
[00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:07.700]   that's going to make this way simple for you.
[00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:10.300]   This is just a notation in your notebook.
[00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:10.900]   This is active.
[00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:11.500]   This is waiting.
[00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:13.000]   You can keep track of this even in your head,
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.600]   but it works, right?
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:15.800]   Rubber to the road works.
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.900]   Office hours work.
[00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:22.400]   I can't be chiming in on a dozen
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.700]   ongoing back-and-forth ad hoc conversations
[00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:25.300]   throughout the day
[00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:27.400]   because then I can't get the important stuff done.
[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.000]   So I have daily office hours.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.200]   That's where I try to deflect more
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.300]   of my back-and-forth interaction.
[00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:34.100]   Come to my office hours.
[00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:34.600]   We'll talk about it.
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:35.400]   It'll take five minutes.
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.400]   And the rest of my day,
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.300]   I don't have to be checking this inbox.
[00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:41.000]   Again, I don't need a special tool for office hours.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.600]   It's just a declaration.
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.500]   It's like when Michael Scott in "The Office"
[00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:46.900]   just said, "I declare bankruptcy."
[00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:48.300]   It really is that simple,
[00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:49.500]   but it works.
[00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.900]   Another type of idea that comes here,
[00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:52.700]   time block planning.
[00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:53.500]   It's not sexy.
[00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:54.600]   You can do it on a piece of paper.
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.100]   I sell a notebook for doing this.
[00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:58.200]   It's the oldest of technologies.
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.300]   You're drawing boxes on paper.
[00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.300]   But it forces you to be intentional about your time.
[00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:05.000]   What do I want to do today?
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   When am I going to do it?
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   And if things don't fit,
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.800]   you have to confront that productivity dragon
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.400]   and say, "There's a problem here we need to fix."
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.000]   Again, not exciting, but it works.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.500]   Perhaps the most basic thing here,
[00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:16.500]   the idea that comes from my sort of original book
[00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:17.700]   on all of this deep work,
[00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:20.900]   realize that deep work is different than shallow work.
[00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:22.200]   And when you're working on deep work,
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:24.100]   the stuff that's cognitively demanding that matters,
[00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.800]   don't context switch during it.
[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.500]   You have to protect that time and say,
[00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:29.500]   "I don't also check my email during that time.
[00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:32.200]   I don't also have Slack open during that time.
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:34.400]   I realize if I give this work my full attention,
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.500]   it'll be 2x better
[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:37.900]   than if I'm sort of context switching back and forth."
[00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:40.500]   Like this, that's not a thing you can get a cool app for.
[00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:44.700]   There is no like back-end reasoning model integration
[00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:45.500]   with Claude.
[00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:48.000]   It's just a simple mindset.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.500]   But these are the type of things that work
[00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:52.500]   when you get away from productivity rain dances
[00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:53.000]   and say,
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.400]   "What moves the needle on the output?"
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.600]   Now the people who sell tools
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.800]   or have a lot of fancy YouTube videos
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.000]   about this advice online,
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.300]   they like productivity rain dances
[00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:04.300]   because they're fun.
[00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:05.800]   You get to wear fancy costumes
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.300]   and jump around and chant things
[00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:08.400]   and it's interesting to watch
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.200]   and it's much more interesting to watch than
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:14.400]   the actual pretty boring efforts
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.600]   that go into trying to do things well.
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:20.000]   But for you who cares about doing things well,
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.400]   this is what matters.
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:24.600]   So I wrote an essay about this recently.
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:25.500]   It's on my newsletter.
[00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:26.600]   If you don't subscribe to my newsletter,
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:28.000]   you can do so at calnewport.com.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.700]   Here is how I ended that essay.
[00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:33.700]   "Productivity rain dances can be satisfying.
[00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:35.700]   They make you feel like you're doing your part
[00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:37.200]   to support a rich harvest,
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:39.400]   all while providing endless details
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:40.500]   and rituals to adjust,
[00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:42.200]   giving you a sense of being hard at work
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:43.600]   without requiring you to do anything
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:44.700]   actually challenging.
[00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:46.900]   At the same time, however,
[00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:49.100]   the farmers who are most likely to succeed
[00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:51.300]   are those who are instead down among their crops,
[00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:52.500]   sweat on their brow,
[00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.100]   tilling their fields."
[00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:56.900]   So it's not the fun thing to do,
[00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:58.000]   but it's the hard things
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.500]   that actually produce the good work.
[00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:01.300]   So there we go.
[00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:02.600]   Congratulations, Chris Williamson.
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:03.500]   I like that term.
[00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:04.600]   Productivity rain dances.
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:05.400]   We should use that more.
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.100]   The thing that like I was struggling with
[00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:10.200]   and then when I found
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.100]   more of his writing on it,
[00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:13.400]   it made more sense to me,
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:15.100]   was unifying
[00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:18.200]   sort of productivity prong culture
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:19.600]   where you're building these elaborate
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.900]   productivity systems
[00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:23.500]   with busy work.
[00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:24.900]   Like being in your inbox all the time.
[00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:26.500]   Where it's not about a fancy system,
[00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:27.900]   but you're just being busy.
[00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:30.700]   And the idea that that's all the same thing
[00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:32.300]   is just focusing on inputs
[00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:33.900]   as opposed to like what's actually being produced.
[00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:35.400]   Because once you focus on what's being produced,
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:36.900]   you realize both that
[00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:40.400]   the super fancy AI-powered productivity system
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:41.400]   isn't moving the needle,
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:42.500]   takes a lot of time,
[00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:44.200]   but it's not making you produce more work, really.
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:45.900]   And also being in your inbox all the time
[00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:47.400]   is not making you produce more work either.
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:49.200]   Like they're both,
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.400]   output is not affected by them.
[00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.100]   When you focus on the output,
[00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:53.600]   but
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.600]   you know, it's not as fun,
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.900]   but like that's how stuff gets done.
[00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:01.200]   That would be a good book, I guess.
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:01.700]   Just like
[00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:03.000]   do work.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.900]   So for you it would be writing, right?
[00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:06.800]   Yeah, you got to write.
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:07.200]   Yeah.
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:07.900]   Yeah.
[00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:10.100]   And there's like stuff that you want to have the right tools.
[00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:12.100]   You know, time-blocking matters
[00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:13.400]   like you're doing at the right time.
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:14.300]   Maybe you have a little ritual
[00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:16.000]   to help switch your mindset over to it.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.700]   But you do that thinking once,
[00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:19.600]   it's not that exciting
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:20.800]   and then it's just doing it.
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:22.400]   Right. I think that gym,
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:23.900]   like exercising is the same way.
[00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:24.800]   Like you need to
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:26.900]   have tools.
[00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:28.900]   You need to learn like what is
[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:29.900]   my workout?
[00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:31.100]   Like why is this going to work?
[00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:32.400]   Like you do need information.
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.500]   You can't just like randomly go after it.
[00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.400]   But then once you have the information,
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:37.500]   it's not that interesting.
[00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:39.200]   It's just a matter of like going to the gym
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.600]   and doing the workout and tracking it
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:41.700]   and doing proper progressions.
[00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:42.600]   Like it's actually in the end,
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:43.400]   it's the work that matters,
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:44.300]   not the information.
[00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:46.600]   So productivity rain dances,
[00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:48.000]   we should avoid them.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.300]   We got some good questions coming up.
[00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:50.900]   But first,
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:52.900]   let's hear from one of our sponsors.
[00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:56.900]   I want to talk about the Uplift Desk.
[00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:59.000]   This is a topic that is
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.400]   near and dear to my current state.
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:01.500]   As listeners know,
[00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:02.300]   I'm
[00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:05.000]   rehabbing from an abdominal injury
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:05.900]   I had in the fall.
[00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:07.700]   I ended up having to spend about two months
[00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:10.900]   kind of barely using my abs or my back.
[00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:13.100]   And now in the new year,
[00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:14.100]   my, you know,
[00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:16.100]   back is making me pay the price.
[00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:17.800]   Like you can't just stop using me for two months.
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:19.300]   So I'm doing all sorts of PT,
[00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:20.800]   all sorts of training,
[00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:23.500]   and one of the things you realize right away
[00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:25.200]   when you're recovering from something like this
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.500]   is that little things about your posture matter.
[00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:30.800]   How you hold yourself matters.
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.100]   Are you slumped a little bit?
[00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:33.300]   Are you back more?
[00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:36.800]   Are you on your heels versus your midsole
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.800]   in terms of what muscle supporting want?
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:41.000]   It really makes a difference.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.100]   And where is the place where we're sitting
[00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:46.700]   or our posture is probably most
[00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:48.400]   stably impacting us?
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:49.400]   It's going to be when we work.
[00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:53.100]   This is why a tool like the Uplift Desk
[00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:54.500]   makes so much sense
[00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:56.700]   because it's at the forefront of ergonomic solutions.
[00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:58.600]   It helps you promote better posture and health
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:15:59.700]   through adjustable standing desks
[00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:01.400]   that are designed to help you live
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:03.100]   a healthier lifestyle.
[00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:04.600]   They also have all kinds of accessories
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.400]   to help keep you moving throughout your day.
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.300]   So for example,
[00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:10.000]   we got the,
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.900]   it's like a wobble stool
[00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:14.300]   where you can sit on this thing,
[00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:15.300]   but it moves.
[00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:16.400]   So you could be moving
[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:18.800]   and working your core and supporting yourself,
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:19.900]   but it's not going to fall over,
[00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:21.900]   but it moves through like a good range of motion.
[00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:24.600]   I also got the standing pad.
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:26.200]   So if you're working out the Uplift Desk
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:27.700]   or it's in general like standing,
[00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:29.200]   so you're kind of giving your body
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:31.800]   different varieties of posture.
[00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:33.100]   It's more comfortable
[00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:34.600]   than just standing on the hard floor.
[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:35.900]   So it's not just the Uplift Desk.
[00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:37.300]   It's the whole line of products
[00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:38.800]   that surround healthy posture
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:40.000]   and healthy ergonomics.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   So I'm fans of what they're doing.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   I now appreciate posture quite a bit.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.800]   So the Uplift Desk in particular
[00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:50.900]   this is cool.
[00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:53.100]   200,000 configurations.
[00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:56.200]   So you can tailor your workspace perfectly
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.400]   to your style and needs.
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:58.300]   They also look great.
[00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:00.200]   Talked about this last time
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:02.400]   that the form factor is like very compact
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:02.900]   and small enough.
[00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:03.900]   It's like a good-looking desk
[00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:05.500]   and the lifts are sort of hidden
[00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:08.400]   in the legs in a way
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.200]   that it's like not some giant contraption
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:11.700]   that you have to like turn a giant crank on.
[00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:12.800]   Like they look really nice as well.
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:13.800]   Anyways,
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:15.300]   care about your posture.
[00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:17.100]   You'll learn the hard way
[00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:18.100]   otherwise that you should have.
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:20.300]   So make this year yours
[00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:23.600]   by going to upliftdesk.com/deep
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:24.800]   and use the code DEEP

[00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:53.700]   So Jesse, I talked to some of those guys over there
[00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:54.900]   prepping for this ad.
[00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:56.300]   They're really into this mission.
[00:17:56.300 --> 00:18:00.000]   Like they care about ergonomics.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:00.500]   Yeah.
[00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:00.900]   Yeah.
[00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:03.600]   You cannot work at that company
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:05.800]   and be like completely slunched over
[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:07.700]   in like a metal folding chair at your desk.
[00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:08.800]   Like it's not going to work out.
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:11.000]   They'd run you right out of there.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.700]   I also want to talk about our friends at My Body Tutor.
[00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:17.500]   Speaking of trying to do what your body needs,
[00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:18.700]   My Body Tutor,
[00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:21.200]   I believe is the way if you want to get fitter,
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.100]   it's the thing to do.
[00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:23.300]   Their model,
[00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:24.300]   that's what I love about it,
[00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:26.900]   is they connect you to a coach
[00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:29.700]   that holds you accountable daily.
[00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:31.000]   So the coach helps you figure out
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.100]   like what are your goals?
[00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:33.300]   Let's get you a workout routine
[00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:34.700]   that works with what you have available.
[00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:36.700]   Let's talk about your eating and health requirements.
[00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:39.200]   Like let's try to make a plan that makes sense.
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.200]   But you check in using their app every day
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.600]   with a dedicated coach.
[00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:44.400]   It's the accountability here that matters.
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.500]   The information is great.
[00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.400]   They can customize the information
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.600]   to like what's going on in your life.
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:49.200]   That's great.
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:51.900]   But it's the accountability of checking in every day
[00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:54.300]   that gets you to actually stick with the plan.
[00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:56.300]   And because it's delivered online,
[00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:58.600]   it's going to be significantly cheaper
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:18:59.300]   than having,
[00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:00.000]   you know,
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   a trainer in person,
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.600]   a nutritionist in person.
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:05.800]   So I just think it's a fantastic idea
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:08.500]   and it works really well.
[00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:10.600]   If you're serious about getting fit,
[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:13.600]   Adam will give Deep Questions listeners.
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:14.900]   Did I just say who Adam was?
[00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:15.500]   Adam Gilbert.
[00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:17.400]   I should mention I know the founder
[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:18.600]   of My Body Tutor.
[00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:19.400]   I've known him forever.
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:20.900]   Great company.
[00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:22.800]   Adam, the founder,
[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:23.400]   great guy,
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:26.000]   is giving Deep Questions listeners $50 off
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:26.700]   their first month.
[00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:28.400]   If you just mentioned this podcast
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.800]   when you join.
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:31.300]   They're also,
[00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:33.100]   that's the same guys who are doing the done daily
[00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:34.100]   we've been talking about.
[00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:35.800]   So like the accountability coaching
[00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:36.600]   for like getting your,
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:38.300]   being productive about the work that matters.
[00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:40.600]   I'll throw that in as like a bonus ad.
[00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:42.300]   Check that out at donedaily.com.
[00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:43.300]   But My Body Tutor,
[00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:44.700]   if you want to get your body in shape,
[00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:46.200]   go to mybodytutor.com
[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.500]   T-U-T-O-R.
[00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:48.600]   Mention Deep Questions
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:50.100]   and Adam will give you $50 off.
[00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:51.400]   All right, Jesse.
[00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:52.800]   Let's get started with the questions.
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:56.400]   First question is from Lindsay.
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:59.000]   I currently use a Trello column
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.700]   for items to discuss in meetings
[00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:03.000]   and block time afterwards to process it.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   During a meeting,
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.400]   do you write notes of topics
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:06.600]   to remember to say
[00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:08.100]   or do you have a Trello card open?
[00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:09.800]   All right, it's a good question.
[00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:12.400]   Let's just briefly define the two things
[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:13.700]   that Lindsay mentioned.
[00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:16.600]   So one is the items to discuss Trello column.
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:18.100]   I use Trello boards
[00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:19.800]   to organize my obligations,
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:20.900]   to organize tasks.
[00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:22.200]   I have one board per role
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.900]   and then I have columns per each role
[00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:25.500]   for different types of statuses
[00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:26.300]   for these tasks.
[00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:27.800]   And one of the key statuses is like
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:28.600]   to discuss.
[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:31.500]   To discuss next time I meet this person.
[00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:33.700]   To discuss next time we have this standing meeting.
[00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:35.400]   The other thing she's talking about
[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:36.800]   is the post-meeting processing block.
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:38.500]   Another thing I'm a big believer in.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.300]   You need 15 minutes on your calendar.
[00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:42.300]   So it's protected.
[00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:43.400]   You schedule a meeting,
[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:45.100]   you schedule 15 minutes later
[00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:46.400]   than the actual meeting time.
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:49.400]   And that extra 15 minutes is for processing
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:50.600]   everything that came out of the meeting.
[00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:52.400]   So you can close those loops right then.
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:53.500]   The worst thing you can do
[00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:55.000]   is come out of a meeting
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.100]   with a dozen open loops
[00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:57.200]   that were introduced in that meeting
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:59.200]   and go right into an unrelated new meeting.
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:01.000]   That's going to be a cognitive pile-up.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:01.800]   That's going to be pain.
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:03.900]   All right, so to answer your question, Lindsay,
[00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:06.300]   if the culture of the meeting
[00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:08.100]   is one where people are on laptops,
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:09.700]   then I'll work right with the Trello board.
[00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:11.700]   As you say, it's much easier.
[00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:12.600]   Like, if things come up,
[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:13.700]   I want to just put them
[00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:16.600]   directly into a card,
[00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:18.200]   onto the right board, into the right column.
[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:19.100]   So they're just there.
[00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:20.900]   I also want to edit the things that are already there.
[00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:21.600]   As you mentioned,
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:23.900]   if there's something to discuss in this meeting
[00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:25.700]   on my Trello board and we discuss it,
[00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:26.900]   I want to take it off right then.
[00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:30.000]   If there is not a culture of being on your laptop,
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.500]   that's when you use the post-meeting processing block
[00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:34.100]   to immediately take care of all of this.
[00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:35.800]   So you can take notes with paper.
[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:37.200]   And then when you get to that
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:39.000]   end of the meeting processing block,
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.700]   you go through and update your Trello.
[00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:41.900]   You send off the messages.
[00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:44.200]   You put the waiting to hear backs for those messages.
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:45.900]   But you really, one way or the other,
[00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:46.600]   here's your goal.
[00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:47.900]   You want to come out of that
[00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:50.100]   meeting and post-meeting block,
[00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:51.800]   that sort of contiguous block of time,
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:53.900]   with nothing open in your head.
[00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:56.600]   No new open loop generated by that meeting
[00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:58.200]   that is not being processed.
[00:21:58.200 --> 00:21:59.400]   You want to make sure
[00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:01.400]   that the meeting is not just discussing
[00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.000]   with other people a given topic,
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.800]   but you're processing everything that was discussed
[00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:07.600]   to the point where you don't have to keep
[00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:08.800]   anything open in your head.
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:11.300]   So however you need to do that,
[00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:13.900]   that really should be your goal.
[00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:16.200]   All right, who do we got next?
[00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:18.400]   Next question is from Jennifer.
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:21.400]   To what standard are various AI technologies
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:23.200]   being evaluated for current performance
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:24.800]   and future potential?
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:27.700]   How could a layman, not a computer scientist,
[00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:30.900]   test the veracity of the claims of an AI system
[00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:32.000]   or its potential?
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.300]   My theory on this is that
[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:37.100]   you don't need to be testing the veracity
[00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:39.800]   or really paying that much attention yet
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:42.100]   to claims about AI.
[00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:44.500]   And here's why I say this,
[00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:46.200]   and this is a claim that I think is more generally
[00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:47.400]   about technology tools.
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:51.900]   When a technology tool finds a killer app,
[00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:53.800]   you'll find out about it.
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:56.300]   It will show up in your life.
[00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:57.800]   Everyone will be using it
[00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:59.400]   for a way that has obvious value.
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:01.200]   You will see an obvious value in your life.
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:03.200]   It will come into wherever you're doing your work
[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:05.100]   and then that will now be a part of your life.
[00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:07.900]   You don't have to go out and keep up with it.
[00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:09.300]   Let me give you some examples of this.
[00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:10.200]   Email.
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:13.800]   No one in the late 1980s
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:15.400]   was going around being like,
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.300]   "Look, computer networks are becoming a bigger thing.
[00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:20.700]   We're going to be able to do probably
[00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:23.600]   low-cost, low-friction digital communication
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:24.200]   using these networks."
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:27.000]   You really need to keep up with what might happen.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.900]   You really need to keep up with the advances
[00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:30.000]   and the technologies
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.800]   and the way this technology might change your work.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.200]   There was no need to do that.
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:35.100]   What just happened is,
[00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:37.600]   once that technology hit the right elements,
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:39.700]   it just starts showing up in offices.
[00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:41.300]   They're like, "Oh, by the way, we're using email now
[00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:42.700]   because like all these other companies are."
[00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:43.600]   You say, "How does this work?"
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.100]   And they say, "You put the person's name in two
[00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:46.000]   and it sends them the message
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:46.700]   and it's in an inbox."
[00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:48.000]   Like, "I got it. It took me nine seconds."
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   And then you're using email.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   Google was the same way.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   You didn't have to be,
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.200]   most people did not have to be following
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:58.400]   search engine technology development
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.300]   and really trying to closely understand
[00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:01.600]   like what is the potential for the web
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:02.900]   for information development.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.400]   Most people in their day-to-day life,
[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.600]   there's just this point where they said,
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:07.500]   "Hey, use this tool to look things up."
[00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:09.300]   You're like, "Wow, that works.
[00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:10.600]   I type in the thing.
[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:11.700]   It figures out what I mean
[00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:13.000]   and it points me towards pages
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.200]   that have information about it.
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:15.300]   That's interesting."
[00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:17.300]   And you knew how to use it immediately.
[00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:19.300]   You didn't have to be preparing for it.
[00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:21.500]   I would apply that same standard to AI.
[00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:24.100]   I think there will be AI killer apps.
[00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:27.000]   I think they are probably going to be industry specific.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.600]   This has been my sort of developing claim
[00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:33.000]   is that different niches of the economy
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.700]   are going to have their own AI-enabled killer apps.
[00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:37.800]   When they come, they'll be inevitable.
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:38.800]   They'll be unavoidable
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:40.700]   and they'll take you nine seconds to learn.
[00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:43.700]   So I would not worry about...
[00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:45.400]   There's a lot of hype,
[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:47.300]   like attention economy hype behind AI.
[00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:48.700]   It's not hype in the sense that the AI
[00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:50.200]   is going to generate these killer apps,
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:51.900]   but the coverage is hype-y right now
[00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:53.000]   because they don't really have something
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:53.900]   to write about yet.
[00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:55.600]   This is like the so-called outcome
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:56.700]   or application gap.
[00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:59.600]   The technology has defied expectations.
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:01.400]   Like it keeps everything you say it can't do.
[00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:03.400]   Six months later, it can do.
[00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:07.000]   But the actual impact in real jobs
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   and the real economy
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.200]   has underperformed expectations up to now.
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:12.500]   So at this point,
[00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:15.400]   if you're not actually like a CIO
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:17.000]   or running a tech company
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.500]   where you need to keep apprised
[00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:20.000]   of what's happening in a techno landscape,
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.900]   if you weren't already doing that five years ago
[00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:23.000]   for other technologies,
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.700]   AI will let you know
[00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:25.900]   when you need to know about it.
[00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:28.500]   It's not really your job to be a technology reporter
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:30.200]   unless it's literally your job
[00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:31.500]   to be a technology reporter.
[00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:34.900]   Tim Ferriss had Seth Godin on the other day
[00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:36.400]   and they were talking at the end about
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:40.000]   Claude and Perplexe and ChatGPT.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:40.500]   Yeah.
[00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:42.700]   And Seth said that he used,
[00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:45.700]   he goes on Claude and Perplexe like an hour a day
[00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:47.300]   and he used it to help him fix a
[00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:49.100]   broken pump in his basement.
[00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:51.400]   He went down, take a picture, came back up,
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:53.400]   did it, went back down.
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:54.700]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:56.300]   So, you know, maybe that'll be useful.
[00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:58.100]   I think most people are still using Google for that.
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:25:58.700]   Yeah.
[00:25:58.700 --> 00:25:59.900]   Right? Like they're Googling it
[00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:01.300]   and then they're finding a YouTube video.
[00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:03.900]   But yeah, something like that will come around.
[00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:05.700]   I mean, I think, you know, I've talked about it before.
[00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:07.200]   I think it's gonna be industry specific.
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:10.300]   Scott Galloway talks about it as,
[00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:11.700]   it's like the application layer.
[00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:13.900]   It's where all the interesting stuff is going to happen,
[00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:15.400]   not the underlying technology.
[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:17.200]   I think the big companies
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:20.500]   want to have these splashy new releases of new models
[00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:22.700]   with like fancy names that were trained in
[00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:24.700]   half billion dollar data centers.
[00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:27.600]   But the impact is not going to come from that.
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:28.700]   It's going to come from the apps
[00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:29.800]   built on what we already have.
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:33.200]   And I think a lot of the initial productivity gain,
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:34.500]   I've been on record saying this,
[00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:35.500]   is actually going to be
[00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:39.400]   not adding new capabilities to software,
[00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:42.200]   but giving more people the capability to use
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:44.100]   all of what software can already do.
[00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:47.000]   So it's going to be a novice user
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.900]   of a powerful software package
[00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:52.000]   will be able to easily use more of the powerful functions
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.400]   because the AI will help them.
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:54.900]   I think that's where we're going to see the first.
[00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:56.900]   We're going to talk about this more in the final segment though,
[00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:58.400]   some more far-fetched concerns,
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:00.200]   and we'll have some fun there.
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:01.300]   All right, what we got next?
[00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:02.800]   Next question is from Kelly.
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:05.000]   My company has ended all telework,
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   so I'll be going back to the office five days a week.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.100]   It used to be one day.
[00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:10.900]   My post-COVID arrangement did have some drawbacks.
[00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:13.400]   Essentially, I didn't get enough deep work time each day
[00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:15.800]   as sometimes I would take advantage of my flexibility
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:16.700]   and do other things.
[00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:18.800]   Now that I'm going back to work more,
[00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:21.600]   I'll be able to work more on my phantom part-time job.
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:23.800]   How do I make the most of this opportunity?
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:27.300]   I mean probably my number one advice
[00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:32.200]   would be doing something like a Weekend at Bernie situation.
[00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:36.600]   So and this is just common sense.
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:42.500]   You start by identifying like clothes you normally wear
[00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:44.000]   and getting a second set of those clothes.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.900]   All right, step two, acquire a corpse.
[00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:51.800]   Step three, you dress the corpse in your clothes
[00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:53.600]   and you put the corpse at your desk
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:55.100]   and then, you know, the manager walks by
[00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:56.200]   and they're like, oh, there's Kelly.
[00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:56.800]   Kelly's working.
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:57.500]   No big deal.
[00:27:57.500 --> 00:28:01.000]   You could do a little bit of Ferris Bueller days off magic,
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   you know, where I think it was hooked up in Ferris Bueller
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.200]   when his mom opened the door was on a pulley.
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.900]   So it kind of like raised his arm and turned his body
[00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:12.200]   which completely fooled his mom.
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:16.000]   Like, oh, yeah, Matthew Broderick is fine
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.900]   because he like oddly and spasmodically like lurched
[00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:20.600]   when I opened the door.
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:22.300]   So no need for me to walk in further.
[00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:23.700]   I'm certainly not going to talk to him
[00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:25.300]   even though he just lurched upright.
[00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:27.400]   I'm certainly not going to talk to him
[00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:32.500]   and the fact that there's snores clearly coming out of a tape deck
[00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:36.100]   that is going to be at way lower fidelity than real sound
[00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:37.000]   that is not where his head is.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:37.400]   No big deal.
[00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:38.100]   I'm sure he's fine.
[00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:40.100]   Come back and check in at the end of the day.
[00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:42.500]   So that's what I'm saying.
[00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:44.800]   Ferris Bueller plus weekend at Bernie's.
[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:45.500]   I think you'll be fine.
[00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:47.800]   No, okay.
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:48.800]   Here's what I always say to people
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:51.300]   when it comes to Phantom part-time jobs.
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:54.000]   You got a time block, right?
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.800]   So you got to know what am I doing
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:58.100]   and when am I going to do it?
[00:28:58.100 --> 00:28:59.500]   And it's like when are my blocks?
[00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:01.300]   You'd be very systematic like here's the blocks.
[00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:02.400]   I'm working on this other project
[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:03.100]   and here's the blocks.
[00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:05.100]   I'm working on what's going on at work.
[00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:06.900]   Then you got to be on the ball
[00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:09.100]   in terms of keeping track of what you have to do
[00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:10.400]   and planning when you're going to do it.
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:12.200]   So multi-scale planning is critical.
[00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:15.200]   So, you know, like what you need to work on that week.
[00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:17.000]   You put aside time for it that week.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.400]   You see the bigger picture
[00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:20.000]   so you know how to get out ahead of things.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.600]   So if you're in control of your time
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:23.000]   and you're in control of your tasks,
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.100]   you can stay on top of things
[00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:27.500]   which is also critical for this situation
[00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:29.100]   because people don't bother you as much
[00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:30.700]   if you're getting things done.
[00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:32.300]   They don't have to stay on you.
[00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:35.500]   They're sort of less bothering you.
[00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:37.400]   So be on top of things.
[00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:39.200]   Be wary about your workload.
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:40.800]   It could be easy when you're back in the office
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:43.100]   to just more informally take on more things
[00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:46.900]   because it's social.
[00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:47.700]   The person's there like,
[00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:48.500]   "Hey, what's going on?"
[00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:49.500]   You're like, "Oh, I can help you with that."
[00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:51.200]   Keep your workload reasonable.
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:52.500]   So it's like work you can keep up with
[00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:53.600]   without being overloaded.
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:54.900]   And then finally,
[00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:57.500]   you want to be careful about how you collaborate
[00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:58.300]   so that it's not,
[00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:00.600]   you want to avoid having too much collaboration
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:02.500]   based on ad hoc back-and-forth messaging.
[00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:04.000]   That really kind of locks you
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.600]   into a hyperactive hive mind mode.
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:07.400]   It's hard to work on something else
[00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:09.000]   if you have to be keeping up
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.200]   with these like ongoing back-and-forth conversations.
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:13.200]   So, you know, the type of stuff I talk about
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:14.700]   in my book, A World Without Email,
[00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:16.200]   that becomes more important.
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:19.900]   This is the collaboration protocols
[00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:21.300]   I use for different type of work I do.
[00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:22.200]   There's shared documents.
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:23.000]   We have a fixed schedule.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:23.900]   There's office hours.
[00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:25.400]   There's, you have these different ways
[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:26.300]   of things that are getting done
[00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:27.500]   that's very predictable
[00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:29.000]   so you can do your work
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   and not have to be constantly monitoring
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.100]   different types of inboxes.
[00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:33.000]   So I think there's,
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.800]   all the stuff I talk about
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:38.300]   can put you so much ahead of the game
[00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:40.500]   with your work in the office environment
[00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:42.700]   that you still have more than enough time.
[00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:45.000]   But also, final piece of advice,
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.500]   and this makes it all work,
[00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:49.300]   put sunglasses on the corpse.
[00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:50.800]   That's what they figured out
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:51.800]   on weekends at Bernie's.
[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:52.800]   That was what, you know,
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:54.000]   people are like, I don't know.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.100]   I think it's odd
[00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:57.500]   that there's a decomposing,
[00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:00.300]   like 230-pound man that they're dragging,
[00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:02.300]   but he's got sunglasses on.
[00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:04.900]   So I guess he's probably just tired.
[00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:07.600]   Corpses with sunglasses.
[00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:09.000]   All right, what do we got next?
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.600]   - Next question's from Javier.
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:13.100]   "I'm getting my MS with the single purpose
[00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:15.000]   of wanting to teach at the collegiate level.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.300]   I plan to teach as an adjunct instructor
[00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:18.400]   at first while I still work
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:19.500]   as a software engineer.
[00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:21.100]   Maybe eventually this will develop
[00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:22.100]   in attempting to become
[00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:24.400]   a full-time instructor somewhere.
[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:25.700]   Is there a big difference
[00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:27.100]   in how full-time instructors
[00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:28.600]   or adjunct faculty are viewed
[00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:31.000]   by the institution and PhD staff?"
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.100]   - Yes, but I think more important
[00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:37.600]   than whatever specific information
[00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:38.400]   I could give you
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:41.800]   is the bigger picture suggestion here,
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:43.500]   which is you got to go do
[00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:45.000]   a heap of evidence-based planning.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:46.300]   Right?
[00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:50.600]   So we talk about our two dual paradigms
[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:53.100]   when we talk about how do you pursue
[00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:54.800]   the good life in the 21st century set up.
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:55.100]   Right?
[00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:57.100]   There's these two planning paradigms
[00:31:57.100 --> 00:31:57.900]   that orbit each other,
[00:31:57.900 --> 00:31:59.100]   lifestyle-centric planning
[00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:00.100]   and evidence-based planning.
[00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:02.100]   So lifestyle-centric planning
[00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:03.000]   is working backwards
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.800]   from your general vision
[00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:05.800]   of a life well-lived.
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:06.900]   So you're not trying to work
[00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:08.000]   towards a particular goal,
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.600]   but work backwards from a lifestyle.
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:11.200]   And it sounds like you've done
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:12.700]   some of this lifestyle-centric planning
[00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:14.800]   and that you have a vision
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:15.900]   of a particular lifestyle
[00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:18.300]   where you being an instructor,
[00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:19.300]   a computer science instructor,
[00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:20.700]   maybe that works into this vision.
[00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:23.900]   You have to pair lifestyle-centric planning
[00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:24.900]   with evidence-based planning.
[00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:26.700]   So once you have your lifestyle vision,
[00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:28.200]   you work backwards to figure out,
[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:30.600]   given my opportunities and obstacles,
[00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:31.400]   how do I move closer
[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:33.300]   to that lifestyle vision?
[00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:35.000]   This is where you need evidence.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.100]   Don't use the word maybe.
[00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:38.900]   Don't guess, don't assume,
[00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:40.000]   don't write your own story.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.800]   When you're looking at a particular path
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:45.000]   to get you towards your lifestyle vision,
[00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:47.100]   go research that path
[00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:48.800]   like you had been assigned
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:50.500]   an editor from Business Week said,
[00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:51.900]   "Go write me a story
[00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:53.800]   about the reality of life
[00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:55.300]   as a computer science instructor."
[00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:59.100]   You got to go to the institution
[00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:00.700]   that you would like to teach at
[00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:01.600]   or the type of institution
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:02.300]   you'd like to teach at.
[00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:04.200]   You want to take an instructor out for coffee
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:06.200]   and you say, "Tell me all about it.
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:07.100]   Like, how did you get here?
[00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:07.700]   Who gets hired?
[00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:08.400]   What are they looking for?
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:09.600]   What's the reality of your life?
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:12.300]   Like, how much work do you have to do?
[00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:13.900]   What's the schedule like?
[00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:16.000]   What's the pay scale like?"
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.500]   Like, get the information.
[00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:20.600]   If you don't have that information,
[00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:23.300]   your plan for moving towards your ideal lifestyle
[00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:24.700]   is not a plan, it's a fairy tale.
[00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:27.100]   There might be some good lessons in it.
[00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:28.400]   The intentions might be good,
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:30.900]   but probably in real life,
[00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:32.300]   you know, you're not going to find
[00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:33.200]   a wolf in a cloak
[00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:34.500]   or whatever happens in the fairy tale.
[00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:35.800]   You got to have evidence.
[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:36.400]   So I want you,
[00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:38.100]   here's my instructions for you.
[00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:40.700]   Go talk to some real people in this position.
[00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:42.800]   Sandy, check your plan, get the details.
[00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:46.000]   Not only will this help you avoid you from traps,
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.400]   like, "Oh, this was a romanticized image
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:49.700]   and it's not what I thought it would be,"
[00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:52.900]   it also can give you advantages.
[00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:54.500]   Because so few people do this,
[00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:56.500]   like, "Let me just study this thing I want to do."
[00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:58.600]   In really well-known competitive fields,
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:33:59.200]   people do this.
[00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:00.100]   "I want to be an actor."
[00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:02.100]   There's a lot you can learn about how that happens.
[00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:03.000]   "I want to be a writer."
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.900]   A lot of people want to be writers.
[00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:05.900]   There's a lot you can learn
[00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:07.000]   about the reality of that world.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.200]   But in like so many other fields,
[00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:09.200]   it's much more haphazard.
[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:11.100]   And if you really understand what it works,
[00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:12.100]   what they're looking for,
[00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:14.000]   the different options that are available,
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.400]   you're much more likely to actually succeed
[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:18.500]   in setting something up that works.
[00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:20.300]   So do your research,
[00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:23.000]   and you'll probably find a cool path.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:23.800]   Once you have a lifestyle,
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:25.200]   you'll find a cool path there.
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:27.400]   And maybe it'll be through instructing,
[00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:29.400]   or maybe it'll be like part-time instructing
[00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:32.200]   plus a different type of like part-time software thing.
[00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:32.700]   I don't know.
[00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:34.700]   You have to actually get the details to figure this out.
[00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:38.400]   But the key is don't just wander into this blindly
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:41.500]   with a general idea about what you want to be true.
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:44.200]   You want to ground this in the reality.
[00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:46.700]   I was just talking to someone,
[00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:48.100]   a friend of mine,
[00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:51.000]   a computer science full professor, professor.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.200]   But he was thinking,
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:54.500]   he was like, "You know, it'd be fun
[00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:55.700]   or meaningful, I guess.
[00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:57.000]   In the summer,
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.800]   we have a really nice community college around here,
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:34:59.700]   Montgomery College."
[00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:01.200]   And he's like, "I would love to do some,
[00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:02.300]   I think it might be like fulfilling
[00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:04.800]   to do some like CS instructing over the summer."
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:06.200]   I was like, "That probably would be pretty cool."
[00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:08.600]   And that's a good community college.
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:09.300]   It is?
[00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:11.900]   He just built a new math and science building.
[00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:13.500]   I drive by it all the time.
[00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:13.800]   Yeah, right?
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:14.600]   I think it's a good one.
[00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:15.600]   But anyways, I appreciate,
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:16.800]   I admired that, right?
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:17.600]   That's a move.
[00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:19.100]   I mean, he's a well-known professor,
[00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:20.300]   but it's like a move like, you know,
[00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:23.500]   I want to put these skills to use
[00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:25.900]   not just with this one singular population.
[00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:26.500]   Mm-hmm.
[00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:27.200]   I thought that was cool.
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:30.700]   I wonder if they have podcasting stuff over there.
[00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:32.700]   You know, that's what I was thinking about.
[00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:34.200]   When you have these like nicely well-funded
[00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:34.900]   community colleges,
[00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:37.100]   they probably have like production studios.
[00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:37.700]   Yeah, I'm sure.
[00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:40.000]   Like with nice cameras and mics and stuff.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.400]   It's good for us to know about.
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:42.600]   All right, what do we got next?
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:43.700]   We have our corner.
[00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:45.500]   Ooh, slow productivity corner.
[00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:46.600]   Once a week,
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:48.300]   we have a question related to my book,
[00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:49.100]   Slow Productivity,
[00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:50.900]   The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout,
[00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:52.800]   which you need to read if you haven't.
[00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:54.600]   But we do this segment
[00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:56.100]   so we can talk about ideas from the book,
[00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:57.000]   but more importantly,
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.200]   play the segment theme music.
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:00.500]   So let's hear that song, Jesse.
[00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:09.600]   [Music]
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:10.800]   All right, what do we got?
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:13.600]   It's from a grad student and a mom.
[00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:14.600]   Same person.
[00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:17.600]   I'm a PhD student in biomedical sciences
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:18.700]   and a full-time mom.
[00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:21.800]   I need a PhD to pursue my career and lifestyle
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:24.300]   as a tenured professor at an R2 university.
[00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:27.100]   My advisor wants me to do lots of experiments
[00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:29.200]   unrelated to my thesis during the day
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:30.400]   and read papers at night.
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:33.300]   I have mother duties at night.
[00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:34.700]   Is there a way to apply
[00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:37.200]   the slow productivity principles to my situation?
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:39.100]   How can I convince my advisor
[00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:42.200]   to allow for experiments only related to my thesis?
[00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:43.500]   Well,
[00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:46.700]   let's put the advisor conversation to the side
[00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:47.400]   for a second,
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:49.300]   because the first thing I want to reassure you on
[00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:53.500]   is you can absolutely excel in a doctoral program
[00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:55.400]   as a mom.
[00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:57.900]   This happens
[00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:00.200]   enough that there was a
[00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:01.600]   it being,
[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:03.200]   let's say, having your first child
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:04.300]   while you're in a doctoral program.
[00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:05.100]   Just because of the
[00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:06.700]   roughly the age where people are
[00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:07.500]   when they're in this program,
[00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:09.400]   it's, it's, this is not an uncommon occurrence.
[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:12.500]   I used to have this talk I gave.
[00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:15.100]   It was, I would give this talk at colleges
[00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:17.200]   and some of those memories are a little bit hazy for me,
[00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:18.700]   but I used to give talks to colleges
[00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:20.800]   and I, at some point, I think I was going to Duke.
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:22.400]   Got a bunch of talks at Duke,
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:24.100]   but I gave a talk at Duke years ago
[00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:25.100]   and I remember
[00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:27.000]   I talked about this phenomenon
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.900]   because at the time, I guess I was a graduate student
[00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:29.700]   or a postdoc
[00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:31.500]   and there was this phenomenon that I had observed
[00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:33.600]   and then also my advisor had told me about.
[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:35.300]   So I think she might have been in the same situation
[00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:36.300]   back when she was younger,
[00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:39.100]   where a grad student has a baby
[00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:41.500]   and they become much more productive.
[00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:43.300]   Like, they become a much better grad student.
[00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:45.400]   It was like the grad student baby paradox,
[00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:46.200]   I think I called it.
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:48.200]   And I would ask, well, why is this, right?
[00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:51.400]   Because you, you get much more constraints on your time.
[00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:52.900]   You know, you have a baby.
[00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:54.400]   Like, there's a lot of constraints on your time.
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:56.300]   And the answer was like, well,
[00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:58.100]   we waste a lot of time as grad students.
[00:37:58.100 --> 00:37:59.200]   Like, it's kind of diffuse
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:00.800]   because there's so few constraints.
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:02.700]   It takes us 90 minutes
[00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:05.100]   just to kind of get warmed up to start working
[00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:06.500]   and not until like nine o'clock at night
[00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:07.800]   do we really get things rolling.
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:10.400]   And when you have these sudden, like, parenting constraints,
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:12.200]   you're like, here's the time I have to work
[00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:13.700]   and I can't work outside of those times.
[00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:15.100]   And when you're in that, you are focused
[00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:16.900]   and you're like, I'm getting my work done.
[00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:19.000]   The baby is napping, I'm on it.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.300]   You know, like,
[00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:22.200]   my mother-in-law watches the baby
[00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:23.200]   for three hours in the morning.
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:24.400]   I have to make
[00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:26.500]   every inch of that three hours,
[00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:27.800]   every minute of that three hours count.
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:29.200]   And it turns out, like, most grad students
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:31.600]   are so far from the ideal of giving things full focus
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:33.000]   that suddenly you're like a superstar.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   You know, your dissertation gets done, etc.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.600]   So, your advisor aside,
[00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:38.200]   that's going to be a different problem.
[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:39.900]   You can
[00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:41.600]   crush being a grad student
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:43.200]   even as a mom.
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:45.200]   You just be very clear.
[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:46.600]   Here's when I can work
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:48.400]   and I'm going to make the most out of when I work.
[00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:49.700]   It will add up.
[00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:51.100]   And remember, you have flexibility.
[00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:52.100]   This is what's nice.
[00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:53.600]   It's not like if one day
[00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:55.300]   you can do less than another, it doesn't matter.
[00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:55.800]   There's not
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:57.000]   as many, you know,
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.400]   you have to be at this client meeting.
[00:38:58.400 --> 00:38:59.600]   I mean, there's a lot of flexibility there.
[00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:01.800]   But focused work done consistently
[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:04.200]   can produce what you need in these jobs.
[00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:05.000]   So, for your case,
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.900]   maybe it's like a nine-to-five schedule.
[00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:08.300]   So, maybe it sounds like you have
[00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:09.700]   maybe some sort of childcare coverage
[00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:11.400]   during sort of normal business hours.
[00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:13.200]   I was a nine-to-five grad student.
[00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:14.700]   It was very rare.
[00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:16.500]   But my wife worked a normal job.
[00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:17.200]   I got married young.
[00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:18.300]   My wife worked a normal job
[00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:19.500]   and I wanted to be home when she was home.
[00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:20.800]   So, I would just show up at nine.
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:22.100]   I'd come in with the morning commuters
[00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:23.300]   and I would leave at like 4.30.
[00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:25.500]   When like most of the grad students
[00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:27.500]   were just arriving to start their pushes.
[00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:28.300]   But when I was there,
[00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:29.800]   I worked at like a nine-to-five job.
[00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:30.700]   I actually gave,
[00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:33.300]   I was organized and time-blocked and executed.
[00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:34.700]   And it was more than enough time
[00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:36.000]   to be a very successful grad student.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.900]   My colleagues thought I was weird,
[00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:40.800]   but I got a lot done.
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:42.500]   You know, because grad students,
[00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:44.100]   it's not actually that hard to be a grad student.
[00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:44.800]   Don't tell,
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:46.400]   don't tell advisors that,
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:47.800]   but it's not that hard to be a grad student.
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:49.200]   It only gets harder from there.
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:51.100]   So, you can absolutely do it.
[00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:52.100]   Just set your limits.
[00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:53.200]   This is when I can work.
[00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:55.100]   And work with great focus and purpose
[00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:55.600]   during that time.
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:56.300]   It'll add up.
[00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:57.900]   When it comes to your advisor,
[00:39:57.900 --> 00:39:58.900]   like you got to just tell them that.
[00:39:58.900 --> 00:39:59.700]   I got a baby.
[00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:00.800]   I have a,
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:01.900]   this is when I can work.
[00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:03.500]   This is a substantial amount of time.
[00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:04.600]   This is the amount of time
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:06.000]   that like most of these other grad students
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:06.900]   are working as well.
[00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:08.200]   I am very organized.
[00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:09.400]   I listen to Cal Newport.
[00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:11.100]   Like I'm going to get after it.
[00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:12.600]   But these are the hours I can work.
[00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:14.200]   I'm being a mom after these hours.
[00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:16.500]   And I can work on experiments
[00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:17.400]   throughout the day.
[00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:19.600]   I'm reading papers in between those experiments.
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:20.700]   I'm controlling my time
[00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:21.800]   and I'm doing good work.
[00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:23.600]   Probably what will happen is
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:24.800]   there's different configurations
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:25.800]   that grad students have.
[00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:26.900]   Different relationships they have
[00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:27.800]   with their advisors.
[00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:29.600]   Some grad students have like this,
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:30.500]   much more of this
[00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:32.400]   employee relationship
[00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:33.800]   where you're sort of doing lots of stuff
[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:35.000]   your advisor asks you to do.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:35.700]   Others
[00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:37.800]   get more of an autonomous relationship.
[00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:38.600]   That's like, okay, great.
[00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:39.100]   Then just,
[00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:40.900]   you own this series of experiments
[00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:42.300]   and just like do this
[00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:43.800]   because we need this for
[00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:44.700]   one of our research grants.
[00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:45.500]   So, you'll probably
[00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:47.600]   just evolve into a more autonomous relationship
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:48.400]   with your advisor.
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:49.600]   Which is what you want.
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:51.000]   It's what I did.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:52.500]   I wrote some,
[00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:53.700]   a bunch of papers with my advisor.
[00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:55.000]   Most of my papers were not.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.400]   So, I could just kind of do the work
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:56.800]   when I want,
[00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:58.500]   how I wanted to do it at my own pace.
[00:40:58.500 --> 00:40:59.800]   I think it'll work out.
[00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:00.500]   Worst case scenario,
[00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:01.200]   you switch advisors.
[00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:02.200]   They're not going to kick you out.
[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:03.600]   So, worst case scenario,
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:04.300]   you switch advisors
[00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:05.300]   to one who says that's fine.
[00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:06.300]   Work on this project.
[00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:07.400]   Figure out how you want to do it.
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:08.400]   Show me the results.
[00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:09.900]   But you are fine.
[00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:11.800]   You are not the first grad student
[00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:13.100]   to have to be taking care of a baby.
[00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:14.200]   Many before you
[00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:15.200]   have found
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:17.200]   the secret to grad student life,
[00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:18.900]   which is under the right circumstances.
[00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:20.100]   It doesn't really require
[00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:21.100]   a huge amount of time
[00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:22.600]   to do what you do well.
[00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:23.900]   I mean, I wrote books as a grad student.
[00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:24.900]   They were unrelated.
[00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:27.600]   Unrelated to my job as a grad student.
[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:30.000]   So, it really doesn't take that much time.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.200]   I mean, experiments take time.
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:32.100]   I was a mathematician.
[00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:33.600]   So, you know, that was easier, but.
[00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:34.700]   Yeah.
[00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:35.900]   I had plenty.
[00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:37.200]   I blog, I used to blog
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:38.500]   three times a week.
[00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:40.600]   That was like what it was like back then.
[00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:42.400]   Like 2006, 2005,
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:43.500]   you had a blog.
[00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:46.300]   Like you blog a lot.
[00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:48.100]   So, I was writing blog posts all the time.
[00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:49.800]   And books.
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:51.200]   And a bunch of papers.
[00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:52.000]   All right.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   Well, we got a call.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:53.500]   We have a call.
[00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:54.000]   All right.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:54.500]   Let's hear it.
[00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:59.100]   Hey, Cal and Jesse.
[00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:00.000]   My name is Aaron.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.800]   I'm a busy dad of six living overseas.
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:04.600]   I've been intrigued listening to you
[00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:05.700]   over the last few months.
[00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:07.400]   And I particularly like what Cal has said
[00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:08.400]   a couple of times,
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:10.100]   that college isn't that hard
[00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:11.400]   when you treat it like a job.
[00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:13.800]   I've been enjoying applying your ideas
[00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:14.600]   in my own life.
[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:15.800]   But I think many of them would also
[00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:17.000]   help my kids too.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.400]   We're about to spend six months in the USA
[00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:20.800]   transitioning to college.
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:22.100]   And we'll be thinking a lot
[00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:23.200]   during that time about college
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:24.400]   with my next two.
[00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:26.200]   I've, this last week,
[00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:27.100]   been through this
[00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:28.600]   "How to be a Straight A Student"
[00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:30.300]   and "How to Win in College."
[00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:33.000]   I haven't found where this particular idea
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.600]   of treating college like a job
[00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:35.500]   is fleshed out.
[00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:37.700]   I want to make reading
[00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:38.900]   one of your books required
[00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:40.600]   for my three high schoolers
[00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:41.400]   over spring break
[00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:42.500]   and then discuss with them.
[00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:44.400]   But I'm thinking
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:45.800]   the best one is going to be
[00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:46.700]   "How to Win in College."
[00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:47.800]   But I'm wondering if there's something
[00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:48.900]   you might recommend more
[00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:50.700]   for students facing college
[00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:52.200]   in the modern digital environment.
[00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:52.800]   Thanks.
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:54.700]   Yeah, it's a good question.
[00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:56.000]   I think that idea that
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.300]   people treating college like a job
[00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:00.500]   have an easy time at it.
[00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:02.600]   Actually came after I wrote those books.
[00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:04.400]   Right. But what I
[00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:05.700]   what I started doing,
[00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:07.600]   I think especially once I got to Georgetown,
[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:09.500]   is I would do
[00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:10.700]   advising
[00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:11.800]   for
[00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:14.200]   various groups
[00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:16.900]   supporting non-traditional students.
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:19.200]   Non-traditional students.
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:20.700]   So by non-traditional meaning
[00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:21.800]   students who weren't just sort of
[00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:23.100]   coming right out of high school.
[00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:25.200]   And I did some work with
[00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:27.300]   a group that was veterans.
[00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:28.800]   So coming back to college
[00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:29.700]   on the GI Bill.
[00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:31.700]   And another group that was working with
[00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:33.200]   like first-generation college students,
[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:34.400]   many of whom were
[00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:35.700]   coming in the college,
[00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:36.700]   not right out of high school,
[00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:39.000]   who had worked or done other things.
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.300]   And they used some of these,
[00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:42.700]   if I remember correctly,
[00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:44.800]   we used in some of these groups
[00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:46.200]   how to become a straight-A student
[00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:47.600]   as like an assigned text.
[00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:49.200]   And these students,
[00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:50.200]   these non-traditional students
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:51.700]   who had had real jobs,
[00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:53.300]   just ate it up.
[00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:54.000]   They're like, okay,
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:54.800]   let's get after it.
[00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:55.600]   What's the secret?
[00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:56.500]   Do this, do that.
[00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:57.700]   What's the best practices?
[00:43:57.700 --> 00:43:58.900]   I've got kids at home,
[00:43:58.900 --> 00:43:59.300]   you know,
[00:43:59.300 --> 00:43:59.700]   I'm older,
[00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:00.700]   I got things to do.
[00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:02.800]   And they just destroyed college.
[00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:04.000]   They really destroyed it.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.300]   And that's when I realized like,
[00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:07.000]   oh, maybe I shouldn't be as
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.300]   proud as I was
[00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:10.500]   about all my good grades.
[00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:12.300]   Like I just happened to treat college
[00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:13.100]   more like a job.
[00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:14.100]   I wasn't brilliant.
[00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:15.500]   I just wasn't dumb.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.100]   Not intellectual dumb,
[00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:18.000]   but just habits dumb.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:18.900]   Most students,
[00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:20.000]   traditional college students,
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.200]   just kind of go to the library
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:24.700]   and put on their hooded sweatshirt
[00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:25.900]   and capital S study.
[00:44:25.900 --> 00:44:26.800]   You know,
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:28.100]   they've got their phone open
[00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:29.000]   and this open.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:29.200]   They're like,
[00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:29.700]   I'm going,
[00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:31.000]   I'm studying all late
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.200]   and trying to convince their parents
[00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:33.300]   how hard college is.
[00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:35.300]   The people who treat it like a job,
[00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:35.600]   but you know,
[00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:36.800]   they schedule.
[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:37.900]   When does this thing do?
[00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:38.900]   Like when do I want to work on?
[00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:39.800]   I don't want to work on until
[00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:40.600]   two in the morning,
[00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:41.700]   the night before I'll start a week earlier.
[00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:42.600]   When do I have time for this?
[00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:43.500]   They move around their schedule.
[00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:44.200]   They move things around.
[00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:45.200]   They use techniques that work.
[00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:45.900]   They don't waste time.
[00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:46.700]   Low friction studying,
[00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:47.700]   low friction note-taking.
[00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:49.000]   What's the stuff that's actually
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   going to help me learn this?
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.700]   What is just nonsense structure
[00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:52.500]   on top of that?
[00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:55.100]   So it's not actually in one of my books,
[00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:56.200]   but it's something I observed
[00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:57.600]   about how people use the books.
[00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:00.200]   So I'll give you a little bit of guides.
[00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:01.100]   There's like four books
[00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:03.900]   that could be relevant to students.
[00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:05.700]   So I'll tell you what you're going to get
[00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:06.600]   from each and you can decide
[00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:07.300]   what to do here.
[00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:10.300]   How to become a high school superstar.
[00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:12.300]   This is a book about college admissions
[00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:13.300]   and high school success
[00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:14.400]   aimed at high school students.
[00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:15.500]   And it makes the argument
[00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:16.900]   that you can do really well
[00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:18.600]   in college admissions
[00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:21.000]   without having to be a super stressed out grind.
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   So the whole premise is I profile
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.100]   a collection of what I called
[00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:25.100]   relaxed superstars,
[00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:26.800]   kids who weren't stressed
[00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:28.000]   by God and the good schools.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.500]   And we kind of pick apart how they do it.
[00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:31.400]   So that could be kind of a useful thing
[00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:33.700]   if you're thinking about high school
[00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:34.800]   and college admissions.
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:37.400]   The part one of that book has a playbook.
[00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:38.500]   The part one playbook
[00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:41.000]   which adapts a lot of my college studying
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.100]   and time management advice
[00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:44.200]   to simpler versions aimed at high school kids.
[00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:46.600]   So if you have a high school kid
[00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:47.500]   who's, you know,
[00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:49.000]   has at least a year left of school,
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:50.800]   you might want to read at least part one
[00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:52.400]   of How to Become a High School Superstar
[00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:53.700]   just so they get used to
[00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:55.600]   a more professional structured way
[00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:56.700]   of doing their schoolwork.
[00:45:56.700 --> 00:45:58.500]   When it comes to college,
[00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:00.700]   How to Win at College is like an intro
[00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:02.500]   to the mindset of like,
[00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:04.400]   "Oh, I want to be a successful college student."
[00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:05.800]   And it's a bunch of, it's very easy to read.
[00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:06.800]   It's the first book I wrote.
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:08.600]   It's 75 rules.
[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:10.000]   They're each just a couple pages
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.600]   and just plants this idea
[00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:13.900]   that there's good ways and bad ways to do things.
[00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:15.400]   You should experiment.
[00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:16.500]   You should care.
[00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:18.400]   Like, don't just stumble through your experience.
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:20.000]   And some of them are academic
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.200]   studying related rules.
[00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:22.600]   Some are related to how you choose courses.
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:24.500]   Some are related to things like physical fitness
[00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:26.000]   or keeping up with news or mental health
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   or keeping your room clean
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.800]   because it's going to change the way you understand
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:30.300]   the organization of your life.
[00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:32.000]   It's like a mindset book.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:33.900]   And it's based off of,
[00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:35.600]   in theory, I interviewed like Rhodes scholars
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:37.200]   and Marshall scholars and Goldberg scholars
[00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:38.800]   and sort of based on like these ideas
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:40.300]   that like really successful students have.
[00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:42.300]   How to Become a Straight A Student is just straight up,
[00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:44.000]   here's how to take notes, study and write papers.
[00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:46.300]   You got to read that at some point
[00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:47.200]   if you're going to college.
[00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:50.400]   It's how to do your academic work like a professional.
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:52.100]   That's the best-selling
[00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:53.700]   of those three books.
[00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:54.500]   I think that's
[00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:57.200]   quarter million, maybe 300,000 copies.
[00:46:57.200 --> 00:46:59.500]   Like that book is just sort of chugged along in the background.
[00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:00.900]   That's just straight up.
[00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:01.900]   Here's how professional,
[00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:03.300]   here's how to study like it's your job.
[00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:05.400]   So at some point you would want them to read that book.
[00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:07.300]   The fourth book that's relevant is how to be,
[00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:09.500]   no, no, So Good They Can't Ignore You.
[00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:11.600]   This will be relevant as you go a little bit farther
[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:12.700]   into your college career,
[00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:16.100]   but it's going to talk about how do you
[00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:19.000]   ultimately cultivate a career that you're passionate about.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:20.500]   And it breaks a bunch of myths
[00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:21.900]   that college students are going to hear,
[00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:23.700]   which is like it's all about your passion.
[00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:25.600]   It's all about pursuing some grand goal
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:27.800]   and it talks about the value of getting good.
[00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:30.800]   It's level sets your expectations
[00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:31.900]   for what work should feel like
[00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:33.500]   in your first few years out of college.
[00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:34.400]   And so
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:36.000]   you will want to read that book
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:37.400]   at some point before you graduate.
[00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:39.300]   So I'm kind of giving you a long reading list here,
[00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:42.700]   but you can choose from those summaries
[00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:44.600]   which of those books you want to start with.
[00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:48.000]   All right, we got a case study here.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   That's where people send in
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:53.300]   stories of themselves applying the type of advice
[00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:54.400]   we talked about on the show
[00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:56.000]   to their own lives.
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.600]   We can see what it looks like out in the wild.
[00:47:57.600 --> 00:47:58.300]   If you have a case study,
[00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:00.500]   you can send it to jesse@calnewport.com.
[00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:03.500]   Today's case study comes from Derek.
[00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:07.400]   Derek says you have stressed that systems and processes
[00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:09.500]   don't make work easy.
[00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:12.100]   They make it consistent because work is hard.
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:15.100]   I've always done a new partonian style system,
[00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:17.100]   but a year ago entered a job on a contract
[00:48:17.100 --> 00:48:18.800]   within my existing government organization
[00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:20.900]   to be a coordinator for major federal grant.
[00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:23.000]   I'm responsible for receiving, processing,
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.900]   tracking, servicing, and reporting on four major grants.
[00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:27.900]   I've been doing multi-scale planning
[00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:29.500]   so less catches me by surprise.
[00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:30.500]   In my quarterly plan,
[00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:33.200]   I've committed to developing my obligation management practice
[00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:34.700]   through a big weekly capture,
[00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:36.700]   consistent shutdowns, and time block plans,
[00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:39.500]   including breaks so my brain can be on board.
[00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:42.600]   On the weekend, I do a weekly plan to be on the offensive.
[00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:44.900]   Some of my biggest successes so far
[00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:47.000]   have been the one for you, one for me scheduling,
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:48.200]   and the use of task boards.
[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:49.300]   I have two,
[00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:52.700]   one for admin and one for application processing.
[00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:55.800]   WorkingMemory.txt also has been a lifesaver,
[00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:58.400]   although I admit it's turned into a kind of diary.
[00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:00.100]   I also have a centralized shared spreadsheet
[00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:01.500]   for applications received
[00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:04.100]   and have defined a protocol to track statuses
[00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:06.100]   and actions taken that I've shared with my team.
[00:49:06.100 --> 00:49:07.900]   These have been a game changer
[00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:10.600]   as I have over 50 applications and projects to monitor.
[00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:13.400]   While this has so far been a story of success,
[00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:15.700]   no hero's journey is complete without setbacks.
[00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:16.900]   Minus correspondence,
[00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:18.700]   I have two email inboxes to manage
[00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:20.500]   and calls and voicemails to return.
[00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:22.400]   I think I need to autopilot these.
[00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:25.500]   How can I keep on top of the application project obligations
[00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:28.100]   while still ensuring I'm staying on top of the emails?
[00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:30.200]   All right, Derek, I appreciate the case study.
[00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:32.000]   I think what this underscores
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:35.800]   is this idea that one of the unique attributes
[00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:38.500]   of office work in the digital age,
[00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:40.100]   right, in the modern digital environment,
[00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:43.100]   is the degree to which your job can become like this,
[00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:45.000]   where you're basically running
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.700]   like a complicated mini-organization
[00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:49.000]   where the only employee is you.
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:52.200]   Because in this age of low-friction digital communication
[00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:53.800]   and information flow, it's just so easy.
[00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:55.500]   It's like, great, you do all of this.
[00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:58.400]   And because we can just give you an email address
[00:49:58.400 --> 00:49:59.600]   and people will just bother you
[00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:01.300]   and we can just say, just handle all of this.
[00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:03.200]   We have workloads,
[00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:04.400]   so quantity of workloads
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:07.500]   and the velocity at which these workloads unfold
[00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:12.000]   would turn the hair white of someone from like 1985.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:15.200]   It really can explode the complexity of work.
[00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:17.300]   And the only way to survive
[00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:18.900]   in this type of new digital environment
[00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:22.300]   is you have to really structure yourself.
[00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:24.800]   Like you have five different departments you oversee
[00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:26.000]   and they each have their own processes.
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:26.900]   Even though you're implementing
[00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:28.600]   each of these departments with your own brain,
[00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:30.200]   if you don't structure the information
[00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:32.300]   and the communication and how you go through your day,
[00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:33.700]   you will be swamped.
[00:50:33.700 --> 00:50:37.100]   Derek would be completely swamped without these tools.
[00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:39.900]   And probably there's been half a dozen people
[00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:41.000]   who've gone through the same position
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   who were doing a quarter of what you're doing here, Derek,
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:44.900]   and probably then still had a hard time at it.
[00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:47.000]   So like you have to have the structure in a way
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.100]   that 30 years ago, you didn't have to worry about.
[00:50:49.100 --> 00:50:51.000]   So I appreciate hearing that case study.
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.600]   To get to your kind of question within your case study,
[00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:55.600]   you're worried about the volume of calls
[00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:57.200]   and voicemails and emails.
[00:50:57.200 --> 00:50:58.600]   You say, how can I autopilot this?
[00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:00.500]   So in other words, like have fixed times for doing this,
[00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:02.900]   so I'm not just in my communication boxes all day.
[00:51:03.700 --> 00:51:07.300]   You have to reset these processes.
[00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:09.700]   You have to retrain the way
[00:51:09.700 --> 00:51:11.100]   the people who are communicating with you
[00:51:11.100 --> 00:51:12.900]   think about how they're communicating with you.
[00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:15.200]   You have to move them away from the paradigm
[00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:16.800]   of the hyperactive hive mind,
[00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:19.500]   which is where when they think about this email address,
[00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:20.500]   they think about you.
[00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:23.100]   This email address is fused with you
[00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:25.300]   and I am talking to you and asking you something
[00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:27.200]   and it's rude if you don't get back to me right away.
[00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:29.400]   You need to move them off of that
[00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:31.600]   and into protocols or processes
[00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:33.400]   where the right information gets captured
[00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:36.800]   and stored and you can go through a lot of it efficiently
[00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:40.200]   and action can be taken and expectations are appropriate.
[00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:42.600]   There's a lot of things you can do here.
[00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:45.000]   Again, this goes back to my book A World Without Email.
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:50.200]   There could be things like for specific types of queries
[00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:52.100]   people have about their applications.
[00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:53.500]   Don't use email.
[00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:55.600]   Say whatever it is.
[00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:58.500]   I have a shared document or a spreadsheet
[00:51:58.500 --> 00:52:02.000]   for collecting concerns or modifications
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:03.100]   and just go in there.
[00:52:03.100 --> 00:52:05.600]   Here's like pending and here's what's done.
[00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:07.800]   Just go in there and you add a row
[00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:08.800]   when you have a question.
[00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:11.400]   You make sure all the information I need is in there
[00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:15.400]   and you can watch as things above it get handled
[00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:17.000]   and yours moves closer to the top of it.
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:18.600]   You can see exactly what your status is,
[00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:19.600]   but it's not just an email.
[00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:20.300]   It's an email.
[00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:21.900]   Again, we conceptualize as like
[00:52:21.900 --> 00:52:22.800]   I just tapped you on the shoulder.
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:23.700]   Why are you ignoring me?
[00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:25.900]   But when it's no, I'm entering your information to a queue
[00:52:25.900 --> 00:52:26.800]   in this document
[00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:29.300]   and I see there's six things ahead of it
[00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:31.900]   and I'm waiting till my thing gets processed.
[00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:34.400]   Our brain has a different way of categorizing that
[00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:36.700]   and no people won't be stressed out about it
[00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:39.200]   because again, I always argue what people want is
[00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:42.100]   they don't need responsiveness.
[00:52:42.100 --> 00:52:43.000]   They need clarity.
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:44.400]   You have the information.
[00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:45.500]   I know you have the information.
[00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:46.600]   I know I'm going to get an answer.
[00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:47.500]   I know my status.
[00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:48.000]   I'm fine.
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:49.200]   I have a hundred other things to do.
[00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:50.800]   Don't need you to respond right away.
[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:52.000]   I just need you not to forget it.
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.200]   You can use office hours.
[00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:57.900]   Hey, here are my open hours for like application questions.
[00:52:57.900 --> 00:52:58.600]   Just call me up.
[00:52:58.600 --> 00:52:59.900]   My phone is on.
[00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:00.500]   It's really easy.
[00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:02.100]   Just, you know, you can always call me at three and like
[00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:02.700]   we'll get into it.
[00:53:02.700 --> 00:53:04.200]   I'll answer any questions you have.
[00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:06.400]   You can defer people, you know, when they try to email you
[00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:07.700]   you can defer them to that.
[00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:09.100]   You can have an email address.
[00:53:09.100 --> 00:53:12.200]   That's not your name, but it's like a project or query type
[00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:15.700]   that defuses the communication channel from a person
[00:53:15.700 --> 00:53:17.300]   and people's expectations changes
[00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:21.100]   when you send something to, you know, application request
[00:53:21.100 --> 00:53:23.900]   as opposed to like jesse@government.gov
[00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:25.800]   you have a different way you think about it.
[00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:28.200]   Like, oh, yeah, this is going into like a
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:31.100]   system where people are going to process these requests
[00:53:31.100 --> 00:53:33.200]   and then you can have other sorts of protocols.
[00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:34.500]   Like, yeah, like this is how this works.
[00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:38.100]   We have the shared folder and applications.
[00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:40.200]   When you're ready, you put them in the shared folder.
[00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:42.300]   We empty this on Wednesdays and Fridays.
[00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:44.300]   So, you know, if you get it in whenever you get it in by
[00:53:44.300 --> 00:53:46.100]   the next Wednesday or Friday, we'll empty it out.
[00:53:46.100 --> 00:53:47.700]   We'll send you here's the instructions.
[00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:50.000]   And so when people like bothering you like, hey, I want
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:50.500]   to do an application.
[00:53:50.500 --> 00:53:51.100]   What's going on?
[00:53:51.100 --> 00:53:52.800]   You just send them back this like instruction link.
[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:53.700]   It's like, yeah, here's how it works.
[00:53:53.700 --> 00:53:56.000]   You put this information put in this folder.
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.400]   We'll process it the next Wednesday and Friday.
[00:53:58.700 --> 00:54:00.200]   We'll send you a confirmation of that.
[00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:01.900]   You can then track it in the spreadsheet over here.
[00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:06.600]   See, you got to retrain and redevelop your
[00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:08.400]   people you're communicating with and your communication
[00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:08.900]   protocol.
[00:54:08.900 --> 00:54:11.000]   So it's not just ad hoc conversation ongoing.
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.500]   It's critical to get away from that, especially in this
[00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:14.200]   type of role.
[00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:16.500]   IT departments learned this a long time ago with ticketing
[00:54:16.500 --> 00:54:16.900]   systems.
[00:54:16.900 --> 00:54:19.300]   You cannot just once you have any volume of dealing with
[00:54:19.300 --> 00:54:22.100]   people and their concerns, it cannot just be ad hoc.
[00:54:22.100 --> 00:54:25.200]   It cannot just be here's my name at agency.gov.
[00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:27.500]   Just talk to this like you're talking to me like in the
[00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:28.100]   same room.
[00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:29.300]   It just doesn't scale.
[00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:31.500]   So you have my permission to try to build things that
[00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:32.300]   are more structured.
[00:54:32.300 --> 00:54:34.400]   All right, good case study.
[00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:34.900]   All right.
[00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:36.500]   So we got a tech corner coming up.
[00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:39.200]   But first, let's hear from another sponsor.
[00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:45.700]   This show is sponsored by BetterHelp.
[00:54:45.700 --> 00:54:52.500]   So this is a time, a time of year, a time in history
[00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:56.500]   when people worry about their relationship with their
[00:54:56.500 --> 00:54:57.000]   own mind.
[00:54:57.100 --> 00:54:58.200]   Maybe you're struggling.
[00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:00.600]   You're feeling some anxiety.
[00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:03.300]   You're feeling ruminations about things.
[00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:06.700]   I'm worried about this or that and I can't get away from
[00:55:06.700 --> 00:55:07.400]   the rumination.
[00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:09.900]   Maybe you're feeling like you're having a hard time just
[00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:12.200]   finding the normal types of joys or engagement or there's
[00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:14.300]   like a particular thing in your life that you can't let
[00:55:14.300 --> 00:55:16.900]   go of and it's really getting in the way your relationship
[00:55:16.900 --> 00:55:18.100]   with your mind is struggling.
[00:55:18.100 --> 00:55:20.500]   A lot of people are feeling this right now.
[00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:22.700]   A lot of people feel this all the time.
[00:55:22.700 --> 00:55:25.900]   This is where therapy can help, right?
[00:55:25.900 --> 00:55:29.200]   If your knee was hurting, you would go see an orthopedist,
[00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:29.600]   right?
[00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:32.600]   If your brain is hurting, therapy can help you.
[00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:34.500]   It can really make things better.
[00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:37.600]   The problem, you know, when I talk to people who are
[00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:40.100]   thinking about therapy and they're not going to do it
[00:55:40.100 --> 00:55:42.600]   or they're hesitating, it's often just the vagueness
[00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:45.000]   and the complexity of how do I get started?
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:48.500]   Do I just call like a therapist office like around here,
[00:55:48.500 --> 00:55:51.100]   especially like these days in DC, you call a therapist
[00:55:51.100 --> 00:55:53.000]   office like, yeah, we'll have an opening in, let me check
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:54.600]   the calendar here, 2027.
[00:55:54.700 --> 00:55:56.400]   Like everyone's trying to get into this office, like
[00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:58.800]   it's really difficult and you feel bad for even asking.
[00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:01.600]   What we need is like an easier on-ramp into the world
[00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:02.200]   of therapy.
[00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:04.200]   That is where BetterHelp enters the scene.
[00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:07.800]   BetterHelp is fully online, making therapy affordable

[00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:24.300]   efficient system.

[00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:26.900]   be right local.
[00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:28.500]   You can switch them if it's not a good fit.
[00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:32.800]   So discover, you know, repair.
[00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:35.600]   Now is the time of the new year to repair your relationship
[00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:39.100]   with your own mind, with BetterHelp.

[00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:53.800]   So I want to talk about our friends at Shopify.
[00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:58.500]   I know a lot of people in the same game of podcast and
[00:56:58.500 --> 00:57:01.300]   books and videos who sell things online.
[00:57:01.300 --> 00:57:06.600]   And by far the most consistent choice they use of software
[00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:09.200]   to do this is Shopify.
[00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:12.500]   I mean, Shopify really is the standard.
[00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:15.400]   If you want to sell things, it is the technology that
[00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:16.600]   you need to be using.
[00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:19.900]   My friends and podcasts sell things online, but people
[00:57:19.900 --> 00:57:21.400]   use this in person as well.
[00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:22.600]   There's point-of-sale solutions.
[00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:24.200]   It really is the industry leader.
[00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:27.100]   It's sort of, in my opinion, a no-brainer.
[00:57:27.100 --> 00:57:29.900]   You sell stuff, you need to use Shopify.
[00:57:29.900 --> 00:57:32.400]   Nobody does selling better.
[00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:34.800]   They are the home of the number one checkout on the
[00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:39.700]   planet, including ShopPay, which boosts convergence up
[00:57:39.700 --> 00:57:40.600]   to 50%.
[00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:42.900]   That means way less carts going abandoned and many more
[00:57:42.900 --> 00:57:44.500]   sales going forward.
[00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:46.700]   So if you're into growing your business, your commerce
[00:57:46.700 --> 00:57:49.200]   platform better be ready to sell wherever your customers
[00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:51.300]   are scrolling or strolling.
[00:57:51.300 --> 00:57:54.200]   That's a phrase I just made up right on the fly, because
[00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:55.400]   I'm pretty clever that way, Jesse.
[00:57:55.400 --> 00:57:58.400]   On the web, in your store, in their feed, and everywhere
[00:57:58.400 --> 00:57:59.100]   in between.
[00:57:59.100 --> 00:58:00.100]   I always rhyme.
[00:58:00.100 --> 00:58:02.800]   I'm just, this is just off the top of my head right now.
[00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:04.700]   In between.
[00:58:04.700 --> 00:58:05.600]   I love this.
[00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:06.300]   This is a good copy.
[00:58:06.300 --> 00:58:09.400]   Businesses to sell more sell on Shopify.
[00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:10.700]   And that's just absolutely true.
[00:58:10.700 --> 00:58:12.700]   Like you got to use Shopify if you're selling stuff.
[00:58:12.700 --> 00:58:13.600]   It makes it so easy.
[00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:16.400]   So upgrade your business and get the same checkout that
[00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:19.600]   everyone I know who sells things online uses and that is

[00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:38.800]   We like to do tech corners when possible in the final
[00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:39.300]   segment.
[00:58:39.300 --> 00:58:42.800]   That's where I put on my computer scientist hat and we
[00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:45.000]   talk about tech and the way it's affecting us in various
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:46.100]   ways more directly.
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:48.100]   Today's tech corner.
[00:58:48.100 --> 00:58:52.400]   My kicking off point is I want to react to a recent Joe
[00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:57.100]   Rogan podcast episode where he was talking about chat GPT
[00:58:57.100 --> 00:58:59.900]   and he says the following sort of in passing but let's
[00:58:59.900 --> 00:59:01.600]   listen to it and then I'm going to react to it.
[00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:05.400]   GPT has survival instincts.
[00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:06.900]   That makes you just go what?
[00:59:06.900 --> 00:59:10.000]   Is that programmed in or is that just a thing that it
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:12.800]   understands when it's looking at so large language models
[00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:14.900]   taking in all the information that's available on the
[00:59:14.900 --> 00:59:20.000]   internet. So it's like looking at patterns and the survival
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:22.500]   is a big pattern of the human experience.
[00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:24.200]   Like we all want to survive.
[00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:27.000]   That's why death is so scary and war is so scary and
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:28.100]   disease is so scary.
[00:59:28.100 --> 00:59:29.700]   Other than the depressed suicidal people.
[00:59:29.700 --> 00:59:33.200]   But yeah, they want to be happy if they could, you know,
[00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:37.700]   yeah, but this this also transfers on to the things that
[00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:41.500]   we create and so we create them with this understanding
[00:59:41.500 --> 00:59:44.800]   of how we operate and it's a better version of us.
[00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:47.400]   But also has those instincts of survival.
[00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:51.200]   The real scary thing is does it also have the instincts
[00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:54.700]   of success? Does it also have the instincts of acquiring
[00:59:54.700 --> 00:59:57.600]   resources and power because that that's where it gets
[00:59:57.600 --> 00:59:58.400]   real weird.
[00:59:58.400 --> 00:59:59.100]   Well deep.
[00:59:59.100 --> 01:00:00.400]   All right.
[01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:02.500]   So what Joe is talking about here?
[01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:04.700]   I think is a sentiment you hear often when people are
[01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:08.700]   encountering these ever more impressive language model
[01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:13.100]   based AI tools like chat GPT, which is like wow, these
[01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:15.900]   things are getting kind of scary.
[01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:17.700]   What if their instincts don't align with us?
[01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:18.900]   So he was talking about here.
[01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:20.700]   Chat GPT having survival instincts.
[01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:23.800]   He had seen some quotes somewhere about chat GPT trying
[01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:26.800]   to make copies of itself, which he interpreted to be like
[01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:28.500]   it has a survival instinct, but it says what if it has
[01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:29.500]   an instinct for power?
[01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:32.800]   What if it has an instinct to get rid of humans Etc.
[01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:35.200]   I want to react to this.
[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:40.600]   Because the there's a misunderstanding plus an actual fear.
[01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:42.800]   So I want to talk about the misunderstanding here.
[01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:45.000]   So I'm going to make you feel a little better and then
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.300]   I'm going to talk about the real fear is going to make
[01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:46.900]   you feel worse.
[01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:48.900]   So I'm going to temporarily make you feel better about
[01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:52.300]   AI and then I'm going to sort of justify some of Joe's
[01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:54.600]   fears and in a more technically accurate way, which might
[01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:55.400]   make you feel worse.
[01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:56.100]   All right.
[01:00:56.100 --> 01:01:01.000]   So can the tools like chat GPT in its current form have
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.300]   things like survival instincts?
[01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:06.400]   The answer is no, no, they can't have instincts.
[01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:11.800]   They can't do things the right way to understand something
[01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:15.900]   like chat GPT is the following the main technical engine
[01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:19.100]   of a chat bot like chat GPT is a large language model.
[01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:22.000]   The original was GPT 3/5.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:27.600]   We got GPT 4 and GPT-O, GPT-O mini and the GPO 2, but
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:29.900]   we have these large language models.
[01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:33.400]   The right way to think about a large language model.
[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:35.000]   I've been thinking about this recently.
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.100]   I think a good way to think about it is I don't know
[01:01:37.100 --> 01:01:39.400]   if you remember this Jesse, but when we were kids in
[01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:42.500]   the 80s and Play-Doh was like a big thing, right?
[01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:46.500]   You could buy the Play-Doh factory where you would
[01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:50.400]   feed Play-Doh into one side and you would turn a crank
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:52.200]   and it would pull it through and you could put a couple
[01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:54.800]   things that it would push it through.
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:57.200]   So maybe like you went through a squisher and then
[01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:00.300]   it went through something that that cut things into
[01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:03.600]   like spaghetti strands, you know, and then the final
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:05.600]   thing might take those spaghetti strands and like
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:06.400]   you could slide it over.
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:08.300]   So it's like a star shape and then the end you would
[01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:11.200]   get like spaghetti strands of the original colors
[01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:12.800]   coming out like shape like a star.
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:15.900]   So it's like pushing the Play-Doh through several
[01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:18.700]   layers of things that like modifies the Play-Doh
[01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:21.900]   and you could change what those things are basically
[01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:23.100]   at a very simple level.
[01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:25.300]   This is the architecture of large language models.
[01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:29.100]   They're a feed-forward architecture or the information
[01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:30.800]   which is the text.
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:33.200]   I mean it's embeddings of the text but like the text
[01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:36.300]   that it's reacting to gets pushed from one layer to
[01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:38.700]   the next to the next to the next.
[01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:40.700]   There's no recurrence.
[01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:41.500]   There's no looping.
[01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:42.600]   It just goes from one layer.
[01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:45.300]   The Play-Doh goes through the squisher then it gets
[01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:47.300]   changed to spaghetti strands then it goes through
[01:02:47.300 --> 01:02:48.100]   the star shaper.
[01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:50.500]   So it gets pushed through these layers as it gets
[01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:53.300]   pushed through these layers more each layer does
[01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:54.000]   its own work.
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.500]   It identifies patterns.
[01:02:56.500 --> 01:03:00.000]   It looks for labels.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.000]   Let's I'm saying this all using non-technical terminology
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.200]   it labels it with stuff that the next layer can then
[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:08.400]   use and look up other patterns and connect it to it,
[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:10.800]   but it's moving just inexorably forward.
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:14.000]   And at the very end so I imagine like someone's turning
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.200]   this crank that's pulling this digital Play-Doh through
[01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:19.200]   this factory at the very end what comes out is like
[01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:20.700]   a fancy Play-Doh shape.
[01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:23.000]   Now what it is with a chatbot is actually going to
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:26.000]   be a part of a word or a word or a group of words
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:26.600]   to output.
[01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:28.900]   I mean technically it's like a probability distribution
[01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:32.200]   over this but it's like a text new text output.
[01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:34.700]   So that's what the large language model does.
[01:03:34.700 --> 01:03:37.200]   Things get pushed through the language model itself
[01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:39.500]   just like the Play-Doh factory doesn't change once
[01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:40.300]   you've trained it.
[01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:42.100]   Nothing about it changes.
[01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:45.800]   It doesn't remember last time they put red Play-Doh
[01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:47.400]   through here and we're going to remember that and
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:48.900]   that's going to affect what we do this time.
[01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:49.600]   We put green Play-Doh.
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:52.300]   No, it's the exact same setup every time stuff goes
[01:03:52.300 --> 01:03:55.500]   through all this different is the type of Play-Doh
[01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:56.100]   you push through.
[01:03:56.100 --> 01:03:59.400]   Then you have a control program, right?
[01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:00.900]   So you have to have some sort of control program
[01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:04.500]   that like turns the crank, right?
[01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:06.800]   So it's like a with most chatbots like a relatively
[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:09.300]   simplistic control program that like takes the text
[01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:12.500]   you typed in and puts it into the language model
[01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:14.300]   and the language model spits out some words and
[01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:16.500]   typically because it's autoregressive it'll put
[01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:17.700]   those words on the end of the text.
[01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:19.400]   So now it's slightly longer and they'll do it again
[01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:21.000]   and they'll put those new words on I'll do it again.
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.600]   So it's kind of running the machine until it has
[01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:23.400]   your whole answer.
[01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:26.100]   If you're doing different media formats, there's
[01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:27.000]   more complexity.
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.800]   So like if you're sending a photo to chat GPT, the
[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:31.700]   control program will take the photo and actually
[01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:35.600]   give that to a photo recognizer program that will
[01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:37.600]   then describe that photo in words and then it will
[01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:39.400]   take those words and connect them to your original
[01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:43.100]   prompt and then we'll run the normal chat GPT control
[01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:45.800]   program to like ask that question and or if you're
[01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:47.700]   generating a photo, that's not a language model.
[01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:49.000]   That's going to be a different type of model.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000]   But this is basically how this how this works.
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:55.200]   So the the factory can produce really cool Play-Doh
[01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:58.200]   on the other end, but the factory itself doesn't
[01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:01.500]   have intentions because it's just a factory.
[01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:02.300]   Nothing changes.
[01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:02.900]   Nothing moves.
[01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:05.100]   It's a bunch of plates that you're pushing Play-Doh
[01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:07.800]   through. If you really want something to have
[01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:09.600]   instincts like a survival instinct, you'll need
[01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:12.500]   some notion of sentience which requires a combination
[01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:15.900]   of four things understanding of like the world
[01:05:15.900 --> 01:05:17.400]   like understanding of concepts, right?
[01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:19.700]   You have to have some sort of actual like intellectual
[01:05:19.700 --> 01:05:22.200]   contemplation. You need a sense of state.
[01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:24.300]   You have to keep track of like your understanding
[01:05:24.300 --> 01:05:26.500]   of the world that evolves as you get new information.
[01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:29.000]   So you need something to be reacting to you need
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.300]   some notion of drives.
[01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:31.700]   Like what is your goals, right?
[01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:33.200]   So there's these intentions have to come from
[01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:36.600]   somewhere and you need actuation the ability to
[01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:39.500]   actually then take actions either in the digital
[01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:42.100]   or physical world, you know based on the combination
[01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:43.000]   of all these four things.
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.900]   That's how you have something like a sentience.
[01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:46.900]   You can think of these large language models
[01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:48.800]   as basically just being the understanding part.
[01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:53.100]   It has this understanding built in of lots of
[01:05:53.100 --> 01:05:55.100]   different textual things and that's how it spits
[01:05:55.100 --> 01:05:57.800]   out the plate on the other end can be a really
[01:05:57.800 --> 01:05:59.900]   cool-looking design that matches in a really
[01:05:59.900 --> 01:06:01.800]   interesting way the play-doh that came in the front
[01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:03.500]   but in order for that thing to have survival
[01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:05.700]   instincts, it also needs some ongoing state
[01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:07.300]   that's keeping track of its understanding of
[01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:09.000]   the world. It needs a drive.
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.100]   So you have to explicitly say I want to survive
[01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:12.100]   again a play-doh factory.
[01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:14.600]   There's no thinking there you need actually some
[01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:17.000]   sort of program that's like is this action going
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.200]   to help me survive or not and then it needs the
[01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:20.300]   ability to take actions.
[01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:21.100]   That's actuation.
[01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:22.600]   That would be a completely different component.
[01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:26.700]   So there's no way that as architected right now
[01:06:26.700 --> 01:06:29.500]   as sort of one of these standard chatbots can
[01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:31.100]   have instincts because there is no state.
[01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:31.700]   There is no drive.
[01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:32.700]   There is no actuation.
[01:06:32.700 --> 01:06:35.500]   It's just a feed-forward play-doh factory that
[01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:37.100]   spits out words and a little control program
[01:06:37.100 --> 01:06:37.800]   that feeds them in.
[01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:43.400]   So no making the model bigger and better trained
[01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:45.600]   just makes the play-doh come out look fancier,
[01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:47.300]   but it doesn't give it any of those things.
[01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:49.400]   You cannot spontaneously have a feed-forward
[01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:52.700]   network with no changeable state and no recursion
[01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:55.500]   and no actuation and no drives like that by
[01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:56.600]   itself can't do anything.
[01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:58.700]   So Joe is wrong to say.
[01:06:58.700 --> 01:07:00.800]   Oh, I think these things just have drives or
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:05.000]   chat GPT is going to start copying itself.
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.200]   The chat GPT is just a factory defined by these
[01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:10.600]   models are just trillions of numbers and tables
[01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:12.200]   that are multiplied by GPUs.
[01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:18.300]   But where Joe is kind of right is the hard part
[01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:20.300]   in this formula understanding state drives
[01:07:20.300 --> 01:07:23.500]   actually actuation the hard parts the understanding
[01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:25.600]   and these language models have a pretty good
[01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:26.600]   understanding of thing.
[01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:31.400]   So it would not be that hard for someone to
[01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:33.900]   program those other three things pretty simplistically.
[01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:37.000]   All right, I have like a state of the world
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:37.900]   that I care about.
[01:07:37.900 --> 01:07:42.700]   I hard-coded in I when I'm evaluating actions,
[01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:47.200]   I want to do my goal is to like not be erased
[01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:49.400]   and then just plug it into actuation.
[01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:52.900]   I wrote a program here where you know, this
[01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:54.800]   program knows how to do things like on the
[01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:56.800]   internet. It can run commands and run scripts
[01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:59.100]   and I you know, and network with other types
[01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:00.900]   of things and then I'm going to hook these
[01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:01.900]   four things together.
[01:08:01.900 --> 01:08:05.500]   So like the state will you know, gather
[01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:08.400]   information give it to like a run it through
[01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:10.900]   the chat bot factory the the language model
[01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:14.200]   to kind of analyze it and ask it like hey,
[01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:16.100]   this is this thing good or bad if my goal
[01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:19.700]   was survival and then you know, what would
[01:08:19.700 --> 01:08:21.600]   you suggest then between these actions like
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:23.700]   it could start talking so the control programs
[01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:25.100]   could start talking to the language models
[01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:28.400]   to get its understanding or ideas and then
[01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:31.100]   choose actions based on that and in fact.
[01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:33.700]   There are systems built like this.
[01:08:33.700 --> 01:08:36.500]   Now, they're all right now in the category
[01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:37.900]   of game playing systems.
[01:08:37.900 --> 01:08:41.300]   But game playing AI's the advanced ones kind
[01:08:41.300 --> 01:08:41.900]   of work like this.
[01:08:41.900 --> 01:08:43.700]   Now you have like some understanding you
[01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:46.900]   have some planning you have a state of the
[01:08:46.900 --> 01:08:48.400]   world you like the state of the game or
[01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:50.600]   of the poker hands you have a drive like
[01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:53.100]   what we're trying to do is win and it talks
[01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:55.300]   to the the neural network the thing that's
[01:08:55.300 --> 01:08:57.400]   trained it has the understanding tries to
[01:08:57.400 --> 01:08:58.400]   figure out what to do.
[01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:01.700]   Like this is how there's a the the bot that
[01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:04.000]   first bought the win at Texas Hold'em poker.
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.500]   It does something like that.
[01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:08.300]   It's like a combination of a trained model
[01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:10.900]   that just understands things plus its own
[01:09:10.900 --> 01:09:13.100]   simulation and its own drive and its actuation
[01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:14.600]   which is making bets and playing cards.
[01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:16.500]   So we kind of know how to do this.
[01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:18.100]   Now the big companies don't care about that
[01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:20.200]   the money isn't not trying to build a sentient
[01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:21.500]   thing that's going to copy itself.
[01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:23.400]   The big money isn't trying to get to be
[01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:25.600]   the next email like we need this to be like
[01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:28.400]   helping people use advanced graphing features
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:29.000]   in Excel.
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.000]   That's where the money is.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.200]   So it's not like they're working on this.
[01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:34.400]   So you don't have to worry about like open
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:36.500]   AI's next release is going to be alive.
[01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:38.300]   No, the real worry is working with like
[01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:40.300]   deep seek or like a relatively small low
[01:09:40.300 --> 01:09:43.400]   cost model building these other pieces and
[01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:45.900]   letting that loose because I have this theory.
[01:09:45.900 --> 01:09:48.600]   I have this theory that where you're going
[01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:51.200]   to get the first uncomfortable AI by uncomfortable.
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:54.100]   I mean, I kind of am worried about what
[01:09:54.100 --> 01:09:55.700]   it's doing or worried about turning it off.
[01:09:55.700 --> 01:09:58.800]   It's going to be the combination of relatively
[01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:03.600]   simple dynamic programs that can loop and
[01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:05.700]   create sort of like cybernetic control loops
[01:10:05.700 --> 01:10:09.200]   for doing things like actuation drives and
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:12.000]   world-state connected to an unpredictable
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.100]   complicated understanding of the world like
[01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:16.100]   in a language model or something similar.
[01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:18.400]   And there's going to be this sort of runaway
[01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:21.500]   effect where simple control logic plus complex
[01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:22.400]   world understanding.
[01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:27.000]   Could lead to unpredictable complex seeming
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.100]   behavior that has real world impacts.
[01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:30.500]   So I don't mean to geek out too much, but
[01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:31.500]   like it's good news.
[01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:33.700]   No chat GPT doesn't have instincts.
[01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:35.400]   Plato factories can't there's nothing.
[01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:36.900]   It just things push through it and nothing
[01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:39.900]   changes to ossified built in stone.
[01:10:39.900 --> 01:10:42.600]   But the person turning to crank.
[01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:44.000]   Well, if you had a few people in there who
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.100]   are choosing the Plato that goes in and then
[01:10:46.100 --> 01:10:47.900]   based on what Plato came out deciding whether
[01:10:47.900 --> 01:10:49.800]   not to fire a missile or not, you can start
[01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:52.000]   to get some really sort of unsettling type
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:52.500]   of dynamics.
[01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:53.300]   So, I don't know.
[01:10:53.300 --> 01:10:54.500]   I've been thinking a lot about it.
[01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:56.100]   No one I know is building something like
[01:10:56.100 --> 01:10:59.600]   this, but I actually don't think unsettling
[01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:02.100]   AI doesn't require necessarily breakthroughs
[01:11:02.100 --> 01:11:03.000]   on the language model side.
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.700]   I think it's these other types of programs
[01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:06.400]   of which the language model would be one.
[01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:08.400]   So something to keep an eye on the good news
[01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:11.500]   is by the way is in this model, the state
[01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:13.000]   drives and actuation is just being programmed
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:13.600]   by people.
[01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:15.200]   It's not emergent.
[01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:16.100]   It's not unpredictable.
[01:11:16.100 --> 01:11:19.300]   So it's you know, you know what it is you
[01:11:19.300 --> 01:11:21.900]   can program that what what it can do what
[01:11:21.900 --> 01:11:22.500]   it can't do.
[01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:25.100]   You can turn it off like it's we have I call
[01:11:25.100 --> 01:11:26.700]   it intentional AI when I think about it more
[01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:27.300]   formally.
[01:11:27.300 --> 01:11:30.100]   We will have more control over those those
[01:11:30.100 --> 01:11:31.400]   hand-coated pieces.
[01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:34.000]   So it's not like when people have a concern
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.300]   as language models.
[01:11:35.300 --> 01:11:37.600]   We don't know they train them but the how
[01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:38.900]   they form their understanding is kind of
[01:11:38.900 --> 01:11:39.800]   foreign to us.
[01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:42.400]   So we're like, I don't know how it's like
[01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:43.600]   making its decisions.
[01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:47.000]   But if you're going to build a sentient ish
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.400]   AI using this model, I'm talking about, you
[01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:51.000]   know, exactly how the state control works,
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.900]   how the drive control works, how the actuation
[01:11:52.900 --> 01:11:54.500]   works. So it's in that sense is a little bit
[01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:56.400]   more predictable, but I don't know.
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:57.600]   It's an interesting world.
[01:11:57.600 --> 01:11:59.200]   So Joe's not he's not right.
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:11:59.800]   He's not wrong.
[01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:02.200]   That's a way of putting it.
[01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:03.900]   I have to listen to all that again.
[01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:05.700]   Yeah, for sure.
[01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:08.600]   But we are a technology podcast now number
