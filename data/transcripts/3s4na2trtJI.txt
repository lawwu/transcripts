[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.640]   Happy Friday. Thank you for listening to the podcast and joining us today. Today, Pastor
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:16.320]   John joins us over the telephone for a question from a perplexed father who writes in anonymously.
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.200]   Pastor John, my adult son wants to get a divorce from his wife. They have been married for
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.880]   two years and have a one-year-old son and a newborn baby girl of 10 days old. I'm totally
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.240]   perplexed by the timing. I don't understand why he feels unhappy, but he claims he is
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:38.120]   no longer in love with his wife anymore. What would you say to someone who has "fallen out
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.440]   of love" with their spouse, and why is that no grounds for divorce?
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:51.280]   Well, what I would say to them face-to-face would depend partly on their demeanor, but
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.020]   I don't have him face-to-face. And so I'm just going to say what I think he probably
[00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:04.720]   needs to hear, whether I would say it exactly like this, I don't know, but here we go. We
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:12.560]   would be naive, I think, to suppose that people, young or old, our own children or those of
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.600]   others will act on the basis of reason and biblical truth when it comes to justifying
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.760]   divorce. I would guess that 95 cases out of 100 people do what they want to do and then
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:31.960]   find reasons to do it, especially those who claim to believe the Bible, find biblical
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.620]   reasons to do it. They just know what they're going to do. They want to do it, they do it.
[00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:43.960]   So we should be realistic as we talk to people, and we should pray. I think that's the greatest
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:52.960]   realism. Pray and fast that God would do what our biblical arguments and reasonings by themselves
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:02.080]   could never do. But having said that, I totally believe in speaking the truth in love, because
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.260]   it's God's way, it's God's design that people should know the truth, and the truth would
[00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:14.280]   set them free, and that context is free from sin, like leaving your wife. So I would hang
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:23.920]   my thoughts on three wordsâ€”joy, significance, and ownership. I would try to make those three
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:31.560]   words as compelling and winsome as I can, but also as forceful as Jesus and the apostles
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:40.720]   did for the sake of staying married. So let me say a word about what I mean by joy, significance,
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:48.640]   and ownership. Joy. I would say to this young man who wants a divorce because he's not in
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:03:00.600]   love, "Oh, what joy lies ahead for those who do not break their covenant even when their
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:08.700]   hearts are broken." And here's what I mean. I believe that most couples who stay married
[00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:17.640]   for 50 or 60 years fall in and out of love numerous times. And I say that with not the
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:26.440]   slightest hint of trying to be funny. It is, in my judgment, almost ludicrous to think
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:36.200]   that we experience as being in love for the entire 60 years what we felt at the beginning
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:44.520]   of that relationship. That's just utterly crazy. It is naive and immature to think that
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:51.800]   staying married is mainly about staying in love. In a relationship between two sinners,
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:04:00.440]   forced to live as close as married couples live, it is naive to think that every season
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:07.000]   will be one of warmth and sweetness and sexual romance. That's just contrary to almost the
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.280]   entire history of the world and contrary to every makeup of fallen human nature. Staying
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:22.040]   married is not first about staying in love, it's about covenant-keeping, promise-keeping,
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:29.500]   being a man and woman of your word, a man and woman who keep the vows to be committed
[00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:37.880]   for better or for worse, a man and a woman of character. That's what it's about. This
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:45.800]   covenant-keeping relates to being in love. Get this, because I thought about how to say
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:54.080]   this. This covenant-keeping relates to being in love the way gardening in the fall relates
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:03.420]   to roses in the spring. This is why I said a minute ago, "Oh, what joy lies ahead for
[00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:08.700]   those who do not break their covenant even when their hearts are broken." The modern
[00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:19.580]   world of self-centeredness and self-exaltation and self-expression has taken the normal 50-year
[00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:26.120]   process of falling in and out of love and turned it into a 50-year process of multiple
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:34.780]   divorces and remarriages. That pattern has not and will not bear the fruit of joy. It
[00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:42.940]   leaves a trail of misery in the soul and misery along the generations. Marriage is the hardest
[00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:53.400]   relationship to stay in and the one that promises glorious, unique, durable joys for those who
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:06:01.980]   have the character to keep their covenant. So that's what I mean by joy. Now here's what
[00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:09.540]   I mean by significance. God offers to husbands and wives the highest possible significance
[00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:17.960]   for their marriage relationship by showing them what its greatest and most glorious meaning
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:26.820]   is, namely, the replication in the world of the covenant relationship between Christ and
[00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:35.920]   his bride, the Church. That's what the highest meaning of marriage is. There is no higher,
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:41.140]   more glorious, more significant conception of marriage than the one that Paul portrays
[00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:49.460]   in Ephesians 5, a parable of the greatest, strongest, deepest, sweetest, richest relationship
[00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:56.420]   in the universe, the blood-bought union between Christ, the Son of God, and his bride, the
[00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:03.760]   Church. That's the meaning. That's the significance of marriage. And I would just say to this
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:12.940]   young man that you are acting, or about to act, on one of the lowest views of marriage.
[00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:18.860]   Not one of the highest, one of the lowest views of marriage. If you divorce because
[00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:27.260]   you don't feel love anymore, there is nothing noble, nothing great, nothing beautiful, nothing
[00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:36.340]   high, nothing truly significant about such a motive. What does it say about Christ, the
[00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:44.220]   model of a man's commitment in marriage? What does it say if he forsakes his wife because
[00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:52.500]   he doesn't feel like staying anymore? What does it say about Christ? That's the issue.
[00:07:52.500 --> 00:08:01.160]   Marriage is an act of worship. It's a display of the price and the preciousness of the covenant-keeping
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:10.360]   love between Christ and his Church. Covenant-keeping in marriage glorifies Christ and the blood
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:19.180]   he shed to possess a bride forever. We cannot even conceive of a greater significance of
[00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:27.560]   marriage than the one God has given. And lastly, the word "ownership." What do I mean by ownership?
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:32.460]   What I mean by ownership is that the union between a man and a woman isn't theirs to
[00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:41.180]   break. They didn't create it. They can't break it. It's not theirs. Jesus said, "What
[00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:51.460]   therefore God has joined together, let not man separate." It's another sign of the
[00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:58.540]   man-centeredness and contemporary self-centeredness of Christianity that a young couple would
[00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:04.700]   have the mindset that they created the union called marriage and therefore they can break
[00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:11.060]   it. They didn't create it. They can't break it. God made it. God breaks it with death.
[00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:18.980]   Or as I think Paul would say, you are free to break your marriage covenant when Christ
[00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:29.180]   breaks his covenant with his bride. So for the sake of maximum long-term joy, and for
[00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:36.740]   the sake of the deepest and highest significance, and for the sake of the maker and owner of
[00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:47.500]   your union, keep your covenant. Oh, what joy lies ahead beyond anything you can presently
[00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:53.460]   imagine for those who keep their covenant even when their hearts are broken.
[00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:58.540]   Yeah, that's a bold claim and appropriate. There's a lot here to think about for every
[00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:03.820]   married couple. Thank you, Pastor John. And thank you for sending us this very raw question.
[00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:06.540]   It's appreciated that you sent it in to us. And thank you for listening and making the
[00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:10.860]   podcast part of your week. You can subscribe to our audio feeds and search our past episodes
[00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:14.300]   in our archive. You can reach us by email with a question of your own, even questions
[00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:21.780]   related to marriage and divorce. You can do all that through our online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:27.860]   Well speaking of marriage pressures, ministry is demanding work. And I know from looking
[00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:31.980]   at all of the APJ questions that we've gotten over the years, there are a lot of discouraged
[00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:38.380]   pastors and wives of pastors who are not flourishing in their local church roles. And Pastor John,
[00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:42.860]   you are not unfamiliar with the discouragement of pastoral ministry. On Monday, Pastor John
[00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:46.120]   will be back with me in the studio to share from his own personal experience about a season
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:50.580]   of life which was especially dark in the ministry and the takeaways that he has from it. You
[00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:54.140]   won't want to miss it. Even if you're not a leader or in pastoral ministry, you won't
[00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:58.220]   want to miss this. I am your host, Tony Reinke. Have a great weekend. We'll see you on Monday.
[00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:00.220]   [END]
[00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:10.220]   1. What is your favorite part of the ministry? #AskPastorJohn
