[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680]   people always ask me we did not have people beating down our doors like I
[00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.560]   always one of the things I've heard throughout the course of Barstool you
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.680]   should be making so much money here and doing this there and deals there it's
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.080]   like I'm looking no one I don't see these mythical deals everyone's talking
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:40.440]   about and there was no bidding war when churning came around Dave Portnoy thanks
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:47.680]   for joining us yep Barstool Dave you obviously own and run a media
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.640]   business I guess best way to describe it Barstool's got media franchises spanning
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.840]   sports gambling pizza reviews and you've got a huge audience you've you've been
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.680]   through an incredible corporate history which I think one of the things we
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.360]   wanted to talk about today was talking about the business if you're up for it
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.480]   yep and talk a little bit about the history of the business super interesting
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.640]   to us when the acquisition happened with Penn and the subsequent buyback we
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.000]   thought it was a super interesting story we actually reached out and tried to
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.120]   have a conversation with you at that time about it but unfortunately missed
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.080]   you so we're really glad to have you here today we'll hope to talk about that
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.840]   hope to talk about media free speech politics I think there's a lot of stuff
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.800]   you've talked about that we often talk about that I think we'd love to just
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.000]   have a dialogue and we'll see where this goes sounds good yeah welcome to the
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.320]   all-in interview and thanks for being with us and Chamath anything you want to
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.880]   start with tell us about just getting out of New York yeah so we were saying
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:49.520]   before we relocate to New York in 2016 when churning bought half the company
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:56.040]   it was basically the concept was create a reality blog media type company turn
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.920]   the lights on see what happened let everyone see it into the company and it
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.400]   was easier to get talent we thought New York attract people to work and when
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.800]   athletes or entertainers come through they usually stop in New York and we can
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.200]   grab them into the office so that's why I moved there I don't think anybody in
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.360]   our company loved New York it was not I mean I personally think it's a dirty
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:23.280]   city I don't like it I just not my favorite cup of tea and then I also got
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.000]   a lot of money so once we're starting to get more money with and I guess fast
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.880]   forward me because when we did a second the pen deal I was like I'm not the
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.640]   taxes are so crazy there Florida I went during kovat because it was an open
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.360]   state that's really what initiated this whole thing is when kovat happened New
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.800]   York locked down Florida was pretty much open so I went there visited and then
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.280]   kind of stayed there longer term during kovat Black Lives Matter happened a lot
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.120]   of things are happening in New York City and like I may stay in Miami were you
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.520]   the only shareholder when churning when Peter bought 35 or whatever 40% of the
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:07.760]   business Peter bought 51 right at that time 51% so for employees of mine I had
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.080]   given equity like hey if something happens you have small it wasn't any I
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.680]   don't even know if it's on paper but for the most part yes I had given away 10 to
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.960]   12% of the company to my long-term employees that was 2016 and when they
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:27.320]   bought when churning bought 51% was that a buyout or that money going into the
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.520]   company so they fit yeah they valued the company and I think 12 and a half
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.320]   million wildly I didn't know what I was doing they really that was too low but
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.640]   whatever that's what they valued it for I think I got about if I recall three
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.520]   and a half million went to me personally and then the rest went into the business
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:51.080]   account right and then you ran it you moved it to New York and you ran the
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.080]   business for a couple years and obviously things took off the the
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.960]   business grew we're turning group like active at this time like were they
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.120]   helpful or was it you building the business and they were just kind of
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.680]   quiet financial sponsors how yeah how did that face go so when they they
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.000]   purchased us they basically gave the money we did we weren't great at
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.680]   business the first thing we did we went out and hired Eric and our genius CEO so
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.480]   she really helped expand the business side of what we were doing and we
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.800]   exploded but churning to answer your question they weren't involved at all I
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.800]   think they really I mean slightly here or there if we had a question I think
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.920]   the biggest thing they did is probably credibility like I was probably seen as
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.200]   and still am at times like a wild card like you don't know what you're dealing
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.880]   with and you put the churn and name on it it's like oh these guys are legit
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.240]   they're real and maybe helped us get into meetings and doors but they weren't
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:50.340]   any day-to-day operations at all probably I would say the best thing they
[00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.640]   did is they stayed out of our way well that's that's crazy because they in like
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.600]   three and a half years almost or maybe four years you took the business from
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:03.040]   like twelve and a half million valuation to like this is the question I yeah the
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:09.300]   question is Dave when that business explodes are you are you spending like a
[00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.200]   few minutes every day saying god damn why did I do this deal like or did you
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.640]   think it was really still worth it you know when the company goes I never
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:23.120]   question it because again turn it we did people always ask me we did not have
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.920]   people beating down our doors like I always one of the things I've heard
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.520]   throughout the course of bar sold you should be making so much money here and
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.240]   doing this there and deals there it's like I'm looking no one I don't see
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.860]   these mythical deals everyone's talking about and there was no bidding war when
[00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:46.520]   churning came around so while understanding it my biggest thing I've
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.240]   never sold the company I wasn't looking to sell a company when they approached
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.760]   us they really were looking at like our gross revenue and I didn't care about
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.520]   gross revenue at all I care about making a profit and putting money in my pocket
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.440]   and that's how we that's how we earned our living they were basing our net
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.200]   worth they give me like comps of other companies I'm like we are way bigger
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.040]   than they are but they like well they've gross sales and all this like well
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.080]   they're losing money like I if you want if I had a year to build up for that
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.920]   sale and I just want to inflate our gross revenue I could done that easily I
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.880]   did it so we definitely sold it for far less but at the same time they were the
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.840]   a they were one of the only serious offers we had and they stayed out of our
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.440]   way they were kind of in a way the perfect partner outside the price
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:36.040]   because they let us do our thing so I didn't regret it and so when the pen
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:39.920]   deal came around was that you saying guys we have to really think about this
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.360]   or is that churn and saying we need to think about this before you get to the
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.200]   pen deal how did how did the growth how did the business go crazy over that
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.400]   three-and-a-half years did you invest a lot of capital at that time I mean how
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:54.760]   did the business go from you know twelve and a half to half a billion dollars is
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.120]   it that you bet you shifted the strategy and said hey let's go after a revenue
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:03.800]   now or I think it was it was probably two major things we we Erica was a
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.280]   perfect hire and built out the business side and people just totally
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:12.280]   underestimated us like I knew how big we were and in a weird way I think a lot of
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:16.080]   times even though people know us now they still are kind of flabbergasted
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:21.160]   when you go under the hood and see our influence like we barstools around 20
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:26.680]   years so during the time that we sold I always gave the analogy and this is old
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.840]   internet but people throw numbers out and how big their audience was and it's
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.840]   like if you're watching TV and someone has a remote control and they're just
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:38.400]   clicking every every second it's like everybody got one view like my network
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.600]   has a view my network has a view and I'd be telling people yeah but ours aren't
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.320]   changing the channel like they're what they're our viewer is one they're on in
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:50.200]   the channel for 30 minutes listening so our influence was just underestimated so
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:53.440]   when you and we did nothing on the business side like we really were so
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:58.680]   busy on creating content and you had to knock down our door to advertise with us
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:03.240]   so when we change that philosophy like let's build out the business side our
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:06.400]   tech all of it with our existing audience it was just kind of like a
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:10.920]   powder keg that exploded it didn't shock me to be honest granted the original
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:15.520]   business plan said in five years they wanted to sell it for like 50 million
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:20.520]   that was the original business plan and we got past that in like six months but
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:23.940]   you guys you guys decided to build quote-unquote in the wild like you had
[00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:28.160]   cameras inside you made stars of some of the people in there was that organic or
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.040]   with that that was like an explicit decision you're like this could be
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:34.800]   really interesting because these people are really odd characters they'll be
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:39.880]   great for television yeah so it was organic in the sense I started barstool
[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:43.200]   I didn't want anyone know who I was it was strictly business it was a it was
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:47.680]   supposed to be like a gambling rag and I had fake names and all this but in the
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:52.560]   early days of the newspaper it slowly shifted that people were much more
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:56.960]   interested in the personalities behind everything so by the time we went to
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:00.560]   New York we knew with the focus should be on the personalities and the people
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:05.360]   we had working here and we have this wild cast of characters and we had a bit
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:09.000]   we were hiring people that were no one else would ever hire or give a chance I
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.520]   often say we're one of the first like digital true digital media companies
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:17.840]   like the people we found all the way from a Jenna Marbles to Pat McAfee to
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:23.520]   Alex Cooper McAfee couldn't get a job when he was done punting like you how
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:29.600]   did you hire McAfee how did he was a fan McAfee was a fan and we met him during a
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.520]   Super Bowl like we were at the Super Bowl and we couldn't get credentialed we
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:38.760]   had an RV that we parked outside and guests come on McAfee came on and he
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:42.560]   knew he wanted to get into media I think he wanted to work at ESPN they wouldn't
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:47.960]   hire him we did and obviously the rest of history with him Alex Cooper had a
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:53.000]   podcast that she just started we saw a sizzle reel for it it was something we'd
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.200]   never seen before so we called her into the office and when I met her she
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:02.280]   basically was like well I edited and made this entire sizzle reel myself like
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:06.120]   how'd you do that she's like I self-taught myself so we hired her no
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:10.520]   idea what would become with her podcast but we were willing to take chances
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:14.740]   almost like a band label type model it's like you hire this talent and you hope
[00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:19.200]   they hit there's a lot of misses we have how do you look at that like is it just
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:23.280]   instinct intuition you you see someone you're like they got it they don't have
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:27.920]   it I mean you kind of yeah it is instinct but it's wrong a lot of times
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:32.120]   that's why I go to the band label like you hear something this is unique this
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:37.240]   is interesting I may it may not always work for me like in my own personality a
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:40.480]   lot of the people who come from networks they're so used to being told what to do
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:44.120]   it's like all the way up this is how you produce it this is the hits this is what
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:48.280]   you have to do we didn't do any that it's Alex go do your thing sink or swim
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:53.120]   on the internet the beauty of the internet it will tell you voting machine
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:58.440]   it's all right yes oh yeah you know that's not true on ESPN maybe more so
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:03.000]   now but if you have you know Sports Center back in the day or you have the
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.520]   NFL show or your CBS you almost have to watch it old terrestrial radio there
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:11.640]   aren't options the internet like you said a voting machine so we'd hire
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:15.400]   people and let the internet decide what became of them you know the old studio
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:18.600]   model Dave they would have talent development and so there would be these
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.760]   producers that would come in and help the talent get better train and teach
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:26.520]   them the art etc but it sounds like do you guys do that I mean do you kind of
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:29.200]   stay out of their way you kind of let them run let them figure it out
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:33.720]   themselves and there's no training there's no tools there's no toolkit that
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:37.200]   says here's how you become successful here's how you here's what you got a hit
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.040]   on here's what you got to do well here's what you got to learn not to do etc yeah
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:43.320]   we don't do any of that I would say all those people anybody who tried to do
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:46.920]   what you just described would not be with us and I'd say is a dinosaur like
[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:51.320]   again the people we've hired from networks the talent it's like they need
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:55.160]   their handheld for the most part there are so waiting this is what you do this
[00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:59.720]   is what you say and we don't do any of that yeah so the raw independent talent
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:02.760]   you just let them run they take off so then the business blows up yeah and then
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:07.360]   yeah tell us about the pen deal like how did that how did that conversation start
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:11.960]   when it happened we talked about it on our show because Chamath and I have
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:16.120]   talked a lot about this idea of the individual influencer media brands need
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:20.040]   to monetize in non-traditional ways it's not just about selling ads but there's
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:24.280]   kind of you know CPG businesses are being launched by Kim Kardashian and
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:28.440]   Kylie Jenner and there's an entirely new business model that's emerged with the
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:31.720]   independent media businesses that have been created over the last decade and
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:36.240]   this seemed like a very good example of that I guess how did the conversation
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:40.160]   with Penn start and how did that that deal kind of come about yeah so they
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.880]   changed the laws in the United States that's what sparked it when they said
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:48.320]   get sports gambling was going to become legal and a state issue we started when I
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:51.720]   started the thing we were a gambling newspaper like that's what we were so
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:57.760]   when that happened I instantly was like this is our chance so we proactively
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:05.400]   went out and tried to solicit deals like I had worked with Draftkings I'd worked
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:08.960]   with FanDuel back then Draftkings when they were four people they offered me
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:12.280]   stock in the company they're they're Boston guys I remember we sat down and
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:15.720]   we were kind of building our thing they were building there so I knew this space
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:22.600]   inside and out we really didn't get any offers we hired molas which is like a
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:28.400]   banking sign oh yeah they suck absolutely suck behind the door is one
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:32.160]   of the guys trashed me so the reason they weren't getting any offers was
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:36.120]   because I was like an ass or something to that effect I caught wind of that
[00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:41.760]   still irks me they got one penny of Commission on that sale but right the
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:47.800]   pen came through we had a guy David who's in the gambling space who
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:54.040]   introduced us to pen I had never heard of them and Erica and I hit it off with
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:14:00.840]   Jay Snowden the CEO and that deal basically was exclusively negotiated
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:05.840]   between Jay and I Eric involved to churning wasn't involved they didn't
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:09.600]   really want to talk to churning they want to talk to Erica and I because
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:13.640]   that's who they would be dealing with so it's like what's Dave about does Dave
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:18.960]   and Erica get along what's the company about and we negotiated that deal pretty
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:23.560]   much exclusively and then the deal was set up as a two-stage right like they
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:27.120]   bought a piece and then they bought the rest later correct which yeah my
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:33.720]   understanding of it it was always going to happen that way like right and and
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:37.560]   you know there are conversations that maybe would have changed our fortunes
[00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:41.320]   who knows like in the beginning do we call it parcel sports book or not
[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:45.560]   because some people may not have a taste for bar so I argued we should we lose
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:49.240]   what is one of the great things I could have been wrong because dealing with
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:56.200]   state legislatures and government is a bear but it was always let's not go all
[00:14:56.200 --> 00:15:02.440]   in right right away because we don't want to shock gambling like legislatures
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:06.080]   let's start it slower and say we don't own them and then eventually we'll
[00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:09.600]   acquire the whole thing so that was always the plan and the price points
[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:14.360]   were kind of mapped out and the thought from Penn is if Dave and Erica are
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:19.520]   creating all this great content we can integrate our sports book in there and
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:23.600]   now we just have a much cheaper way to get a lot more customers as gambling
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:27.600]   becomes legal all throughout America correct yes their basic bet and they had
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:31.520]   no national brand so in that sense they're the perfect fit like they owned
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:37.360]   all these scattered casinos throughout the country most of them people probably
[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:40.840]   haven't heard of unless you live in that area but what that did do is it gave
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:44.840]   them licenses for the sports gambling so it's like what brand are they gonna
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:49.440]   launch with they didn't have one so in that we were the perfect fit and the
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:56.280]   launch is actually very successful in terms of you know we were up 15% or so
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:16:00.840]   in Pennsylvania other states pretty good launches but super competitive but yeah
[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:05.240]   that was the theory behind so what what happened what then the deal kind of
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:09.480]   turned upside down pretty quickly right yeah I would say quickly because I
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:15.640]   thought we were kind of moving and grooving for a while our model was
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:21.680]   essentially we're not gonna pay for advertising like where the advertising
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:27.680]   vehicle so the people that space are spending hundreds of millions of dollars
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:33.440]   and they're losing hundreds of millions of dollars in the market shares it's you
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:37.960]   mean the cut the gambling companies correct dragons fan yeah MGM Caesars
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:41.800]   hundreds of millions hundreds of millions we're spending none they bought
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:46.400]   us so we're getting smashed in that regard but we're still kind of holding
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:51.920]   our market share which I thought was pretty strong
[00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:58.080]   our tech wasn't great and I think we knew that they bought a company the
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:02.360]   score for two billion I think they spent a lot of money on the score for the tech
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:07.440]   and it took a while for that to come out we didn't control it I was under the
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:13.640]   impression for the past football season we didn't promote that heart like you
[00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:17.640]   kind of waited because we're waiting for the new tech and then by the time the
[00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:23.320]   new tech came out they formed the deal with ESPN and we were done so did they
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:26.480]   step in and tell you how to run the company during that time were they kind
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:32.160]   of active and changing stuff or did they kind of leave you alone as well I think
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:36.640]   they were a headache for Erica in the sense of like we had to report now to a
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:41.760]   public company and and there was maybe more emphasis on the bottom line I
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:46.920]   didn't get affected by it outside of like of a scandal hit in their public
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:51.120]   company but they were they were pretty they were pretty lenient again there
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:54.680]   were things that came up in that relationship like that I don't think
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:18:00.000]   anybody could protect I still think we could do a very good we're very good at
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.680]   promoting gambling and and for pennies on the dollar consider can pair to what
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:11.320]   other companies do you yes they did an ESPN deal without your knowledge or were
[00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:14.720]   they did they tell you hey we got this this inbound from ESPN and we're trying
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:18.280]   to figure out what to do with it they did the ESPN deal without without me
[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:25.120]   being involved mm-hmm yeah you find out on the back end of that correct and so
[00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:29.960]   how did you structure this deal to then get it out because it seems I mean that
[00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:33.280]   press was even more incredible than the press on the way in because it's like
[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:38.240]   Portnoy just executed a really sick deal it looked like yeah I think there's was
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:44.040]   just a basic feeling from Penn and us that the the Barstool ESPN worlds are
[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:49.400]   different they were gonna partner with ESPN they tried with us and I think the
[00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:54.200]   biggest the hiccup with me and my persona and what people feel about me
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:59.280]   it's one thing what is your persona and what do people feel about you depends
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:02.520]   who you ask some people love me and they'll be like this guy should run for
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:07.280]   president and some people think I'm the devil so depends what article you read
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:13.960]   but you know all the things that uh you know what what do they look like that
[00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:18.280]   person and who hates you what do they look like I well I'd say a rational
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:23.600]   person likes me and a crazy person doesn't like me but that's my own I feel
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:29.320]   the same way yeah I mean I think if you're going stereotypical is you're
[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:33.400]   gonna say the right generally likes me in the left extreme left generally
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:38.400]   doesn't I think that the moderates on both sides generally like me but you
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:44.880]   know my core beliefs generally tend and people who follow me for a long time
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:52.480]   know this tend to line up with the left more than it does with the right but the
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:56.920]   hate I get comes from the left not the right you're a man without a home yeah
[00:19:56.920 --> 00:20:02.800]   it's an interesting kind of philosophy they have there but I will say if you
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:06.280]   say something that goes contrary to either side they'll equally jump down
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:09.600]   your throat and be like ah forget everything we've said about him like I
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:13.640]   remember I said it's pro-choice once and and I mean the right wanted to slip my
[00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:18.520]   cut my tongue out of my mouth I mean they were coming from people who had for
[00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:22.680]   ten years been like we love this guy we love this guy we love this guy disagreed
[00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:26.440]   on one point now like we hate this guy we hate this guy we hate this guy so uh
[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:31.480]   both I guess I'm a man without a home is a fair way to put it but Dave at the end
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:36.600]   of the day it's like you speak your mind and people appreciate someone who speaks
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:43.600]   their mind and speaks their truth yeah or you speak the agenda and if you speak
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:46.680]   the agenda they say we like you and if you don't speak the agenda we don't like
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:51.960]   you yeah and it varies from if you cannot speak the agenda and they don't
[00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:55.480]   like you but if you get back on agenda on the next thing they like you again
[00:20:55.480 --> 00:21:00.160]   they don't they don't stay too firm on on it's just what you said last is
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:03.920]   basically what it is and I've always said I the biggest issue I have a lot of
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:07.720]   things I don't want to know what somebody thinks on an issue by their
[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:14.200]   political affiliation like and I think 95% of the time you hear political
[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:17.280]   people speak you already know what they're gonna say based on their
[00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:21.800]   affiliation which is sad and stinks hundred percent the flip side of that
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:27.960]   there's more people I know that there's far more people who think like I do and
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:32.360]   I feel like that's the norm but a normal person also doesn't want to get in
[00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:36.800]   screaming matches about politics and yeah total craziness totally and on any
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:42.640]   given topic or policy you got a point of view but if you don't conform to all the
[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:47.760]   topics and policies that the agenda is defined to be by that party then you
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:51.320]   don't fit and you're ousted anyway you can't be an independent thinker today
[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:54.360]   yeah do you think wild and we talked about this a lot because we just did our
[00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:57.880]   all-in summit this week and this this was a repeated theme with all the people
[00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:03.120]   we had we had Kirsten cinema she was a senator from Arizona you know she she
[00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:06.520]   got kind of ousted from the Democratic Party for speaking her mind and not kind
[00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:10.400]   of conforming to what the Democrats were telling her to do we have Barry Weiss
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:13.260]   who left the New York Times she was an editor at the New York Times and she
[00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:17.520]   didn't want to conform to their agenda and she started her own publication
[00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:21.460]   called the free press so we this was repeated a lot some of the academics we
[00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:26.440]   had were similarly ousted from from their communities anytime you don't
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:29.160]   speak the agenda and you speak your mind you kind of get ousted and then you're
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:32.840]   on the outskirts and you kind of have to start afresh do you think that this is a
[00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:35.960]   new phenomenon in America or do you think this has always been the case and
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:39.400]   we're just all kind of waking up to it because we're you know in your case
[00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:43.000]   you're more kind of celebrity now you're more well-known and this is becoming
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.800]   more of an issue for you has this always been how things have been I would guess
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:54.320]   it has been this way far far more than I realized of I think the internet
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:57.800]   certainly changes a lot of things because people have more voice and more
[00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:03.960]   access to information but I bet it's been like this a lot I mean I grew up in
[00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:09.480]   a house where like the New York Times is gospel and my dad hates Trump like my
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:13.200]   dad hates him hates him hates him my mom hates him hates him hates him and then I
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:18.640]   came under attacks from like the New York Times and that was confusing for
[00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:23.920]   like my dad it's like he's seen things that he's like I don't understand how
[00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:28.040]   this is happening and I'm showing him document stuff but yeah I probably think
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:34.680]   it has been this way because it's about power really and power is always
[00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:41.080]   something throughout history that people go pretty far to control maintain so I
[00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:45.700]   would guess this has been going on for a long time we interviewed Trump you did
[00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:49.520]   as well what was that experience like what did you think about him before
[00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:53.920]   going into it what did you think after and then when you shared it with your
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:57.160]   parents what did that do to your relationship with your parents or their
[00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:05.200]   thoughts about him yeah my so I was when Trump ran the first time I was like I'm
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:09.200]   Trump because I think politics are so broken and I think he's somebody who can
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:13.280]   just kind of like make a mockery of it and break politics I said you needed a
[00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:17.800]   torpedo yes now I didn't think I was gonna win the presidency I was stunned I
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:23.200]   was nervous when I went to interview him to be honest because he asked me I had
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:28.160]   like 24 hours notice he was still sitting president I don't do interviews
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:35.960]   so I was nervous when I went in my thought on him was well I thought it was
[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:45.800]   funny and interesting but he gets if you if someone is interviewing me and I
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:50.240]   think they hate my guts and I think no matter what this interview comes out I
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:54.360]   could have the cure for cancer and they'd be like no you don't or I give
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:59.600]   you a dollar and they want a hundred if I just think it's no matter what happens
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:04.800]   they're gonna try to crucify me I would probably be like an arrogant head in
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:10.080]   that interview he when he realized that I was not trying to like gotcha or
[00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:14.660]   anything he was affable open and normal I think that's what happens with him
[00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:19.560]   quite a bit it's like he senses instantly it's not hard to tell who's
[00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:23.000]   coming first throat who's gonna be fair who's on his side and that changes his
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:29.760]   demeanor you know I've done a decent amount of research I feel like on Trump
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:34.640]   people everyone he's lying and this and that like that's what the left always
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:38.080]   says he's a liar that's a lie that's a lie and I read an article just like last
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:44.000]   week it was from Time magazine is like top 10 lies he's told and most of the
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:50.520]   lies tend to be what I would say are exaggerations like he talks how he would
[00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:54.480]   if he was on barstool like I'm gonna build like a hundred he said he's gonna
[00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:59.240]   build a thousand feet of wall and he built like 300 feet or they're all like
[00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:04.840]   they're not they're great like even how he talks in the debate you know like
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:11.200]   they're eating the pets and he's just not presidential and then those things
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:16.640]   get taken and there he's a liar does this but they're not what I would say
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:22.520]   egregious lies most of them they're quite clear exaggerations and he doesn't
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:28.600]   talk like a president and whether that helps or hurts him down the road I just
[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:35.200]   think he's he's a not presidential president I said during the primaries I
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:40.040]   would I would have voted for Nikki Haley I'll vote for Trump in the presidency
[00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:47.440]   because I want the country to get along I don't know if they can with him
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:51.840]   because it's not his fault necessarily to me but they just people just he's
[00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:56.720]   broken people's brains they're like they're just broken it's the you see
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:27:01.640]   people it's like they're not making any sense the things they jump on like it
[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:06.240]   there's no there's nothing he can say yeah I'll make him that'll make him say
[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:12.240]   what do you think what do you think happens if Kamala wins it's probably
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:18.840]   more of the same you know I I think that what the Democrats have done is far
[00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:23.840]   worse than really anything Trump has done like in terms of not allowing a
[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:28.720]   primary to me that's crazy like I'm somebody who if I liked a candidate and
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:33.620]   the Democrat Democrat side I could have potentially voted for that person like
[00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:39.400]   to not give people a choice and they really still haven't figured out well
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:45.720]   was he not prepared like is he not mentally aware can he not run is he too
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:49.080]   old he just thought he was gonna lose the the theorem you just thought he was
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:53.720]   gonna lose it's not a real answer he ran like you have to then let other people
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:59.600]   run and if he's not mentally there which I don't think he is Kamala has known
[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:03.800]   that like and she just lied about it forever and then they kick him out so
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:10.080]   there's so many problems I have with the way she never got a vote like I that I
[00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:14.920]   don't know you can say whatever you want about Trump he won the Republican
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:20.160]   nomination by landslide fair and square and Kamala did not so to me that's a
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:26.200]   major major issue some of her past statements for me are just like nutty
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:31.520]   and I don't like what's happened in a lot of Democratic states so I would vote
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:39.160]   like I hope if she's elected it like California and New York those don't
[00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:41.640]   become what happens the United States I don't know that it will I don't know
[00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:47.100]   that that much can change is it hard to build a company of young creative people
[00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:52.560]   in New York that abide by the culture that you want or do you find yourself
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:55.600]   pushing up against all kinds of things that you're just like what are these
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:59.220]   people asking for I don't get it no because we hire I think the hardest
[00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:03.600]   thing is just cost of living and taxes and things like that for our employees
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:09.680]   to live in New York City it's extremely expensive we wouldn't run into the
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:14.680]   people who think in our proper employees for us they're there and by the way we
[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:18.460]   have across Barstow we have super liberal conservative we have it all and
[00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:22.720]   they clash internally like how normal humans would but it's really the cost of
[00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:27.400]   living like in taxes and you know it's just really really hard for a young
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:31.960]   person you know you could pay him 200 grand a year and that is barely enough
[00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:36.160]   for someone to live in Manhattan okay well talk about that for a second you
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:40.560]   know a lot of the undercurrent of why people are angry is that there's just
[00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:44.880]   really exaggerated wealth inequality right there's folks like us that have
[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:48.720]   sort of been lucky good whatever you want to call it on the right side of
[00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:51.760]   doing well and then there's all those other people with the potential to do
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:56.840]   well but they're constrained somehow and it's just getting harder and harder you
[00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:59.680]   have sympathy for that argument do you have any sense of like what should be
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:06.800]   done to fix that I do and it's such a hard thing to answer because I do but I
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:13.760]   also think at times it's a crutch like so where is that fine balance and I guess
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:18.720]   the way I've thought about it as an overall philosophy is we should be
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:25.760]   looking forward not backward and there feels like there's a whole lot of how do
[00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:32.240]   we fix backwards but that's not necessarily gonna really help forward if
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:37.040]   that makes sense like I mean California going back and they're looking at like
[00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:41.800]   reparations and things like it's you hear it's like well how are they gonna do
[00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:45.520]   that we already have like crazy inflation and now you're saying you want
[00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:52.000]   to give everybody like african-americans who fit the criteria is like millions of
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.560]   dollars each is that where what from where like where is where is all this
[00:30:55.560 --> 00:31:01.960]   coming from so it's moving forward and at what point I think a fair question is
[00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:05.840]   at what point is like all right well this isn't working like we if you're
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:09.680]   just consistently going back you're not gonna go forward that's kind of how like
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:13.440]   if you pay a person at bars tool 200 K I'm just picking that number I'm not
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:17.200]   saying you do or not and they can't really make ends meet in New York City
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:21.120]   and they say Dave I got to quit I got to move to a cheaper city or whatever after
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:25.040]   enough people say that do you pay that person 250 or do you think you have to
[00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:28.720]   move the company do you think you need to change the laws of the city like what
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:32.480]   happens when you're running this business now and that inequality issue
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:35.880]   is confronted every day in your employee base what do you do yeah for me on a
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:43.040]   personal basis a lot of it we're sort of a talent company so if I can't lose this
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:48.240]   person I'll up the ante and pay to keep them if we can afford to move on without
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:54.840]   them we'll move on without them so it's a but it's a case by case in a tough
[00:31:54.840 --> 00:32:00.040]   tough issue yeah Dave I just want to go back a second you ended up buying the
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:06.440]   company back for a dollar one question I had was how is it $1 and not 20 million
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:11.120]   dollars and I want to talk a little bit about this idea of founder mode which I
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:13.720]   don't know if you've heard this term but it was kind of brought up in Silicon
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:19.120]   Valley a week or two ago and it's cocaine it's cocaine we made a whole
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:22.840]   thing about it I don't know if you like founder mode or not yeah but I'm not
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:30.280]   coca-cola coffee guy well I guess how is it a dollar how was it sounds like a
[00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:33.640]   great deal how did you negotiate that and is it a doll or is there is there a
[00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:37.440]   back-end deal or something that we're that we're missing that no no yeah no I
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:44.320]   think what it the thought was we had a lot of headaches with state legislatures
[00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:48.440]   gambling there was a like the Massachusetts gambling lady hated my
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:52.760]   guts other people did I think for Penn to move forward they kind of had to
[00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:59.200]   disassociate this with the bet they made and quickly yeah and quickly and let's
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:05.280]   end on very good terms barstool myself I think that's where it came from I don't
[00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:09.920]   think that I don't think we were like a critical part but did you propose the
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:13.840]   terms did you propose that structure it was mutual it was it was a mutual like
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:19.240]   understanding but a dollar seems like that's a very stark number was it
[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:22.640]   burning money at the time well you have to put something I think if you're gonna
[00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:26.560]   give me the company back like if you could do zero I think they could do zero
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:30.440]   yeah the company was losing money oh I see and so do you have to put money in
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:36.560]   yourself no okay and so you took the business over and I want to play this
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:41.800]   clip Nick can you pull the clip up this should be interesting I had a sales
[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:49.200]   meeting today I think I think I let him I let him know he's back I let him know
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:54.120]   I was here crack some skulls I think crack skulls but it's like you their
[00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:59.080]   comp plan was to me they should be making more money on their comp plan less
[00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:05.480]   base salary you know a lot of people may not make it this is gonna get grimy
[00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:11.520]   again I will yell at you I may forget about it five seconds later if you
[00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:16.840]   can't handle that don't be here but I'm sick of the excuses and honestly our
[00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:20.800]   comp plan was ass backwards so salespeople I want people up there like a
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:28.840]   bunch of Gordon Gekko looking motherfuckers that's good you step in
[00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:33.400]   and you know this is what people in Silicon Valley might call founder mode
[00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:38.000]   you're just like cracking skulls you're seeing all this you're like we're gonna
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.680]   right-size the the organization we're gonna get the ship headed in the right
[00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:46.400]   direction we're gonna restructure comp I guess how did things drift you know
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:52.960]   during that time yeah they drifted we're a big public company that was using us
[00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:57.960]   as a marketing machine really to drive drive consumers the casino maybe weren't
[00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:03.920]   as concerned about the bottom line you know I wasn't involved in really a lot
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:08.400]   of stuff but it was growth mode growth mode growth mode not bottom line mode
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:13.640]   not bottom line mode which was I think what they wanted from us and that was no
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:18.720]   longer going to be the case and it isn't case was this like Elon take it over
[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:21.880]   Twitter and he kind of goes in he's like what the heck is going on here we gotta
[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:28.320]   yeah yeah from what I heard or saw stories of that yes I think very similar
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:33.000]   where and again this is always there's one thing that I clash at the left there
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:39.920]   seems to be like oh we shouldn't have to work hard culture like yo I have to work
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:44.880]   like 10 hours a day or you get what you work for so we're a great place to work
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:49.240]   people kill to work for Barstool there's not and and we're always fine that like
[00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:52.560]   I had a sales job grass is always greener on the other side but you know
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:58.560]   we do sports entertainment it's a great spot to work and if you work hard you
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:04.920]   get rewarded but there is sort of that I don't know the shaming of success
[00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:10.840]   earning whatever you want to call it I do feel like exist in our in our country
[00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:15.280]   a little bit and I don't know where that came from but that's the thing that
[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:20.460]   hurts me the most I think the I've said this before but the prosperity that we
[00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:27.320]   enjoy as a country is because of the productivity that's arisen from
[00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:31.440]   entrepreneurship and entrepreneurship means everyone has a chance to build
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:35.360]   something and be successful in this country and if you are you deserve that
[00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:39.840]   success and we should be rewarding that success with accolades not with disdain
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:47.840]   yeah it's like it's a it's a slur like I love the word bill it's a someone could
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:52.440]   call me a billionaire it's I would take that and happily be like well you know
[00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:56.400]   I've said that now that's one thing I'm always I won't apologize for making
[00:36:56.400 --> 00:37:00.040]   money having money spending money I had none of it like that's what I worked my
[00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:08.240]   ass off for and it is wildly irritating as somebody who you know Bill Barstow I
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:12.320]   didn't take a vacation day for ten years like and literally I had a hump in my
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:17.080]   neck because I was like at my computer all day to then be told I have to coddle
[00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:23.000]   somebody else who works for me is infuriating and that's good the bigger
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.280]   you get like if I didn't have to have HR or any of that I know you can't go
[00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:32.800]   over I want it like I want to be able to and the bigger you get the less you can
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:35.720]   do that because you don't know who you're talking to and what type of issue
[00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:40.360]   that may lead to yeah do you like the business building aspect I mean do you
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:45.840]   like building sales comp plans and looking at the finances and figuring out
[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:50.760]   the right next step strategically or do you like being on camera and creating
[00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:55.920]   content and creatives yeah like how much of a business guy are you are you like
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:38:00.680]   I think I'm underestimate a little in business side there's certain aspects I
[00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:05.880]   like certain aspects I hate like in our world I hate negotiating the talent
[00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:10.440]   contracts like if you could have told me Dave don't like what's something you're
[00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:14.560]   gonna hate it's the talent business where inherently we're trying to find
[00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:20.240]   new stars build them up just so they can turn around hire an agent negotiate us
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:25.200]   and then leave so it's like this I wish it was a product that I owned in in the
[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:32.000]   more we do that that is a guy I hate it and you know we're using everything and
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:38.080]   you it happens that Alex McAfee we make millionaires out of people but that's
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:42.480]   our business so I hate hate hate that but the business side of it outside of
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:46.480]   the talent and what's the next steps I enjoy how successful has it been to
[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:51.200]   launch these products off of Barcelona so you know you've launched a whole line
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:54.200]   of stuff what's working and what's not working what have you learned from that
[00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:59.600]   yeah what I've learned about our audience and this probably holds true
[00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:05.400]   for a lot it doesn't matter what I say or our influences the product it's like
[00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:10.440]   if if the products good did they do well like pink Whitney is a drink that kills
[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:15.800]   it for us we are Dan big cat has a coffee now I did a what excuse me a one
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:20.720]   bite frozen pizza it was the biggest frozen launch Walmart ever had it's gone
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:25.960]   it's basically disappeared because it wasn't very good and that's a huge
[00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:31.360]   missed opportunity probably because I got everybody to eat it and we had like
[00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:35.200]   a million and not even our crowd our crowds on a Walmart crowd because a lot
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:40.040]   of you're saying the products are the actual product is bad it tasted bad how
[00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:44.080]   did that happen how did it taste bad yeah cuz I don't know what the hell I
[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:50.640]   was doing we had a third party and and I just didn't understand the frozen
[00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:55.000]   pizza market I thought we had made it as good as you could make it and that just
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:02.360]   wasn't the case so it was a bad product I knew was bad so after it launched it
[00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:07.080]   pretty much disappeared I mean still occasionally there so it really is
[00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:10.520]   product high noon which I don't own but I'm heavily involved in it's an
[00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:15.960]   unbelievable product it's just a spectacular drink it's the number one
[00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:22.560]   Vodka on the market so we have this this megaphone of people who trust us and
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:26.480]   we'll give anything a shot but if the products no good it ain't gonna work and
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:30.480]   if products good it'll work you know years ago Starbucks set up a corporate
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:35.680]   strategy they Howard realized that every time they put a new product on the
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:40.200]   shelf right when you check out you know there at the register yep it would sell
[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:43.320]   like crazy but then it would also go sell like crazy and Walmart and Target
[00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:47.320]   and Kroger's all over the country everywhere else and they were making
[00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:51.680]   brands with their platform they realized you know we've got a platform so they
[00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:55.360]   started to kind of do these deals where in order to put your brand your product
[00:40:55.360 --> 00:41:00.160]   on the shelf at checkout they had to get equity in the business is that a model
[00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:03.320]   you've kind of played with where you can leverage the platform instead of
[00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:07.200]   charging people add dollars you basically align with brands that you
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:11.840]   love take a piece of those brands and then really truly partner up with them
[00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:14.560]   and help them be successful and participate in that upside with them
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:20.880]   yes yep we've done that we're starting to do that a lot more now that I've got
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:26.280]   the company back because when it wasn't my company I I didn't care as much
[00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:33.160]   because it's like what are we getting so I'm trying to be much more like helpful
[00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:37.840]   to our talent because not only are they happy but it helps me keep them so we're
[00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:41.840]   doing a lot more deals now how you just suggest what's the what's the day in the
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:45.640]   life of Dave Portnoy are you like on zooms all day talking to your teams
[00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:49.680]   about various things or when do you have time to make the content like how do you
[00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:55.180]   yeah I was your day structure it really varies it can vary day to day I have my
[00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:59.900]   set like content things that I'm doing whether it's pizza BFF I may do a
[00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:05.400]   podcast like this and then business stuff but I'm not working like how I was
[00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:09.960]   working when I started it we have good people at high levels who I trust and
[00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:14.080]   are doing like whether it's a CFO whether it's sales I'm still in the loop
[00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:19.480]   on how everything's going but I'm not as involved in the day at each day I mean
[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:23.160]   like would you say your style is like you observe and then if you feel or
[00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:27.560]   sense it's going off track you just jump in and just 100% yeah that's 100% what I
[00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:33.720]   would do yeah cuz like yes I was much more involved the beginning I don't want
[00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:39.280]   to be that involved as like I want kind of live my life a little bit so yes
[00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:42.600]   that's I would say that's exactly how I do it let's go back to your roots for a
[00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:46.520]   second because I'm I'm really curious about this do you think that sports
[00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:53.640]   gambling has been good for America so far based on how it's been launched how
[00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:58.800]   young men use it yeah I mean I'd say it's new I wouldn't say it's good or bad
[00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:03.320]   I mean everyone's doing it I'm sure there's horror stories just like anything
[00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:08.560]   any vice of people be like oh I lost money or whatever but from my world I
[00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:12.740]   was doing it my whole life so I was doing it was not legal I'm also a firm
[00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:17.640]   believer and let an adult be an adult like if they want to gamble they do it
[00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:20.480]   but I wouldn't say it's been it's probably created a bunch of business
[00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:26.280]   like because the industry is spending so much and that trickles down in so many
[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:32.240]   different areas so gambling is going to happen there's certain things that I'm
[00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:37.000]   pretty things that have happened since the dawn of man gambling is one of them
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.480]   it is going to happen so you might as well legalize it and make money off of
[00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:44.800]   it rather than have it be underground bookies and things like that you talk a
[00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:48.520]   lot about WNB right now but are there sports leagues that you think are just
[00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:53.560]   yesterday's news a little bit boring not really well baseball slow they're also
[00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:58.600]   like in some bizarre world the last to embrace like highlights in the internet
[00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:03.800]   where the NBA was always the leader in forefront I think it shows you know
[00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:09.200]   football isn't it's the same same sports basically I think baseball is the core
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:15.640]   for this lagging do you think do sports franchise values go up as legalization
[00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:19.960]   happens and then do sports franchise values go down and you know is that a
[00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:25.600]   big driver do you think for well the NFL is talking about letting private equity
[00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:34.080]   right invest yeah last month yeah so I can't that that to me can only make
[00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:39.640]   franchises skyrocket and I don't think the bottom line always matters with
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:44.760]   sports like making money losing money there's not many of them and it's the
[00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:49.880]   biggest toy anybody really on earth can have right like what is better and it
[00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:53.680]   does for some people doesn't matter how much money you have you may still not be
[00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:59.360]   able to get it so I can't see any world in which that doesn't continue to
[00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:04.160]   increase when this the demand far outweighs supply do you think that
[00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:08.640]   there's a world where somebody figures out a way for the players to own a piece
[00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:12.840]   of these teams as well like you know you talked about you started barstool your
[00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:18.200]   four main guys whether that was written down or not you're giving them equity in
[00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:21.760]   the same way if you think about the equity that you know MJ created in the
[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:25.840]   league or LeBron and Steph and KD have created in the league they capture it in
[00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:30.840]   salary but they don't capture it in equity how do you think about that it's
[00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:37.360]   a tough question because by the time you would say like an MJ or a LeBron maybe
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:42.840]   LeBron a little different but by the time they've risen to the level of all
[00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:47.920]   this guy knee is worth the equity like if you rewound Jordan's career from day
[00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:51.720]   one and you have the choice like we can have them on the polls or whatever
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:55.680]   clearly the equity is probably worth it but by the time he establishes that
[00:45:55.680 --> 00:46:00.280]   you're depending on almost which I find almost never happens in business rare
[00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:05.780]   like retroactive goodwill good faith like okay you did so much here's some
[00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:10.960]   equity I don't I haven't found many people do that no I think for the NBA
[00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:14.480]   they'll just they'll probably find a way for LeBron to get the Vegas franchise
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:19.120]   that's kind of his his reward maybe you know yeah but then there's a bunch of
[00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:22.360]   these other guys that are when you say LeBron do you mean like the Fenway
[00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:26.320]   sports group because he's that like they buy teams he's part of that I think I
[00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:30.980]   think it's probably it's probably Fenway maybe but I think that they want him on
[00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:35.240]   the masthead as a direct owner yeah I suspect if I had to guess I mean Jordan
[00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:41.080]   had minority in the Wizards do you still gamble for fun or do you still gamble
[00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:44.880]   mostly let me let me tell you Dave's bets this year because I had him pulled
[00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:51.600]   up you bet I'm high one to your yeah tell us it so 2.1 million on on the
[00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:56.600]   Huskies 1.3 million on those are winnings yeah yeah on the Masters on
[00:46:56.600 --> 00:47:01.920]   Scotty 1.1 million on the Celtics maybe a finals million dollars on Michigan over
[00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:05.760]   Alabama and the Rose Bowl half a million on the Chiefs to win the Super Bowl half
[00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:11.000]   a million on Washington over Texas and the Sugar Bowl you're gambling yes so to
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:16.240]   clarify the only the early ones that I bet a million on Michigan to win the
[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:20.200]   Rose Bowl that's just a million to win a million I went to Michigan I went to the
[00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:23.860]   game it's like this is gonna be my big bet most of the others have been like
[00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:28.960]   future so like the not nearly the winnings have been big because I've been
[00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:32.880]   red-hot I've gambled my whole life I love gambling people we have a big
[00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:36.080]   partnership with Draftkings people are always like Oh Draftkings gives them the
[00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:41.040]   money or pen no it's my own money and yeah it's it's a passion of mine I love
[00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:45.400]   doing I bet on a horse racing sports and I enjoy it the worst thing about
[00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:50.240]   gambling in my opinion is we have to pay taxes on the winnings and then we can't
[00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:56.240]   carry over the losses the great news which may be different I generally don't
[00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:59.680]   have to worry about that because I generally lose so I'm never like worried
[00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:04.760]   this year this year will be year one of quite a long life that I've won in it
[00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:08.480]   doesn't look like I'm going that way but that is crap it's like Kamala like
[00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:13.200]   unrealized unrealized gains I like you get taxed on something you never had
[00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:17.920]   exactly is she's still doing that by the way is that like a real thing she walked
[00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:21.880]   it back a little she walked it back yeah she said oh no and then she also walked
[00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:27.520]   back the capital gains tax from 40% down to 28 because the backlash she got when
[00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:32.640]   she said hey I support the Biden proposal for tax reform there was so
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:37.080]   much backlash she started to lose a lot of big donors and they were like okay
[00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:40.240]   you know here's the compromise and that's where they ended up so what
[00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:44.520]   ultimately happens if she gets elected it's anyone's guess you know all these
[00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:47.840]   guys are kind of tacking to get elected and no one knows what their actual
[00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:51.800]   policy will end up being when they're in office for all right folks so you know
[00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:55.760]   we don't know do you gamble in any other way craps dice yes that's what I was
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:49:00.800]   gonna ask you ever blackjack poker yeah or stocks you know like you did stocks
[00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:05.320]   for a while didn't you on I love stocks like stocks is to me is better than
[00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:09.600]   sports gambling because you rarely like unless a company just goes poof you're
[00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:14.720]   not like out like if you have patience for the most part you can bounce back so
[00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:20.240]   yeah I have money in the stock market I'll play like at a casino but it
[00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:25.520]   doesn't do it for me I'm delusional like I think I know what's gonna happen in
[00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:29.280]   sports like I'm like oh I know the Patriots are playing or like if I'm
[00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:34.280]   playing blackjack like I know the rules but I also know I have no control over
[00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:38.880]   what I don't count cards I like poker but I'm no expert at it and I don't play
[00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:43.400]   that often it doesn't say you're not a quant guy you're not an analytical guy
[00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:47.160]   it's doing nothing or anything like no no no no no if I could go back at one
[00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:51.960]   skill I'd love to like be able to like to have an algorithm for the stock
[00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:55.440]   market like how all the people make all their money where just hit like but I
[00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:58.680]   don't have that brain you did a lot of it during kovat but then that content
[00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:02.960]   kind of wound down yeah well the stock market during coat so we did the pen
[00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:08.200]   deal like right before kovat so we're gearing up to do all the sports gambling
[00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:13.280]   content and sports went away and I'm alright well the stock market is still
[00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:16.680]   going it's kind of the same thing so I started doing that without much
[00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:21.440]   knowledge live streaming and people loved it the swings in the stock market
[00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:28.920]   during kovat bananas yes it was I mean huge like I loved it but that's not
[00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:34.040]   happening so to do the daily I was day trading stocks aren't moving nearly
[00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:38.560]   unless it's like in earnings they're not moving like they were so it's it's
[00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:44.320]   boring yeah can you tell us about the Caitlin Clark Angel Reese WNBA
[00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:47.000]   controversy you have some strong opinions on that you have strong
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   opinions on that I mean I so I love Caitlin Clark this I mean do you think
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:59.640]   do you think it's Larry magic all over again we'll see how Angel she had a
[00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:05.360]   great rookie year had a great rookie year yeah Angel was not on the same but
[00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:09.960]   I don't think not if you love college basketball women's college basketball
[00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:15.480]   sure you knew Angel Reese was I did not know who Angel Reese was until she was
[00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:19.440]   doing this thing to Caitlin Clark in this and follow who is this whereas
[00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:27.320]   magic and bird everybody knew those two going in Angel and this isn't this will
[00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:32.480]   sound disrespectful but it's a fact people would not the majority of people
[00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:37.400]   would not know who she was if it wasn't for her going at Caitlin Clark in
[00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:41.120]   becoming her rival by really trash-talking her and that anybody in
[00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:47.720]   the media who says it's anything other than Angel Reese thrusting herself into
[00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:51.200]   this conversation which by the way business-wise brilliant for her because
[00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:54.760]   she's got shoe deals she was Shaq she's got all this stuff but people would not
[00:51:54.760 --> 00:52:00.000]   know who she was if Caitlin Clark is everybody every metric like a unicorn
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:05.440]   yeah yeah exactly so and she put herself in the same conversation with it and
[00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:09.800]   she's had a great rookie season but bird magic no one knew she I mean I didn't
[00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:14.520]   know I just saw Caitlin play in college and she was doing things I just never
[00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:18.760]   seen a woman doing best pulling up from the logo pal like who the hell is this
[00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:24.240]   and I just started watching her and I didn't even during the game with um the
[00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:27.840]   LSU when and she did all the theatrical I didn't notice angel during the game
[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:33.120]   like I really I bet on Iowa I was mad and then I don't know if I get credit or
[00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:38.600]   or disapprove however you want to put it I tweeted and this went super viral and
[00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:44.000]   started like a race war I was so mad when they lost this game I tweeted
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:47.960]   Angel Reese is a classless piece of shit it's the first time I talked about her
[00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:51.520]   and it was right after she was taunting her and everyone's like you only said
[00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:55.720]   that because he's black it's like it had nothing to do it it was I bet on Caitlin
[00:52:55.720 --> 00:53:00.040]   I was pissed it didn't matter who it was people always ignore that with me some
[00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:04.920]   of my most fiercest enemies Roger Goodell like I and I had to pull up like Brooks
[00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:08.520]   Koepka I'm like all these people I'd call classless pieces of shit it's how I
[00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:16.160]   talk but the race thing from that moment really took off between these two I
[00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:20.800]   wouldn't say it's bird magic I think it's disrespectful to how different
[00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:23.960]   because those are two of the greatest of all time two of the greatest of all time
[00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:27.320]   and angels a great rebound and to Caitlin's credit I think that she has
[00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:31.400]   completely uplifted the WNBA to a level that I don't think anybody expect it's
[00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:38.640]   insane the number one game on NBA TV has been a WNBA game is beating the NBA I
[00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:42.680]   remember when you know we had a moment where Steph had all these ankle injuries
[00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:47.000]   this was like in that first era with Monte Allison and there was a lot of
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:51.760]   pressure to trade step and yeah just came back and all of a sudden he was
[00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:57.000]   lights out right and then what you saw was every young kid wearing his jersey
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:02.800]   because it's much easier to look at step and say I could be like Steph right not
[00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:06.280]   nearly as tall as everybody else not nearly as huge as everybody else and
[00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:09.600]   you're starting to see the same thing with Caitlin where all these kids are
[00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:13.840]   like I can shoot like her that's where you become transcendent because you have
[00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:18.120]   this approach that seems like well I could do this too it's that thing that
[00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:22.560]   just makes you a huge star I said when Nike did the deal with her I thought it
[00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:27.920]   was the most the biggest steal like in the history of sports marketing like it
[00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:31.120]   was 10 million and then you look at like Devin Booker's like 30 million a year
[00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:36.400]   there's no person on the planet who can tell me Devin Booker's more marketable
[00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:40.280]   than Caitlin Clark it's like Caitlin Clark is up there with anybody she's
[00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:46.180]   she's hit something that that you rarely whether it's a tiger a Serena somebody
[00:54:46.180 --> 00:54:51.640]   who is just redefining the sport and it's not the color of her skin that I
[00:54:51.640 --> 00:54:55.680]   that was what drove me nuts with this because the WNBA is filled with white
[00:54:55.680 --> 00:55:02.360]   superstars people are at Diana Taurasi so the Sabrina I okay there's a ton of
[00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:10.200]   Inesco yeah Inesco and the woman from UConn who's at the top top and superb
[00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:15.920]   there's ton she plays different if you watch the game she does not play how
[00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:20.080]   anybody's seen a woman play that's it that and everyone made it into all these
[00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:24.960]   others issue it's she plays different you haven't seen it before Dave let me
[00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:28.960]   ask you a question you've remained steadfast in speaking your mind speaking
[00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:33.040]   your truth telling your opinions it's gotten you a lot of heat over the years
[00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:36.120]   you got a lot of people writing articles negatively about you chasing down
[00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:41.680]   personal stories about you all this sort of stuff you're still here and there was
[00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:44.960]   a period of time for a couple years where everyone talked about canceled
[00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:49.240]   culture and someone does something that is inappropriate or is a micro
[00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:52.800]   aggression using a big platform and they should be canceled and everyone rallies
[00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:58.600]   behind and puts this person out they're done but you haven't been canceled why
[00:55:58.600 --> 00:56:01.960]   is that and do you think that we're kind of post cancel culture in America was
[00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:05.520]   that a moment that's come and gone or do you think we're still kind of fighting
[00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:10.200]   the fight for free speech in America and the ability to speak one's mind and
[00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:13.840]   speak one's voice without being deep platformed and shut down yeah I don't
[00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:19.760]   think it's totally gone I think I'm here just it Barstool's been around for a
[00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:24.760]   long time so people really do know me like the fans or people have read
[00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:29.840]   Barstool for 20 years have stuck by me and how and and that's been important
[00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:34.040]   like if you're on someone else's platform it's a lot easier to platform
[00:56:34.040 --> 00:56:37.560]   them because you have advertisers and somebody above who don't want to deal
[00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:41.480]   with the headache or anything like that so I I've been like even when Penn was
[00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:46.960]   here and there are people above me theoretically what choice did they have
[00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:50.240]   to have my back because it's it's well if you don't have my back I still have
[00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:53.880]   this megaphone I'm just gonna be like guess what these guys don't have my back
[00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:58.440]   and then poof everything they've done so I've had that luxury of being able to
[00:56:58.440 --> 00:57:01.940]   speak directly and not having to worry where if you're just on a different
[00:57:01.940 --> 00:57:10.160]   network they can pull the plug a lot easier and I'm kind of an open book so
[00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:15.520]   it's I I think what has worked in my favor I've never been worried well if I
[00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:19.280]   speak out or defend myself what's gonna come out next or is there someone
[00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:22.360]   lurking in the closets I guess I've never care I everything is out there I
[00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:28.440]   there's I've told the truth and that's allowed me to be pretty comfortable like
[00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:32.560]   the heavy accusations like business insider when like sexual misconduct type
[00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:37.240]   stuff like all garbage and when I say point there wasn't point zero zero one
[00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:42.120]   there was no truth to any of the stuff that happened I had all the facts and so
[00:57:42.120 --> 00:57:46.880]   when this thing hit like I just it made me look kind of stupid or embarrassed
[00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:50.760]   because nobody wants like personal text but I had that stuff out there like it
[00:57:50.760 --> 00:57:55.400]   was out there hours after it's like here it is here's everything that disproves
[00:57:55.400 --> 00:57:59.600]   it not everyone does that you think people are just sick and tired of being
[00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:02.680]   told what to think and who to follow and who's right and who's wrong and they
[00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:06.040]   want to kind of make up their own minds and not kind of get behind this whole
[00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:12.400]   cancel culture organizational system anymore you think 100% I know my biggest
[00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:17.040]   issue is I don't know what to believe I don't believe anything like and that's
[00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:22.560]   kind of unfortunate like you you just hear so many things and it's a lot of
[00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:26.960]   times even hard to figure out where the truth is like you try to dig into it
[00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:32.080]   especially in politics like but that's probably good answer example I hear so
[00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:36.520]   many things on both sides and then when you really try to dig down and be like
[00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:42.080]   is this real is this fake it's it's hard to find the root of the truth and that
[00:58:42.080 --> 00:58:46.800]   is actually kind of scary I think that's why that's why freedom of speech matters
[00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:50.720]   now more than ever because we got to have more voices not fewer so that
[00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:54.760]   people can ultimately find the truth themselves have you been able to convince
[00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:58.480]   your dad that maybe the New York Times isn't always telling the truth no I
[00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:04.200]   haven't which is scary he doesn't have an answer for it with me does but like
[00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:10.520]   he still truly believes he's one of those guys where there's nothing Trump
[00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:15.840]   could do nothing nothing like he's bad and if he gives the greatest answer
[00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:19.120]   greatest thing whatever it doesn't matter Trump's bad I mean you can give
[00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:23.800]   well what about the other side he doesn't care so no he's skewed he he's
[00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:28.000]   somebody who's gonna watch mainstream media and pretty much believe everything
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:32.720]   they say maybe a little bit he's changed but and I think there's a lot of people
[00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:36.880]   like well before we wrap what's the what's the future for Barstool Dave
[00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:39.520]   what are you what are you gonna do with the business over time it's just a
[00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:43.440]   business you now own forever you're gonna run it make a profit live off of
[00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:48.280]   it I mean what's your your long yeah I mean that that kind of nailed it I in
[00:59:48.280 --> 00:59:54.640]   this may sound not like a true founder I sometimes get this but I want Barstool
[00:59:54.640 --> 00:59:58.960]   to be a place where we break even or make money so I'm not overly stressed
[00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:03.200]   and pulling my hair out and people enjoy coming to work and they have a good job
[01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:07.240]   that like I've said and I said to our employees when I took it's like I've
[01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:11.960]   made my money I I've never gonna become like a billionaire off Barstool and
[01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:16.240]   someone pays it so I'm happy I'm comfortable and I want our employees to
[01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:19.960]   have a place there that they know a job is there and you know they don't hate
[01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:23.400]   going to work that's kind of and we'll look for opportunities and try to
[01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:29.040]   continue to grow but I'm not maniacal how do we get to the next step yeah
[01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:31.560]   that's awesome great Dave thanks for being with us this has been an awesome
[01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:36.680]   chat I really enjoyed it, thanks man, take care. See you guys.
