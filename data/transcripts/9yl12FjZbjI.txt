[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.800]   - Welcome back to a new week of episodes
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.800]   on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.040]   And for the first few days of this week,
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.120]   we're gonna be joined by Dr. Don Whitney again,
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.240]   professor of biblical spirituality
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.440]   and associate dean of the School of Theology
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.640]   at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville.
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.640]   He is well known for his classic book,
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.040]   Spiritual Disciplines for the Christian Life,
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.060]   a book originally published in 1991
[00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.640]   and then revised and expanded in 2014.
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.920]   I know a number of listeners are familiar with his book
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.040]   and he's also the author of a new book from Crossway,
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.400]   which is titled, Praying the Bible.
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.520]   Dr. Whitney, onto the next question on my list,
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.800]   sort of the common questions that we get
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.880]   on the disciplines here in our inbox.
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.840]   And this one is really foundational and important
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.980]   because there's a lot of questions
[00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.080]   about why Christians are called
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.140]   to practice the spiritual disciplines in the first place
[00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.140]   or how do we know if we're doing
[00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.900]   the spiritual disciplines right?
[00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.380]   What should be the goal of it all?
[00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.640]   What should we be seeing in our lives?
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.580]   But essentially, why do we do them in the first place?
[00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.540]   - Well, we are to practice the spiritual disciplines,
[00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.300]   first of all, because they are commanded in scripture.
[00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.980]   First Timothy 4, 7 says,
[00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.540]   "Discipline yourself for the purpose of godliness."
[00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.120]   And the practical ways that we carry those out,
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.020]   we call the spiritual disciplines.
[00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.980]   And so, first of all, the Bible commands these things,
[00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.120]   discipline yourself.
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.940]   And so that's not just some amorphous attitude
[00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.860]   that involves actually things we are to do
[00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.900]   and biblical activities that we are to engage in,
[00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:43.820]   rightly motivated.
[00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.940]   And so, first of all, the Bible commands that.
[00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.980]   Discipline is at the very heart of discipleship
[00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.340]   in the New Testament.
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.480]   When Jesus invited people to himself in Matthew 11, 29,
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.440]   he says, "Take my yoke upon you and learn from me."
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.800]   The same is true in this offer of discipleship
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.000]   in Luke 9, 23.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.560]   He said to them all, "If anyone would come after me,
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.260]   "let him deny himself, take up his cross daily
[00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.720]   "and follow me."
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.440]   So at the very least, to be a disciple of Jesus
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.440]   was to follow him.
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.440]   And as they did, they learned from him.
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.320]   So if Jesus got up one morning and said,
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.200]   "Men, get up, we're going to Galilee."
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.620]   They didn't stretch their arms and say,
[00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.480]   "Well, Lord, we kind of thought we'd sleep in today
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.640]   "and go up there tomorrow."
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.840]   It had to be a disciplined following.
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.000]   Discipline is always at the heart of discipleship.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.640]   And so to follow Jesus has to be an intentional thing.
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.640]   You don't follow someone accidentally, not for very long.
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.820]   So at the very heart of discipleship
[00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.380]   is this idea of discipline.
[00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.380]   So Jesus has expected this from us in the scriptures.
[00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.080]   Another reason we should practice the spiritual disciplines
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.880]   is found in Hebrews 12, 14, which says,
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.420]   "Pursue holiness or sanctification,"
[00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.100]   some translations say.
[00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.420]   First of all, Hebrews 12, 14 says,
[00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.000]   "Pursue peace with all men and the sanctification
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.560]   "or holiness, godliness, Christ-likeness,
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.240]   "without which no one will see the Lord."
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.280]   Again, pursue this holiness, sanctification,
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.700]   Christ-likeness, godliness,
[00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.620]   without which no one will see the Lord.
[00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.500]   We will not see the Lord because we pursue holiness.
[00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.980]   Rather, those who know the Lord will pursue holiness.
[00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.360]   Because of their knowledge of God,
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.920]   they can't help but pursue him.
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.680]   All those who are born again are given the Holy Spirit.
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.440]   And the Holy Spirit brings his holy presence
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.420]   wherever he goes.
[00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.660]   When someone walks into a room,
[00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.080]   they don't pause at the door and say,
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.780]   "Hmm, I wonder what nature I will bring with me.
[00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.180]   "Maybe I'll bring my alligator nature into this room."
[00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.180]   And no, we don't do that
[00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.000]   because we don't have an alligator nature.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.420]   We only have a human nature,
[00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.780]   and we take our human nature with us wherever we go.
[00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.960]   In the same way, wherever the Holy Spirit goes,
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.340]   he brings his holy nature with him.
[00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.520]   And when he indwells any flesh and blood creature,
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.020]   he brings that holy nature,
[00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.780]   and that person, therefore,
[00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.620]   has new holy hungers they didn't have before.
[00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.580]   They hunger for the holy word of God
[00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.340]   that they used to find boring or irrelevant.
[00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.580]   They hunger for fellowship with God's people.
[00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:20.340]   They can't imagine life
[00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.400]   apart from the people of God anymore
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.180]   because the Holy Spirit ministers to them
[00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.220]   through the people of God.
[00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.660]   And so to cut themselves off
[00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.860]   from fellowship with God's people is in a real sense
[00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.380]   to cut themself off from so much of the ministry
[00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.680]   of the Holy Spirit to them, and they can't bear that.
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.620]   Anyone indwelled by the Holy Spirit
[00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.220]   has new holy longings they did not have before.
[00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.940]   They long for a holy body without sin anymore.
[00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.040]   They long to live with a holy mind,
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.860]   no longer affected by temptation ever again.
[00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.100]   They long to live in a holy and perfect world
[00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.540]   with holy and perfect people.
[00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.220]   And at last, see face to face
[00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.580]   in one that the angels call holy, holy, holy.
[00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.620]   And that's the heartbeat of all those
[00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.000]   in whom the Holy Spirit dwells.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.580]   They may be nine years old,
[00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.840]   and those things will be expressed in nine-year-old ways,
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.700]   but they will be there because he is there.
[00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.040]   And a person may be 99 with the encrusted traditions
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.140]   and experiences of the years over their heart,
[00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.580]   but pulsing underneath that is the evergreen,
[00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.500]   ever-fresh work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.800]   And so wherever the Holy Spirit dwells,
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.700]   he gives us hunger and longing and aspiration for holiness.
[00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:30.340]   And so you are compelled by the presence of the Holy Spirit
[00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.740]   to pursue holiness, sanctification, godliness.
[00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.700]   And so if you're not pursuing that, you won't see the Lord.
[00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.840]   And the reason is you don't know the Lord.
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.600]   You don't know the Lord if you're not pursuing holiness.
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.220]   Anyone who doesn't want to be with Jesus,
[00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.980]   I submit, has not met the man.
[00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:48.740]   Well, how do we do that then?
[00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.080]   If we will not see the Lord without pursuing holiness,
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.580]   anyone who wants to see the Lord is gonna say,
[00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.460]   "How then do I pursue this holiness
[00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:59.940]   without which no one sees the Lord?"
[00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.660]   The answer is in 1 Timothy 4, 7.
[00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.360]   Discipline yourself for the purpose of godliness.
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.780]   Discipline yourself for the purpose of godliness,
[00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.540]   holiness, Christ-likeness.
[00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:14.600]   So the practical everyday way we pursue the holiness
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.240]   without which we will not see the Lord
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.440]   is the practice of the biblical spiritual disciplines.
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.520]   That's why it is so important
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.640]   to practice the biblical spiritual disciplines.
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.000]   - That's so important.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.240]   God, give us the focus and the discipline
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.840]   for this work in our lives in 2016.
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.400]   Thank you, Dr. Whitney.
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.440]   So what are the most important spiritual disciplines,
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.000]   the ones we cannot neglect,
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.420]   the ones we need regularly, even daily?
[00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.120]   And can we even talk in those terms
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.360]   when we talk about the spiritual disciplines?
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.400]   I'll ask Don that tomorrow when he joins us again.
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.340]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.940]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:53.100]   (silence)
[00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.260]   (silence)
[00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.420]   (silence)
[00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:07.420]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
