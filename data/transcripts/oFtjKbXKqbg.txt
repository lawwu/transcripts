[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440]   So I was trying to figure out how to do photorealistic AI photos.
[00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.040]   And it was stable diffusion by itself is not doing that well.
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.440]   Like the faces look all mangled and it doesn't have enough resolution
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.680]   or something to do that well.
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.000]   So, but I started seeing these base models, these fine-tuned models
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.240]   and people would train on porn and I would try them
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.280]   and they would be very photorealistic.
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.520]   They would have bodies that actually made sense like body anatomy.
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.720]   But if you look at the photorealistic models
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.920]   that people use now still, there's still core of porn there.
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:30.960]   Like of naked people.
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.800]   So I need to prompt out the naked
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.040]   and everyone needs to do this with AI startups, with imaging.
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.560]   You need to prompt out the naked stuff.
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.200]   - You have to keep reminding the model you need to put clothes on.
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.040]   - Yeah, don't put naked because it's very risky.
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.120]   I have Google vision that checks every photo
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.520]   before it's shown to the user to like check for NSFW.
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.080]   - Like a nipple detector? Oh, NSFW detector.
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.080]   - Because you get the journalists get very angry.
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:55.440]   - The following is a conversation with Peter Levels,
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.640]   also known on X as Levels IO.
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.160]   He is a self-taught developer and entrepreneur
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.640]   who designed, programmed, shipped and ran over 40 startups.
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.720]   Many of which are hugely successful.
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.320]   In most cases, he did it all by himself
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.960]   while living the digital nomad life in over 40 countries
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.960]   and over 150 cities.
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.400]   Programming on a laptop while chilling on a couch
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:28.000]   using vanilla HTML, jQuery, PHP and SQLite.
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.480]   He builds and ships quickly and improves on the fly.
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.480]   All in the open, documenting his work,
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.120]   both his successes and failures
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.520]   with a raw honesty of a true indie hacker.
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.680]   Peter is an inspiration to a huge number of developers
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.760]   and entrepreneurs who love creating cool things in the world
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.920]   that are hopefully useful for people.
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.200]   This was an honor and a pleasure for me.
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.840]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.920]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.800]   in the description.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.560]   And now dear friends, here's Peter Levels.
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.720]   - You've launched a lot of companies
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.240]   and built a lot of products.
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.720]   As you say, most fail, but some succeeded.
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.960]   What's your philosophy behind building
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.000]   the startups that you did?
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.920]   - I think my philosophy is very different
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.520]   than most people in startups.
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.720]   'Cause most people in startups,
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.880]   they build a company and they raise money, right?
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.080]   And they hire people and then they build a product
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.680]   and they find something that makes money.
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.200]   And I don't really raise money.
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.320]   I don't use VC funding.
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.360]   I do everything myself.
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.040]   I'm a designer, I'm the developer.
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.120]   I make everything, I make the logo.
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.280]   So for me, I'm much more scrappy.
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.960]   And because I don't have funding,
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.160]   like I need to go fast.
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.720]   I need to make things fast to see if an idea works, right?
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.720]   I have an idea in my mind and I build it,
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.400]   build it like a micro, mini startup.
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.560]   And I launch it very quickly,
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.200]   like within two weeks or something of building it.
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.400]   And I check if there's demand
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.560]   and if people actually sign up and not just sign up,
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.160]   but if people actually pay money, right?
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.560]   Like they need to take out their credit cards,
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.160]   pay me money and then I can see if the idea is validated.
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.280]   And most ideas don't work.
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.200]   Like, as you say, most fail.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.560]   - So there's this rapid iterative phase
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.000]   where you just build a prototype that works, launch it,
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.960]   see if people like it,
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.400]   improving it really, really quickly
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.200]   to see if people like it a little bit more enough to pay
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.800]   and all that, that whole rapid process is how you think of.
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.960]   - Yeah, I think it's like, it's very rapid.
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.680]   And it's like, if I compare it to, for example, Google,
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.960]   you know, like our big tech companies,
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.120]   especially Google right now is kind of struggling.
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.560]   Like they made like transformers.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.040]   They made all, they invented all the AI stuff years ago
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.080]   and they never really shipped.
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.640]   Like they could have shipped ChatGPT, for example.
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.720]   I think I heard in 2019 and they never shipped it
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.880]   because they were so stuck in bureaucracy,
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:41.600]   but they had everything.
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.720]   They had the data, they had the tech,
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.640]   they had the engineers and they couldn't do it.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.360]   And it's because these big organizations,
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.520]   it can make you very slow.
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.160]   So being alone by myself on my laptop,
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.760]   like, you know, in my underwear,
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.000]   in a hotel room or something, I can ship very fast.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.800]   And I don't need to like, I don't need to ask like legal
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.880]   for like, oh, can you vouch for this?
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.080]   You know, I can just go and ship.
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.160]   - Do you always code in your underwear?
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.920]   Your profile picture, you're like slouching on a couch
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.680]   in your underwear, chilling on a laptop.
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.840]   - No, no, but I do wear like shorts a lot.
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.680]   And I usually just wear shorts and no t-shirt
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.880]   'cause I'm always too hot.
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:15.840]   Like I'm always overheating.
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.560]   - And thank you for showing up, not just in your underwear,
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.520]   but wearing shorts.
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.040]   - And no, you know, I'm still wearing this for you.
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.040]   - Thank you, thank you for dressing up.
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.600]   - I think it's 'cause since I go to the gym,
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.400]   I'm always too hot.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.840]   - What's your favorite exercise in the gym?
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:28.960]   - Man, overhead press.
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.400]   - Overhead press, like shoulder press.
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.520]   - Yeah. - Okay.
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.160]   - But it feels good 'cause you're doing like, you win.
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.840]   'Cause when you, what is it?
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.920]   I do 60 kilos, so it's like 120 pounds or something.
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.880]   Like it's my only thing I can do well, you know, in the gym.
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.360]   And you stand like this and you're like, I did it, you know?
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.920]   Like a winner pose, a victory pose.
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.520]   I do bench press squats, deadlifts.
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.080]   - Hence the mug.
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.680]   - Yeah. - Talking to my therapist.
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:52.800]   - Yeah. - It's a deadlift.
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.880]   - Yeah, because it acts like therapy for me, you know?
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.880]   - Yeah, it is. - Which is controversial to say.
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.640]   Like if I say this on Twitter, people get angry.
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.640]   - Physical hardship is a kind of therapy.
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:01.040]   - Yeah.
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.480]   - I just rewatched "Happy People" here in the Taiga
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.960]   that Warner Herzog film,
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.480]   where they document people that are doing trapping.
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.880]   They're essentially just working for survival
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.720]   in the wilderness year round.
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:15.120]   - Yeah.
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.000]   - And there's a deep happiness to their way of life
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.520]   because they're so busy in it, in nature.
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.480]   - Yeah, 100%.
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.080]   - Like there's something about that physical.
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.600]   - Physical, yeah. - Toil.
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.280]   - Yeah, my dad taught me that.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.520]   My dad always does like construction in the house.
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.440]   Like he's always renovating the house.
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.560]   He breaks through one room
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.000]   and then he goes to the next room
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.760]   and he's just going in a circle around the house
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:36.880]   for like the last 40 years.
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.680]   So, but so he's always doing construction in the house
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:40.480]   and it's his hobby.
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.000]   And he, like he taught me when I'm depressed or something,
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.520]   he says like, get a big, like what do you call it?
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.160]   Like a big mountain of sand or something from construction.
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.000]   Just get a shovel and bring it to the other side
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.760]   and just, you know, do like physical labor,
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.720]   do like hard work and do something.
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:59.920]   Like set a goal, do something.
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.160]   And I kind of did that with startups too.
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.200]   - Yeah, construction is not about the destination, man.
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.080]   It's about the journey.
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.720]   - Yeah.
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.320]   - Yeah, sometimes I wonder people
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.840]   who are always remodeling their house,
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.200]   is it really about the remodeling?
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.080]   - No, no, it's not.
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.440]   - Is it about the project? - It's about the journey.
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:14.480]   - The puzzle of it.
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.920]   - No, he doesn't care about the results.
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.200]   Well, he shows me, he's like, it's amazing.
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.240]   I'm like, yeah, it's amazing.
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.840]   But then he wants to go to the next room, you know?
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.880]   But I think it's very metaphorical for work
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.400]   'cause I also, I never stop work.
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.960]   I go to the next website or I make a new one, right?
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:29.840]   Or I make a new startup.
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:30.640]   So I'm always like,
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.520]   like to give you something to wake up in the morning
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.200]   and like, you know, have coffee and kiss your girlfriend.
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.960]   And then you have like a goal.
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.080]   Today, I'm gonna fix this feature.
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.840]   Today, I'm gonna fix this bug or something.
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.040]   I'm gonna do something.
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.720]   You have something to wake up to, you know?
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.720]   And I think maybe especially as a man, also women,
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.640]   but you need a hard work, you know?
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:51.760]   You need like an endeavor, I think.
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:55.680]   - How much of the building that you do is about money?
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.880]   How much is it about just a deep internal happiness?
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:06:59.840]   - It's really about fun.
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.240]   'Cause I was doing it when I didn't make money, right?
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:02.800]   That's the point.
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:03.760]   So I was always coding.
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:04.880]   I was always, I was making music.
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.000]   I made electronic music,
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.320]   drum and bass music like 20 years ago.
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.880]   And I was always making stuff.
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.800]   So I think creative expression is like a meaningful work.
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:15.520]   That's so important.
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:16.560]   It's so fun.
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.240]   It's so fun to have like a daily challenge
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.840]   where you try to figure stuff out.
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.000]   - But the interesting thing is
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.320]   you've built a lot of successful products
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:27.920]   and you never really wanted to take it to that level
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.760]   where you scale real big
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.760]   and sell it to a company or something like this.
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:32.320]   - Yeah.
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.840]   The problem is I don't dictate that, right?
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.280]   Like if more people start using,
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.960]   if millions of people suddenly start using it
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:37.760]   and it becomes big,
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:40.080]   I'm not gonna say,
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.400]   "Oh, stop signing up to my website and pay me money."
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.160]   But I never raised funding for it.
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.040]   And I think 'cause I don't like the stressful life
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:47.760]   that comes with it.
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:50.240]   Like I have a lot of founder friends
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.160]   and they tell me secretly
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.640]   like with hundreds of millions of dollars
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:55.840]   in funding and stuff.
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.920]   And they tell me like next time,
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.840]   if I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna do it like you
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.360]   because it's more fun.
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.480]   It's more Indies, more chill.
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:03.280]   It's more creative.
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:04.960]   They don't like this.
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.320]   They don't like to be manager, right?
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:07.840]   You become like a CEO, you become a manager.
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:11.840]   And I think a lot of people that start startups,
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.360]   when they become a CEO,
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.560]   they don't like that job actually,
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.840]   but they can't really exit it, you know?
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.040]   But they like to do the groundwork, the coding.
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.360]   So I think that keeps you happy,
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.960]   like doing something creative.
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:27.040]   - Yeah, it's interesting how people are pulled towards that,
[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.720]   to scale, to go really big.
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:33.200]   And you don't have that honest reflection with yourself,
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.880]   like what actually makes you happy?
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.400]   Because for a lot of great engineers,
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:37.840]   what makes them happy is the building,
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:41.120]   the "individual contributor,"
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.040]   like where you're actually still coding
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:44.800]   or you're actually still building.
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.680]   And they let go of that and then they become unhappy.
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.400]   But some of that is the sacrifice needed
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.880]   to have an impact at scale,
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.640]   if you truly believe in a thing you're doing.
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.160]   - But like, look at Elon,
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.120]   he's doing things a million times bigger than me, right?
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.840]   And would I wanna do that?
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.440]   I don't know, you can't really choose these things, right?
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:04.800]   But I really respect that.
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.800]   I think Elon's very different from VC founders, right?
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.480]   VC start, it's like software,
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.000]   there's a lot of bullshit in this world, I think.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.520]   There's a lot of dodgy finance stuff happening there, I think.
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:16.480]   And I never have concrete evidence about it,
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.160]   but your gut tells you something's going on
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:22.000]   with companies getting sold to friends and VCs,
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.360]   and then they do reciprocity
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:26.080]   and there's shady financial dealings.
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:26.880]   With Elon, that's not.
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.240]   He's just raising money from investors
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.280]   and he's actually building stuff.
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.520]   He needs the money to build stuff, hardware stuff.
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.600]   And that I really respect.
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:37.600]   - You said that there's been a few low points in your life.
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.560]   You've been depressed
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.280]   and the building is one of the ways you get out of that.
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.560]   But can you talk to that?
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:43.840]   Can you take me to that place,
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.160]   that time when you were at a low point?
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.880]   - So I was in Holland and I graduated university
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.120]   and I didn't wanna like get a normal job.
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.560]   And I was making some money with YouTube
[00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:53.600]   'cause I had this music career
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.800]   and I uploaded my music to YouTube.
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.840]   And YouTube started paying me like with AdSense,
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.080]   like $2,000 a month, $2,000 a month.
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.720]   And all my friends got like normal jobs
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:03.600]   and we stopped hanging out
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.360]   'cause people like in university hang out.
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:09.520]   You know, you chill at each other's houses, you go party.
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:10.720]   But when people get jobs,
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:12.000]   they only party like in the weekend
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.920]   and they don't hang anymore in a week
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:14.960]   'cause you need to be at the office.
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:15.920]   And I was like, this is not for me.
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:16.880]   I wanna do something else.
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.800]   And I was starting getting this like,
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.160]   I think it's like Saturn return.
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:21.920]   It's, you know, when you're turned 27,
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:24.720]   it's like some concept where Saturn returns
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.480]   to the same place in the orbit
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:27.600]   that it was when you're born.
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.440]   - I'm learning so many things.
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.800]   - It's some astrology thing, you know?
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:34.400]   - So many truly special artists died when they were 27.
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.000]   - Exactly, something of 27, man.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:36.720]   And it was for me.
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.480]   Like I started going crazy
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:41.200]   because I didn't really see like my future in Holland,
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.760]   buying a house, going living in the suburbs and stuff.
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:44.880]   So I flew out.
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.880]   I went to Asia, started digital nomading
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:47.840]   and did that for a year.
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:49.920]   And then that made me feel even worse, you know?
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:53.040]   'Cause I was like alone in hotel rooms,
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.560]   like looking at the ceiling.
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:55.840]   Like, what am I doing with my life?
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:58.400]   Like this is, like I was working on startups
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.280]   and stuff and YouTube,
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:01.600]   but it's like, what is the future here, you know?
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:04.880]   Like, is this something while my friends
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:06.080]   in Holland were doing really well
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.840]   and we have a normal life, you know?
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.480]   So it was getting very depressed.
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.160]   And like, I'm like an outcast, you know?
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:13.680]   And my money was shrinking.
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.200]   I wasn't making money anymore a lot.
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.040]   I was making $500 a month or something.
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:20.560]   And I was, you know, looking at the ceiling thinking like,
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:22.560]   now I'm like 27, I'm a loser.
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:25.200]   And that's the moment when I started building like startups.
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.320]   And it was because my dad said,
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.080]   like, if you're depressed, you need to, you know,
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.720]   get sand, get a shovel, start shoveling, do something.
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:31.760]   You can't just sit still,
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:34.160]   which is kind of like a interesting way
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.200]   to deal with depression, you know?
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.800]   Like, it's not like, oh, let's talk about it.
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:38.480]   It's more like, let's go do something.
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:42.160]   And I started doing a project called
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.680]   12 Startups in 12 Months,
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.320]   where every month I would make something like a project
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.160]   and I would launch it with Stripe
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:49.120]   so people could pay for it.
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:52.160]   - So the basic format is try to build a thing,
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.000]   put it online and put Stripe
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.200]   to where you can pay money for it.
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.240]   - Yeah, add a Stripe check.
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.120]   I'm not sponsored by Stripe,
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.400]   but add a Stripe checkout button.
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.320]   - Is that still like the easiest way
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:02.240]   to just like pay for stuff, Stripe?
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.520]   - 100%, like I think so, yeah.
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:04.480]   - It's a cool company.
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:05.520]   They just made it so easy.
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:06.480]   You can just click and-
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:08.080]   - Yeah, and they're really nice.
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.520]   Like the CEO, Patrick, is really nice.
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.440]   - Behind the scenes, it must be difficult
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:12.960]   to like actually make that happen.
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.400]   'Cause that used to be a huge problem.
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.360]   - Merchant.
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:18.160]   - Just adding a thing, a button,
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.680]   where you can like pay for a thing.
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.600]   - Dude, dude, I know this
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.480]   because when I was nine years old,
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:25.760]   I was making websites also.
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.400]   And I tried to open a merchant account.
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:29.440]   There was like before Stripe,
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:32.800]   you would have like, I think it was called WorldPay.
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.280]   So I had to like fill out all these forms.
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:37.440]   And then I had to fax them to America
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.040]   from Holland with my dad's fax.
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:42.320]   And my dad had to, it wasn't my dad's name.
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:43.120]   And he had to sign for this.
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:44.480]   And he started reading these terms and conditions,
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:45.600]   which was like, he's liable
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.920]   for like 100 million in damages.
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:49.360]   And he's like, "I don't wanna sign this."
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.040]   I'm like, "Dad, come on, I need a merchant account.
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.160]   "I need to make money on the internet."
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.960]   And he signed it and we faxed it to America.
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.160]   And I had a merchant account,
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.840]   but then nobody paid for anything.
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:58.800]   So that was the problem, you know?
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.400]   But it's much easier now.
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.360]   You can sign up, you add some codes and yeah.
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.960]   - So 12 startups in 12 months.
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:05.760]   - Yeah.
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:09.840]   - So startup number one, what was that?
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:11.760]   What were you feeling?
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:14.080]   What were you, you sit behind the computer.
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.600]   Like how much do you actually know
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.000]   about building stuff at that point?
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.440]   - Well, I could code a little bit
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:20.480]   'cause I did the YouTube channel
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.480]   and I made a website for,
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.320]   I would make websites for like the YouTube channel.
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.920]   It was called Panda Mix Show.
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:27.600]   And it was like these electronic music mixes
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.520]   like dubstep or drum and bass or techno or house.
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:31.280]   - I saw one of them had like Flash.
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:32.080]   Were you using Flash?
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:34.640]   - Yeah, my album, my CD album was using Flash.
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:36.160]   Yeah, I sold my CD, yeah.
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.800]   - 'Cause Flash was a software. - Flash was cool.
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.000]   - This is like the break.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.160]   - Like grandpa, you know, but Flash was cool.
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:44.080]   - Yeah, and there was, what's it called?
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:45.760]   Boy, I should remember this ActionScript.
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.120]   There's some kind of programming language.
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:49.280]   - ActionScript, yeah, ActionScript in Flash.
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:50.720]   Back then that was the JavaScript, you know?
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:51.840]   - The JavaScript, yeah.
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:53.200]   And I thought that's gonna,
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.720]   that's supposed to be the dynamic thing
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.080]   that takes over the internet.
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.520]   I invested so many hours in learning that.
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:58.800]   - And Steve Jobs killed it.
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:00.160]   - Steve Jobs killed it. - Steve Jobs said,
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:01.360]   "Flash sucks, stop using it."
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.080]   And everyone's like, "Okay."
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:04.000]   - That guy was right though, right?
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.360]   - Yeah, I don't know, yeah.
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:07.120]   Well, it was a closed platform, I think.
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:10.000]   And it's ironic 'cause Apple, you know,
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.360]   they're not very open.
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.960]   But back then Steve was like,
[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.400]   "This is closed, we should not use it."
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.400]   And it's security problems, I think,
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:17.520]   which sounded like a cop-out.
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:18.800]   Like he just wanted to say that
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:19.840]   to make it look kind of bad.
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:22.320]   But Flash was cool, yeah.
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:23.520]   - Yeah, it was cool for a time.
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:26.960]   Listen, animated GIFs were cool for a time too.
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:29.360]   They came back in a different way.
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:30.480]   As a meme though.
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:34.400]   I mean, like, I remember when GIFs were actually cool,
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:35.760]   not ironically cool.
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:40.480]   On the internet, you would have like a dancing rabbit
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:41.600]   or something like this.
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:42.480]   And that was really exciting.
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:44.320]   - You had like the, you know, Lex homepage.
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:46.000]   Everyone was centered.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.240]   And you had like Peter's homepage.
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.800]   And on the construction GIF,
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:53.280]   which was like a guy with a helmet.
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:54.560]   And the lights, it was amazing.
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:55.200]   - And the banners.
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:58.400]   That's how, before like Google AdSense,
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:59.760]   you would have like banners for advertising.
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:00.960]   - It was amazing, yeah.
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:03.680]   - And a lot of links to porn, I think.
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:06.640]   - Yeah, I think that was where the merchant accounts
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:07.440]   people would use for it.
[00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:08.400]   People would make money a lot.
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:10.480]   Only money made on the internet was like porn,
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:11.200]   or a lot of it.
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:13.840]   - Yeah, it was a dark place.
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:14.800]   It's still a dark place.
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:17.280]   But there's beauty in the darkness.
[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:20.560]   Anyway, so you did some basic HTML.
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:23.200]   - Yeah, but I had to learn the actual coding.
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:24.800]   So this was good.
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:27.280]   It was a good idea to like every month launch a startup
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:30.240]   so I could learn the codes, learn basic stuff.
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.160]   But it was still very scrappy
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.160]   'cause I didn't have time to, which was on purpose.
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.000]   I didn't have time to spend a lot of,
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.120]   I had a month to do something.
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:38.240]   So I couldn't spend more than a month.
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.280]   And I was pretty strict about that.
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:41.680]   And I published it as a blog post.
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:43.760]   So people, I think I put it on Hacker News
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:44.960]   and people would check like,
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:46.480]   kind of like, oh, did you actually, you know?
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:48.800]   I felt like accountability 'cause I put it public
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:49.760]   that I actually had to do it.
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:51.200]   - Do you remember the first one you did?
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:54.000]   - I think it was play my inbox.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.840]   'Cause back then my friends, we would send,
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:59.440]   we would send like cool, it was before Spotify, I think.
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:01.120]   We would send like, 2014,
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:03.040]   we would send music to each other, like YouTube links.
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:05.680]   Like this is a cool song, this is a cool song.
[00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:08.080]   And it was these giant email threads on Gmail
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:10.160]   and they were like unnavigatable.
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.720]   So I made an app that would log into your Gmail,
[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:15.840]   get them emails and find the ones with YouTube links.
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:18.720]   And then make like, kind of like a gallery of your songs,
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:19.840]   like essentially Spotify.
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:21.360]   And my friends loved it.
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.040]   - Was it scraping it?
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:23.440]   Like what was the API?
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:26.240]   - No, it uses like POP, like pop or IMAP.
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:28.000]   You know, it would actually check your email.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.280]   So that like privacy concerns,
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:31.520]   'cause it would get all your emails to find YouTube links,
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:32.960]   but then I wouldn't save anything.
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:35.760]   But that was fun.
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:37.760]   It was like, and that first product
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:39.120]   already would get like press.
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:42.800]   Like it went on, I think like some tech media and stuff.
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:43.680]   And I was like, that's cool.
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:44.560]   Like it didn't make money.
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:45.840]   There was no payment button,
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:49.680]   but it was actually people using it.
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:51.360]   I think tens of thousands of people used it.
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:52.400]   - That's a great idea.
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:54.960]   I wonder why, like, why don't we have that?
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:57.280]   Why don't we have things that access Gmail
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:01.440]   and extract some useful aggregate information?
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.040]   - Yeah, you could tell Gmail like,
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.080]   don't give me all the emails.
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:05.440]   Just give me the ones with YouTube links,
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:06.240]   you know, or something like that.
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:06.880]   - Yeah.
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:09.120]   I mean, there is a whole ecosystem of like apps
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:10.560]   you can build on top of the Google.
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:10.880]   - Yeah.
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:12.160]   - But people don't really--
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:12.800]   - Never do this.
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:16.480]   - They build, I've seen a few like Boomerang.
[00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:18.720]   There's a few apps that are like good,
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:20.320]   but just, I wonder what,
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:21.680]   maybe it's not easy to make money.
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:23.360]   - I think it's hard to get people to pay
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:25.200]   for these like extensions and plugins, you know?
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:26.400]   'Cause it's not like a real app.
[00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:28.320]   So it's not like people don't value it.
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:30.480]   People value it, oh, and a plugin should be free.
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:31.840]   You know, when I wanna use a plugin
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:32.800]   in Google Sheets or something,
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:33.760]   I'm not gonna pay for it.
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:35.840]   Like it should be free, which is,
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:37.520]   but if you go to a website and you actually,
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:38.720]   okay, I need this product.
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.800]   I'm gonna pay for this 'cause it's a real product.
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.640]   So even though it's the same code in the back,
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:43.520]   it's a plugin, you know?
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:46.640]   - Yeah, I mean, you can do it through like extensions,
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:49.120]   like Chrome extensions from the browser side.
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:50.640]   - Yeah, but who pays for Chrome extensions, right?
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:51.600]   Like barely anybody.
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:54.400]   So that's not a good place to make money probably.
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:55.440]   - Yeah, that sucks.
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:57.200]   - Like Chrome extensions should be an extension
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.000]   for your startup, you know?
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:58.880]   You have a product.
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:01.520]   Oh, we also have a Chrome extension, you know?
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:05.040]   - I wish the Chrome extension would be the product.
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:06.560]   I wish Chrome would support that,
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:08.320]   like where you could pay for it easily.
[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:11.200]   'Cause like imagine, I can imagine a lot of products
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.040]   that would just live as extensions,
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:14.880]   like improvements for social media.
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.880]   - Yeah, it's like GPTs, you know?
[00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:17.680]   - GPTs, yeah.
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:19.680]   - Like these chat GPTs, they're gonna charge money for it.
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:22.480]   Now you get a rev share, I think, for an open AI.
[00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:23.520]   I made a lot of them also.
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.200]   - Right, we'll talk about it.
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.560]   So let's rewind back.
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:30.000]   It's a pretty cool idea to do 12 startups in 12 months.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.960]   What's it take to build a thing in 30 days?
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:35.360]   Like at that time, how hard was that?
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:38.880]   - I think the hard part is like figuring out
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:39.840]   what you shouldn't add, right?
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:41.920]   Which you shouldn't build because you don't have time.
[00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:43.840]   So you need to build a landing page.
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:47.280]   Well, you need to build the product actually,
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:48.720]   'cause they need to be something they pay for.
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:51.360]   Do you need to build a login system?
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:52.320]   Like maybe no, you know?
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.240]   Like maybe you can build some scrappy login system.
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:57.200]   Like for PhotEye, you sign up, you pay with Stripe checkout
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.880]   and you get a login link.
[00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:00.880]   And when I started, it was only a login link with a hash
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.240]   and that's just a static link.
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:03.840]   So it's very easy to log in.
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:04.800]   It's not so safe, you know?
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:05.680]   What if you leak the link?
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.760]   And now I have real Google login,
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:08.640]   but that took like a year.
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:11.600]   So keeping it very scrappy is very important to,
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:13.360]   'cause you don't have time, you know?
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:16.320]   You need to focus on what you can build fast.
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:20.960]   So money, Stripe, build a product, build a landing page.
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:24.560]   You need to think about how are people gonna find this.
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.640]   So are you gonna put it on Reddit or something?
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:27.680]   How are you gonna put it on Reddit
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:29.600]   without being looked at as a spammer, right?
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:32.080]   Like if you say, "Hey, this is my new startup.
[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:32.640]   You should use it."
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.400]   No, nobody gets deleted, you know?
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:37.280]   Maybe if you find a problem that a lot of people
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:39.120]   on Reddit already have on subreddits, you know?
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:40.560]   Like you solve the problem and say,
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:43.920]   "Sup people, I made this thing that might solve your problem
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:45.680]   and maybe it's free for now," you know?
[00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:48.080]   Like that could work, you know?
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:50.560]   But you need to be very, you know,
[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:53.360]   narrow it down what you're building.
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:54.400]   - Time is limited.
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:55.120]   - Yeah.
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:58.560]   - Actually, can we go back to the you laying in a room
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:19:59.600]   feeling like a loser?
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:00.240]   - Yeah.
[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:02.000]   - I still feel like a loser sometimes.
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:06.880]   What's, what can you, can you speak to that feeling,
[00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:11.280]   to that place of just like feeling like a loser?
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:13.760]   And 'cause I think a lot of people in this world
[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:16.480]   are laying in a room right now listening to this
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:18.480]   and feeling like a loser.
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:19.920]   - Okay, so I think it's normal if you're young
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:21.280]   that you feel like a loser, first of all.
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:22.960]   - Especially when you're 27.
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:24.640]   - Yes, yeah, especially-
[00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:25.360]   - There's like a peak.
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:27.360]   - Yeah, yeah, I think 27 is the peak.
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.040]   And so I would not kill yourselves.
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:31.920]   It's very important to just get through it, you know?
[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:34.960]   But because you have nothing, you have probably no money,
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:36.320]   you have no business, you have no job.
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:40.240]   Like Jeremy Peterson said this, I saw it somewhere.
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:41.360]   Like the reason people are depressed
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:42.000]   because they have nothing.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.520]   They don't have a girlfriend, they don't have a boyfriend,
[00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:45.280]   they don't have, you need stuff.
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:47.520]   You need like, or a family, you need things around you.
[00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:48.640]   You need to build a life for yourself.
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:50.400]   If you don't build a life for yourself, you'll be depressed.
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:53.520]   So if you're alone in Asia, in a hostel,
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:54.560]   looking at the ceiling
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:56.240]   and you don't have any money coming in,
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:57.920]   you don't have a girlfriend, you don't,
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:59.360]   of course you're depressed, it's logic.
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:00.560]   But back then, if you're in the moment,
[00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:01.520]   you think there's not logic,
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:02.560]   there's something wrong with me, you know?
[00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:05.760]   And also I think I started going,
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.040]   I started getting like anxiety
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:09.440]   and I think I started going a little bit crazy
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:12.480]   where I think travel can make you insane.
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:14.000]   And I know this because I know
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.360]   that there's like digital nomads
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:16.640]   that they kill themselves.
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:18.640]   And I haven't checked like the comparison
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:20.400]   with like baseline people, like Suze Iray.
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:23.920]   But I have a hunch, especially in the beginning
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:25.760]   when it was a very new thing, like 10 years ago,
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:29.760]   that it can be very psychologically taxing
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:32.400]   and you're alone a lot.
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:33.760]   Back then when you travel alone,
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:35.760]   there was no other digital nomads back then a lot.
[00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:38.000]   So you're in a strange culture,
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.200]   you look different than everybody.
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:40.400]   Like you're in, I was in Asia,
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.080]   like everybody's really nice in Thailand,
[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:44.400]   but you're not part of the culture,
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:45.760]   you're traveling around,
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:47.120]   you're hopping from city to city,
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:49.120]   you don't have a home anymore,
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:51.520]   you feel disrooted.
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:54.000]   - And you're constantly an outcast
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.600]   in that you're different from everybody else.
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:56.320]   - Yes, exactly.
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:58.400]   But people treat you like Thailand, people are so nice,
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:21:59.680]   but you still feel like an outcast.
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:02.400]   And then I think the digital nomads I met then
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:04.640]   were all kind of like, it was like shady business,
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:06.560]   but they were like vigilantes 'cause it was a new thing.
[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:08.960]   And like one guy was selling illegal drugs,
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:10.560]   it was American guy was selling illegal drugs
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:13.200]   via UPS to Americans on his website.
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:15.520]   They were like a lot of drop shippers doing shady stuff.
[00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:18.880]   There's a lot of shady things going on there.
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:20.720]   And they didn't look like very balanced people.
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:22.720]   They didn't look like people I wanted to hang with.
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:26.320]   So I also felt outcast from other foreigners in Thailand,
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:27.680]   other digital nomads.
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:29.440]   And I was like, man, I made a big mistake.
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:30.720]   And then I went back to Holland
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:32.000]   and then I got even more depressed.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.480]   - You said digital nomad, what is digital nomad?
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:35.680]   What is that way of life?
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:36.800]   What is the philosophy there?
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:38.560]   And the history of the movement?
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:40.480]   - I struck upon it on accident
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:42.240]   'cause I was like, I'm gonna graduate university
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:43.840]   and then I need to get out of here.
[00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:45.600]   I'll fly to Asia 'cause I've been before in Asia.
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:48.160]   I studied in Korea in 2009, like study exchange.
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:50.400]   So I was like, Asia is easy, Thailand's easy.
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:51.920]   And I'll just go there and figure things out.
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:53.040]   And it's cheap, it's very cheap.
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:55.920]   Chiang Mai, I would live like for $150 per month rent
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:57.280]   for like a private room, pretty good.
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:58.560]   So I struck upon this on accident.
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:00.640]   I was like, okay, there's other people on laptops
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:03.120]   working on their startup or working remotely.
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:04.160]   Back then, nobody worked remotely,
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:06.160]   but they worked on their businesses, right?
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:10.480]   And they would live in like Colombia
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:13.440]   or Thailand or Vietnam or Bali.
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:15.280]   They would live kind of like in more cheap places.
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:17.840]   And it looked like a very adventurous life.
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:20.560]   Like you travel around, you build your business.
[00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:22.720]   There's no pressure from like your home society, right?
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:24.080]   Like you're American.
[00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:25.760]   So you get pressure from American society
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:26.640]   telling you kind of what to do.
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:28.720]   Like you need to buy a house or you need to do this stuff.
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:29.680]   I had this in Holland too.
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:32.000]   And you can get away from this pressure.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.600]   You can kind of feel like you're free.
[00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:36.720]   There's nobody telling you what to do,
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.520]   but that's also why you start feeling like you go crazy
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:40.880]   'cause you are free.
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:43.760]   You're disattached from anything and anybody.
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:46.080]   You're disattached from your culture.
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:47.760]   You're disattached from the culture you're probably in
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:49.200]   'cause you're staying very short.
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:53.200]   - I think Franz Kafka said, "I'm free, therefore I'm lost."
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:54.800]   - Man, that's so true.
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:55.920]   Yeah, that's exactly the point.
[00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:58.080]   And yeah, freedom is like,
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:23:59.920]   it's the definition of no constraints, right?
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:01.120]   Like anything's possible.
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:01.920]   You can go anywhere.
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:04.880]   And everybody's like, "Oh, that must be super nice."
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.960]   You know, like freedom, you must be very happy.
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:07.760]   And it's the opposite.
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:09.200]   Like, I don't think that makes you happy.
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:11.040]   I think constraints probably make you happy.
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:12.400]   And that's a big lesson I learned then.
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:15.600]   - But what were they making for money?
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:18.160]   So you're saying they were doing shady stuff at that time?
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:20.800]   - For me, you know, 'cause I was more like a developer.
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:22.160]   I wanted to make startups kinda.
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:27.200]   And it was like drugs being shipped to America,
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:31.200]   like diet pills and stuff, like non-FDA proof stuff, you know?
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:33.120]   And they would like, there was no like effort.
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:34.480]   They were like, they would sit with beers
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:36.160]   and they would laugh about like all the dodgy shit
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:37.040]   kinda they're doing, you know?
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:38.240]   - Oh, that part of it, okay.
[00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:39.040]   - That kind of vibe, you know?
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:41.200]   Like kinda sleazy e-com vibe.
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.720]   I'm not saying all e-com is sleazy, you know?
[00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:44.480]   But you know, this vibe.
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:45.600]   - It could be a vibe.
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:49.600]   And your vibe was more build cool shit that's ethical.
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:51.600]   - You know the guys with sports cars in Dubai?
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:52.320]   These people, you know?
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:52.960]   - Yes.
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:55.120]   - E-com, like, oh, bro, you gotta drop shit.
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:55.440]   - Yeah.
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:57.600]   - And you'll make a hundred million a month.
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:59.120]   Those people, it was this shit.
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:00.640]   And I was like, this is not my people.
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:03.040]   - Yeah, I don't, I mean, there's nothing wrong
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:04.240]   with any of those individual components.
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:05.040]   - No, no judgment.
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:10.080]   - But there's a foundation that's not quite ethical.
[00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:10.640]   What is that?
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:11.440]   I don't know what that is.
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:12.160]   But yeah, I get you.
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:13.360]   - No, like, I don't wanna judge.
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:15.600]   It was more, I know that for me, it wasn't my world.
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:16.880]   It wasn't my subculture.
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:18.720]   I wanted to make cool shit, you know?
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.400]   But they also think their cool shit is cool.
[00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:24.080]   So, you know, but I wanted to make like real like startups.
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:25.040]   And that was my thing.
[00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:27.440]   I would read Hacker News, you know, like Y Combinator.
[00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:28.800]   And they were making cool stuff.
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:29.920]   So I wanted to make cool stuff.
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:32.400]   - I mean, that's a pretty cool way of life.
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:34.480]   Just if you romanticize it for a moment.
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:35.680]   - It's very romantic, man.
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.600]   It's very, it's colorful, you know?
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:38.720]   Like if I think about the memories.
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:40.640]   - I mean, what are some happy memories?
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:43.600]   Just like working, working cafes or working in,
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:51.600]   just the freedom that envelops you with that way of life.
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:52.720]   'Cause anything is possible.
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:53.360]   You can just get up and go.
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:54.320]   - No, I think it was amazing.
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:56.320]   Like we would work, like you wouldn't,
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:58.720]   I would make friends and we would work until, you know,
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:02.560]   6 a.m. in Bali, for example, with like,
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:06.960]   with Andre, my best friend, who is still my best friend.
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:07.920]   And we would, and other friends,
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:09.440]   and we would work until like the morning
[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:10.640]   when the sun came up.
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.880]   Because at night, the coworking space was silent,
[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:13.840]   you know, there was nobody else.
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:18.000]   And I would wake up like 6 p.m. or 5 p.m.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.400]   I would drive to the coworking space on a motorbike.
[00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:23.920]   I would buy like 30 hot lattes from a cafe.
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:24.720]   - How many?
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:28.640]   - 30, 'cause there was like six people coming.
[00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:30.240]   Or we didn't know, sometimes people would come in.
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:32.240]   - Did you say three, zero, 30?
[00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:32.800]   - Yeah.
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:33.600]   - Nice.
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:35.680]   - And we would drink like four per person or something,
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:35.920]   you know?
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:37.280]   Man, it's Bali.
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:38.880]   I don't know if they were powerful lattes, you know,
[00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:40.000]   but they were lattes.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.360]   And we would put it in a plastic bag
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:42.320]   and then we'd drive there.
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:45.120]   And all the coffee was like falling, you know, everywhere.
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:46.480]   And then we'd go to the coworking space
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:47.760]   and have these coffees here.
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:49.440]   And we'd work all night.
[00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:50.960]   We'd play like techno music
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:53.120]   and everybody would just work in there.
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:54.560]   Like this was literally like business people.
[00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:55.440]   They would work in their startup
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:56.720]   and we'd all try and make something.
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:58.880]   And then the sun would come up
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:03.440]   and the morning people, you know, the yoga girls
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:04.800]   and yoga guys would come in, you know,
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:06.400]   after the yoga class at six.
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:07.840]   And they'd say, "Hey, good morning."
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:09.440]   And we're like, we look like this, you know?
[00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:11.200]   And we're like, "What's up, how are you doing?"
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:13.120]   And we didn't know how bad we looked, you know,
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:14.400]   but it was very bad.
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:17.360]   And then we'd go home, sleep in like a hostel or a hotel
[00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:18.640]   and do the same thing.
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:19.760]   And again, and again, and again.
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:23.280]   And it was this lock-in mode, you know, like working.
[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:26.080]   And that was very fun.
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:28.000]   - So it's just a bunch of you,
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.120]   techno music blasting all through the night, yeah.
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:32.880]   - Or more like (beatboxing)
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:35.120]   like industrially, not like this cheesy.
[00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:39.040]   - See, I got, for me, it's such an interesting thing
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:40.560]   because the speed of the beat affects
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:41.760]   how I feel about a thing.
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:44.400]   So the faster it is, the more anxiety I feel.
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:46.960]   But that anxiety is channeled into productivity.
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:48.400]   But if it's a little too fast,
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:50.800]   I start, the anxiety overpowers.
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:52.000]   - So you don't like drum and bass music?
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.040]   - Probably not.
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:53.920]   - No, it's too fast.
[00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:57.200]   - I mean, for working, I have to play with it.
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:58.160]   It's like, you can actually,
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:01.040]   like I can adjust my level of anxiety.
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:02.880]   There must be a better word than anxiety.
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:07.440]   It's like productive anxiety that I like, whatever that is.
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:08.960]   - It also depends what kind of work you do, right?
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:10.160]   Like if you're writing,
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:11.680]   you probably don't want drum and bass music.
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:14.320]   I think for codes, like industrial techno,
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:16.320]   this kind of stuff, kind of fast.
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:18.320]   It works well 'cause you really get like locked in
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:23.280]   and combined with caffeine, you go deep.
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:25.920]   And I think you balance on this edge of anxiety
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:27.600]   'cause this caffeine is also hitting your anxiety.
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:29.360]   You wanna be on the edge of anxiety
[00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:30.320]   with this techno running.
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:31.760]   Sometimes it gets too much.
[00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:33.120]   It's like, stop the techno, stop the music.
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:36.640]   It's like, but those are good memories.
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:37.760]   And also like travel memories.
[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:40.480]   Like you go from city to city and it feels like,
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:42.240]   it's kind of like jet set life.
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:43.920]   Like it feels very beautiful.
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:46.080]   Like you're seeing a lot of cool cities.
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:49.280]   - What was your favorite place that you remember you visited?
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:54.400]   - I think still like Bangkok is the best place.
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:58.000]   And back in Chiang Mai, I think Thailand is very special.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.440]   Like I've been to the other place,
[00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:00.320]   like I've been to Vietnam
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:02.240]   and I've been to South America and stuff.
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:05.680]   I still think Thailand wins in how nice people are,
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:07.680]   how easy of a life people have there.
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:08.960]   - Everything's cheap.
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:10.320]   - Yeah. - And good.
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:11.760]   - Well, Bangkok is getting expensive now,
[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:13.440]   but Chiang Mai is still cheap.
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:15.440]   I think when you're starting out, it's a great place.
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:17.120]   Man, the air quality sucks.
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:17.840]   It's a big problem.
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:21.440]   So, and it's quite hot, but that's a very cool place.
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:23.280]   - Pros and cons.
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:25.040]   - I love Brazil also.
[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:26.720]   My girlfriend is Brazilian, but I do love,
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:28.240]   not just because of that, but I like Brazil.
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:31.600]   The problem still is the safety issue.
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:34.320]   You know, like it's like in America, like it's localized.
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.560]   It's hard for Europeans to understand like safety's localized
[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:37.840]   to specific areas.
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:39.680]   So if you go to the right areas, it's amazing.
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:40.480]   Brazil is amazing.
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:43.520]   If you go to the wrong areas, like maybe you die, right?
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:45.040]   - Yeah. - Yeah, I mean, that's true.
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:46.880]   - But it's not true in Europe.
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:48.160]   So in Europe it's much more-- - That's true.
[00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:50.320]   - More average. - You're right, you're right.
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:52.320]   It's more averaged out.
[00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:53.600]   - Yeah. - I like it when
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:54.800]   there's strong neighborhoods.
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:57.520]   When you like, you cross a certain street
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:59.280]   and you're in a dangerous part of town.
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:02.000]   - Man, yeah. - I like it.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.480]   I like there's certain cities in the United States like that.
[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:05.360]   - Yeah. - I like that.
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:07.440]   And you're saying Europe is-- - But you don't feel scared?
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:10.160]   - Well, I don't, I like danger. - BJJ.
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:12.320]   - No, not even just that.
[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:13.680]   I think danger is interesting.
[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:17.920]   So danger reveals something about yourself, about others.
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:19.760]   Also, I like the full range of humanity.
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:20.960]   - Yeah. - So I don't like
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:23.200]   the mellowed out aspects of humanity.
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:24.720]   - I have friends, like these are my friends
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:25.600]   that are exactly like this.
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:29.040]   Like they go to like the kind of broken areas, you know?
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:30.480]   Like they like this reality.
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:32.000]   They like this authenticity more.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:32.960]   They don't like luxury.
[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:34.960]   They don't like-- - Oh yeah, I hate luxury.
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:36.480]   - Yeah, that's very European of you.
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:38.480]   - Wait, what's that?
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:40.800]   That's a whole 'nother conversation.
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:46.240]   So you quoted Freya Stark, quote,
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:48.640]   "To awaken quite alone in a strange town
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:52.080]   is one of the most pleasant sensations in the world."
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:54.640]   - Yeah. - Do you remember a time
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:58.080]   you awoken in a strange town and felt like that?
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:00.080]   We're talking about small towns or big towns or?
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:00.960]   - Man, anywhere.
[00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:03.200]   I think I wrote it in some blog posts and like,
[00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:06.640]   it was a common thing when you would wake up.
[00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:08.720]   And this was like, 'cause I have this website.
[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:10.480]   I started a website about this digital nomads
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:12.880]   called nomadlist.com and there was a community.
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:15.040]   So it was like 30,000 other digital nomads
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:15.840]   'cause I was feeling lonely.
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:18.240]   So I built this website and I stopped feeling lonely.
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:21.280]   Like I started organizing meetups and making friends.
[00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:23.520]   And it was very common that people would say
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:26.080]   they would wake up and they would forget where they are.
[00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:28.960]   - Yeah. - Like for the first half minute
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:30.400]   and I had to look outside, like, where am I?
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:31.680]   Which country?
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:32.720]   Which sounds really like privilege,
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:33.600]   but it was more like funny.
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:35.680]   Like you literally don't know where you are
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:36.960]   because you're so disrooted.
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:41.040]   But there's something, man, it's like Anthony Bourdain.
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:43.680]   You know, there's something pure about this kind of
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:47.920]   vagabond travel thing, you know?
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:49.040]   Like it's behind me, I think.
[00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:51.040]   I don't like, now I travel with my girlfriend, right?
[00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:53.920]   It's very different, but it is a romantic like memories
[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:58.080]   of this kind of like vagabond individualistic solo life.
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:31:59.440]   But the thing is, it didn't make me happy,
[00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:01.440]   but it was very cool, but it didn't make me happy, right?
[00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:02.400]   It made me anxious.
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:05.440]   - There's something about it that made you anxious.
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:06.560]   I don't know, I still feel like that.
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:07.840]   It's a cool feeling.
[00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:10.240]   It's scary at first, but then you realize where you are
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:14.560]   and you, I don't know, it's like you awaken
[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:16.320]   to the possibilities of this place.
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:17.360]   - That's it. - When you feel like that.
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:18.560]   - That's it. - It's like, great.
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:21.040]   And it's even when you're doing some basic travel.
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:22.080]   - Yeah. - Like go to San Francisco
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:22.560]   or something else.
[00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:23.840]   - Yeah, you have like the novelty effect.
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:26.960]   Like you're in a new place, like here things are possible.
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:28.800]   You know, you don't get bored yet
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:33.200]   and that's why people get addicted to travel, you know?
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:34.480]   - Back to startups.
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:37.840]   You wrote a book on how to do this thing
[00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:40.720]   and gave a great talk on it, how to do startups.
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:43.840]   The book's called "Make Bootstrappers Handbook."
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:45.040]   - Yeah. - I was wondering
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:46.720]   if you could go through some of the steps.
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:50.400]   It's idea, build, launch, grow, monetize, automate, and exit.
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:52.400]   There's a lot of fascinating ideas in each one.
[00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:56.320]   So idea stage, how do you find a good idea?
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:58.560]   - Yeah, so I think you need to be able to spot problems.
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:00.400]   So for example, you can go in your daily life,
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:01.920]   like when you wake up and you're like,
[00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:03.920]   what is stuff that I'm really annoyed with?
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:08.160]   That's like in my daily life that doesn't function well.
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:10.400]   And that's a problem that you can see, okay,
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:13.680]   maybe that's something I can add, write code about,
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:16.240]   you know, code for, and it will make my life easier.
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:18.400]   So I would say make like a list of all these problems
[00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:20.080]   you have and like idea to solve it.
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:22.320]   And I see which one is like viable,
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:24.720]   you can actually do something and then start building it.
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:26.880]   - So that's a really good place to start.
[00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:31.520]   Become open to all the problems in your life.
[00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:33.040]   Like actually start noticing them.
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:35.040]   I think that's actually not a trivial thing to do,
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:38.000]   to realize that some aspects of your life
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.120]   could be done way, way better.
[00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:39.440]   - Yeah.
[00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:43.920]   - 'Cause we kind of very quickly get accustomed to discomforts.
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:44.400]   - Exactly.
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:47.120]   - Like, for example, like doorknobs.
[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:47.760]   - Yeah.
[00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:49.760]   - Like design of certain things.
[00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:52.000]   - New Lex Prima doorknob.
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:57.440]   - Well, that one I know how much incredible design work
[00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:58.240]   has gone into.
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:00.800]   It's a really interesting doors and doorknobs.
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:04.800]   It's just the design of everyday things, forks and spoons.
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:06.480]   It's gonna be hard to come up with a fork
[00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:08.400]   that's better than the current fork designs.
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:11.120]   And the other aspect of it is you're saying like,
[00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:12.640]   in order to come up with interesting ideas,
[00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:15.200]   you gotta try to live a more interesting life.
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:17.440]   - Yeah, but that's where travel comes in.
[00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:19.200]   Because when I started traveling,
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:21.040]   I started seeing stuff in other countries
[00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:22.800]   that you didn't have in Europe, for example,
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:23.760]   or America even.
[00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:27.680]   Like if you go to Asia, like dude,
[00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:29.200]   especially 10 years ago, nobody knew about this.
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:31.840]   Like the WeChat, all these apps that they already had
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:34.480]   before we had them, these everything apps, right?
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:36.480]   Like now Elon's trying to make X this everything app,
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:37.600]   like WeChat, same thing.
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:40.480]   In Indonesia or Thailand, you have one app
[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:43.040]   that you can order food with, you can order groceries,
[00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:46.960]   you can order massage, you can order car mechanic.
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:50.080]   Anything you can think of is in the app.
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:53.760]   And that stuff, for example, that's called like arbitrage.
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:56.480]   You can go back to your country and build that same app
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:57.920]   for your country, for example.
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:01.440]   So you start seeing problems.
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:03.360]   You start seeing solutions that other countries already,
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:05.360]   other people already did in the rest of the world.
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:08.800]   And also traveling in general just gives you more problems
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:10.640]   'cause travel is uncomfortable.
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:13.280]   Airports are horrible.
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:15.280]   Airplanes are not comfortable either.
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:17.440]   There's a lot of problems you start seeing
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:18.480]   just getting out of your house.
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:21.360]   - But also you can, I mean, in the digital world,
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:23.600]   you can just go into different communities
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:26.000]   and see what can be improved by the others in that.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.280]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:29.680]   - But what specifically is your process
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:30.880]   of generating ideas?
[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:32.960]   Do you like do idea dumps?
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:33.840]   Like do you have a document
[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:34.640]   where you just keep writing stuff?
[00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:35.840]   - Yeah, I used to have like a,
[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:37.280]   'cause when I wasn't making money,
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:39.520]   I was trying to like make this list of ideas
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:41.600]   to see like, so I need to build,
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:42.800]   I was thinking statistically already,
[00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:44.000]   like I need to build all these things
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.160]   and one of these will work out probably.
[00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:47.680]   So I need to have a lot of things to try.
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:50.160]   And I did that.
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:51.040]   Right now, I think like,
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:52.000]   because I already have money,
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.280]   I can do more things based on technology.
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:57.840]   So for example, AI, when I found out about,
[00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:00.960]   when stable diffusion came or chatGBT and stuff,
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:02.480]   all these things were like,
[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:06.400]   I didn't start working with them because I had a problem.
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:07.760]   I had no problems,
[00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:09.680]   but I was very curious about technology
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:12.480]   and I was like playing with it
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:15.360]   and figuring out like first just playing with it
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:16.640]   and then you find something like,
[00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:18.400]   okay, this generates,
[00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:20.320]   stable diffusion generates houses very beautiful
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:21.280]   and interiors, you know?
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:22.800]   - So it's less about problem solving,
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:24.000]   it's more about the possibilities
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.200]   of new things you can create.
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:26.880]   - Yeah, but that's very risky
[00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:28.400]   because that's the famous like solution
[00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:29.120]   trying to find a problem.
[00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:31.280]   And usually it doesn't work.
[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:33.120]   And that's very common with startup founders.
[00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:34.880]   I think they have tech,
[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:36.880]   but actually people don't need the tech, right?
[00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:38.880]   - Can you actually explain,
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:41.760]   it'd be cool to talk about some of the stuff you've created.
[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:45.440]   Can you explain the photoAI.com?
[00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:47.840]   - Yeah, so it's like fire your photographer.
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:48.560]   The idea is like,
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:49.680]   you don't need a photographer anymore.
[00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:52.320]   You can train yourself as an AI model
[00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:54.000]   and you can take as many photos as you want
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.120]   anywhere in any clothes,
[00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:59.280]   with facial expressions like happy or sad
[00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:01.920]   or poses, all this stuff.
[00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:03.440]   - So how does it work?
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:09.200]   This is a link to a gallery of ones done on me.
[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:11.600]   - So on the left, you have the prompts, the box.
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:12.640]   Yeah, so you can write like,
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:14.800]   so model is your model, this Lex Friedman.
[00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:17.680]   So you can write like model as a blah, blah, blah,
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:18.720]   whatever you want.
[00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:20.240]   Then press the button and it will take photos.
[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:21.760]   It will take like one minute.
[00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:23.920]   - What are you using for the hosting for the compute?
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:26.320]   - Replicate, replicate.com.
[00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:27.280]   They're very, very good.
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:28.480]   - Okay, it's cool.
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:30.000]   Like this interface wise,
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   it's cool that you're showing how long it's going to take.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.040]   This is amazing.
[00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:33.920]   So it's taking a,
[00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:36.320]   I'm presuming you just loaded in a few pictures
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:36.960]   from the internet.
[00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:38.800]   - Yeah, so I went to Google images,
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:39.760]   typed in Lex Friedman.
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:41.680]   I added like 10 or 20 images.
[00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:42.880]   You can open them in the gallery
[00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:46.080]   and you can use your cursors to, yeah.
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:48.320]   So some don't look like you.
[00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:49.840]   So the hit or miss rate is like,
[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:53.440]   I don't know, let's say like 50, 50 or something.
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:54.800]   - But when I was watching your tweets,
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:56.560]   like it's been getting better and better and better.
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:57.920]   - It was very bad in the beginning.
[00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:00.240]   It was so bad, but still people signed up to it, you know?
[00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:04.960]   - There's two Lexes, it's great.
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:06.400]   It's getting more and more sexual
[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:07.760]   and it's making me very uncomfortable.
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:09.440]   - Man, but that's the problem with these models
[00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:11.200]   'cause, no, we need to talk about this
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:12.720]   'cause the models in Fusion,
[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:16.000]   so the photorealistic models that are like fine-tuned,
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.320]   they were all trained on porn in the beginning
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:19.600]   and it was a guy called Hassan.
[00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:21.200]   So I was trying to figure out
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:22.720]   how to do photorealistic AI photos
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:24.480]   and it was, Stable Diffusion by itself
[00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:25.360]   is not doing that well.
[00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:26.880]   Like the faces look all mangled
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:29.760]   and it doesn't have enough resolution
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:31.040]   or something to do that well.
[00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:34.480]   So, but I started seeing these base models,
[00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:35.280]   these fine-tuned models
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:36.720]   and people would train on porn
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:37.520]   and I would try them
[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:39.520]   and they would be very photorealistic.
[00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:41.600]   They would have bodies that actually made sense,
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:43.760]   like body anatomy.
[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:47.040]   But if you look at the photorealistic models
[00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:48.720]   that people use now still,
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:50.320]   there's still core of porn there,
[00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:51.280]   like of naked people.
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:53.120]   So I need to prompt out the naked
[00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:53.840]   and everyone needs to do this
[00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:55.360]   with AI startups, with imaging.
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:57.200]   You need to prompt out the naked stuff.
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:59.120]   You need to put a naked-
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:01.360]   - You have to keep reminding the model
[00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:02.400]   you need to put clothes on.
[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:04.160]   - Yeah, don't put naked 'cause it's very risky.
[00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:06.240]   I have Google Vision that checks every photo
[00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:07.760]   before it's shown to the user
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:09.520]   to like check for NSFW. - Like a nipple detector?
[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:11.280]   Oh, NSFW detector.
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:13.280]   - Because the journalists get very angry
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:14.160]   if they, you know.
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:15.120]   - If you sexualize.
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:16.080]   - There was a journalist, I think,
[00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:17.200]   that got angry that used this
[00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:19.600]   and was like, "Oh, it showed like a nipple."
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:21.040]   Because Google Vision didn't detect it.
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:24.080]   So there's like these kinds of problems
[00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:24.960]   you need to deal with, you know?
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:26.400]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:27.200]   This is with cats.
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:29.760]   But look at the cat face.
[00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:31.920]   It's also kind of mangled, you know?
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:36.160]   - I'm a little bit disturbed.
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:37.520]   - You can zoom in on the cat if you want.
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:40.960]   Yeah, this is a very sad cat.
[00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:42.560]   It doesn't have a nose.
[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:43.600]   - It doesn't have a nose.
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:46.240]   - Man, but this is the problem with AI startups
[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:48.000]   'cause they all act like it's perfect,
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.600]   like this is groundbreaking.
[00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:50.320]   But it's not perfect.
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:52.640]   It's like really bad, you know, half the time.
[00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:55.440]   - So if I wanted to sort of update model as...
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:56.880]   - Yeah, so you remove this stuff
[00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:59.200]   and you write like whatever you want,
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:01.680]   like in Thailand or something or in Tokyo.
[00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:03.840]   - In Tokyo?
[00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:04.400]   - Yeah.
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:06.640]   - And then...
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:09.040]   - You can say like at night with neon lights,
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:10.560]   like you can add more detail.
[00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:12.400]   - I'll go in Austin.
[00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:13.040]   Do you think I'll know?
[00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:13.920]   - Yeah, Austin.
[00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:14.640]   - In Austin, Texas.
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:15.520]   - With cowboy hats.
[00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:16.880]   - In Texas, yeah.
[00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:17.920]   - As a cowboy.
[00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:22.080]   - As a cowboy.
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:24.560]   It's going to go so towards the porn direction.
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:25.840]   - Man, I hope not.
[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:26.800]   This is the end of my career.
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:30.160]   - Or the beginning, it depends.
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:31.600]   We can send you a push notification
[00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:32.480]   when your photos are done.
[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:33.200]   Yeah, all right, cool.
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:34.960]   - Yeah, let's see.
[00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:36.000]   - Oh, wow.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.600]   So this whole interface you've built.
[00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:37.920]   - Yeah.
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:39.040]   - This is really well done.
[00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:39.920]   - It's called jQuery.
[00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:41.760]   Do I still use jQuery?
[00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:42.000]   - Yes.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:42.560]   - I'm the only one?
[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:43.040]   - Still.
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:43.360]   - After 10 years?
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:44.800]   - To this day, you're not the only one.
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:47.360]   The entire web is PHP.
[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:48.480]   - It's PHP and jQuery.
[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:49.520]   Yeah, and SQLite.
[00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:52.720]   - You're just like one of the top performers
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:54.160]   from a programming perspective
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:57.520]   that are still openly talking about it.
[00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:59.360]   But everyone's using PHP.
[00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:00.560]   If you look, most of the web
[00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:02.240]   is still probably PHP and jQuery.
[00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:02.960]   - I think 70%.
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:04.000]   It's because of WordPress, right?
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:04.720]   Because the blogs are...
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:05.120]   - Yeah, that's true.
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:05.360]   - Yeah.
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:06.400]   - That's true.
[00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:07.760]   - I'm seeing a revival now.
[00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:09.120]   People are getting sick of frameworks.
[00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:11.840]   Like all the JavaScript frameworks
[00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:13.920]   are so, what do you call it, wieldy.
[00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:16.720]   It takes so much work to just maintain this code.
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:19.280]   And then it updates to a new version.
[00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:20.320]   You need to change everything.
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:23.520]   PHP just stays the same and works.
[00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:23.920]   - Yeah.
[00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:24.240]   - And...
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:26.560]   - Can you actually just speak to that stack?
[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:30.320]   You build all your websites, apps, startups, projects,
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:33.040]   all of that with mostly vanilla HTML.
[00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:33.680]   - Yeah.
[00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:39.040]   - JavaScript with jQuery, PHP, and SQLite.
[00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:43.040]   And so that's a really simple stack.
[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:44.800]   And you get stuff done really fast with that.
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:46.720]   Can you just speak to the philosophy behind that?
[00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:48.080]   - I think it's accidental
[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:49.440]   'cause that's the thing I knew.
[00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:53.200]   Like I knew PHP, I knew HTML, CSS,
[00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:54.160]   'cause you make websites.
[00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:57.760]   And when my startup started taking off,
[00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:59.280]   I didn't have time to...
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:00.480]   I remember putting on my to-do list,
[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:01.840]   like learn Node.js,
[00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:03.680]   'cause it's important to switch, you know?
[00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:06.480]   'Cause this obviously is much better language than PHP.
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:07.360]   And I never learned it.
[00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:07.920]   I never did it.
[00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:09.280]   'Cause I didn't have time.
[00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:11.840]   These things were growing like this,
[00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:13.280]   and I was launching more projects,
[00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:14.240]   and I never had time.
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:17.920]   It's like one day, I'll start coding properly,
[00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:18.880]   and I never got to it.
[00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:22.000]   - I sometimes wonder if I need to learn that stuff.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.200]   It's still a to-do item for me
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:26.320]   to really learn Node.js, or Flask,
[00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:27.600]   or these kind of--
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:28.480]   - React, Vue.
[00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:29.520]   - Yeah, React.
[00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:35.360]   It feels like a responsible software engineer
[00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:37.840]   should know how to use these.
[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:42.480]   But you can get stuff done so fast
[00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:44.080]   with vanilla versions of stuff.
[00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:45.760]   - Yeah, it's like software developers,
[00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:46.560]   if you want to get a job,
[00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:50.080]   and there's people making stuff, like startups.
[00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:51.280]   And if you want to be an entrepreneur,
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:53.360]   probably, maybe you shouldn't.
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:54.400]   - I wonder if there's...
[00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:57.920]   I really want to measure performance and speed.
[00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:00.080]   I think there's a deep wisdom in that.
[00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:00.400]   - Yeah.
[00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:02.240]   - I do think that frameworks,
[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:05.120]   and just constantly wanting to learn the new thing,
[00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:07.840]   this complicated way of software engineering
[00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:08.720]   gets in the way.
[00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:09.920]   I'm not sure what to say about that,
[00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:12.320]   because definitely, you shouldn't build everything
[00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:14.480]   from just vanilla JavaScript,
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:16.000]   or vanilla C, for example.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:16.240]   - Yeah.
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:19.280]   - C++, when you're building systems engineering,
[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:21.120]   is like, there's a lot of benefits.
[00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:23.840]   For a pointer safety, all that kind of stuff.
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:26.160]   So I don't know, but it just feels like
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:29.920]   you can get so much more stuff done
[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:31.680]   if you don't care about how you do it.
[00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:34.960]   - Man, this is my most controversial take, I think.
[00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:36.960]   And maybe I'm wrong, but I feel like
[00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:40.000]   there's frameworks now that raise money.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.040]   They raise a lot of money.
[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:43.840]   Like they raise 50 million, 100 million, $3 million.
[00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:47.040]   And the idea is that you need to make the developers,
[00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:47.760]   the new developers,
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:49.600]   like when you're 18 or 20 years old, right?
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:52.720]   Get them to use this framework,
[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:54.720]   and add a platform to it,
[00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:56.640]   like where the framework can...
[00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:58.320]   It's open source,
[00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:00.480]   but you probably should use the platform,
[00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:02.240]   which is paid, to use it.
[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:05.440]   And the cost of the platforms to host it
[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:07.520]   are a thousand times higher
[00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:10.560]   than just hosting it on a simple AWS server
[00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:12.240]   or a VPS on DigitalOcean, right?
[00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:15.280]   So there's obviously like a monetary incentive here.
[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:16.880]   Like we wanna get a lot of developers
[00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:17.600]   to use this technology,
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:19.040]   and then we need to charge them money
[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:20.880]   'cause they're gonna use it in startups.
[00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:22.320]   And then the startups can pay for the bills.
[00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:24.960]   But what that...
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:29.600]   It kind of destroys the information out there
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:30.640]   about learning to code
[00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:32.640]   because they pay YouTubers,
[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:34.560]   they pay influencers,
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:35.520]   developer influencers,
[00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:36.800]   a big thing to like...
[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:38.240]   And same thing what happens
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:40.480]   with like nutrition and fitness or something.
[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:41.760]   Same thing happens in developing.
[00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:43.600]   They pay these influencers to promote the stuff,
[00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:45.520]   use it, make stuff with it,
[00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:46.560]   make demo products with it.
[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:47.440]   And then a lot of people are like,
[00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:48.960]   "Wow, use this."
[00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:50.080]   And I started noticing this
[00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:51.520]   'cause when I would ship my stuff,
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:53.280]   people would ask me, "What are you using?"
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:56.000]   I would say, "Oh, just PHP, jQuery, why does it matter?"
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.600]   And people would start kind of attacking me like,
[00:44:57.600 --> 00:44:59.440]   "Why are you not using this new technology?"
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:01.360]   "This new framework, this new thing."
[00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:03.520]   And I say, "I don't know 'cause this PHP thing works
[00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:04.640]   "and I don't really...
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:06.960]   "I'm optimizing for anything, it just works."
[00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:09.360]   And I never understood like why...
[00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:12.320]   I understand there's new technologies that are better
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:13.280]   and there should be improvement,
[00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:16.240]   but I'm very suspicious of money.
[00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:17.120]   Just like lobbying.
[00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:20.560]   There's money in this developer framework scene.
[00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:21.680]   There's hundreds of millions
[00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:24.960]   that goes to ads or influencers or whatever.
[00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:26.400]   It can't all go to developers.
[00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:28.000]   You don't need so many developers for a framework
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:28.880]   and it's open source.
[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:31.920]   To make a lot of more money on these startups.
[00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:33.200]   - So that's a really good perspective.
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:35.680]   But in addition to that is like when you say better,
[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:41.440]   it's like, can we get some data on the better?
[00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:43.120]   Because like I wanna know
[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:45.840]   from the individual developer perspective
[00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:47.760]   and then from a team of five, team of 10,
[00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:49.040]   team of 20 developers,
[00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:55.200]   measure how productive they are in shipping features,
[00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:57.040]   how many bugs they create,
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:59.040]   how many security holes.
[00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:02.160]   - PHP was not good at security for a while,
[00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:02.720]   but now it's good.
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:05.040]   - In theory, is it though?
[00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:05.840]   - Now it's good.
[00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:08.640]   - No, now as you're saying it,
[00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:11.280]   I wanna know if that's true
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:14.800]   because PHP was just the majority of websites
[00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:15.200]   on the internet.
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:15.760]   - Could be true.
[00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:17.920]   - Is it just overrepresented?
[00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:18.960]   Same with WordPress.
[00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:21.280]   Yes, there's a reputation that WordPress
[00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:23.280]   has a gigantic number of security holes.
[00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:25.120]   I don't know if that's true.
[00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:26.800]   I know it gets attacked a lot
[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:28.720]   because it's so popular.
[00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:30.480]   It definitely does have security holes,
[00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:32.160]   but maybe a lot of other systems
[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:33.440]   have security holes as well.
[00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:36.560]   Anyway, I just sort of question the conventional wisdom
[00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:39.280]   that keeps wanting to push software engineers
[00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:41.360]   towards frameworks, towards complex,
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:44.880]   like super complicated
[00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:46.480]   sort of software engineering approaches
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:48.960]   that stretch out the time it takes
[00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:50.000]   to actually build the thing.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.960]   - 100%, and it's the same thing with big corporations.
[00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:54.240]   80% of the people don't do anything.
[00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:55.920]   It's like, it's not efficient.
[00:46:55.920 --> 00:47:02.080]   And if your benchmark is like people building stuff
[00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:03.840]   that actually gets done,
[00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:04.960]   and like for society, right?
[00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:06.240]   Like if we wanna save time,
[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:07.440]   we should probably use technologies
[00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:11.440]   that's simple, that's pragmatic,
[00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:14.720]   that works, that's not overly complicated,
[00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:17.280]   doesn't make your life like a living hell.
[00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:19.520]   - And use a framework
[00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:21.280]   when it obviously solves a problem,
[00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:22.320]   a direct problem that you--
[00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:23.680]   - Of course, yeah, of course.
[00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:25.760]   I'm not saying you should code without a framework.
[00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:26.800]   You should use whatever you want,
[00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:30.080]   but yeah, I think it's suspicious, you know?
[00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:32.000]   And I think it's suspicious,
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:33.280]   when I talk about it on Twitter,
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:35.280]   like there's this army comes out, you know?
[00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:36.640]   There's these framework armies.
[00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:38.960]   Man, it's something my gut tells me.
[00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:41.280]   - I wanna ask the framework army
[00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:42.960]   what have they built this week?
[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:44.160]   It's the Elon question.
[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:45.040]   What did you do this week?
[00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:46.320]   - Yeah, and did you make money with it, you know?
[00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:47.440]   Did you charge users?
[00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:48.800]   Is it a real business?
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:50.640]   And yeah.
[00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:54.720]   - So going back to the cowboy, first of all--
[00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:55.840]   - Some don't look like you, right?
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:56.640]   But some do.
[00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:58.320]   - Every aspect of this is pretty incredible.
[00:47:58.320 --> 00:47:59.840]   I'm also just looking at the interface.
[00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:00.640]   It's really well done.
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:02.160]   So this is all just jQuery.
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:04.240]   And this is really well done.
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:07.120]   So take me through the journey of photo AI.
[00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:11.360]   Most of the world doesn't know much
[00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:13.920]   about stable diffusion or any of this,
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:15.440]   any of the generative AI stuff.
[00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:16.800]   And so you're thinking, okay,
[00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:18.880]   how can I build cool stuff with this?
[00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:21.280]   So what was the origin story of photo AI?
[00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:23.760]   - I think it started 'cause stable diffusion came out.
[00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:27.040]   So stable diffusion is the first generative image model,
[00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:27.600]   AI model.
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:29.840]   And I started playing with it.
[00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:31.200]   You could install it on your Mac.
[00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:33.840]   Somebody forked it and made it work for MacBooks.
[00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:36.320]   So I downloaded it and cloned the repo
[00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:37.840]   and started using it to generate images.
[00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:41.680]   And it was amazing.
[00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:43.840]   I found it on Twitter
[00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:45.440]   because you see things happen on Twitter
[00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:48.320]   and I would post what I was making on Twitter as well.
[00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:50.320]   And you could make any image.
[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:51.520]   You could write a prompt.
[00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:52.720]   So essentially you write a prompt
[00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:54.720]   and then it generates a photo of that
[00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:57.040]   or image of that in any style.
[00:48:57.040 --> 00:48:58.800]   Like they would use like artist names
[00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:00.720]   to make like a Picasso kind of style and stuff.
[00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:06.240]   And I was trying to see, like, what is it good at?
[00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:06.960]   Is it good at people?
[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:08.080]   No, it's really bad at people,
[00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:10.080]   but it was good at houses.
[00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:11.120]   So architecture, for example,
[00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:13.280]   I would generate like architecture houses.
[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:18.480]   So I made a website called thishousedoesnotexist.org
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:20.080]   and it generated like,
[00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:21.920]   they called like house porn in that one.
[00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:24.160]   Like house porn is like a subreddit.
[00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:26.320]   So, and this was Stable Fusion, like the first version.
[00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:28.560]   So it looks really, you can click for another photo.
[00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:33.840]   So it generates like all these kind of non-existing houses.
[00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:34.720]   - It is house porn.
[00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:36.080]   - But it looked kind of good, you know?
[00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:37.280]   Like, especially back then.
[00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:38.080]   - It looks really good.
[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:39.200]   - Now things look much better.
[00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:43.920]   - It's really, really well done.
[00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:46.480]   Wow.
[00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:48.080]   - And it also generates like a description.
[00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:51.280]   - And you can upvote.
[00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:52.000]   Is it nice?
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:52.800]   Upvote it.
[00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:54.320]   Man, there's so much to talk to you about.
[00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:56.920]   Like the choices here, it's really well done.
[00:49:56.920 --> 00:49:57.920]   - This is very scrappy.
[00:49:57.920 --> 00:49:59.120]   In the bottom, there's like a ranking
[00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:01.040]   of the most upvoted houses.
[00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:02.240]   So these are the top voted.
[00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:04.320]   If you go to old time, you see quite beautiful ones.
[00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:06.880]   Yeah, so this one is my favorite.
[00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:08.240]   The number one, it's like kind of like a...
[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:11.440]   - How is this not more popular?
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:13.840]   - It was really popular for like a while,
[00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:16.000]   but then people got so bored of it.
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.160]   I think 'cause I was getting bored of it too.
[00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:20.640]   Like just continuous house porn,
[00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:22.400]   like everything starts looking the same.
[00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:24.800]   But then I saw it was really good at interior.
[00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:27.920]   So I pivoted to interiorai.com
[00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:31.360]   where I tried to like upload
[00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:32.720]   first generated interior designs.
[00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:34.000]   And then I tried to do,
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.400]   like there was a new technology called image to image
[00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:38.800]   where you can input an image, like a photo
[00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:40.800]   and it would kind of modify the thing.
[00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:43.360]   So you see, it looks almost the same as photo.
[00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:45.200]   It has the same code essentially.
[00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:47.520]   - Nice.
[00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:50.080]   - So I would upload a photo of my interior where I lived
[00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:52.160]   and I would ask like, change this into like,
[00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:56.800]   I don't know, like maximalist design, you know?
[00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:58.960]   And it worked and it worked really well.
[00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:00.800]   So I was like, okay, this is a startup
[00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:02.640]   'cause obviously interior design, AI
[00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:03.600]   and nobody's doing that yet.
[00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:05.920]   So I launched this and it was successful
[00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:09.040]   and made like, within a week made 10K, 20K a month.
[00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:12.000]   And now it still makes like 40K, 50K a month.
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.400]   And it's been like two years.
[00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:15.600]   So then I was like,
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:17.040]   how can I improve this interior design?
[00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:18.400]   I need to start learning fine tuning.
[00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:21.120]   And fine tuning is where you have this existing AI model
[00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:23.600]   and you fine tune it on a specific goal you want it to do.
[00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:26.480]   So I would find really beautiful interior design,
[00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:30.000]   make a gallery and train a new model
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:31.280]   that was very good interior design.
[00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:32.720]   And it worked and I used that as well.
[00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:35.920]   And then for fun, I uploaded photos of myself
[00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:38.080]   and here's what happened.
[00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:41.760]   And to train myself, like, and this would never work
[00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:42.720]   obviously, and it worked.
[00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:46.320]   And actually it started understanding me as a concept.
[00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:49.520]   So my face worked and you could do like different styles
[00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:53.520]   like me as a, like very cheesy medieval warrior, all this stuff.
[00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:55.520]   So I was like, this is another startup.
[00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:58.320]   So now I did avatar.ai.me.
[00:51:58.320 --> 00:51:59.840]   I couldn't get to .com.
[00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:04.160]   And this was, yeah, avatar.ai.me.
[00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:06.320]   Well, now it's forwards to photo because it pivoted.
[00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:07.040]   Got it.
[00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:09.920]   But this was more like cheesy thing.
[00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:12.320]   So this is very interesting because this went so viral.
[00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:16.160]   It made like, I think like 150K in a week or something.
[00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:17.200]   So most money ever made.
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:20.960]   And then big, this is very interesting.
[00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:22.880]   The big VC companies like Lenza,
[00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:26.000]   which are much better at iOS and stuff than me.
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:27.360]   I didn't have iOS app.
[00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:29.360]   They quickly built an iOS app that does the same
[00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:31.600]   and they found technology and it's all open technology.
[00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:32.480]   So it's good.
[00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:35.280]   And I think they made like $30 million with it.
[00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:35.760]   Yeah.
[00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:38.960]   They became like the top grossing app after that.
[00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:40.640]   And it was-
[00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:41.840]   How do you feel about that?
[00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:43.200]   I think it's amazing, honestly.
[00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:44.000]   And it's not like-
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:45.840]   You didn't have like a feeling like, oh, fuck.
[00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:48.000]   No, I was a little bit like sad
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.080]   because all my products would work out
[00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:52.160]   and I never had like real fierce competition.
[00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:53.360]   And now I have like fierce competition
[00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:56.720]   from like a very skilled, high talent,
[00:52:56.720 --> 00:52:59.040]   like iOS developer studio or something that...
[00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:00.640]   And they already had an app.
[00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:02.640]   They had an app in App Store for like,
[00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:04.000]   I think retouching your face or something.
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:04.800]   So they were very smart.
[00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:06.160]   They add these avatars to there.
[00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:07.040]   It's a feature.
[00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:07.840]   They had the users.
[00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:09.280]   They do a push notification to everybody.
[00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:10.320]   We have this avatars.
[00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:10.800]   Yeah.
[00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:11.760]   Man, they made great.
[00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:13.840]   I think they made so much money.
[00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:16.720]   And I think they did a really great job.
[00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:19.120]   And I also made a lot of money with it,
[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:22.160]   but I quickly realized it wasn't my thing
[00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:23.040]   because it was so cheesy.
[00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:24.320]   It was like kitsch, you know?
[00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:28.240]   It's kind of like me as a Barbie or me as a...
[00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:29.280]   You know, it was too cheesy.
[00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:30.240]   I wanted to go for like,
[00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:31.680]   what's a real problem we can solve?
[00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:32.800]   Because this is going to be a hype.
[00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:33.360]   This is going to be...
[00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:34.800]   And it was a hype, these avatars.
[00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:38.800]   It's like, let's do real photography.
[00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:41.360]   Like how can you make people look really photorealistic?
[00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:42.000]   And it was difficult.
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:43.120]   And that's why these avatars worked
[00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:44.800]   because they were all like in a cheesy,
[00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:45.920]   you know, Picasso style.
[00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:48.400]   And art is easy because you interpret the...
[00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:52.000]   All the problems that AI has with your face
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:53.040]   are like artistic, you know?
[00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:54.480]   If you call it Picasso.
[00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:55.600]   But if you make a real photo,
[00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:56.400]   all the problems with your face,
[00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:58.160]   like it just, you look wrong, you know?
[00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:00.960]   So I started making photo AI,
[00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:02.480]   which was like a pivot of it,
[00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:03.760]   where it was like a photo studio
[00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:07.520]   where you could take photos
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:09.680]   without actually needing a photographer,
[00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:10.320]   needing a studio.
[00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:11.920]   You don't just, you know, you just type it.
[00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:14.640]   And I've been working on it for like the last...
[00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:15.600]   Yeah, it's really incredible.
[00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:17.200]   That journey is really incredible.
[00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:20.080]   Let's go to the beginning of photo AI though,
[00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:21.360]   'cause I remember seeing a lot of
[00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:24.800]   really hilarious photos.
[00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:26.960]   I think you were using yourself as a case study, right?
[00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:27.460]   Yeah.
[00:54:27.460 --> 00:54:30.640]   Yeah, so there's a tweet here,
[00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:36.320]   "Sold $100,000 in AI-generated avatars."
[00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:37.040]   Yeah, and it's a lot.
[00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:38.080]   Like it's a lot for anybody.
[00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:38.720]   It's a lot for me.
[00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:41.840]   Like making 10K a day on this, you know?
[00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:43.680]   That's amazing.
[00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:45.840]   That's amazing.
[00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:49.120]   And then the nested tweet, like that's a launch tweet.
[00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:52.400]   And then before that, it's like me hacking on it.
[00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:54.240]   Oh, I see.
[00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:55.460]   So that...
[00:54:55.460 --> 00:54:59.760]   Okay, so October 26th, 2022.
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:00.160]   Yeah.
[00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:02.640]   I train an ML model on my face.
[00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:06.640]   Because my eyes are quite far apart,
[00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:08.080]   I learned when I did YouTube,
[00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:10.480]   I would put like a photo of like my DJ photo, you know?
[00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:11.760]   My make sure...
[00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:14.240]   People would say I look like a hammerhead shark.
[00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:15.200]   It was like the top comment.
[00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:16.800]   So then I realized my eyes are far apart.
[00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:20.160]   Yeah, the internet helps you figure out what you look like.
[00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:21.840]   Yeah, helps you realize how you look, you know?
[00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:23.360]   Boy, do I love the internet.
[00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:24.000]   So first trap.
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:27.040]   Well, what is this?
[00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:27.680]   Wait.
[00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:29.520]   It's water from the waterfall.
[00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:31.120]   But the waterfall's in the back, you know?
[00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:31.920]   So what's going on?
[00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:34.240]   So this is...
[00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:35.680]   How much of this is real?
[00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:36.800]   It's all AI.
[00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:38.080]   It's all AI.
[00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:38.580]   Yeah.
[00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:40.720]   That's pretty good though for the early days.
[00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:41.280]   Exactly.
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:42.080]   But this was hit or miss.
[00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:43.760]   So you had to do a lot of curation
[00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:45.360]   because 99% of it was really bad.
[00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:47.600]   So these are the photos I uploaded.
[00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:49.040]   How many photos did you use?
[00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:49.840]   Only these.
[00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:52.960]   I will try more up to date pics later.
[00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:55.360]   These are the only photos you uploaded?
[00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:55.920]   Yeah.
[00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:56.420]   Wow.
[00:55:56.420 --> 00:55:59.360]   Wow.
[00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:01.840]   Okay, so like you were learning all this super quickly.
[00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:04.320]   What are some like interesting details
[00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:05.360]   you remember from that time
[00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:07.760]   for like what you had to figure out to make it work?
[00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:09.200]   And for people just listening,
[00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:12.240]   he uploaded just a handful of photos
[00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:14.640]   that don't really have a good capture of the face.
[00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:16.240]   And he's able to...
[00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:17.040]   I think it's cropped.
[00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:18.800]   It's like a crop, but the layout.
[00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:20.400]   But they're square photos.
[00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:21.680]   So they're 512 by 512.
[00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:23.360]   Because that's stability fusion.
[00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:26.960]   But nevertheless, not great capture of the face.
[00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:32.800]   It's not like a collection of several hundred photos
[00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:34.240]   that are like 360.
[00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:35.120]   Exactly.
[00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:35.920]   I would imagine that too.
[00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:36.640]   When I started, I was like,
[00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:39.040]   "Oh, this must be like some 3D scan technology, right?"
[00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:40.880]   So I think the cool thing with AI,
[00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:42.240]   it trains the concept of you.
[00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:44.560]   So it's literally like learning,
[00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:45.920]   just like any AI model learns,
[00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:46.880]   it learns how you look.
[00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:49.920]   So I did this and then I was getting so many...
[00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:52.960]   I was getting DMs, like telegram messages,
[00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:54.000]   like how can I do the same thing?
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:55.200]   I want these photos.
[00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:56.560]   My girlfriend wants these photos.
[00:56:56.560 --> 00:56:58.320]   So I was like, "Okay, this is obviously a business."
[00:56:58.320 --> 00:57:00.800]   But I didn't have time to code it,
[00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:02.960]   make a whole like app about it.
[00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:05.200]   So I made an HTML page.
[00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:06.640]   Registered a domain name.
[00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:08.800]   And this was not even...
[00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:09.920]   It was a Stripe payment link,
[00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:13.440]   which means you have literally a link to Stripe to pay,
[00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:15.120]   but there's no code in the back.
[00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:17.280]   So all you know is you have customers that paid money.
[00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:21.280]   Then I added like a type form link.
[00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:23.040]   So type form is a site where you can create
[00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:25.920]   like your own input form, like Google Forms.
[00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:29.360]   So they would get an email with a link to the type form,
[00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:31.040]   or actually just a link after the checkout.
[00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:32.560]   And they could upload their photos.
[00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:35.040]   So enter their email, upload the photos,
[00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:37.280]   and then I launched it.
[00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:38.640]   And I was like, "Here, first sale."
[00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:40.000]   So this is October, 2022.
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:44.400]   And I think within like the first 24 hours was like,
[00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:46.400]   I'm not sure, it was like a thousand customers or something.
[00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:50.320]   But the problem was I didn't have code to automate this.
[00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:51.600]   So I had to do manually.
[00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:52.800]   So the first few hundred,
[00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:56.400]   I just literally took their photos, trained them.
[00:57:56.400 --> 00:57:58.480]   And then I would generate the photos with the prompts
[00:57:58.480 --> 00:57:59.760]   and I had this text file with the prompts
[00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:01.280]   and I would do everything manually.
[00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:03.760]   And this quickly became way too much.
[00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:05.760]   So, but that's another constraint.
[00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:10.080]   Like I was forced to code something up that would do that.
[00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:11.680]   And that was essentially making it
[00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:12.720]   into a real website, right?
[00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:13.920]   - So at first it was the type form
[00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:15.280]   and they uploaded through the type form.
[00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:16.800]   - Stripe checkout type form, yeah.
[00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:19.200]   - And then you were like, that image is downloaded.
[00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:20.640]   Did you write a script to export?
[00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:22.480]   - No, I just downloaded the images myself.
[00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:24.240]   It was a zip file, unzipped the zip file.
[00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:25.120]   - And you unzipped it?
[00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:26.080]   - Yeah, unzipped it.
[00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:28.000]   Yes, and then, no, because, you know,
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:30.240]   do things, don't scale, Paul Graham says, right?
[00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:33.120]   So, and then I would trade and then I would email them
[00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:35.520]   the photos, I think from my personal email.
[00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:38.000]   So here's your avatars, you know, and they liked it.
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:39.040]   They were like, wow, it's amazing.
[00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:42.400]   - You emailed them with your personal email.
[00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:44.880]   - 'Cause I didn't have an email address on this domain.
[00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:46.880]   - And this was like a hundred people.
[00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:48.640]   - Yeah, and then you know who signed up?
[00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:52.480]   Like, man, I cannot say, but really famous people.
[00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:54.160]   Like really, really like billionaires.
[00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:55.520]   Famous tech billionaires did it.
[00:58:55.520 --> 00:58:56.960]   And I was like, wow, this is crazy.
[00:58:56.960 --> 00:58:59.120]   And I sent, I was like so scared to mess them.
[00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:02.320]   So I said, thanks so much for using my sites.
[00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:04.320]   You know, he's like, yeah, amazing app, great work.
[00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:07.040]   So it's like, this is different than normal reaction, you know?
[00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:08.480]   - It's Bill Gates, isn't it?
[00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:10.720]   - I cannot say anything.
[00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:13.760]   - Just like shirtless pics.
[00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:16.480]   - GDPR, you know, like privacy, European regulation.
[00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:19.280]   I cannot share anything, but I was very, I was like, wow.
[00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:22.880]   And, but this shows like, so you make something
[00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:24.800]   and then if it takes off very fast, you're like,
[00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:25.920]   it's validated, you know, you're like,
[00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:28.160]   here's something that people really want.
[00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:30.320]   But then also I thought this is hype.
[00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:31.840]   This is gonna die down very fast.
[00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:33.600]   And it did, 'cause it's too cheesy.
[00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:35.920]   - But you had to automate the whole thing.
[00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:37.120]   How'd you automate it?
[00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:38.800]   So like, what's the AI component?
[00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:40.480]   Like how hard was that to figure out?
[00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:44.000]   - Okay, so that's actually in many ways, the easiest thing.
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:45.760]   'Cause there is all these platforms already back then.
[00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:49.040]   There was platforms for fine tune, still diffusion.
[00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:51.600]   Like now I use replicates.
[00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:54.880]   Back then I use different platforms, which was funny.
[00:59:54.880 --> 00:59:56.720]   'Cause that platform, when this thing took off,
[00:59:56.720 --> 00:59:58.320]   I would tweet, 'cause I tweet always
[00:59:58.320 --> 01:00:00.000]   like how much money these websites make.
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.720]   And then sort of the, you call it vendor, right?
[01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:05.040]   The platform that did the GPUs.
[01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:07.840]   They increased the price for training from $3 to $20
[01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:10.880]   after they saw that I was making so much money.
[01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:12.160]   So immediately my profit is gone
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:13.280]   'cause I was selling them for $30.
[01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:16.480]   And I was in a slack with them, like saying, what is this?
[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:18.880]   Like, can you just put it back to $3?
[01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:20.240]   They say, yeah, maybe in the future.
[01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:21.040]   We're looking at it right now.
[01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:22.000]   I'm like, what are you talking about?
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.760]   Like, you just took all my money, you know?
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:24.320]   And they're smart.
[01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:25.520]   - Well, they're not that smart
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:29.520]   because like you're also have a large platform
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:31.280]   and a lot of people respect you.
[01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:32.800]   So you can literally come out and say that.
[01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:34.640]   - Yeah, but I think it's like kind of dirty
[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:36.400]   to cancel a company or something.
[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:38.640]   I prefer just bringing my business elsewhere.
[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:40.240]   But there was no elsewhere back then.
[01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:45.760]   So I started talking to other AI model, ML platforms.
[01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:47.040]   So Replicate was on those platforms.
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:50.560]   And I started DMing the CEO, say, can you please create,
[01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:53.600]   like, it's called Dream Booth, this fine tuning of yourself.
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:54.720]   Can you add this to your site?
[01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:57.040]   'Cause I need this 'cause I'm being price gouged.
[01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:59.680]   And he said, no, because it takes too long to run.
[01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:00.640]   It takes half an hour to run
[01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:01.920]   and we don't have the GPUs for it.
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:02.960]   I said, please, please, please.
[01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:05.200]   And then after a week, they said, we're doing it.
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:06.160]   We're launching this.
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:09.040]   And then this company became,
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:10.400]   it was like not very famous company.
[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:12.000]   It became very famous with this stuff
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.920]   because suddenly everybody was like,
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:16.560]   oh, we can build similar apps, like avatar apps.
[01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:18.000]   And everybody started building avatar apps
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.520]   and everybody started using Replicate for it.
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:22.800]   And it was from these early DMs with like the CEO,
[01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:24.160]   like Ben Fursh, very nice guy.
[01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:27.680]   And he was like, they never price gouged me.
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:28.560]   They never treated me bad.
[01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:29.600]   They always been very nice.
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:31.600]   It's a very cool company.
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:33.040]   So you can run any ML model,
[01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:35.680]   any AI model, LLMs, you can run on here.
[01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:36.800]   - And you can scale.
[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:38.960]   - Yes, they scale, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:40.080]   And I mean, you can do now.
[01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:42.000]   You can click on the model and just run it already.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.120]   It's like super easy.
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:44.160]   You log in with GitHub.
[01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:45.680]   - That's great.
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:47.120]   - And by running it on the website,
[01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:48.560]   then you can automate with the API.
[01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:50.160]   You can make a website that runs the model.
[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:52.480]   - Generate images, generate text, generate video,
[01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:53.920]   generate music, generate speech.
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:55.360]   - I know, like-- - Find two models.
[01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:56.720]   - They do anything, yeah.
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:57.680]   It's a very cool company.
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:01:58.800]   - Nice.
[01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:00.960]   And you're like growing with them essentially.
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:02.080]   They grew because of you,
[01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:03.520]   because it's like a big use case.
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:06.720]   - Yeah, like the website even looks weird now.
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:09.280]   It started as like a machine learning platform.
[01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:11.280]   That was like, I didn't even understand what it did.
[01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:14.080]   It was just too ML, you know?
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:15.760]   Like you would understand because you're in the ML world.
[01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:17.360]   I wouldn't understand. - Now it's noob friendly.
[01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:18.240]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:20.000]   And I didn't know how it worked.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.960]   But I knew that they could probably do this.
[01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:23.440]   And they did it.
[01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:25.920]   They built the models and now I use them for everything.
[01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:30.640]   And we trained like, I think now like 36,000 models,
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:31.920]   36,000 people already.
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:34.080]   - But is there some tricks to fine tuning
[01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:36.480]   to like the collection of photos that are provided?
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:37.840]   Like how do you like-- - Yes.
[01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:39.120]   Yes, man, there's so many hacks.
[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:40.800]   - The hacks, yeah. - It's like 100 hacks
[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:41.440]   to make it work.
[01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:44.320]   - What's, what is some-- - Give my secrets now.
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:48.080]   - Well, not the secrets, but the more like insights maybe
[01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:49.680]   about the human face and the human body.
[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:52.240]   Like what kind of stuff gets messed up a lot?
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:54.720]   - I think people, well, man, it's a little thing.
[01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:56.080]   People don't know how they look.
[01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:59.200]   So they generate photos of themselves
[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:00.880]   and then they say, "Ah, it doesn't look like me."
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:04.160]   - Yeah. - But then, you know,
[01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:05.040]   you can check the training for us.
[01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:07.200]   It does look like you, but you don't know how you look.
[01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:10.640]   So there's a face dysmorphia of yourself
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:12.160]   that you have no idea how you look.
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:13.040]   - Yeah, that's hilarious.
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:15.520]   I mean, I've got to, one of the least pleasant activities
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:18.480]   in my existence is having to listen to my voice
[01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:19.680]   and look at my face.
[01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:25.760]   And so I get to like really, really have to sort of come
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:29.120]   in to terms with the reality of how I look and how I sound.
[01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:31.920]   - And everybody, and-- - People often don't, right?
[01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:33.120]   - Really? - Like you have
[01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:35.120]   a distorted view, perspective.
[01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:38.560]   - I know that like, I would, if I would make a selfie,
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:40.560]   how I think I look, that's nice.
[01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:42.240]   Other people think that's not nice.
[01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:43.280]   But then they make a photo of me.
[01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:44.240]   I'm like, "That's super ugly."
[01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:45.440]   But then they're like, "No, that's how you look
[01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:46.320]   and you look nice."
[01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:49.520]   You know, so how other people see you is nice.
[01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:52.960]   So you need to ask other people to choose your photos.
[01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:53.440]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:54.640]   - You shouldn't choose them yourself
[01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:55.600]   because you don't know how you look.
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:57.920]   - Yeah, you don't know what makes you interesting,
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:03:59.760]   what makes you attractive, all this kind of stuff.
[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:02.800]   And a lot of us, this is a dark aspect of psychology.
[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:04.960]   We focus on some small flaws.
[01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:05.600]   - Yeah.
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:08.480]   - This is why I hate plastic surgery, for example.
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:10.480]   People try to remove the flaws when the flaws
[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:12.320]   are the thing that makes you interesting and attractive.
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:14.080]   - I learned from the hammerhead shark eyes,
[01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:16.960]   this stuff about you that looks ugly to you.
[01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:19.520]   And it's probably that what makes you original
[01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:21.040]   makes you nice and people like it about you.
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:21.280]   - Yeah.
[01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:22.560]   - And it's not like, "Oh my God."
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:24.080]   And people notice it.
[01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:26.640]   People notice your hammerhead eyes, you know.
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:28.080]   But it's like, that's me, that's my face.
[01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:29.440]   So I love myself.
[01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:31.040]   And that's confidence and confidence is attractive.
[01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:31.520]   - Yes.
[01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:32.160]   - Right?
[01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:33.760]   - Confidence is attractive.
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:36.080]   But yes, understanding what makes you beautiful.
[01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:38.240]   It's the breaking of symmetry makes you beautiful.
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:42.000]   It's the breaking of the average face makes you beautiful.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:42.480]   All of that.
[01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:42.960]   - Yeah.
[01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:45.360]   - And obviously different for men and women
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:46.800]   of different ages, all this kind of stuff.
[01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:47.200]   - Yeah, 100%.
[01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:49.760]   - But underneath it all, the personality,
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:54.080]   all of that, when the face comes alive,
[01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:55.840]   that also is the thing that makes you beautiful.
[01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:56.160]   - Yeah.
[01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:58.240]   - But anyway, you have to figure all that out with AI.
[01:04:58.240 --> 01:04:58.960]   - Yeah.
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:00.000]   One thing that worked was like,
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.520]   people would upload full body photos of themselves.
[01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:05.600]   So I would crop the face, right?
[01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:06.880]   'Cause then the model knew better
[01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:09.040]   that we're training mostly the face here.
[01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:11.440]   But then I started losing a resemblance of the body
[01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:12.880]   'cause some people are skinny,
[01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:14.000]   some people are muscular, whatever.
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.120]   So you want to have that too.
[01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:17.760]   So now I mix full body photos in the training
[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:19.520]   with face photos, face crops.
[01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:21.040]   And it's all automatic.
[01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:23.360]   And I know that other people,
[01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:26.320]   they use, again, AI models to detect
[01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:28.480]   what are the best photos in this training set
[01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:29.760]   and then train on those.
[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:31.600]   But it's all about training data
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:33.040]   and it's with everything in AI.
[01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:35.120]   How good your training data is,
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:37.040]   is in many ways more important
[01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:39.120]   than how many steps you train for,
[01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:41.120]   how many months or whatever with the GPUs,
[01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:43.280]   the goals.
[01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:44.800]   - Do you have any guidelines for people
[01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:46.480]   of like how to get good data,
[01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:48.080]   how to give good data to fine tune on?
[01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:49.840]   - Like the photos should be diverse.
[01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:51.360]   So for example,
[01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:54.640]   if I only upload photos with a brown shirt or green shirt,
[01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:57.520]   the model will think that I'm training the green shirt.
[01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:00.320]   So the things that are the same,
[01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:03.120]   every photo are the concepts that are trained.
[01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:06.320]   What you want is your face to be the concept of strength
[01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:09.680]   and everything else to be diverse, like different.
[01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:11.760]   - So diverse lighting as well, diverse everything.
[01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:12.960]   - Yeah, outside, inside.
[01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:15.280]   But there's no like, this is the problem.
[01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:16.880]   There's no like manual for this.
[01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:19.040]   And nobody knew, we were all just,
[01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:20.480]   especially two years ago, we were all hacking,
[01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:23.520]   trying to test anything, anything you can think of.
[01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:26.240]   And it's frustrating.
[01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:27.360]   It's one of the most frustrating
[01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:30.240]   and also fun and challenging things to do because with AI,
[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:32.560]   'cause it's a black box.
[01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:34.480]   And like Karpati, I think says this,
[01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:37.120]   like we didn't really know how this thing works,
[01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:39.120]   but it does something,
[01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:40.960]   but nobody really knows why, right?
[01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:44.160]   Like we cannot look into the model of an LLM,
[01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:45.280]   like what is actually in there?
[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:48.000]   We just know it's like a 3D matrix of numbers, right?
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:53.360]   So it's very frustrating 'cause some things you,
[01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:54.960]   there would be, you think they're obvious
[01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:57.760]   that they will improve things, will make them worse.
[01:06:57.760 --> 01:06:59.680]   And there's so many parameters you can tweak.
[01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:03.280]   So you're testing everything to improve things.
[01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:05.200]   - I mean, there's a whole field now
[01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:08.320]   of mechanistic interpretability that like studies that,
[01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:10.640]   tries to figure out, tries to break things apart.
[01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:11.600]   And understand how it works.
[01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:14.800]   But there's also the data side
[01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:18.800]   and the actual like consumer facing product side
[01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:20.800]   of figuring out how you get it to generate a thing
[01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:23.440]   that's beautiful or interesting or naturalistic,
[01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:24.480]   all that kind of stuff.
[01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:26.880]   And you're like at the forefront of figuring that out
[01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:28.000]   about the human face.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.320]   And humans really care about the human face.
[01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:31.360]   - They're very vain.
[01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:34.320]   Like me, like I wanna look good in your podcast,
[01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:35.600]   for example, yeah, for sure.
[01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:38.320]   - And then one of the things I actually would love
[01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:42.000]   to like rigorously use photo AI,
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.760]   because for the thumbnails, I take portraits of people.
[01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:47.520]   I didn't, I don't know shit about photography.
[01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:50.400]   I basically used your approach for photography.
[01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:53.360]   I like Google, how do you take photographs?
[01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:53.860]   - Yeah.
[01:07:53.860 --> 01:07:56.800]   - Camera, lighting.
[01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:58.480]   And also it's tough because,
[01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:00.720]   maybe you could speak to this also,
[01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:04.160]   but like with photography, no offense to any,
[01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:07.440]   they're true artists, great photographers.
[01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:10.800]   But like people like take themselves way too seriously,
[01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:13.840]   think you need a whole lot of equipment.
[01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:15.760]   You definitely don't want one light.
[01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:17.360]   You need like five lights.
[01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:18.480]   - I know this.
[01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:22.640]   - And like, and you have to have like the lenses.
[01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:25.520]   And I talked to a guy, an expert
[01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:30.720]   of shaping the sound in a room, okay?
[01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:33.840]   'Cause I was thinking, I'm gonna do a podcast studio,
[01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:37.280]   whatever, I should probably like treat the,
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:40.160]   do a sound treatment on the room.
[01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:43.280]   And like, when he showed up and analyzed the room,
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:45.200]   he thought everything I was doing was horrible.
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:48.560]   And that's when I realized like, you know what?
[01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:49.840]   I don't need experts in my life.
[01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:51.440]   - Did he kick you out of the house?
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:52.880]   - No, I didn't kick him.
[01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:53.840]   I mean, I said, thank you.
[01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:54.400]   Thank you very much.
[01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:55.120]   - Thank you, great tips.
[01:08:55.120 --> 01:09:00.320]   - I just felt like there is, you know,
[01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:02.080]   focus on whatever the problems are,
[01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:04.480]   use your own judgment, use your own instincts.
[01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:06.000]   Don't listen to other people
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.440]   and only consult other people
[01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:08.880]   when there's a specific problem.
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:12.160]   And you consult them, not to offload the problem onto them,
[01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:14.320]   but to gain wisdom from their perspective.
[01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:16.480]   Even if their perspective is ultimately
[01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:17.600]   one you don't agree with,
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:19.280]   you're gonna gain wisdom from that.
[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:23.120]   And just, I ultimately come up with like a PHP solution,
[01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:25.200]   PHP and jQuery solution.
[01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:26.160]   (laughing)
[01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:27.120]   The PHP studio.
[01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:28.480]   I have a little suitcase.
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:34.640]   I use like just the basic sort of consumer type of stuff.
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:36.320]   One light, it's great.
[01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:37.440]   - Yeah, and look at you.
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:39.120]   You're like one of the top podcasts in the world
[01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:41.280]   and you get millions of views and it works.
[01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:42.880]   And the people that spend so much money
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:45.760]   on optimizing for the best sound, for the best studio,
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:47.440]   they get like 300 views, you know?
[01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:48.320]   So what is this about?
[01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:51.120]   This is about that either you do really well
[01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:53.040]   or also that a lot of these things don't matter.
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:56.000]   Like what matters is probably the content of the podcast.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.200]   Like you get interesting guests.
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:09:58.560]   - Focus on the stuff that matters.
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:00.480]   - Yeah, and I think this is very common.
[01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:03.200]   They call it gear acquisition syndrome, like gas.
[01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:05.440]   Like people in any industry do this.
[01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:06.560]   They just buy all the stuff.
[01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:07.440]   There was a meme recently.
[01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:10.000]   Like what's the name for the guy that buys all the stuff
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.840]   before he even started doing the hobby, right?
[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:13.840]   Marketing, you know?
[01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:14.960]   Marketing does that to people.
[01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:15.840]   They wanna buy this stuff.
[01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:16.320]   - Yeah.
[01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:22.080]   - But like, man, you can make a Hollywood movie on an iPhone,
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:24.160]   you know, if the content is good enough.
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:26.640]   And it will probably be original
[01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:29.120]   because you would be using an iPhone for it, you know?
[01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:32.160]   - That said, so the reason I brought that up
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:36.080]   with photography, there is wisdom from people.
[01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:38.320]   And one of the things I realized,
[01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:40.640]   you probably also realized this,
[01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:46.400]   but how much power light has to convey emotion.
[01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:49.600]   Take one light and move it around.
[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:51.600]   You're sitting in the darkness, move it around your face.
[01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:53.520]   The different positions
[01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:55.440]   are having a second light potentially.
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:57.200]   You can play with how a person feels
[01:10:57.200 --> 01:10:59.120]   just from a generic face.
[01:10:59.120 --> 01:10:59.760]   It's interesting.
[01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:01.360]   Like you can make people attractive.
[01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:02.320]   You can make them ugly.
[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:03.360]   You can make them scary.
[01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:06.080]   You can make them lonely, all of this.
[01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:09.040]   And so you kind of start to realize this.
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:12.160]   And I would definitely love AI help
[01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:15.680]   in creating great portraits of people.
[01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:16.960]   - Guest photos, yeah.
[01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:17.760]   - Guest photos.
[01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:19.680]   For example, that's a small use case.
[01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:24.880]   But for me, I suppose it's an important use case
[01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:26.560]   because I want people to look good,
[01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:29.680]   but I also wanna capture who they are,
[01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:32.320]   maybe my conception of who they are,
[01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:33.920]   what makes them beautiful,
[01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:36.480]   what makes their appearance powerful in some ways.
[01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:37.520]   Sometimes it's the eyes.
[01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:39.040]   Oftentimes it's the eyes,
[01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:40.480]   but there's certain features of the face
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:41.840]   can sometimes be really powerful.
[01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:44.960]   And I can't, it's also kind of awkward for me
[01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:46.960]   to take photographs.
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:50.800]   So I'm not collecting enough photographs for myself
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:53.920]   to do it with just those photographs.
[01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:56.320]   If I can load that off onto AI
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:59.040]   and then start to play with lighting--
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:11:59.760]   - You should do this.
[01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:01.040]   And you should probably do it yourself.
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:01.920]   Like you can use photo,
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:03.920]   but it's even more fun if you do it yourself.
[01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:05.600]   So you train the models.
[01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:07.120]   You can learn about like control net.
[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:08.560]   Control net is where, for example,
[01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:09.600]   your photos in your podcast
[01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:11.440]   are usually like from the angle, right?
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:14.320]   So you can create a control net face pose
[01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:15.440]   that's always like this.
[01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:17.440]   So every model, every photo you generate
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:20.400]   uses this control net pose, for example.
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:22.240]   I think it would be very fun for you to try out.
[01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:23.920]   - Do you play with lighting at all?
[01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:25.680]   Do you play with lighting pose with the--
[01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:27.920]   - Man, actually like this week or recently,
[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:29.040]   there's a new model came out
[01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:32.240]   that can adjust the light of any photo,
[01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:34.640]   but also AI image with stable diffusion.
[01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:36.320]   I think it's called Relight.
[01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:39.040]   And it's amazing.
[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:43.600]   Like you can upload kind of like a light map.
[01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:46.000]   So for example, red, purple, blue,
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.720]   and use that light map to change the light
[01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:50.160]   on the photo you input.
[01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:50.720]   It's amazing.
[01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:53.040]   So there's for sure a lot of stuff you can do.
[01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:56.160]   - What's your advice for people in general
[01:12:56.160 --> 01:13:00.400]   on how to learn all the state-of-the-art AI tools available?
[01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:02.400]   Like you mentioned the new models coming out all the time.
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:02.960]   - Yeah.
[01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:05.200]   - Like how do you pay attention?
[01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:07.920]   How do you stay on top of everything?
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:10.000]   - I think you need to join Twitter, X.
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.600]   You know, X is amazing now.
[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:13.600]   And the whole AI industry is on X.
[01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:16.080]   And they're all like anime avatars.
[01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:19.200]   So it's funny 'cause my friends ask me this,
[01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:21.520]   like who should I follow to stay up-to-date?
[01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:25.280]   And I say, go to X and follow all the AI anime models
[01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:27.920]   that this person is following or follows.
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:29.840]   And I sent them some URL and they all start laughing.
[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:30.640]   Like, what is this?
[01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:32.880]   But they're real, like people hacking around in AI.
[01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:35.600]   They get hired by big companies and they're on X.
[01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:38.000]   And most of them are anonymous.
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:38.640]   This is very funny.
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:40.800]   They use anime avatars.
[01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:42.080]   I don't.
[01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:44.720]   But those people hack around
[01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:47.360]   and they publish what they're discovering.
[01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:48.880]   They talk about papers, for example.
[01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:50.720]   So yeah, definitely X.
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:51.840]   - That's great.
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:55.200]   Almost exclusively, all the people I follow are AI people.
[01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:56.880]   - Yeah, it's a good time now.
[01:13:56.880 --> 01:14:02.400]   - Well, but also it just brings happiness to my soul
[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:05.440]   'cause there's so much turmoil on Twitter.
[01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:07.280]   - Yeah, like politics and stuff.
[01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:08.720]   - There's battles going on.
[01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:10.000]   It's like a war zone.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.880]   And it's nice to just go into this happy place
[01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:14.240]   to where people are building stuff.
[01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:15.440]   - Yeah, 100%.
[01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:17.840]   I like Twitter for that most, like building stuff.
[01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:20.400]   'Cause it inspires you to build.
[01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:23.760]   And it's just fun to see other people share
[01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:24.720]   what they're discovering.
[01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:27.280]   And then you're like, okay, I'm gonna make something too.
[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:28.080]   It's just super fun.
[01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:30.320]   And so if you wanna start going X,
[01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:32.880]   and then I would go to Replicate
[01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:34.800]   and start trying to play with models.
[01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:36.480]   And when you have something that kind of,
[01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:39.280]   you manually enter stuff, you set the parameters.
[01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:41.680]   Something that works, you can make an app out of it
[01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:42.320]   or a website.
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:45.360]   - Can you speak a little bit more to the process
[01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:47.120]   of it becoming better and better and better?
[01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:47.840]   Photo, yeah.
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:49.680]   - So I had this photo guy and a lot of people using it.
[01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:52.240]   There was like a million or more photos a month
[01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:53.520]   being generated.
[01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:57.120]   And I discovered, I was testing parameters,
[01:14:57.120 --> 01:14:59.760]   like increase the step count of generating a photo
[01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:02.000]   or changing the sampler, like a scheduler.
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:03.920]   Like you have DPM, two colors,
[01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:05.280]   all these things I don't know anything about,
[01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:07.520]   but I know that you can choose them when you generate an image
[01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:09.360]   and they have different resulting images.
[01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:11.200]   But I didn't know which one were better.
[01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:12.880]   So I would do it myself, test it.
[01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:15.360]   But then I was like, why don't I test on these users?
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:17.120]   'Cause I have a million photos generated anyway.
[01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:19.280]   So on like 10% of the users,
[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:22.240]   I would randomly test parameters.
[01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:24.080]   And then I would see if they would,
[01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:26.400]   'cause you can favor the photo or you can download it.
[01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:28.720]   I would measure if they favor it or like the photo.
[01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:31.440]   And then I would A/B test
[01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:33.200]   and you test for significance and stuff,
[01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:37.440]   which parameters were better and which were worse.
[01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:39.120]   - So you start starting to figure out
[01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:40.560]   which models are actually working.
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:42.160]   - Exactly, and then if it's significant enough data,
[01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:45.120]   you switch to that for the whole, all the users.
[01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:47.280]   And so that was like the breakthrough to make it better.
[01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:49.840]   Just use the users to improve it themselves.
[01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:51.040]   And I tell them when they sign up,
[01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:52.720]   we do sampling, we do testing
[01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:54.080]   on your photos with random parameters.
[01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:55.440]   And that worked really well.
[01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:56.560]   I don't do a lot of testing anymore
[01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:58.720]   because it's like, I kind of reached like a diminishing point
[01:15:58.720 --> 01:15:59.840]   where it's like, it's kind of good.
[01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:02.720]   But that was a breakthrough, yeah.
[01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:04.880]   - So it's really about the parameters and the models
[01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:08.000]   that choose and letting the users help
[01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:10.720]   do the search in the space of models
[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:11.920]   and parameters for you.
[01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:15.280]   - Yeah, but actually, so like Stable Diffusion,
[01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:19.200]   I use 1.5, 2.0 came out as Stable Diffusion XL came out,
[01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:21.280]   all these new versions and they were all worse.
[01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:24.800]   And so the core scene of people are still using 1.5
[01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:27.520]   because it's like, it's also not like really called neutered.
[01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:29.520]   Like they neutered like to make it super
[01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:32.160]   like with safety features and stuff.
[01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:36.080]   So most of the people are still on Stable Diffusion 1.5
[01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:39.360]   and meanwhile, Stable Diffusion, the company went like,
[01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:43.520]   the CEO left, a lot of drama happened
[01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:45.040]   because they couldn't make money.
[01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:47.840]   And yeah, so they gave us, it's very interesting.
[01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:51.680]   They gave us this open source model that everybody uses.
[01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:53.760]   They raised like hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:55.760]   It all, they didn't make any money.
[01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:57.760]   There were not a lot and they did an amazing job.
[01:16:57.760 --> 01:16:59.840]   And now everybody uses open source model for free.
[01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:03.040]   And they did, you know, it's amazing.
[01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:04.080]   Like it's amazing.
[01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:05.840]   - You're not even using the latest one.
[01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:07.200]   - No, and the strange thing is that
[01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:08.400]   this company raised hundreds of millions,
[01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:10.560]   but the people that are benefiting from it are really small.
[01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:13.120]   Like people like me will make these small apps
[01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:14.480]   that are using the model.
[01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:16.640]   And now they're starting to charge money for the new models,
[01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:19.360]   but the new models are not so good for people.
[01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:20.480]   They're not so open source, right?
[01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:23.040]   - Yeah, it's interesting because open source
[01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:26.240]   is so impactful in the AI space,
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:28.560]   but you wonder like, what is the business model behind that?
[01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:30.960]   But it's enabling this whole ecosystem of companies
[01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:33.600]   that they're using the open source model.
[01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:34.720]   - So it's kind of like this frameworks,
[01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:36.400]   but then they didn't, you know,
[01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:38.480]   bribe enough influencers to use it.
[01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:41.440]   And they didn't charge money for the platform, you know?
[01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:43.600]   - Okay, so back to your book and the ideas.
[01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:46.320]   We didn't even get to the first step.
[01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:49.680]   Generating ideas.
[01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:51.840]   So you had notebook and you're filling it up.
[01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:53.920]   How do you know when an idea is a good one?
[01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:58.400]   Like you have this just flood of ideas.
[01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:00.880]   How do you pick the one that you actually try to build?
[01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:02.480]   - Man, mostly you don't know.
[01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:04.320]   Like mostly I choose the ones that are most viable
[01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:05.280]   for me to build.
[01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:07.360]   Like I cannot build a space company now, right?
[01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:09.360]   Would be quite challenging, but I can build something.
[01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:11.760]   - Did you actually write down like space company?
[01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:14.240]   - No, I think asteroid mining would be very cool.
[01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:16.000]   'Cause like you go to an asteroid,
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:17.360]   you take some stuff from there,
[01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:19.360]   you bring it back, you sell it, you know?
[01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:21.280]   But then you need to do,
[01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:23.280]   and you can hire someone to launch the thing.
[01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:24.480]   So all you need is like the robot
[01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:26.560]   that goes to the asteroid, you know?
[01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:27.840]   And the robotics interesting.
[01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:29.120]   Like I wanna also learn robotics.
[01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:30.480]   So maybe that could be.
[01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:33.280]   - I think both the asteroid mining and the robotics.
[01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:34.320]   - Yeah, together.
[01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:39.520]   - I feel like.
[01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:40.560]   - No, exactly, this is it.
[01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:44.160]   We do this, not because it's easy,
[01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:45.760]   but because we thought it would be easy.
[01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:48.320]   Exactly, that's me with asteroid mining.
[01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:51.360]   Exactly, that's why I should do this.
[01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:54.960]   - It's not nomadlist.com, it's asteroid mining.
[01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:56.720]   You have to like build stuff.
[01:18:56.720 --> 01:18:58.960]   You have to, gravity is really hard to overcome.
[01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:02.160]   - Yeah, but it seems, man, I sound like idiot probably now,
[01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:03.600]   but it sounds quite approachable,
[01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:04.560]   like relatively approachable.
[01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:05.840]   You don't have to build the rockets.
[01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:07.960]   - Oh, you use something like SpaceX to get out to space.
[01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:11.920]   - Yeah, you hire SpaceX to send this dog robot or whatever.
[01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:13.680]   - So is there actually exist a notebook
[01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:15.040]   where you wrote down asteroid mining?
[01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:16.400]   - No, I used, back then I used Trello.
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:17.200]   - Trello.
[01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:19.600]   - Yeah, but now I don't really, I use Telegram.
[01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:20.960]   I write it on like saved messages
[01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:22.560]   and I have like idea I write it down.
[01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:23.760]   - You type to yourself on Telegram.
[01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:25.840]   - You know, 'cause you use WhatsApp, right, I think?
[01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:28.160]   So you have like message to yourself, I think also, yeah.
[01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:30.160]   - So you're talking to yourself on Telegram.
[01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:31.520]   - Yeah, you use like a notepad.
[01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:33.440]   You not forget stuff and then I pin it, you know.
[01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:35.440]   - I love how like you're not using
[01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:37.520]   super complicated systems or whatever.
[01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:38.960]   You know, people use Obsidian now.
[01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:42.080]   There's a lot of these, a notion
[01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:44.000]   where you have systems for note-taking.
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:47.680]   You're not, you're notepad, you're notepad.dx you guy,
[01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:48.800]   if you're a Windows user.
[01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:51.200]   - Man, I saw some YouTubers doing this like,
[01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:53.680]   there's a lot of these productivity gurus also
[01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:55.840]   and they do this whole like iPad with a pencil.
[01:19:55.840 --> 01:19:58.480]   And then I also had an iPad and I also got the pencil
[01:19:58.480 --> 01:20:00.560]   and I got this app where you can like draw on paper,
[01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:03.920]   like draw like a calendar, you know,
[01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:05.840]   like people, students use this
[01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:07.680]   and you can do coloring and stuff.
[01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:09.280]   And I'm like, dude, I did this for a week
[01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:10.560]   and I'm like, what am I doing with my life?
[01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:12.800]   Like I could just write it as a message to myself
[01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:13.840]   and it's good enough, you know?
[01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:17.040]   - Speaking of ideas, you shared a tweet explaining
[01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:20.560]   why the first idea sometimes might be a brilliant idea.
[01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:22.640]   The reason for this, you think, is the first idea
[01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:24.800]   submerges from your subconscious
[01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:26.880]   and was actually boiling in your brain for weeks, months,
[01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:28.160]   sometimes years in the background.
[01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:31.440]   The eight hours of thinking can never compete
[01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:33.520]   with the perpetual subconscious background job.
[01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:35.760]   So this is the idea that if you think about an idea
[01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:37.440]   for eight hours versus like the first idea
[01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:38.880]   that pops into your mind.
[01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:40.480]   And sometimes there is subconscious,
[01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:44.400]   like stuff that you've been thinking about for many years.
[01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:47.360]   - I mean like it emerges, I wrote it wrong
[01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:49.120]   'cause I don't know, I'm not native English,
[01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:51.280]   but it emerges from your subconscious, right?
[01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:54.720]   It comes from the, like a water is your subconscious
[01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:56.720]   in here is boiling and then when it's ready,
[01:20:56.720 --> 01:20:59.520]   it's like ding, second microwave comes out
[01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:01.040]   and there you have your idea.
[01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:02.480]   - You think you have ideas like that?
[01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:03.920]   - Yeah, all the time, 100%.
[01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:05.520]   - It's just stuff that's been like there.
[01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:06.640]   - Yes. - Yeah.
[01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:08.960]   - And I also, it comes up and I bring it,
[01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:09.760]   I send it back, you know?
[01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:12.400]   Like send it back to the kitchen to boil more.
[01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:13.920]   - Yeah. - And it's like a soup
[01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:15.920]   of ideas that's cooking.
[01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:17.600]   It's 100%, this is how my brain works.
[01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:18.560]   And I think most people.
[01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:20.400]   - But it's also about the timing.
[01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:21.520]   Sometimes you have to send it back,
[01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:22.800]   not just because you're not ready,
[01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:23.920]   but the world is not ready.
[01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:26.400]   - Yes, so many times like startup founders
[01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:30.000]   are too early with their idea, yeah, 100%.
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.680]   - Robotics is an interesting one for that
[01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:34.240]   because like there's been a lot of robotics companies
[01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:35.600]   that failed. - Yeah.
[01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:37.040]   - Because it's been very difficult
[01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:38.560]   to build a robotics company and make money
[01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:39.680]   because there's the manufacturing,
[01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:41.040]   like the cost of everything,
[01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:43.120]   the intelligence of the robot is enough,
[01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:46.560]   is not sufficient to create a compelling enough product
[01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:48.080]   from which to make money.
[01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:51.280]   So all, so there's this long line of robotics companies
[01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:53.520]   that have tried, they had big dreams and they failed.
[01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:55.440]   - Yeah, like Boston Dynamics,
[01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:56.400]   I still don't know what they're doing,
[01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:59.120]   but they always upload YouTube videos and it's amazing.
[01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:01.840]   But I feel like a lot of these companies don't have,
[01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:04.000]   it's like a solution looking for a problem for now.
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.600]   Military obviously is useless,
[01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:09.840]   but like do I need like a robotic dog now for my house?
[01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:10.800]   I don't know, like it's fun,
[01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:12.480]   but it doesn't really solve anything yet.
[01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:14.720]   I feel the same kind of with VR,
[01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:15.680]   like it's really cool.
[01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:16.960]   Like Apple Vision Pro is very cool.
[01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:19.120]   It doesn't really solve something for me yet.
[01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:22.800]   And that's kind of the tech looking for a solution, right?
[01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:23.600]   But one day will.
[01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:26.320]   - When the personal computer, when the Mac came along,
[01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:29.840]   there's a big switch that happened.
[01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:31.840]   It somehow captivated everybody's imagination.
[01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:33.760]   You could like the application,
[01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:36.880]   the killer apps became apparent.
[01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:37.840]   You can type in a computer.
[01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:39.760]   - But they became apparent like immediately.
[01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:41.120]   Back then they also had like this thing
[01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:43.040]   where like, we don't need these computers.
[01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:47.040]   They're like a hype and it also went like,
[01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:49.360]   and kind of like, you know, waves.
[01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:51.600]   - Yes, yeah, but the hype is the thing
[01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:53.760]   that allowed the thing to proliferate sufficiently
[01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:56.400]   to where people's minds would start opening up
[01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:58.160]   to it a little bit, the possibility of it.
[01:22:58.160 --> 01:22:59.840]   Right now, for example, with the robotics,
[01:22:59.840 --> 01:23:03.040]   there's very few robots in the homes of people.
[01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:04.160]   - Exactly, yeah.
[01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:06.320]   - The robots that are there are Roombas,
[01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:10.480]   so the vacuum cleaners, or they're Amazon Alexa.
[01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:12.000]   - Yeah, or dishwasher.
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.200]   I mean, it's essentially a robot.
[01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:16.160]   - Yes, but the intelligence is very limited, I guess,
[01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:18.160]   is one way we can summarize all of them.
[01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:20.640]   Except Alexa, which is pretty intelligent,
[01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:24.640]   but is limited with the kind of ways
[01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:25.520]   it interacts with you.
[01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:28.560]   That's just one example.
[01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:31.360]   I sometimes think about that as like,
[01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:34.400]   if some people in this world were kind of born
[01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:36.240]   in the whole existence, it's like,
[01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:41.360]   they were meant to build the thing, you know?
[01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:44.960]   I think I sometimes wonder like what I was meant to do.
[01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:47.440]   'Cause you have these plans for your life,
[01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:48.720]   you have these dreams.
[01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:51.040]   - I think you're meant to build robots.
[01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:52.320]   - Okay, me first.
[01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:54.400]   Maybe, maybe.
[01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:58.400]   That's a sense of habit.
[01:23:58.400 --> 01:23:59.280]   It could be other things.
[01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:02.960]   It could hilariously not be the thing I was meant to be,
[01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:06.720]   is to talk to people, which is weird,
[01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:08.960]   because I always was anxious about talking to people.
[01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:09.840]   It's like a-- - Really?
[01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:11.600]   - Yeah, I'm scared of this.
[01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:14.080]   I was scared, yeah, exactly.
[01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:15.040]   - I'm scared of you, so.
[01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:17.040]   - (laughs) It's just anxiety throughout,
[01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:18.240]   social interaction in general.
[01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:20.320]   I'm an introvert that hides from the world, so yeah.
[01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:22.880]   It's really strange.
[01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:24.480]   - Yeah, but that's also kind of life.
[01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:26.480]   Like life brings you to, it's very hard to
[01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:30.000]   super intently kind of choose
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:31.520]   what you're gonna do with your life.
[01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:32.800]   It's more like surfing.
[01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:35.040]   You're surfing the waves, you go in the ocean,
[01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:36.880]   you see where you end up, you know?
[01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:38.960]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:41.440]   And the universe has a kind of sense of humor.
[01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:41.940]   - Yeah.
[01:24:41.940 --> 01:24:44.000]   - I guess you have to just, yeah,
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.240]   allow yourself to be carried away by the waves, yeah.
[01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:47.120]   - Exactly, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:49.760]   - Have you felt that way in your life?
[01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:51.520]   - Yeah, all the time, like, yeah.
[01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:53.440]   That's like, I think that's the best way to live your life.
[01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:55.280]   - So allow whatever to happen.
[01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:57.440]   Like, do you know what you're doing in the next few years?
[01:24:57.440 --> 01:25:00.080]   Is it possible that it'll be completely, like, changed?
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:02.240]   - Possibly, I think relationships,
[01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:03.360]   like you wanna hold a relationship, right?
[01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:04.240]   You wanna hold your girlfriend,
[01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:06.240]   you wanna become wife and all this stuff.
[01:25:06.240 --> 01:25:10.720]   But you should, I think you should stay open to where,
[01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:11.920]   like, for example, where you wanna live.
[01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:12.880]   Like, I don't know, we don't know
[01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:14.000]   where we wanna live, for example.
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:17.200]   That's something that will figure itself out.
[01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:18.720]   It will crystallize where, you know,
[01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:22.000]   you will get sent by the waves to somewhere
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:22.880]   where you wanna live, for example.
[01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:23.520]   What are you gonna do?
[01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:25.680]   I think that's a really good way to live your life.
[01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:28.400]   I think most stress comes from trying to control,
[01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:32.320]   like, hold things, like, it's kind of Buddhist, you know?
[01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:35.200]   You need to, like, lose control, let it loose,
[01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:36.400]   and then things will happen.
[01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:38.000]   Like, when you do mushrooms, when you do drugs,
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.720]   like psychedelic drugs, the people that start,
[01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:42.800]   that are, like, control freaks, get bad trips.
[01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:43.280]   Right?
[01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:44.480]   'Cause you need to let go.
[01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:46.160]   Like, I'm a pretty control freak, actually.
[01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:49.120]   And when I did mushrooms, when I was 17,
[01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:51.280]   I was very good, and then at the end,
[01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:52.640]   it wasn't so good 'cause I tried to control.
[01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:54.240]   I was like, ah, now it's going too much, you know?
[01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:55.280]   Now I need to, let's stop.
[01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:56.880]   Bro, you can't stop it.
[01:25:56.880 --> 01:25:58.800]   You need to go through with it, you know?
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:01.840]   And so I think it's a good metaphor for life.
[01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:04.400]   I think that's, you know, a very tranquil way
[01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:05.360]   to lead your life.
[01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:08.240]   - Yeah, actually, when I took ayahuasca,
[01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:12.960]   that lesson is deeply within me already
[01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:14.000]   that you can't control anything.
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:14.480]   - Yes.
[01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:17.840]   - I think I probably learned that the most in jiu-jitsu.
[01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:20.000]   So just let go and relax.
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:20.480]   - Yeah.
[01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:22.320]   - And that's why I had just an incredible experience.
[01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:24.240]   There's, like, literally no negative aspect
[01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:25.920]   of my ayahuasca experience
[01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:27.360]   or any psychedelics I've ever had.
[01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:29.520]   Some of that could be with my biology,
[01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:30.560]   my genetics, whatever,
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:32.960]   but some of it was just not trying to control.
[01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:33.600]   - Yeah.
[01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:34.400]   - Just sort of the way.
[01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:35.040]   - For sure.
[01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:36.800]   I think most stress in life comes from trying to control.
[01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:41.360]   - So once you have the idea, step two, build.
[01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:43.360]   How do you think about building the thing
[01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:44.480]   once you have the idea?
[01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:46.960]   - I think you should build with the technology that you know.
[01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:49.920]   So for example, Nomad List,
[01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:51.280]   which is, like, this website I made
[01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:53.680]   to figure out the best cities to live and work
[01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:54.560]   as digital nomads.
[01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:56.400]   It wasn't a website.
[01:26:56.400 --> 01:26:58.560]   It launched as a Google spreadsheet.
[01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:00.560]   So it was a public Google spreadsheet
[01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:01.920]   anybody could edit.
[01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:03.440]   And I was like, I'm collecting, like, cities
[01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:04.880]   where we can live as digital nomads
[01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:07.280]   with the internet speeds, the cost of living,
[01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:09.200]   you know, other stuff.
[01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:11.120]   And I tweeted it and I would,
[01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:12.400]   and back then I didn't have a lot of followers.
[01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:14.800]   I had, like, a few thousand followers or something.
[01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:17.360]   And it went, like, viral for my skill viral back then,
[01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:18.720]   you know, which was, like, five retweets.
[01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:21.440]   And a lot of people started editing it
[01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:23.120]   and there was, like, hundreds of cities in this list,
[01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:25.200]   like, from all over the world with all the data.
[01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:26.160]   It was very crowdsourced.
[01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:28.560]   And then I made that into a website.
[01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:32.000]   So figuring out, like, what technology you can use
[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:32.960]   that you already know.
[01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:33.760]   So if you cannot code,
[01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:34.720]   you can use a spreadsheet.
[01:27:34.720 --> 01:27:37.360]   If you cannot use a spreadsheet,
[01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:39.760]   like, whatever, you can always use,
[01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:41.120]   for example, a website generator,
[01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:43.200]   like Wix or something, or Squarespace, right?
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:45.600]   Like, you don't need to code to build a startup.
[01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:48.000]   All you need is a idea for a product,
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.720]   build something like a landing page or something,
[01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:54.160]   put a Stripe button on there and then make it.
[01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:55.840]   And if you can't code,
[01:27:55.840 --> 01:27:58.080]   use the language that you already know
[01:27:58.080 --> 01:27:59.920]   and start coding with that and see how far you can get.
[01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:02.240]   You can always rewrite the code later.
[01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:04.240]   Like, the tech stack, it's not actually,
[01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:05.920]   it's not the most important of a business
[01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:06.880]   when you're starting out a business.
[01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:08.560]   The important thing is that you validate
[01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:09.280]   that there's a market,
[01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:11.040]   that there's a product that people want to pay for.
[01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:13.840]   So use whatever you can use.
[01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:16.880]   And if you cannot code, use, you know,
[01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:19.440]   spreadsheets, landing page generators, whatever.
[01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:21.840]   - Yeah, and the crowdsourcing element is fascinating.
[01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:24.560]   It's cool.
[01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:26.080]   It's cool when a lot of people start using it,
[01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:27.920]   you get to learn so fast.
[01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:28.800]   - Yeah.
[01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:32.800]   - Like I've actually did the spreadsheet thing.
[01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:37.040]   You share a spreadsheet publicly and I made it editable.
[01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:37.600]   - Yeah.
[01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:38.400]   - It's so cool.
[01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:39.520]   - Interesting things start happening.
[01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:40.320]   - Yeah.
[01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:41.920]   I did it for like a workout thing
[01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:44.240]   'cause I was doing a large amount of pushups and pull-ups.
[01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:45.360]   - Yeah, I remember this, man, yeah.
[01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:50.080]   - And like, and well, also Google Sheets is pretty limited
[01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:51.840]   in that everything's allowed.
[01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:54.160]   So people could just write anything in any cell
[01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:58.000]   and they can create new sheets, new tabs.
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:28:59.600]   And it just exploded.
[01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:02.960]   And one of the things that I really enjoyed
[01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:04.480]   is there's very few trolls
[01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:10.320]   because actually other people would delete the trolls.
[01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:11.840]   There would be like this weird war.
[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:11.840]   - Army.
[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:15.680]   - Of like, they want like to protect the thing.
[01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:17.840]   It's an immune system that's inherent to the thing.
[01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:19.920]   - It becomes a society, you know, in a spreadsheet.
[01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:22.160]   - And then there's the outcasts who go to the bottom
[01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:24.800]   of the spreadsheet and they would try to hide messages.
[01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:26.720]   And they like, I don't wanna be with the cool kids
[01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:27.920]   up at the top of the spreadsheets.
[01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:29.440]   - Self-organizing.
[01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:30.720]   - Yeah, it's fast.
[01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:33.440]   I mean, but that kind of crowdsourcing element
[01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:34.720]   is really powerful.
[01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:37.920]   And if you can create a product that use that
[01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:41.360]   to its benefit, that's really nice.
[01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:43.600]   Like any kind of voting system, any kind of rating system
[01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:46.560]   for A and B testing is really, really, really fascinating.
[01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:48.640]   So anyway, so Nomad List is great.
[01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:50.480]   I would love for you to talk about that.
[01:29:50.480 --> 01:29:53.280]   But one sort of way to talk about it is
[01:29:55.520 --> 01:29:58.240]   through you building Hood Maps.
[01:29:58.240 --> 01:29:58.800]   - Yeah.
[01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:00.480]   - So you've, you did an awesome thing,
[01:30:00.480 --> 01:30:04.080]   which is document yourself building the thing
[01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:06.800]   and doing so in just a handful of days,
[01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:07.920]   like three, four, five days.
[01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:10.560]   So people should definitely check out the video
[01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:11.600]   in the blog post.
[01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:14.480]   Can you explain what Hood Maps is
[01:30:14.480 --> 01:30:16.880]   and what this whole like, this process was?
[01:30:16.880 --> 01:30:18.720]   - So I was traveling and I was still trying to find
[01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:20.000]   like problems, right?
[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.320]   And I would go, I would discover that like
[01:30:22.320 --> 01:30:23.920]   everybody's experience of a city is different
[01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:25.200]   because they stay in different areas.
[01:30:25.200 --> 01:30:25.600]   - Yeah.
[01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:29.280]   - So I'm from Amsterdam and when I grew up in Amsterdam,
[01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:31.360]   or I didn't grow up, but I lived there in university,
[01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:33.760]   I knew that center is like, in Europe,
[01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:35.600]   the centers are always tourist areas.
[01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:36.960]   So they're super busy.
[01:30:36.960 --> 01:30:38.800]   They're not very authentic.
[01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:40.400]   The culture, they're not really Dutch culture.
[01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:42.560]   It's Amsterdam tourist culture, you know?
[01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:44.080]   So when people would travel to Amsterdam,
[01:30:44.080 --> 01:30:45.360]   I would say, don't go to the center,
[01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:48.800]   go to, you know, southeast of the center,
[01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:50.800]   the Jordaan or the Pijp or something,
[01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:51.680]   more hipster areas,
[01:30:51.680 --> 01:30:54.720]   like a little bit more authentic culture of Amsterdam.
[01:30:54.720 --> 01:30:55.840]   That's where I would live, you know,
[01:30:55.840 --> 01:30:56.640]   and where I would go.
[01:30:56.640 --> 01:30:59.600]   And I thought this could be like an app
[01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:01.520]   where you can have like a Google maps
[01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:02.800]   and you put colors over it.
[01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:04.720]   You have like areas that are like color coded,
[01:31:04.720 --> 01:31:06.720]   like red is tourist, green is rich,
[01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:09.440]   you know, green money, yellow is hipster.
[01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:10.560]   And you can figure out where you need to go
[01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:11.360]   in a city when you travel.
[01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:12.160]   'Cause I was traveling a lot,
[01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:13.280]   I wanted to go to the cool spots.
[01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:14.800]   - So just use color.
[01:31:14.800 --> 01:31:16.480]   - Yeah, color, yeah, yeah.
[01:31:16.480 --> 01:31:17.440]   And I would use a canvas.
[01:31:17.440 --> 01:31:18.880]   So I thought, okay, what do I need?
[01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:19.280]   I need to--
[01:31:19.280 --> 01:31:21.600]   - Did you know that you would be using a canvas?
[01:31:21.600 --> 01:31:23.360]   - No, I didn't know it was possible
[01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:24.000]   'cause I didn't know--
[01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:25.840]   - So I mean, this is the cool thing.
[01:31:25.840 --> 01:31:26.880]   People should really check it out.
[01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:27.680]   - 'Cause this is how it started.
[01:31:27.680 --> 01:31:30.240]   - Because like you're honestly capture
[01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:33.680]   so beautifully the humbling aspects,
[01:31:33.680 --> 01:31:36.480]   the embarrassing aspects of like not knowing what to do.
[01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:38.480]   It's like, how do I do this?
[01:31:38.480 --> 01:31:40.560]   And you like document yourself.
[01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:41.760]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:43.600]   Dude, I feel embarrassed about myself.
[01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:45.360]   - Oh, really, yeah.
[01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:47.600]   - It's called being alive, nice.
[01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:49.920]   So you're like, you don't know anything about,
[01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:56.240]   so canvas is a way, HTML5 thing
[01:31:56.240 --> 01:31:58.160]   that allows you to draw shapes.
[01:31:58.160 --> 01:32:00.080]   - Yeah, draw images, just draw pixels essentially.
[01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:02.480]   And that was special back then
[01:32:02.480 --> 01:32:04.480]   because before you could only have like elements, right?
[01:32:04.480 --> 01:32:06.640]   So you wanna draw a pixel, use a canvas.
[01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:08.640]   And I knew I needed to draw pixels
[01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:09.840]   'cause I need to draw these colors.
[01:32:09.840 --> 01:32:12.800]   And I felt like, okay, I'll get like a Google Maps,
[01:32:12.800 --> 01:32:16.400]   iframe embeds, and then I'll put a div on top of it
[01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:19.600]   with the colors and I'll do like opacity 50,
[01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:20.640]   so it kind of shows.
[01:32:20.640 --> 01:32:24.240]   So I did that with canvas and then I started drawing.
[01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:26.560]   And then I felt like,
[01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:28.000]   obviously other people need to edit this
[01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:29.760]   'cause I cannot draw all these things myself.
[01:32:29.760 --> 01:32:33.840]   So I crowdsourced it again and you would draw on the map
[01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:35.840]   and then it would send the pixel data to the server,
[01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:36.960]   it would put it in a database.
[01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:39.760]   And then I would have a robot running like a cron job,
[01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:41.520]   which every week would calculate
[01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:42.960]   or every day would calculate like,
[01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:44.240]   okay, so Amsterdam center,
[01:32:44.240 --> 01:32:47.360]   there's like six people say it's tourists,
[01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:48.720]   this part of the center,
[01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:50.960]   but two people say it's like hipster.
[01:32:50.960 --> 01:32:52.560]   Okay, so the tourist part wins, right?
[01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:53.680]   It's just an array.
[01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:55.120]   So find the most common value
[01:32:55.120 --> 01:32:57.440]   in a little pixel area on a map.
[01:32:57.440 --> 01:33:00.720]   So most people say it's tourist, it's tourist
[01:33:00.720 --> 01:33:01.440]   and it becomes red.
[01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:05.040]   And I would do that for all the GPS corners in the world.
[01:33:05.040 --> 01:33:06.640]   - Can you just clarify,
[01:33:06.640 --> 01:33:09.840]   do you have to be as a human that's contributing to this,
[01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:11.920]   do you have to be in that location to make the label?
[01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:14.720]   - No, people just type in cities and go like,
[01:33:14.720 --> 01:33:16.400]   go berserk and start drawing everywhere.
[01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:18.320]   - Would they draw shapes or would they draw pixels?
[01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:19.600]   - Man, they drew like crazy stuff,
[01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:21.520]   like offensive symbols, I can't mention,
[01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:23.200]   they would draw penises.
[01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:25.760]   - I mean, that's obviously a guy thing.
[01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:27.200]   - I would do the same thing, draw penises.
[01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:28.240]   - That's the first thing,
[01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:30.400]   when I show up to Mars and there's no cameras,
[01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:31.680]   I'm drawing a penis on the sand.
[01:33:31.680 --> 01:33:33.120]   - Man, I did it in the snow, you know,
[01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:35.040]   but the penises did not become a problem
[01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:36.800]   'cause I knew that not everybody would draw a penis
[01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:37.760]   and not in the same place.
[01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:40.240]   So most people would use it fairly.
[01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:42.240]   So just if I had enough crowdsourced data,
[01:33:42.240 --> 01:33:44.480]   so you have all these pixels on top of it,
[01:33:44.480 --> 01:33:45.920]   it's like a layer of pixels
[01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:47.520]   and then you choose the most common pixel.
[01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:51.360]   So yeah, it's just like a poll, but in visual format.
[01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:54.480]   And it worked and within a week, I had enough data.
[01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:57.280]   And it was like cities that did really well,
[01:33:57.280 --> 01:33:59.840]   like Los Angeles, a lot of people started using it.
[01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:01.920]   Like most data's in Los Angeles.
[01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:05.680]   - Because Los Angeles has defined neighborhoods.
[01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:06.480]   - Yeah, I understand.
[01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:09.760]   - And not just in terms of the official labels,
[01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:11.680]   but like what they're known for.
[01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:12.160]   - Yeah.
[01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:16.320]   - What are the, did you provide the categories
[01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:18.160]   that they were allowed to use as labels?
[01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:19.440]   - The colors, yeah.
[01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:20.320]   - As colors?
[01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:21.840]   - So it's just like, I think you can see there,
[01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:25.360]   there's like hipster, tourist, rich, business.
[01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:26.480]   So there's always a business area, right?
[01:34:26.480 --> 01:34:27.760]   And then there's a residential.
[01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:28.800]   Like residential's gray.
[01:34:28.800 --> 01:34:30.960]   So I thought those were the most common things
[01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:31.760]   in the city kind of.
[01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:33.120]   - And a little bit meme-y,
[01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:34.800]   like it's almost fun to label it.
[01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:37.200]   - Yeah, I mean, obviously it's simplified,
[01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:38.480]   but you need to simplify this stuff.
[01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:40.320]   You know, you don't wanna have too many categories.
[01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:43.680]   And it's essentially just like using a paintbrush
[01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:45.200]   where you select a color in the bottom,
[01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:46.960]   you select a category and you start drawing.
[01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:49.120]   There's no instruction, there's no manual.
[01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:51.440]   And then I also added tagging
[01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:55.200]   so people could like write something on a specific location.
[01:34:55.200 --> 01:35:00.480]   So don't go here or like, here's like nice cafes and stuff.
[01:35:00.480 --> 01:35:02.160]   And man, the memes that came from that.
[01:35:02.160 --> 01:35:05.840]   And I also added uploading so that the tags could be uploaded.
[01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:07.680]   So the memes that came from that is like amazing.
[01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:10.240]   Like people in Los Angeles would write crazy stuff.
[01:35:10.240 --> 01:35:12.400]   It would go viral in all these cities.
[01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:14.320]   You can allow, allow your location.
[01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:16.640]   And it will probably send you to Austin.
[01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:23.760]   - Okay, so we're looking, oh boy, drunk hipsters.
[01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:29.680]   - Air bro and bros.
[01:35:29.680 --> 01:35:33.360]   - Air bro and bros, hipster girls who do cocaine.
[01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:36.000]   - I saw a guy in a fish costume get beaten up here.
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.240]   - Yep, that seems also accurate.
[01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:39.600]   - Overpriced and underwhelming.
[01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:43.360]   (laughing)
[01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:46.000]   - Let me see, let me make sure this is accurate.
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:46.480]   Let's see.
[01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:52.640]   Dirty 6th, for people who know Austin
[01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:54.800]   know that that's important to label.
[01:35:54.800 --> 01:35:56.800]   6th Street is famous in Austin.
[01:35:56.800 --> 01:35:59.680]   Dirty 6th drunk frat boys, accurate.
[01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:02.960]   Drunk frat bros continued on 6th, very well.
[01:36:02.960 --> 01:36:03.840]   - Drunk douche bros.
[01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:06.000]   - West 6th drunk douche bros.
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:07.200]   - They go from frat to douche.
[01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:09.280]   - Douche, I mean, it's very accurate.
[01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:13.760]   So far, they only let hot people live here.
[01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:17.600]   That's, I think that might be accurate.
[01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:19.680]   - It's like the district.
[01:36:19.680 --> 01:36:22.800]   - Exercise freaks on the river.
[01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:23.520]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:25.040]   - Dog runners, accurate.
[01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:28.080]   I saw a guy in a fish costume get beat up here.
[01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:29.120]   - I wanna know this story.
[01:36:29.120 --> 01:36:32.160]   - So that's all user contributed.
[01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:34.000]   - Yeah, and that's like stuff I couldn't come up with
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:34.880]   'cause I don't know Austin.
[01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:37.280]   I don't know the memes here, the subcultures.
[01:36:37.280 --> 01:36:39.920]   - And then me as a user can upvote or downvote this.
[01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:40.560]   - Yes.
[01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:42.080]   - So this is completely crowdsourced.
[01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:43.840]   - 'Cause of Reddit, you know, upvote, downvote.
[01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:44.480]   Took it from there.
[01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:47.200]   - And that's really, really, really powerful.
[01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:49.760]   Single people with dogs, accurate.
[01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:51.200]   At which point did it go from colors
[01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:52.720]   to the actually showing the text?
[01:36:52.720 --> 01:36:56.160]   - I think I added the text like a week after.
[01:36:56.160 --> 01:36:58.960]   And so here's like the pixels.
[01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:00.640]   - So that's really cool, the pixels.
[01:37:00.640 --> 01:37:01.280]   How do you go from there?
[01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:02.480]   That's a huge amount of data.
[01:37:02.480 --> 01:37:05.040]   So there's, we're now looking at an image
[01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:08.400]   where it's just a sea of pixels
[01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:10.640]   that call it different colors in a city.
[01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:12.480]   So how do you combine that to be a thing
[01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:13.760]   that actually makes some sense?
[01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:15.920]   - I think here the problem was that you have this data,
[01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:19.600]   but it's like, it's not locked to one location.
[01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:20.000]   - Yeah.
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:21.120]   - So I had to normalize it.
[01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:23.200]   So when you click, when you draw on the map,
[01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:25.600]   it will show you the specific pixel location
[01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:26.800]   and you can convert the pixel location
[01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:28.000]   to a GPS coordinate, right?
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:29.040]   Like latitude, longitude.
[01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:31.040]   But the number will have a lot of commas
[01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:32.000]   or a lot of decimals, right?
[01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:32.960]   'Cause it's very specific.
[01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:34.720]   Like it's like this specific part of the table.
[01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:37.200]   So what you want to do is you want to take that pixel
[01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:39.600]   and you want to normalize it by removing like decimals,
[01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:41.760]   which I discovered.
[01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:43.600]   So that you're talking about this neighborhood
[01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:44.880]   or this street, right?
[01:37:44.880 --> 01:37:45.600]   And so that's what I did.
[01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:46.960]   I just took the decimals off
[01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:48.480]   and then I saved it like this.
[01:37:48.480 --> 01:37:51.520]   And then it starts going through like a grid
[01:37:51.520 --> 01:37:54.400]   and then you have like a grid of data.
[01:37:54.400 --> 01:37:55.920]   You get like a pixel map kind of.
[01:37:55.920 --> 01:37:58.080]   - And you said it looks kind of ugly.
[01:37:58.080 --> 01:37:59.280]   So then you smooth it.
[01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:01.920]   - Yeah, I started adding blurring and stuff.
[01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:04.000]   I think now it's not smooth again
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:05.120]   'cause I liked it better.
[01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:06.640]   People like the pixel look kind of.
[01:38:06.640 --> 01:38:09.360]   Yeah, a lot of people use it and it keeps going viral.
[01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:13.200]   And every time my maps bill, like Mapbox,
[01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:15.120]   I had to stop using, I first used Google Maps.
[01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:16.240]   It went viral.
[01:38:16.240 --> 01:38:18.080]   And Google Maps, it was out of credits.
[01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:21.040]   So I, and I had to, it's so funny.
[01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:22.960]   During when I launched it, it went viral.
[01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:26.080]   Google Maps, the map didn't load anymore.
[01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:27.360]   It says over the limits.
[01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:29.040]   You need to contact Enterprise Sales.
[01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:32.240]   And I'm like, but I need now like a map.
[01:38:32.240 --> 01:38:34.000]   So, and I don't want to contact Enterprise Sales.
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.640]   I don't want to go on a call schedule with some calendar.
[01:38:36.640 --> 01:38:39.760]   So I switched to Mapbox and then had Mapbox for years.
[01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:41.440]   And then it went viral.
[01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:44.240]   And I had a bill of $20,000 was like last year.
[01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:46.400]   So they helped me with the bill.
[01:38:46.400 --> 01:38:48.320]   They said, you know, you can pay less.
[01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:50.800]   And then I now switch to like an open source
[01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:52.640]   kind of map platform.
[01:38:52.640 --> 01:38:54.320]   So it's a very expensive product
[01:38:54.320 --> 01:38:56.880]   and never made any dollar money, but it's very fun.
[01:38:56.880 --> 01:38:57.760]   But it's very expensive.
[01:38:57.760 --> 01:38:58.960]   - Where do you learn from that?
[01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:02.480]   So like from that experience,
[01:39:02.480 --> 01:39:04.800]   'cause when you leverage somebody else's
[01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:05.920]   sort of through the API.
[01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:06.800]   - Yeah.
[01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:09.680]   I mean, I don't think a map hosting service
[01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:11.200]   should cost this much, you know,
[01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:13.680]   but I could host it myself,
[01:39:13.680 --> 01:39:15.600]   but that would be, I don't know how to do that,
[01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:16.720]   you know, but I could do that.
[01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:18.480]   - Yeah, it's super complicated.
[01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:20.480]   - I think that the thing is more about like,
[01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:22.320]   you can't make money with this project.
[01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:24.320]   I tried to do many things to make money with it.
[01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:26.080]   And it's, it hasn't worked.
[01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:28.960]   - You talked about like possibly doing advertisements
[01:39:28.960 --> 01:39:32.560]   on it or somehow, or people sponsoring it, yeah.
[01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:33.760]   But it's really surprising to me
[01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:36.720]   that people don't want to advertise on it.
[01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:39.440]   - I think map apps are very hard to like monetize.
[01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:40.960]   Like Google Maps also doesn't really make money.
[01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:42.160]   Like sometimes you see these ads,
[01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:44.000]   but I don't think there's a lot of money there.
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:47.760]   You could put like a banner ad, but it's kind of ugly.
[01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:49.680]   And the product is kind of like, it's kind of cool.
[01:39:49.680 --> 01:39:51.920]   So it's kind of fun to like subsidize it.
[01:39:51.920 --> 01:39:54.000]   And it's kind of a little bit part of Nomad List.
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:55.680]   Like I put it on Nomad List in the cities as well.
[01:39:57.440 --> 01:39:58.640]   But I also realized like,
[01:39:58.640 --> 01:39:59.920]   you don't need to monetize everything.
[01:39:59.920 --> 01:40:01.840]   Like some products are just cool.
[01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:06.080]   And you know, it's like, it's cool to have hood maps exist.
[01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:08.240]   I want this to exist, right?
[01:40:08.240 --> 01:40:09.920]   - Yeah, there's a bunch of stuff you've created
[01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:11.600]   that I'm just glad exists in this world.
[01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:12.560]   That's true.
[01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:13.920]   And it's a whole nother puzzle.
[01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:17.600]   And I'm surprised to figure out how to make money off of it.
[01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:20.320]   I'm surprised maps don't make money, but you're right.
[01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:21.200]   It's hard.
[01:40:21.200 --> 01:40:22.480]   It's hard to make money.
[01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:24.480]   'Cause there's a lot of compute required
[01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:25.680]   to actually bring it to life.
[01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:27.360]   And also where do you put the ads, right?
[01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:30.320]   Like if you have a website, you can put like an ad box
[01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:32.400]   or you can do like a product placement or something.
[01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:33.760]   But you're talking about a map app
[01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:35.840]   that where 90% of the interface is a map.
[01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:37.200]   So what are you going to do?
[01:40:37.200 --> 01:40:39.360]   You're going to like, like it's hard to figure out
[01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:40.000]   where is this.
[01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:40.880]   - Yeah.
[01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:42.080]   And people don't want to pay for it.
[01:40:42.080 --> 01:40:43.280]   - No, exactly.
[01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:45.040]   Because if you make people pay for it,
[01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:46.960]   you lose 99% of the user base
[01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:48.480]   and you lose the crowdsource data.
[01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:49.360]   So it's not fun anymore.
[01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:51.120]   It stops being accurate, right?
[01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:55.440]   So you kind of, they pay for it by crowdsourcing the data.
[01:40:55.440 --> 01:40:57.040]   But then, yeah, it's fine.
[01:40:57.040 --> 01:40:58.880]   You know, it doesn't make money, but it's cool.
[01:40:58.880 --> 01:41:02.240]   - But that said, Nomad List makes money.
[01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:02.640]   - Yeah.
[01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:04.880]   - So what was the story behind Nomad List?
[01:41:04.880 --> 01:41:08.800]   - So Nomad List started because I was in Chiang Mai in Thailand,
[01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:10.320]   which is now like the second city here.
[01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:14.240]   And I was, you know, working on my laptop.
[01:41:14.240 --> 01:41:16.880]   I met like other nomads there.
[01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:18.800]   And I was like, okay, this seems like a cool thing to do.
[01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:21.360]   Like working on your laptop in a different country,
[01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:22.240]   kind of travel around.
[01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:24.880]   But back then the internet everywhere was very slow.
[01:41:25.440 --> 01:41:26.960]   So the internet was fast in, for example,
[01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:28.240]   Holland or United States.
[01:41:28.240 --> 01:41:30.640]   But in a lot of parts in, you know,
[01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:33.840]   South America or Asia was very slow, like 0.5 megabits.
[01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:35.520]   So you couldn't watch a YouTube video.
[01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:38.960]   Thailand weirdly had like quite fast internet.
[01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:42.800]   But I wanted to find like other cities where I could go
[01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:46.160]   to like work on my laptop or whatever and travel.
[01:41:46.160 --> 01:41:48.080]   But we needed like fast internet.
[01:41:48.080 --> 01:41:50.320]   So I was like, let's, you know,
[01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:52.880]   crowdsource this information with a spreadsheet.
[01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:54.160]   And I also needed to know the cost of living
[01:41:54.160 --> 01:41:54.960]   'cause I didn't have a lot of money.
[01:41:54.960 --> 01:41:56.000]   I had $500 a month.
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.480]   So I had to find a place where like the rent was like,
[01:41:58.480 --> 01:41:59.760]   you know, $200 per month or something
[01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:01.040]   where I had, you know, some money
[01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:02.960]   that I could actually rent something.
[01:42:02.960 --> 01:42:07.600]   And there was NomadList and it still runs.
[01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:09.040]   I think it's now almost 10 years.
[01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:10.640]   - So just to describe how it works,
[01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:13.120]   like I'm looking at Chiang Mai here.
[01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:15.680]   There's a total score, it's ranked number two.
[01:42:15.680 --> 01:42:17.040]   - Yeah, that's like a nomad score.
[01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:19.840]   - 4.82, like by members.
[01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:22.240]   But it's looking at the internet.
[01:42:23.040 --> 01:42:26.400]   In this case, it's fast, fun, temperature,
[01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:30.080]   humidity, air quality, safety, food safety,
[01:42:30.080 --> 01:42:35.760]   crime, racism, or lack of crime, lack of racism,
[01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:38.480]   educational level, power grid, vulnerability
[01:42:38.480 --> 01:42:40.000]   to climate change, income level.
[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:41.040]   - It's a little much, you know.
[01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:42.480]   - English speaking, it's awesome.
[01:42:42.480 --> 01:42:44.240]   It's awesome, walkability.
[01:42:44.240 --> 01:42:45.040]   - Yeah, keep adding stuff.
[01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:46.240]   - 'Cause for certain groups of people,
[01:42:46.240 --> 01:42:47.200]   certain things really matter.
[01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:48.080]   And this is really cool.
[01:42:48.080 --> 01:42:50.800]   Happiness, I'd love to ask about that.
[01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:56.960]   Nightlife, free Wi-Fi, AC, female friendly,
[01:42:56.960 --> 01:42:57.840]   freedom of speech.
[01:42:57.840 --> 01:42:59.760]   - Yeah, not so good in Thailand, you know.
[01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:02.240]   - Values derived from national statistics, right?
[01:43:02.240 --> 01:43:04.480]   - Yeah, I like how that one has--
[01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:06.000]   - I need to do that because the data sets
[01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:07.920]   are usually national, they're not on city level, right?
[01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:09.200]   So I don't know about the freedom of speech
[01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:10.640]   between Bangkok or Chiang Mai.
[01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:11.680]   I know it in Thailand.
[01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:13.520]   - I mean, this is really fascinating.
[01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:14.640]   So this is for city.
[01:43:14.640 --> 01:43:15.200]   - Yeah.
[01:43:15.200 --> 01:43:17.280]   - It's basically rating all the different things
[01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:18.800]   that matter to you, and internet.
[01:43:18.800 --> 01:43:20.640]   And this is all crowdsourced.
[01:43:20.640 --> 01:43:22.640]   - Well, so it started crowdsourced,
[01:43:22.640 --> 01:43:27.280]   but then I realized that you can download
[01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:30.560]   more accurate data sets from public source,
[01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:31.360]   like World Bank.
[01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:33.760]   They have a lot of public data sets, United Nations.
[01:43:33.760 --> 01:43:36.160]   And you can download a lot of data there,
[01:43:36.160 --> 01:43:37.520]   which you can freely use.
[01:43:37.520 --> 01:43:39.840]   I started getting problems with crowdsourced data,
[01:43:39.840 --> 01:43:41.840]   where, for example, people from India,
[01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:43.440]   they really love India.
[01:43:43.440 --> 01:43:46.160]   And they would submit the best scores
[01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:47.600]   for everything in India.
[01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:50.000]   And not just one person, but a lot of people,
[01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:51.760]   they would love to pump India.
[01:43:51.760 --> 01:43:53.280]   And I'm like, I love India too,
[01:43:53.280 --> 01:43:55.680]   but that's not valid data.
[01:43:55.680 --> 01:43:57.280]   So you started getting discrepancies in the data
[01:43:57.280 --> 01:43:59.520]   between where people were from and stuff.
[01:43:59.520 --> 01:44:02.320]   So I started switching to data sets.
[01:44:02.320 --> 01:44:04.480]   And now it's mostly data sets,
[01:44:04.480 --> 01:44:05.840]   but one thing that's still crowdsourced
[01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:07.920]   is so people add where they are,
[01:44:07.920 --> 01:44:10.320]   they add their travels to their profile.
[01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:13.280]   And I use that data to see which places are upcoming
[01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:15.200]   and which places are popular now.
[01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:17.360]   So about half of the ranking you see here
[01:44:17.360 --> 01:44:20.000]   is based on actual digital nomads who are there.
[01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:21.760]   You can click on a city, you can click on people,
[01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:23.840]   you can see the people, the users that are actually there.
[01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:27.200]   And it's like 30,000 or 40,000 members.
[01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:28.720]   So these people are in Austin now.
[01:44:28.720 --> 01:44:31.280]   - 1,800 remote workers in Austin now,
[01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:33.360]   of which eight plus members checked in.
[01:44:33.360 --> 01:44:36.640]   Members who will be here soon and go.
[01:44:36.640 --> 01:44:37.680]   - Yeah, so we have meetups.
[01:44:37.680 --> 01:44:39.680]   So people organize their own meetups.
[01:44:39.680 --> 01:44:42.720]   And we have about, I think like 30 per month.
[01:44:42.720 --> 01:44:44.000]   So it's like one meetup a day.
[01:44:44.640 --> 01:44:46.640]   And I don't do anything, they organize themselves.
[01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:49.600]   So I just, it's a whole black box.
[01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:52.160]   It just runs and I don't do a lot on it.
[01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:54.240]   It pulls data from everywhere and it just works.
[01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:57.920]   - Cons of Austin, it's too expensive,
[01:44:57.920 --> 01:45:00.000]   very sweaty and humid, now difficult to make friends.
[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:01.280]   - Difficult to make friends, interesting, right?
[01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:01.840]   I didn't know that.
[01:45:01.840 --> 01:45:03.200]   - Difficult to make friends.
[01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:03.760]   - In Austin.
[01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:05.760]   - I mean, but it's all crowdsourced,
[01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:06.960]   but mostly it's pros.
[01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:08.240]   - Yeah, Austin's very--
[01:45:08.240 --> 01:45:09.520]   - Pretty safe, fast internet.
[01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:11.280]   - I don't understand why it says not safe for women
[01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:13.200]   to check the data set.
[01:45:13.200 --> 01:45:14.000]   It's still safe.
[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.560]   The problem with a lot of places like United States
[01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:18.480]   is that it depends per area, right?
[01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:21.200]   So if you get like city level data or nation level data,
[01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:23.280]   it's like Brazil is the worst
[01:45:23.280 --> 01:45:26.960]   because the range in like safe and wealthy
[01:45:26.960 --> 01:45:28.640]   and not safe is like huge.
[01:45:28.640 --> 01:45:30.880]   So you can't say many things about Brazil.
[01:45:30.880 --> 01:45:32.880]   - So once you actually show up to the city,
[01:45:32.880 --> 01:45:35.760]   how do you figure out what area,
[01:45:35.760 --> 01:45:37.200]   like where to get fast internet?
[01:45:37.200 --> 01:45:40.080]   For example, like for me, it's consistently a struggle
[01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:44.320]   to figure out my hotels with fast wifi, for example,
[01:45:44.320 --> 01:45:45.840]   like a place, okay, okay.
[01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:49.360]   I show up to a city, there's a lot of fascinating puzzles
[01:45:49.360 --> 01:45:50.400]   and I haven't figured out a way
[01:45:50.400 --> 01:45:51.520]   to actually solve this puzzle.
[01:45:51.520 --> 01:45:53.280]   When I show up to a city,
[01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:57.200]   figuring out where I can get fast internet connection
[01:45:57.200 --> 01:46:01.200]   and for podcasting purposes,
[01:46:01.200 --> 01:46:03.920]   where I can find a place with a table that's quiet.
[01:46:03.920 --> 01:46:04.640]   - Right.
[01:46:04.640 --> 01:46:05.760]   - That's not easy.
[01:46:05.760 --> 01:46:06.720]   - Construction sounds?
[01:46:06.720 --> 01:46:08.480]   - All kinds of sounds.
[01:46:08.480 --> 01:46:10.480]   You have to learn about all the sources of sounds
[01:46:10.480 --> 01:46:14.000]   in the world and also like the quality of the room
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:18.320]   because the more, the emptier the room
[01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:21.120]   and like if it's just walls without any curtains
[01:46:21.120 --> 01:46:22.080]   or any of this kind of stuff,
[01:46:22.080 --> 01:46:25.440]   then there's echoes in the room anyway.
[01:46:25.440 --> 01:46:28.720]   But you figure out that a lot of hotels don't have tables.
[01:46:28.720 --> 01:46:29.680]   They don't have like normal--
[01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:30.720]   - And this weird desk, right?
[01:46:30.720 --> 01:46:31.440]   - Yeah, they have a desk.
[01:46:31.440 --> 01:46:32.800]   - It's not a center table.
[01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:37.040]   - Yep, and if you wanna get a nicer hotel
[01:46:37.040 --> 01:46:38.720]   where it's more spacious and so on,
[01:46:38.720 --> 01:46:40.240]   they usually have these like boutique,
[01:46:40.240 --> 01:46:44.240]   like fancy looking, like modernist tables that don't--
[01:46:44.240 --> 01:46:45.120]   - Yeah, it's too designy.
[01:46:45.120 --> 01:46:46.080]   - It's too designy.
[01:46:46.080 --> 01:46:47.360]   They're not really real tables.
[01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:48.480]   - What if you get Ikea?
[01:46:48.480 --> 01:46:50.080]   - Buy Ikea.
[01:46:50.080 --> 01:46:52.080]   - Yeah, before you arrive, you order an Ikea.
[01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:52.240]   - Yeah.
[01:46:52.240 --> 01:46:54.000]   - Like Nomads do this, they get desks.
[01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000]   - I feel like you should be able to show up to a place
[01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:57.920]   and have the desk, like it's not,
[01:46:57.920 --> 01:46:59.440]   unless you stay in there for a long time,
[01:46:59.440 --> 01:47:02.480]   just the entire assembly, all that.
[01:47:02.480 --> 01:47:04.720]   Airbnb is so unreliable.
[01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:09.600]   The range in quality that you get is huge.
[01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:13.520]   Hotels have a lot of problems, pros and cons.
[01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:15.680]   Like hotels have the problem that the pictures
[01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:18.000]   somehow never have good representative pictures
[01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:19.360]   of what's actually going to be in the rooms.
[01:47:19.360 --> 01:47:22.800]   - And that's a problem, fake photos, man.
[01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:25.280]   - If I could have the kind of data you have
[01:47:25.280 --> 01:47:26.720]   on Nomad List for hotels.
[01:47:26.720 --> 01:47:27.360]   - Yeah, man.
[01:47:27.360 --> 01:47:29.760]   - And I feel like you can make a lot of money on that too.
[01:47:29.760 --> 01:47:31.440]   - Yeah, the booking fees, I feel it, right?
[01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:32.400]   I thought about this idea,
[01:47:32.400 --> 01:47:33.600]   'cause we have the same problem.
[01:47:33.760 --> 01:47:36.480]   I go to hotels and there's specific ones
[01:47:36.480 --> 01:47:38.880]   that are very good and I know now the chains and stuff.
[01:47:38.880 --> 01:47:42.240]   But even if you go, some chains are very bad
[01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:44.240]   in a specific city and very good in other cities.
[01:47:44.240 --> 01:47:47.120]   - And each individual hotel has a lot of kinds of rooms.
[01:47:47.120 --> 01:47:47.920]   - Yeah.
[01:47:47.920 --> 01:47:51.360]   - Like some are more expensive, some are cheaper and so on,
[01:47:51.360 --> 01:47:55.040]   but you can get the details of what's in the room,
[01:47:55.040 --> 01:47:57.040]   like what's the actual layout of the room,
[01:47:57.040 --> 01:47:57.760]   what is the view of the room.
[01:47:57.760 --> 01:47:58.480]   - 3D scan it.
[01:47:58.480 --> 01:48:01.200]   - I feel like as a hotel, you can win a lot.
[01:48:01.200 --> 01:48:04.640]   So first you create a service that allows you
[01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:07.200]   to have like high resolution data about a hotel.
[01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:09.520]   Then one hotel signs up for that.
[01:48:09.520 --> 01:48:12.720]   I would 100% use that website to look for a hotel
[01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:15.520]   instead of the crappy alternatives
[01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:16.720]   that don't give any information.
[01:48:16.720 --> 01:48:18.560]   And I feel like there'll be this pressure
[01:48:18.560 --> 01:48:20.480]   for all the hotels to join that site.
[01:48:20.480 --> 01:48:22.480]   And you can make a shit ton of money
[01:48:22.480 --> 01:48:23.840]   'cause hotels make a lot of money.
[01:48:23.840 --> 01:48:24.480]   - I think it's true.
[01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:25.680]   But the problem is with these hotels,
[01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:27.360]   like it's same with airline industry.
[01:48:27.360 --> 01:48:29.120]   Why does every airline website suck
[01:48:29.120 --> 01:48:30.480]   when you try book a flight?
[01:48:30.480 --> 01:48:30.720]   - Yeah.
[01:48:30.720 --> 01:48:31.440]   - It's like very strange.
[01:48:31.440 --> 01:48:32.480]   Like, why does it have to suck?
[01:48:32.480 --> 01:48:33.920]   Obviously there's competition here.
[01:48:33.920 --> 01:48:35.280]   Why doesn't the best website win?
[01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:36.320]   - What's the explanation for that?
[01:48:36.320 --> 01:48:37.760]   - Man, I thought about this for years.
[01:48:37.760 --> 01:48:41.120]   So I think it's like, I have to book the flight anyway.
[01:48:41.120 --> 01:48:43.040]   Like I know there's a route that they take
[01:48:43.040 --> 01:48:45.360]   and I need to book, for example, Qatar Airlines.
[01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:47.760]   And I need to get through this process.
[01:48:47.760 --> 01:48:52.560]   So, and with hotels similar, you need a hotel anyway.
[01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:55.920]   So do you have time to like figure out the best one?
[01:48:55.920 --> 01:48:58.560]   Not really, you kind of just need to get the place booked
[01:48:58.560 --> 01:49:00.240]   and you need to get the flight.
[01:49:00.240 --> 01:49:03.040]   And you'll go through the pain of this process.
[01:49:03.040 --> 01:49:04.800]   And that's why this process always sucks so much
[01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:06.960]   with hotels and airline websites and stuff
[01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:08.720]   because they don't have an incentive to improve it.
[01:49:08.720 --> 01:49:12.480]   Because generally only for like a super upper segment
[01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:14.880]   of the market, I think like super high luxury,
[01:49:14.880 --> 01:49:16.880]   it affects the actual booking, right?
[01:49:16.880 --> 01:49:17.840]   - I don't know.
[01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:20.000]   I think that's an interesting theory.
[01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:21.680]   I think that must be a different theory.
[01:49:21.680 --> 01:49:25.280]   My theory would be that great engineers,
[01:49:25.280 --> 01:49:26.400]   like great software engineers
[01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:27.600]   are not allowed to make changes.
[01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:28.240]   - Yeah.
[01:49:28.240 --> 01:49:30.880]   - Basically like there's some kind of bureaucracy.
[01:49:30.880 --> 01:49:32.400]   There's way too many managers.
[01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:36.320]   There's a lot of bureaucracy and great engineers show up
[01:49:36.320 --> 01:49:38.320]   to try to work there and they're not allowed
[01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:40.480]   to really make any contributions and then they leave.
[01:49:40.480 --> 01:49:43.040]   And so you have a lot of mediocre software engineers
[01:49:43.040 --> 01:49:44.000]   that are not really interested
[01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:45.360]   in improving any other thing.
[01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:48.000]   And like literally they would like to improve the stuff
[01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:51.440]   but the bureaucracy of the place,
[01:49:51.440 --> 01:49:54.320]   plus all the bosses, all the high up people
[01:49:54.320 --> 01:49:55.840]   are not technical people probably.
[01:49:55.840 --> 01:49:56.160]   - Yeah.
[01:49:56.160 --> 01:49:58.240]   - They don't know much about what web dev,
[01:49:58.240 --> 01:49:59.920]   they don't know much about programming.
[01:49:59.920 --> 01:50:02.240]   So they just don't give any respect.
[01:50:02.240 --> 01:50:02.800]   - Yeah.
[01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:06.320]   - Like you have to give the freedom and the respect
[01:50:06.320 --> 01:50:09.520]   to great engineers as they try to do great things.
[01:50:09.520 --> 01:50:11.040]   That feels like an explanation.
[01:50:11.040 --> 01:50:12.960]   Like if you were a great programmer,
[01:50:12.960 --> 01:50:16.160]   would you wanna work at America Airlines or?
[01:50:16.160 --> 01:50:17.680]   - No, no.
[01:50:17.680 --> 01:50:20.960]   - I'm torn on that 'cause I actually,
[01:50:20.960 --> 01:50:23.280]   as somebody who loves programming,
[01:50:23.280 --> 01:50:25.680]   would love to work at America Airlines
[01:50:25.680 --> 01:50:27.600]   so I can make the thing better.
[01:50:27.600 --> 01:50:29.280]   - Yeah, but I would work there
[01:50:29.280 --> 01:50:30.560]   just to fix it for myself, you know?
[01:50:30.560 --> 01:50:31.840]   - Yeah, for yourself.
[01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:35.360]   And then you just know how much suffering you alleviated.
[01:50:35.360 --> 01:50:35.920]   - Yeah, for the whole society.
[01:50:35.920 --> 01:50:37.520]   - How much frustration.
[01:50:37.520 --> 01:50:39.840]   Just imagine all the thousands,
[01:50:39.840 --> 01:50:42.400]   maybe millions of people that go to that website
[01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:44.800]   and have to click like a million times.
[01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:45.920]   It often doesn't work.
[01:50:45.920 --> 01:50:47.360]   It's clunky, all that kind of stuff.
[01:50:47.360 --> 01:50:50.640]   You're making their life just so much better.
[01:50:50.640 --> 01:50:52.640]   Yeah, but there must be an explanation
[01:50:52.640 --> 01:50:54.320]   that has to do with managers and bureaucracies.
[01:50:54.320 --> 01:50:55.920]   - I think it's money.
[01:50:55.920 --> 01:50:57.120]   Do you know booking.com?
[01:50:57.120 --> 01:50:58.080]   - Sure.
[01:50:58.080 --> 01:51:00.480]   - It's the biggest booking website in the world.
[01:51:00.480 --> 01:51:01.840]   It's Dutch, actually.
[01:51:01.840 --> 01:51:04.240]   And they have teams 'cause my friend worked there.
[01:51:04.240 --> 01:51:06.640]   They have teams for a specific part of the website,
[01:51:06.640 --> 01:51:09.040]   like a 10 by 10 pixels area
[01:51:09.040 --> 01:51:11.120]   where they run tests on this.
[01:51:11.120 --> 01:51:13.120]   So they run tests and they're famous for this stuff.
[01:51:13.120 --> 01:51:14.720]   Like, oh, there's only one room left, right?
[01:51:14.720 --> 01:51:15.600]   With this red letter.
[01:51:15.600 --> 01:51:17.280]   It's like one room left, book now.
[01:51:17.280 --> 01:51:20.160]   And they got a fine from the European Union about this.
[01:51:20.160 --> 01:51:22.160]   So they have all these teams
[01:51:22.160 --> 01:51:23.520]   and they run the test for 24 hours.
[01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:24.800]   They go to sleep, they wake up next day,
[01:51:24.800 --> 01:51:25.840]   they come to the office and they see,
[01:51:25.840 --> 01:51:27.680]   okay, this performed better.
[01:51:27.680 --> 01:51:29.440]   This website has become a monster,
[01:51:29.440 --> 01:51:31.920]   but it's the most revenue-generating
[01:51:31.920 --> 01:51:33.200]   hotel booking website in the world.
[01:51:33.200 --> 01:51:33.760]   It's number one.
[01:51:33.760 --> 01:51:37.600]   So that shows that it's not about user experience.
[01:51:37.600 --> 01:51:40.880]   It's about, I don't know, about making more money.
[01:51:40.880 --> 01:51:44.880]   And not every company, but if they're optimizing,
[01:51:44.880 --> 01:51:46.640]   it's a public company, if they're optimizing for money.
[01:51:46.640 --> 01:51:49.040]   - But you can optimize for money by disrupting,
[01:51:49.040 --> 01:51:50.160]   like making it way better.
[01:51:50.160 --> 01:51:51.440]   - Yeah, but it's always startups.
[01:51:51.440 --> 01:51:52.560]   They start with disrupting,
[01:51:52.560 --> 01:51:55.120]   like booking all started as a startup in 1997.
[01:51:55.120 --> 01:51:57.680]   And then they become like the old shit again.
[01:51:57.680 --> 01:52:00.640]   Like Uber now starts to become like a taxi again, right?
[01:52:00.640 --> 01:52:01.680]   It was very good in the beginning.
[01:52:01.680 --> 01:52:04.400]   Now it's kind of like taxis now in many places are better.
[01:52:04.400 --> 01:52:05.760]   They're nicer than Ubers, right?
[01:52:05.760 --> 01:52:07.760]   So it's like the circle.
[01:52:07.760 --> 01:52:09.680]   - I think some of it is also just,
[01:52:09.680 --> 01:52:13.840]   it's hard to have ultra-competent engineers.
[01:52:13.840 --> 01:52:17.200]   Stripe seems like a trivial thing,
[01:52:17.200 --> 01:52:19.760]   but it's hard to pull off.
[01:52:19.760 --> 01:52:23.200]   Why was it so hard for Amazon to have buy with one click?
[01:52:23.200 --> 01:52:24.720]   Which I think is a genius idea.
[01:52:24.720 --> 01:52:26.400]   - Yeah. - Make buying easier.
[01:52:26.400 --> 01:52:31.200]   Make it as frictionless as possible.
[01:52:31.200 --> 01:52:33.760]   Just click a button once and you bought the thing.
[01:52:33.760 --> 01:52:36.160]   - Yeah. - As opposed to most of the web
[01:52:36.160 --> 01:52:38.800]   was a lot of clicking and it often doesn't work.
[01:52:38.800 --> 01:52:39.680]   Like with the airlines.
[01:52:39.680 --> 01:52:40.960]   - Remember the forms would delete,
[01:52:40.960 --> 01:52:42.320]   you could click next, submit,
[01:52:42.320 --> 01:52:44.080]   and it would 404 or something,
[01:52:44.080 --> 01:52:46.080]   or your internet would go down, your modem.
[01:52:46.080 --> 01:52:47.200]   - Yeah. - Yeah, man.
[01:52:47.200 --> 01:52:49.200]   - And I would have an existential crisis.
[01:52:49.200 --> 01:52:51.760]   It's like the frustration would take over my whole body.
[01:52:51.760 --> 01:52:52.960]   - Yes. - And I would just wanted
[01:52:52.960 --> 01:52:55.120]   to quit life for a brief moment there.
[01:52:55.120 --> 01:52:55.840]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:52:55.840 --> 01:52:57.840]   - I'm so happy to form stays in Google Chrome now
[01:52:57.840 --> 01:52:58.800]   when something goes wrong.
[01:52:58.800 --> 01:53:00.960]   But that's, so Google,
[01:53:00.960 --> 01:53:02.960]   somebody at Google improved society with that, right?
[01:53:02.960 --> 01:53:06.400]   - Yeah, and one of the challenges at Google
[01:53:06.400 --> 01:53:07.760]   is to have the freedom to do that.
[01:53:07.760 --> 01:53:08.800]   - They don't anymore.
[01:53:08.800 --> 01:53:10.480]   - There's a bunch of bureaucracy, yeah.
[01:53:10.480 --> 01:53:12.560]   - Yeah, at Google. - There's so many brilliant,
[01:53:12.560 --> 01:53:13.840]   brilliant people there.
[01:53:13.840 --> 01:53:16.160]   But it just moves slowly. - Yeah.
[01:53:16.160 --> 01:53:18.000]   - And I wonder why that is.
[01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:19.680]   Maybe that's the natural way of a company,
[01:53:19.680 --> 01:53:22.480]   but you have people like Elon who rolls in
[01:53:22.480 --> 01:53:25.600]   and just fires most of the folks and always operate,
[01:53:25.600 --> 01:53:27.600]   they push the company to operate as a startup,
[01:53:27.600 --> 01:53:28.720]   even when it's already big.
[01:53:28.720 --> 01:53:30.560]   - Yeah, but I mean, Apple does this.
[01:53:30.560 --> 01:53:31.760]   Like I started in business school,
[01:53:31.760 --> 01:53:34.080]   Apple does competing product teams
[01:53:34.080 --> 01:53:35.440]   that operate as startups.
[01:53:35.440 --> 01:53:36.800]   So it's three to five people.
[01:53:36.800 --> 01:53:38.320]   They make something, they have multiple teams
[01:53:38.320 --> 01:53:39.520]   to make the same thing.
[01:53:39.520 --> 01:53:40.480]   The best team wins.
[01:53:40.480 --> 01:53:42.560]   So you need to, I think you need to emulate
[01:53:42.560 --> 01:53:44.880]   like a free market inside a company
[01:53:44.880 --> 01:53:46.160]   to make it entrepreneurial, you know?
[01:53:46.160 --> 01:53:46.880]   - Yeah. - And you need
[01:53:46.880 --> 01:53:49.280]   entrepreneurial mentality in a company
[01:53:49.280 --> 01:53:52.000]   to come up with new ideas and do it better.
[01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.160]   - So one of the things you do really, really well
[01:53:54.160 --> 01:53:56.640]   is learn a new thing.
[01:53:56.640 --> 01:53:58.480]   Like you're trying to, you have an idea,
[01:53:58.480 --> 01:53:59.600]   you try to build it.
[01:53:59.600 --> 01:54:01.840]   And then you learn everything you need to
[01:54:01.840 --> 01:54:03.200]   in order to build it.
[01:54:03.200 --> 01:54:04.160]   You have your current skills,
[01:54:04.160 --> 01:54:06.560]   but you need to learn just a minimal amount of stuff.
[01:54:06.560 --> 01:54:08.160]   So you're a good person to ask like,
[01:54:08.160 --> 01:54:10.400]   how do you learn?
[01:54:10.400 --> 01:54:13.840]   How do you learn quickly and effectively
[01:54:13.840 --> 01:54:15.200]   and just the stuff you need?
[01:54:15.200 --> 01:54:17.440]   You did, just by way of example,
[01:54:17.440 --> 01:54:20.240]   you did a 30 days learning session on 3D.
[01:54:20.240 --> 01:54:22.320]   - Yeah. - Where you documented yourself,
[01:54:22.320 --> 01:54:23.680]   giving yourself only 30 days
[01:54:23.680 --> 01:54:25.040]   to learn everything you can about.
[01:54:25.040 --> 01:54:26.560]   - Yeah, I tried to learn virtual reality
[01:54:26.560 --> 01:54:28.320]   'cause I was like, this was like same as AI.
[01:54:28.320 --> 01:54:31.040]   It came up suddenly, like 2016, 2017
[01:54:31.040 --> 01:54:32.560]   with I think HTC Vive,
[01:54:32.560 --> 01:54:35.200]   this big VR glasses before Apple Vision Pro.
[01:54:35.200 --> 01:54:36.640]   And so I was like, oh, this is gonna be big.
[01:54:36.640 --> 01:54:37.520]   So I need to learn this.
[01:54:37.520 --> 01:54:39.680]   So I know nothing about 3D.
[01:54:39.680 --> 01:54:42.320]   I installed like, I think Unity
[01:54:42.320 --> 01:54:43.920]   and like Blender and stuff.
[01:54:43.920 --> 01:54:45.440]   And I started learning all this stuff
[01:54:45.440 --> 01:54:49.200]   because I thought this was like a new,
[01:54:49.200 --> 01:54:51.120]   you know, nascent technology that was gonna be big.
[01:54:51.120 --> 01:54:52.720]   And if I had the skills for it,
[01:54:52.720 --> 01:54:55.440]   I could use this to build stuff.
[01:54:55.440 --> 01:54:57.040]   And so I think with learning for me,
[01:54:57.040 --> 01:54:59.360]   it's like, I think learning is so funny
[01:54:59.360 --> 01:55:00.800]   'cause people always ask me like,
[01:55:00.800 --> 01:55:02.320]   how do you learn to code?
[01:55:02.320 --> 01:55:03.280]   Like, should I learn to code?
[01:55:03.280 --> 01:55:04.800]   And I'm like, I don't know.
[01:55:04.800 --> 01:55:06.640]   Like every day I'm learning, it's kind of cliche,
[01:55:06.640 --> 01:55:08.320]   but every day I'm learning new stuff.
[01:55:08.320 --> 01:55:09.920]   So every day I'm searching on Google
[01:55:09.920 --> 01:55:12.240]   or asking now chat GPT, how to do this thing,
[01:55:12.240 --> 01:55:12.880]   how to do this thing.
[01:55:12.880 --> 01:55:15.040]   Every day I'm getting better at my skill.
[01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:16.240]   So you never stop learning.
[01:55:16.240 --> 01:55:18.880]   So the whole concept of like, how do you learn?
[01:55:18.880 --> 01:55:19.520]   Well, you never end.
[01:55:19.520 --> 01:55:20.320]   So where do you wanna be?
[01:55:20.320 --> 01:55:22.000]   Do you wanna know a little bit?
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:22.960]   Do you wanna know a lot?
[01:55:22.960 --> 01:55:24.800]   Do you wanna do it for your whole life?
[01:55:24.800 --> 01:55:27.920]   So I think taking action is the best step to learn.
[01:55:27.920 --> 01:55:31.440]   So making things, like you know nothing,
[01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:32.480]   just start making things.
[01:55:32.480 --> 01:55:34.480]   Okay, so like how to make a website,
[01:55:34.480 --> 01:55:35.440]   search how to make a website.
[01:55:35.440 --> 01:55:36.880]   Or nowadays you ask chat GPT,
[01:55:36.880 --> 01:55:37.680]   how do I make a website?
[01:55:37.680 --> 01:55:38.560]   Where do I start?
[01:55:38.560 --> 01:55:39.920]   It generates codes for you, right?
[01:55:39.920 --> 01:55:41.600]   Copy the code, put it in a file, save it,
[01:55:41.600 --> 01:55:43.440]   open it in Google Chrome or whatever.
[01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:44.560]   You have a website.
[01:55:44.560 --> 01:55:46.160]   And then you start tweaking with it.
[01:55:46.160 --> 01:55:47.760]   And you start, okay, how do I add a button?
[01:55:47.760 --> 01:55:50.240]   How do I add AI features, right?
[01:55:50.240 --> 01:55:50.880]   Like nowadays.
[01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:52.640]   So it's like by taking action,
[01:55:52.640 --> 01:55:55.840]   you can learn stuff much faster than reading books
[01:55:55.840 --> 01:55:56.920]   or actually tutorials.
[01:55:56.920 --> 01:55:58.560]   - Actually I'm always curious.
[01:55:58.560 --> 01:56:00.080]   Let me ask perplexity.
[01:56:00.080 --> 01:56:01.600]   How do I make a website?
[01:56:01.600 --> 01:56:04.000]   I'm just curious what he would say.
[01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:09.120]   I hope it goes with like really basic vanilla solutions.
[01:56:09.120 --> 01:56:11.040]   Define your website's purpose.
[01:56:11.040 --> 01:56:12.080]   Choose a domain name.
[01:56:12.080 --> 01:56:13.920]   Select a web hosting provider.
[01:56:13.920 --> 01:56:16.400]   Choose a website, a builder, a CMS.
[01:56:16.400 --> 01:56:17.680]   Website, builder, platform, Wix.
[01:56:17.680 --> 01:56:20.000]   - It tells like Wix or Squarespace is what I said.
[01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:21.120]   - Yeah. - The landing page.
[01:56:21.120 --> 01:56:27.200]   - What do I, how do I say if I wanna program it myself?
[01:56:27.200 --> 01:56:29.200]   Design your website, create essential pages.
[01:56:29.200 --> 01:56:30.960]   - Yeah, even tells you to launch it, right?
[01:56:30.960 --> 01:56:32.560]   Like start promoting it. - Launch your website.
[01:56:32.560 --> 01:56:33.680]   Cool, well, I mean, you could do that.
[01:56:33.680 --> 01:56:35.040]   - Yeah, but this is literally it.
[01:56:35.040 --> 01:56:36.560]   Like it's, this is- - If you wanna make a website.
[01:56:36.560 --> 01:56:38.080]   - This is the basis, like Google Analytics.
[01:56:38.080 --> 01:56:40.000]   - But you can't make nomad lists with this way.
[01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000]   - You can. - With Wix, like with-
[01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.480]   - Ah, no, you can get pretty far, I think.
[01:56:44.480 --> 01:56:46.080]   - You can get pretty far. - These website builders
[01:56:46.080 --> 01:56:46.880]   are pretty advanced.
[01:56:46.880 --> 01:56:48.800]   Like all you need is a grid of images, right?
[01:56:48.800 --> 01:56:50.000]   - Yeah. - That are clickable,
[01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:51.840]   that open like another page. - Yeah.
[01:56:51.840 --> 01:56:52.720]   - You can get quite far.
[01:56:52.720 --> 01:56:56.000]   - How do I learn to program?
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:02.560]   Choose a programming language to start with.
[01:57:02.560 --> 01:57:04.640]   - Your free CodeCamp is good.
[01:57:04.640 --> 01:57:08.480]   - Work through a resource systematically.
[01:57:09.600 --> 01:57:13.520]   Practice calling regularly for 30, 60 minutes a day.
[01:57:13.520 --> 01:57:14.560]   Consistency is key.
[01:57:14.560 --> 01:57:16.320]   Join programming communities like Reddits.
[01:57:16.320 --> 01:57:19.440]   Yeah, yeah, it's pretty good.
[01:57:19.440 --> 01:57:20.880]   - Yeah. - It's pretty good.
[01:57:20.880 --> 01:57:23.040]   - So I think it's a very good starting ground
[01:57:23.040 --> 01:57:24.560]   'cause imagine you know nothing
[01:57:24.560 --> 01:57:26.960]   and you wanna make a website, you wanna make a startup.
[01:57:26.960 --> 01:57:29.920]   This is like, that's why, man,
[01:57:29.920 --> 01:57:32.800]   the power of AI for education is gonna be insane.
[01:57:32.800 --> 01:57:36.480]   Like people anywhere can ask this question
[01:57:36.480 --> 01:57:37.360]   and start building stuff.
[01:57:37.360 --> 01:57:39.120]   - Yeah, it clarifies it for sure.
[01:57:39.120 --> 01:57:41.760]   - And just start building, like keep, build, build,
[01:57:41.760 --> 01:57:43.920]   like actually apply the thing.
[01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:46.560]   Whether it's AI or any of the programming
[01:57:46.560 --> 01:57:48.320]   for web development. - Yeah.
[01:57:48.320 --> 01:57:50.480]   - Just have a project in mind.
[01:57:50.480 --> 01:57:54.640]   I love the idea of like 12 startups in 12 months
[01:57:54.640 --> 01:57:58.240]   or like build a project almost every day.
[01:57:58.240 --> 01:58:00.560]   Just build the thing. - Yeah.
[01:58:00.560 --> 01:58:03.680]   - And get it to work and finish it every single day.
[01:58:03.680 --> 01:58:04.960]   That's a cool experiment.
[01:58:04.960 --> 01:58:06.000]   - I think that was the inspiration.
[01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:10.640]   It was a girl who did 160 websites in 160 days
[01:58:10.640 --> 01:58:12.080]   or something, literally mini websites.
[01:58:12.080 --> 01:58:14.320]   - Yeah. - And she learned
[01:58:14.320 --> 01:58:15.200]   to code that way.
[01:58:15.200 --> 01:58:18.160]   So I think it's good to set yourself challenges, you know?
[01:58:18.160 --> 01:58:20.960]   Like don't, you can go to some coding bootcamp
[01:58:20.960 --> 01:58:22.480]   but I don't think they actually work.
[01:58:22.480 --> 01:58:23.920]   I think it's better to do like,
[01:58:23.920 --> 01:58:26.160]   for me, I'll do the dark like self learning
[01:58:26.160 --> 01:58:28.160]   and setting yourself like challenges
[01:58:28.160 --> 01:58:30.080]   and just getting in.
[01:58:30.080 --> 01:58:31.040]   But you need discipline, you know?
[01:58:31.040 --> 01:58:32.960]   You need discipline to keep doing it.
[01:58:32.960 --> 01:58:34.800]   And coding, you know, coding is very,
[01:58:35.360 --> 01:58:37.600]   it's a steep learning curve to get in.
[01:58:37.600 --> 01:58:38.320]   It's very annoying.
[01:58:38.320 --> 01:58:39.760]   Working with computers is very annoying.
[01:58:39.760 --> 01:58:44.800]   So it can be hard for people to keep doing it, you know?
[01:58:44.800 --> 01:58:49.200]   - Yeah, that thing of just keep doing it and don't quit.
[01:58:49.200 --> 01:58:52.000]   That urgency that's required to finish a thing.
[01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.560]   That's why it's really powerful when you documented this,
[01:58:54.560 --> 01:58:57.760]   the creation of hood maps or like a working prototype,
[01:58:57.760 --> 01:59:01.600]   that there's just a constant frustration, I guess.
[01:59:01.600 --> 01:59:04.080]   It's like, oh, okay, how do I do this?
[01:59:04.080 --> 01:59:06.560]   And then you look it up and you're like, okay,
[01:59:06.560 --> 01:59:08.720]   you have to interpret the different options you have.
[01:59:08.720 --> 01:59:11.040]   And then just try it.
[01:59:11.040 --> 01:59:14.640]   And then there's a dopamine rush of like,
[01:59:14.640 --> 01:59:16.240]   ooh, it works, cool.
[01:59:16.240 --> 01:59:17.040]   - Man, it's amazing.
[01:59:17.040 --> 01:59:18.560]   And I live streamed it.
[01:59:18.560 --> 01:59:20.240]   It's on YouTube and stuff.
[01:59:20.240 --> 01:59:20.880]   People can watch it.
[01:59:20.880 --> 01:59:23.120]   And it's amazing when things work.
[01:59:23.120 --> 01:59:25.920]   Look, it's just like amazing that you,
[01:59:25.920 --> 01:59:27.600]   I look very not, I don't look far ahead.
[01:59:27.600 --> 01:59:29.360]   So I only look, okay, what's the next problem to solve?
[01:59:29.360 --> 01:59:30.160]   And then the next problem.
[01:59:30.800 --> 01:59:33.680]   And at the end, you have a whole app
[01:59:33.680 --> 01:59:35.120]   or a website or a thing, you know?
[01:59:35.120 --> 01:59:38.720]   But I think most people look way too far ahead.
[01:59:38.720 --> 01:59:40.880]   You know, they look, it's like this poster again.
[01:59:40.880 --> 01:59:42.960]   Like you shouldn't, you don't know how hard it's going to be.
[01:59:42.960 --> 01:59:44.640]   So you should only look like for the next thing,
[01:59:44.640 --> 01:59:47.120]   the next little challenge, the next step,
[01:59:47.120 --> 01:59:48.640]   and then see where you end up.
[01:59:48.640 --> 01:59:50.400]   - And assume it's going to be easy.
[01:59:50.400 --> 01:59:52.720]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:59:52.720 --> 01:59:54.480]   Be naive about it because it's,
[01:59:54.480 --> 01:59:56.240]   you're going to have very difficult problems.
[01:59:56.240 --> 01:59:59.040]   A lot of the big problems won't be even tech,
[01:59:59.040 --> 02:00:00.000]   will be like public, right?
[02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:01.280]   Like maybe people don't like your website.
[02:00:01.280 --> 02:00:04.800]   Like you will get canceled for a website, for example.
[02:00:04.800 --> 02:00:05.840]   Like a lot of things can happen.
[02:00:05.840 --> 02:00:08.560]   - What's it like building in public like you do?
[02:00:08.560 --> 02:00:12.160]   Like openly, where you're just iterating quickly
[02:00:12.160 --> 02:00:13.440]   and you're getting people's feedback.
[02:00:13.440 --> 02:00:15.280]   So there's the power of the crowdsourcing,
[02:00:15.280 --> 02:00:17.680]   but there's also the negative aspects
[02:00:17.680 --> 02:00:19.120]   of people being able to criticize.
[02:00:19.120 --> 02:00:22.080]   - So man, I think haters are actually good
[02:00:22.080 --> 02:00:24.160]   'cause I think a lot of haters have good points.
[02:00:24.160 --> 02:00:27.040]   And it takes like stepping away from the emotion of like,
[02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.320]   ah, your website sucks because blah, blah, blah.
[02:00:30.320 --> 02:00:31.520]   And you're like, okay, just remove this,
[02:00:31.520 --> 02:00:33.520]   your website sucks 'cause it's personal, you know?
[02:00:33.520 --> 02:00:34.160]   What did he say?
[02:00:34.160 --> 02:00:35.280]   Why did he not like it?
[02:00:35.280 --> 02:00:36.720]   And then you figure out, okay, he didn't like it
[02:00:36.720 --> 02:00:39.200]   'cause the signup was difficult or something,
[02:00:39.200 --> 02:00:40.320]   or it wasn't the data.
[02:00:40.320 --> 02:00:42.320]   They say, no, this data is not accurate or something, right?
[02:00:42.320 --> 02:00:43.680]   Okay, I need to improve the quality of the data.
[02:00:43.680 --> 02:00:44.720]   This hater has a point.
[02:00:44.720 --> 02:00:48.560]   I think it's dumb to completely ignore your haters, you know?
[02:00:48.560 --> 02:00:51.600]   And also, man, I think I've been there
[02:00:51.600 --> 02:00:52.960]   when I was like 10 years old or something.
[02:00:52.960 --> 02:00:55.280]   You're on the internet, you're just shouting crazy stuff.
[02:00:55.280 --> 02:00:56.640]   That's like most of Twitter, you know?
[02:00:56.640 --> 02:00:58.080]   Or half of Twitter.
[02:00:58.080 --> 02:00:59.760]   So you have to take it with a grain of salt.
[02:00:59.760 --> 02:01:04.160]   Yeah, man, you need to grow a very thick skin
[02:01:04.160 --> 02:01:05.840]   like on Twitter, on X.
[02:01:05.840 --> 02:01:08.480]   Like people say, but I mute a lot of people.
[02:01:08.480 --> 02:01:12.080]   Like I found out I muted already 15,000 people recently,
[02:01:12.080 --> 02:01:12.580]   I checked.
[02:01:12.580 --> 02:01:15.680]   So in 10 years, I muted 15,000 people.
[02:01:15.680 --> 02:01:16.240]   So that's like-
[02:01:16.240 --> 02:01:17.600]   - Like that's one by one manual?
[02:01:17.600 --> 02:01:18.160]   - 15, yeah.
[02:01:18.160 --> 02:01:19.040]   - Oh, wow.
[02:01:19.040 --> 02:01:20.640]   - So 1500 people per year.
[02:01:20.640 --> 02:01:22.320]   And I don't like to block
[02:01:22.320 --> 02:01:23.760]   'cause then they get angry, they make a screenshot
[02:01:23.760 --> 02:01:25.360]   and they say, ah, you blocked me.
[02:01:25.360 --> 02:01:27.360]   So I just mute and they disappear.
[02:01:27.360 --> 02:01:28.240]   And it's amazing.
[02:01:28.240 --> 02:01:30.160]   - So you mentioned Reddit.
[02:01:30.160 --> 02:01:34.080]   So hoodmaps, that make it to the front page of Reddit?
[02:01:34.080 --> 02:01:35.360]   - Yeah, yeah, it did.
[02:01:35.360 --> 02:01:36.640]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, it did.
[02:01:36.640 --> 02:01:37.520]   It was amazing.
[02:01:37.520 --> 02:01:39.760]   And my server almost went down
[02:01:39.760 --> 02:01:40.960]   and I was checking like Google Analytics.
[02:01:40.960 --> 02:01:43.120]   It's like 5,000 people on the website or something crazy.
[02:01:43.120 --> 02:01:45.120]   And it was at night and it was amazing.
[02:01:45.120 --> 02:01:49.040]   Man, I think nowadays, honestly, TikTok,
[02:01:49.040 --> 02:01:52.000]   YouTube reels, Instagram reels,
[02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.080]   a lot of apps get very big from people
[02:01:55.040 --> 02:01:56.560]   making TikTok videos about it.
[02:01:56.560 --> 02:01:58.960]   So let's say you make your own app.
[02:01:58.960 --> 02:02:00.240]   You can make a video of yourself.
[02:02:00.240 --> 02:02:01.280]   Like, oh, I made this app.
[02:02:01.280 --> 02:02:03.120]   This is how it works, blah, blah, blah.
[02:02:03.120 --> 02:02:05.840]   And this is why I made it, for example.
[02:02:05.840 --> 02:02:07.280]   And this is why you should use it.
[02:02:07.280 --> 02:02:08.800]   And if it's a good video, it will take off
[02:02:08.800 --> 02:02:13.680]   and you will get, man, I got like $20,000 extra per month
[02:02:13.680 --> 02:02:15.840]   or something from a TikTok, from one TikTok video.
[02:02:15.840 --> 02:02:17.760]   Like it made a photo guy.
[02:02:17.760 --> 02:02:19.120]   - By you or somebody else?
[02:02:19.120 --> 02:02:20.080]   - By some random guy.
[02:02:20.080 --> 02:02:21.520]   So there's all these AI influencers
[02:02:21.520 --> 02:02:23.760]   that they write about, they show AI apps
[02:02:23.760 --> 02:02:25.440]   and then they ask money later.
[02:02:25.440 --> 02:02:27.680]   Like when a video goes viral, all I can do is do it again
[02:02:27.680 --> 02:02:29.600]   and send me $4,000 or something.
[02:02:29.600 --> 02:02:31.600]   I'm like, okay, I did that, for example.
[02:02:31.600 --> 02:02:34.880]   But it works, like TikTok is a very big platform
[02:02:34.880 --> 02:02:38.480]   for user acquisition, yeah.
[02:02:38.480 --> 02:02:40.640]   And organic, like the best user acquisition
[02:02:40.640 --> 02:02:41.840]   I think is organic.
[02:02:41.840 --> 02:02:42.720]   You don't need to buy ads.
[02:02:42.720 --> 02:02:44.480]   You probably don't have money when you start to buy ads.
[02:02:44.480 --> 02:02:47.840]   So use organic or write a banger tweet, right?
[02:02:47.840 --> 02:02:50.160]   That's can make an app take off as well.
[02:02:50.160 --> 02:02:52.240]   - Well, I mean, yeah, fundamentally create cool stuff.
[02:02:52.960 --> 02:02:55.200]   - And have just a little bit of a following,
[02:02:55.200 --> 02:02:59.200]   enough to like, for the cool thing to be noticed
[02:02:59.200 --> 02:03:00.720]   and then it becomes viral if it's cool enough.
[02:03:00.720 --> 02:03:02.480]   - Yeah, and you don't need a lot of followers anymore
[02:03:02.480 --> 02:03:04.480]   'cause on X and a lot of platforms,
[02:03:04.480 --> 02:03:06.960]   'cause TikTok X, I think Instant Reels
[02:03:06.960 --> 02:03:08.560]   also they have the same algorithm now.
[02:03:08.560 --> 02:03:09.760]   It's not about followers anymore.
[02:03:09.760 --> 02:03:12.720]   It's about, they test your content on a small subset,
[02:03:12.720 --> 02:03:14.000]   like 300 people.
[02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.720]   If they like it, it gets tested to a thousand people
[02:03:16.720 --> 02:03:17.680]   and on and on.
[02:03:17.680 --> 02:03:20.480]   So if the thing is good, it will rise anyway.
[02:03:20.480 --> 02:03:22.400]   It doesn't matter if you have half a million followers
[02:03:22.400 --> 02:03:24.320]   or a thousand followers or a hundred.
[02:03:24.320 --> 02:03:25.920]   - What's your philosophy of monetizing?
[02:03:25.920 --> 02:03:27.360]   How to make money from the thing you build?
[02:03:27.360 --> 02:03:30.320]   - Yeah, so a lot of starters, they do like free users.
[02:03:30.320 --> 02:03:32.800]   So you could sign up, you could use an app for free,
[02:03:32.800 --> 02:03:35.840]   which is, it never worked for me well
[02:03:35.840 --> 02:03:39.280]   because I think free users generally don't convert.
[02:03:39.280 --> 02:03:41.200]   And I think if you have VC funding,
[02:03:41.200 --> 02:03:42.880]   it makes sense to get free users
[02:03:42.880 --> 02:03:44.400]   because you can spend your funding on ads
[02:03:44.400 --> 02:03:46.160]   and you can get like millions of people come in,
[02:03:46.160 --> 02:03:48.400]   predictably how much they convert
[02:03:48.400 --> 02:03:50.640]   and give them like a free trial or whatever
[02:03:50.640 --> 02:03:51.840]   and then they sign up.
[02:03:51.840 --> 02:03:53.920]   But you need to have that flow worked out so well
[02:03:53.920 --> 02:03:55.120]   for you to make it work
[02:03:55.120 --> 02:03:57.040]   that you need like, it's very difficult.
[02:03:57.040 --> 02:03:58.080]   I think it's best to start
[02:03:58.080 --> 02:04:01.680]   and just start asking people for money in the beginning.
[02:04:01.680 --> 02:04:03.200]   So show your app,
[02:04:03.200 --> 02:04:04.400]   like what are you doing on your landing page?
[02:04:04.400 --> 02:04:06.000]   Like make a demo or whatever, a video.
[02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.080]   And then if you want to use it, pay me money.
[02:04:08.080 --> 02:04:09.600]   Pay $10, $20, $30.
[02:04:09.600 --> 02:04:12.560]   I would ask more than $10 per month.
[02:04:12.560 --> 02:04:14.000]   Like Netflix is like $10 per month,
[02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:15.680]   but Netflix is a giant company that can,
[02:04:15.680 --> 02:04:18.560]   you know, they can afford to make it so cheap,
[02:04:18.560 --> 02:04:19.600]   relatively cheap.
[02:04:19.600 --> 02:04:21.200]   If you're an individual, like an indie hacker,
[02:04:21.200 --> 02:04:22.480]   like you are making your own app,
[02:04:22.480 --> 02:04:27.360]   you need to make like at least $30 or more on a user
[02:04:27.360 --> 02:04:29.920]   to make it worthy for you.
[02:04:29.920 --> 02:04:30.880]   You need to make money, you know?
[02:04:30.880 --> 02:04:32.960]   - And it builds a community of people
[02:04:32.960 --> 02:04:34.800]   that actually really care about the product.
[02:04:34.800 --> 02:04:36.080]   - Also, yeah, making a community,
[02:04:36.080 --> 02:04:37.680]   like making a Discord is very normal now.
[02:04:37.680 --> 02:04:38.960]   Every AI app has a Discord
[02:04:38.960 --> 02:04:41.200]   and you have the developers and the users together
[02:04:41.200 --> 02:04:42.880]   in like a Discord and they talk about,
[02:04:42.880 --> 02:04:44.240]   they ask for features, they build together.
[02:04:44.240 --> 02:04:45.440]   It's very normal now.
[02:04:45.440 --> 02:04:49.680]   And you need to imagine, like if you're starting out
[02:04:49.680 --> 02:04:52.400]   getting 1,000 users is quite difficult.
[02:04:52.400 --> 02:04:53.760]   Getting 1,000 pages is quite difficult.
[02:04:53.760 --> 02:04:57.680]   And if you charge them like $30, you have 30K a month.
[02:04:57.680 --> 02:04:58.480]   That's a lot of money.
[02:04:58.480 --> 02:05:00.000]   - That's enough to like...
[02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:01.040]   - Live a good life.
[02:05:01.040 --> 02:05:02.480]   - Yeah, live a pretty good life.
[02:05:02.480 --> 02:05:04.640]   I mean, that could be a lot of costs associated with hosting.
[02:05:04.640 --> 02:05:06.000]   - Yeah, so that's another thing.
[02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:07.760]   I make sure my profit margins are very high.
[02:05:07.760 --> 02:05:09.200]   So I try to keep the costs very low.
[02:05:09.200 --> 02:05:10.080]   I don't hire people.
[02:05:10.080 --> 02:05:15.280]   I try to negotiate with like AI vendors now.
[02:05:15.280 --> 02:05:17.280]   Like, can you make it cheaper, you know?
[02:05:17.280 --> 02:05:18.320]   Which is, I discovered this.
[02:05:18.320 --> 02:05:20.320]   You can just email companies and say,
[02:05:20.320 --> 02:05:23.360]   "Can you give me a discount 'cause it's too expensive?"
[02:05:23.360 --> 02:05:25.120]   And they say, "Sure, 50%."
[02:05:25.120 --> 02:05:26.320]   I'm like, "Wow, very good."
[02:05:26.320 --> 02:05:28.320]   And I didn't know this.
[02:05:28.320 --> 02:05:29.120]   You can just ask.
[02:05:29.120 --> 02:05:32.000]   And especially in like, now it's kind of recession.
[02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.640]   You can ask companies like, "I need a discount
[02:05:34.640 --> 02:05:35.760]   "or I kind of need to like..."
[02:05:35.760 --> 02:05:37.120]   You don't need to be asshole about it.
[02:05:37.120 --> 02:05:38.880]   Say, "I kind of need a discount
[02:05:38.880 --> 02:05:40.720]   "or I need to go maybe to another company.
[02:05:40.720 --> 02:05:42.960]   "Maybe like a discount here and there."
[02:05:42.960 --> 02:05:43.920]   And they say, "Sure."
[02:05:43.920 --> 02:05:44.960]   A lot of them will say, "Yes."
[02:05:44.960 --> 02:05:47.120]   Like 25% discount, 50% discounts.
[02:05:47.120 --> 02:05:49.920]   'Cause you think the price on the website
[02:05:49.920 --> 02:05:51.520]   is the price of the API or something.
[02:05:51.520 --> 02:05:53.200]   It's not, like, you know?
[02:05:53.200 --> 02:05:55.680]   - And also you're a public facing person.
[02:05:55.680 --> 02:05:57.040]   - Oh, that helps also.
[02:05:57.040 --> 02:05:58.640]   - And there's love and good vibes
[02:05:58.640 --> 02:05:59.520]   that you put out into the world.
[02:05:59.520 --> 02:06:02.560]   Like you're actually legitimately trying to build cool stuff.
[02:06:02.560 --> 02:06:05.360]   So a lot of companies probably wanna associate with you
[02:06:05.360 --> 02:06:06.240]   because you're trying to do-
[02:06:06.240 --> 02:06:07.600]   - Yeah, it's like a secret hack.
[02:06:07.600 --> 02:06:08.640]   But I think even without-
[02:06:08.640 --> 02:06:10.080]   - Secret hack, be a good person.
[02:06:10.080 --> 02:06:11.840]   - It depends how much discount they will give, you know?
[02:06:11.840 --> 02:06:12.720]   They'll maybe give more.
[02:06:12.720 --> 02:06:15.200]   But you know, that's why you should shitpost on Twitter.
[02:06:15.200 --> 02:06:17.200]   So you get, you know, discounts, maybe.
[02:06:17.200 --> 02:06:19.440]   (both laugh)
[02:06:19.440 --> 02:06:20.320]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:06:20.320 --> 02:06:24.000]   But, and also the, when it's crowdsourced,
[02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:29.280]   I mean, paying does prevent spam or help prevent spam.
[02:06:29.280 --> 02:06:30.000]   - Also, yeah.
[02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:31.360]   It gives you high quality users.
[02:06:31.360 --> 02:06:32.000]   - High quality users.
[02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.880]   - And free users are, sorry, but they're horrible.
[02:06:34.880 --> 02:06:36.800]   Like, it's just like millions of people,
[02:06:36.800 --> 02:06:38.560]   especially with AI startups, you get a lot of abuse.
[02:06:38.560 --> 02:06:40.560]   So you get millions of people from anywhere
[02:06:40.560 --> 02:06:43.920]   just abusing your app, just hacking it and whatever.
[02:06:43.920 --> 02:06:45.920]   - There's something on the internet.
[02:06:45.920 --> 02:06:48.960]   You mentioned like 4chan discovered hood maps.
[02:06:48.960 --> 02:06:50.640]   - Yeah, but I love 4chan.
[02:06:50.640 --> 02:06:51.760]   I don't love 4chan, but you know what I mean?
[02:06:51.760 --> 02:06:53.680]   Like, they're so crazy, especially back then.
[02:06:53.680 --> 02:06:57.120]   Like, that's, it's kind of funny what they do, you know?
[02:06:57.120 --> 02:07:00.000]   - I actually, what is it?
[02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:01.680]   There's a new documentary on Netflix,
[02:07:01.680 --> 02:07:03.360]   Anti-Social Network or something like that.
[02:07:03.360 --> 02:07:04.880]   That was really, was fascinating.
[02:07:04.880 --> 02:07:08.720]   Just 4chan, just the, you know, the spirit of the thing,
[02:07:08.720 --> 02:07:09.200]   4chan and-
[02:07:09.200 --> 02:07:10.560]   - People misunderstand 4chan.
[02:07:10.560 --> 02:07:14.320]   - It's so much about freedom and also like the humor
[02:07:14.320 --> 02:07:18.560]   involved in fucking with the system and fucking with man.
[02:07:18.560 --> 02:07:20.800]   - That's it, it's just anti-system for fun.
[02:07:20.800 --> 02:07:24.800]   - But the dark aspect of it is you're having fun,
[02:07:24.800 --> 02:07:27.280]   you're doing anti-system stuff,
[02:07:27.280 --> 02:07:30.240]   but like the Nazis always show up.
[02:07:30.240 --> 02:07:30.880]   And it's somehow-
[02:07:30.880 --> 02:07:31.920]   - And the bad shit started happening.
[02:07:31.920 --> 02:07:33.680]   - It's drifting somehow, yeah.
[02:07:33.680 --> 02:07:34.880]   - Like school shootings and stuff.
[02:07:34.880 --> 02:07:38.320]   So it's a very difficult topic, but I do know it's,
[02:07:39.360 --> 02:07:40.960]   especially early on, I think 2010,
[02:07:40.960 --> 02:07:42.320]   I would go to 4chan for fun
[02:07:42.320 --> 02:07:44.480]   and they would post like crazy offensive stuff.
[02:07:44.480 --> 02:07:46.240]   And this was just to scare off people.
[02:07:46.240 --> 02:07:47.280]   So we showed to other people, say,
[02:07:47.280 --> 02:07:48.960]   "Hey, do you know this internet website, 4chan?
[02:07:48.960 --> 02:07:49.600]   Just check it out."
[02:07:49.600 --> 02:07:50.160]   - Yeah.
[02:07:50.160 --> 02:07:51.600]   - And they'd be, "But dude, what the fuck is that?"
[02:07:51.600 --> 02:07:52.800]   I'm like, "No, no, you don't understand."
[02:07:52.800 --> 02:07:53.120]   - Yeah.
[02:07:53.120 --> 02:07:54.160]   - That's to scare you away.
[02:07:54.160 --> 02:07:55.520]   But actually when you go through a scroll,
[02:07:55.520 --> 02:07:56.640]   there's like deep conversations.
[02:07:56.640 --> 02:07:57.280]   - Yes.
[02:07:57.280 --> 02:07:58.720]   - And they would already be,
[02:07:58.720 --> 02:08:00.560]   this was like a normie filter, like to stop.
[02:08:00.560 --> 02:08:00.880]   - Yeah.
[02:08:00.880 --> 02:08:02.880]   - So kind of cool, but yeah.
[02:08:02.880 --> 02:08:03.840]   - It goes dark.
[02:08:03.840 --> 02:08:05.120]   - It goes dark, yeah.
[02:08:05.120 --> 02:08:06.880]   - And if you have those people show up,
[02:08:06.880 --> 02:08:08.720]   they'll, for the fun of it,
[02:08:08.720 --> 02:08:09.840]   do a bunch of racist things
[02:08:09.840 --> 02:08:10.960]   and all that kind of stuff you were saying.
[02:08:10.960 --> 02:08:12.880]   - But everything's, I think it was never,
[02:08:12.880 --> 02:08:13.760]   man, I'm not a fortune,
[02:08:13.760 --> 02:08:15.760]   but like it was always about provoking.
[02:08:15.760 --> 02:08:17.200]   It's just provocateurs, you know?
[02:08:17.200 --> 02:08:19.760]   - But the provoking in the case of hood maps
[02:08:19.760 --> 02:08:25.280]   or something like this can damage the good thing.
[02:08:25.280 --> 02:08:29.520]   Like, you know, a little poison in a town is always good.
[02:08:29.520 --> 02:08:30.960]   It's like the Tom Waits thing,
[02:08:30.960 --> 02:08:32.240]   but you don't want too much.
[02:08:32.240 --> 02:08:34.080]   Otherwise it destroys the town.
[02:08:34.080 --> 02:08:34.800]   It destroys the thing.
[02:08:34.800 --> 02:08:36.240]   - They're kind of like pen testers, you know,
[02:08:36.240 --> 02:08:37.680]   like penetration testers, hackers.
[02:08:37.680 --> 02:08:38.000]   - Yeah.
[02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:39.760]   - They just test your app for you
[02:08:39.760 --> 02:08:40.800]   and then you add some stuff.
[02:08:40.800 --> 02:08:44.960]   Like I add like a NSFW word list.
[02:08:44.960 --> 02:08:46.080]   They would say like bad words.
[02:08:46.080 --> 02:08:48.720]   So when they would write like a bad words,
[02:08:48.720 --> 02:08:50.400]   they would get forwarded to YouTube,
[02:08:50.400 --> 02:08:51.360]   which was like a video.
[02:08:51.360 --> 02:08:54.400]   It was like a very relaxing video
[02:08:54.400 --> 02:08:57.600]   that's like kind of ASMR with like glowing jelly,
[02:08:57.600 --> 02:08:59.600]   streaming like this to relax them, you know?
[02:08:59.600 --> 02:09:01.360]   Or cheese melting on the toast.
[02:09:01.360 --> 02:09:01.840]   - Cheese melting, nice.
[02:09:01.840 --> 02:09:02.880]   - To chill them out.
[02:09:02.880 --> 02:09:03.760]   - Yeah, I like it.
[02:09:03.760 --> 02:09:05.040]   - And like, yeah.
[02:09:05.040 --> 02:09:06.400]   But actually a lot of stuff,
[02:09:06.400 --> 02:09:08.800]   I didn't realize how much originated in 4chan
[02:09:08.800 --> 02:09:09.600]   in terms of memes.
[02:09:09.600 --> 02:09:12.000]   Rickroll, I didn't understand.
[02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.400]   I didn't know that Rickroll originated in 4chan.
[02:09:14.400 --> 02:09:15.600]   Like there's so many memes.
[02:09:15.600 --> 02:09:17.120]   Like most of the memes that you think-
[02:09:17.120 --> 02:09:18.960]   - The word roll, I think, comes from 4chan.
[02:09:18.960 --> 02:09:19.680]   Like not the word roll,
[02:09:19.680 --> 02:09:21.600]   but like in this case, in the meme use,
[02:09:21.600 --> 02:09:24.080]   like you would get like roll doubles
[02:09:24.080 --> 02:09:26.960]   'cause every, there was like post IDs on 4chan.
[02:09:26.960 --> 02:09:29.040]   So they were kind of like random.
[02:09:29.040 --> 02:09:31.760]   So if I get doubles, like this happens or something.
[02:09:31.760 --> 02:09:32.880]   So you'd get like two, two.
[02:09:33.760 --> 02:09:35.120]   Anyway, it's like a betting market
[02:09:35.120 --> 02:09:37.120]   kind of on these doubles, on these post IDs.
[02:09:37.120 --> 02:09:38.240]   It's so much funny stuff.
[02:09:38.240 --> 02:09:41.360]   - Yeah, I mean, that's the internet that's purest.
[02:09:41.360 --> 02:09:44.000]   But yeah, again, the dark stuff kind of seeps in.
[02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:44.240]   - Yeah.
[02:09:44.240 --> 02:09:47.040]   - And it's nice to keep the dark stuff
[02:09:47.040 --> 02:09:49.040]   to like some low amount.
[02:09:49.040 --> 02:09:51.120]   It's nice to have a bit of noise in the darkness,
[02:09:51.120 --> 02:09:51.920]   but not too much.
[02:09:51.920 --> 02:09:52.480]   - Yeah.
[02:09:52.480 --> 02:09:55.040]   - And, but again, like you have to pay attention
[02:09:55.040 --> 02:09:58.080]   to that with, I mean, I guess spam in general.
[02:09:58.080 --> 02:09:59.920]   You have to fight that with Nomad List.
[02:09:59.920 --> 02:10:00.880]   How do you fight spam?
[02:10:00.880 --> 02:10:02.640]   - Man, I use GPT-4 now.
[02:10:02.640 --> 02:10:03.200]   It's amazing.
[02:10:03.200 --> 02:10:07.200]   So I have like user input.
[02:10:07.200 --> 02:10:08.160]   I have reviews.
[02:10:08.160 --> 02:10:09.280]   People can review cities
[02:10:09.280 --> 02:10:10.560]   and they don't need to actually sign up.
[02:10:10.560 --> 02:10:12.080]   It's anonymous reviews.
[02:10:12.080 --> 02:10:14.080]   And they write like whole books about like seas
[02:10:14.080 --> 02:10:14.960]   and what's good and bad.
[02:10:14.960 --> 02:10:18.320]   So I run it through GPT-4 now.
[02:10:18.320 --> 02:10:20.240]   And I asked like, is this a, you know,
[02:10:20.240 --> 02:10:21.120]   is this a good review?
[02:10:21.120 --> 02:10:22.240]   Like, is it offensive?
[02:10:22.240 --> 02:10:23.760]   Is it racist or some stuff?
[02:10:23.760 --> 02:10:25.760]   And then it sends me a message on Telegram
[02:10:25.760 --> 02:10:28.240]   when it rejects reviews and I check it.
[02:10:28.240 --> 02:10:31.040]   And it's, man, it's so on point.
[02:10:31.040 --> 02:10:31.680]   - Automated.
[02:10:31.680 --> 02:10:33.360]   - Yes, and it's so accurate.
[02:10:33.360 --> 02:10:34.720]   It understands double meanings.
[02:10:34.720 --> 02:10:39.120]   I have GPT-4 running on the chat community.
[02:10:39.120 --> 02:10:41.120]   It's a chat community of 10,000 people
[02:10:41.120 --> 02:10:41.760]   and they're chatting
[02:10:41.760 --> 02:10:43.120]   and they start fighting with each other.
[02:10:43.120 --> 02:10:47.440]   And I used to have, human moderators was very good
[02:10:47.440 --> 02:10:49.280]   but they would start fighting the human moderator.
[02:10:49.280 --> 02:10:51.120]   Like this guy is biased or something.
[02:10:51.120 --> 02:10:55.520]   Now I have GPT-4 and it's really, really, really, really good.
[02:10:55.520 --> 02:10:56.480]   It understands humor.
[02:10:56.480 --> 02:10:59.600]   It understands like, like you could say something bad
[02:10:59.600 --> 02:11:00.560]   but it's kind of like a joke
[02:11:00.560 --> 02:11:02.880]   and it's kind of not like offensive so much.
[02:11:02.880 --> 02:11:04.640]   So it shouldn't be deleted, right?
[02:11:04.640 --> 02:11:06.240]   It understands that, you know?
[02:11:06.240 --> 02:11:10.800]   - I would love to have a GPT-4 based filter
[02:11:10.800 --> 02:11:15.040]   of different kinds of, for like X.
[02:11:15.040 --> 02:11:18.080]   - Yeah, I thought this week, I tweeted like a fact check.
[02:11:18.080 --> 02:11:20.560]   Like you can click fact check and then GPT-4.
[02:11:20.560 --> 02:11:22.880]   Look, GPT-4 is not always right about stuff, right?
[02:11:22.880 --> 02:11:26.000]   But it can give you a general fact check on a tweet.
[02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:27.680]   Like usually what I do now,
[02:11:27.680 --> 02:11:29.840]   when I write something like difficult about economics
[02:11:29.840 --> 02:11:31.920]   or something like AI, I put in GPT-4, I say,
[02:11:31.920 --> 02:11:32.720]   "Can you fact check it?"
[02:11:32.720 --> 02:11:34.880]   'Cause I might've said something stupid
[02:11:34.880 --> 02:11:37.600]   and the stupid stuff always gets taken out by the replies.
[02:11:37.600 --> 02:11:38.960]   Like, "Oh, you said this wrong."
[02:11:38.960 --> 02:11:41.200]   And then the whole tweet kind of doesn't make sense anymore.
[02:11:41.200 --> 02:11:44.800]   So I asked GPT-4 to fact check a lot of stuff.
[02:11:44.800 --> 02:11:46.320]   - So fact check is a tough one.
[02:11:46.320 --> 02:11:47.760]   - Yeah. - But it would be interesting
[02:11:47.760 --> 02:11:53.760]   to sort of rate a thing based on how well thought out it is
[02:11:53.760 --> 02:11:55.520]   and how well argued it is.
[02:11:55.520 --> 02:11:57.920]   - Yeah. - That seems more doable.
[02:11:57.920 --> 02:11:59.120]   That seems like more doable.
[02:11:59.120 --> 02:12:00.480]   Like it seems like a GPT thing
[02:12:00.480 --> 02:12:02.160]   because it's less about the truth
[02:12:02.160 --> 02:12:03.840]   and it's more about the rigor of the thing.
[02:12:03.840 --> 02:12:04.400]   - Exactly.
[02:12:04.400 --> 02:12:05.280]   And you can ask that.
[02:12:05.280 --> 02:12:07.760]   You can ask in the prompt, like, I don't know.
[02:12:07.760 --> 02:12:08.640]   Like, for example, do you think,
[02:12:08.640 --> 02:12:12.640]   create like a ranking score of X Twitter replies
[02:12:12.640 --> 02:12:13.920]   where should this post be?
[02:12:13.920 --> 02:12:17.920]   If we rank on like, I don't know, integrity, reality,
[02:12:17.920 --> 02:12:21.040]   like fundamental deepness or something, interestness.
[02:12:21.040 --> 02:12:24.640]   And it will give you that pretty good score probably.
[02:12:24.640 --> 02:12:26.800]   I mean, Elon can do this with Grok, right?
[02:12:26.800 --> 02:12:30.560]   He can start doing, using that to check replies
[02:12:30.560 --> 02:12:32.080]   'cause the reply section is like chaos.
[02:12:32.080 --> 02:12:33.120]   - Yeah. - You know?
[02:12:33.120 --> 02:12:34.720]   - And actually the ranking of the replies
[02:12:34.720 --> 02:12:36.320]   - Doesn't make any sense. - Doesn't make sense.
[02:12:36.320 --> 02:12:38.560]   - No. - And I would like to sort
[02:12:38.560 --> 02:12:39.600]   in different kinds of ways.
[02:12:39.600 --> 02:12:41.280]   - Yeah, and you get too many replies now.
[02:12:41.280 --> 02:12:42.800]   If you have a lot of followers, I get too many replies.
[02:12:42.800 --> 02:12:43.520]   I don't see everything.
[02:12:43.520 --> 02:12:46.880]   And I, a lot of stuff I just miss
[02:12:46.880 --> 02:12:48.400]   and I don't, I wanna see the good stuff.
[02:12:48.400 --> 02:12:51.360]   - And also the notifications or whatever
[02:12:51.360 --> 02:12:52.640]   is just complete chaos.
[02:12:52.640 --> 02:12:53.920]   - Yeah. - It'd be nice to be able
[02:12:53.920 --> 02:12:55.760]   to filter that in interesting ways,
[02:12:55.760 --> 02:12:56.960]   sort it in interesting ways.
[02:12:56.960 --> 02:13:00.640]   'Cause like, I feel like I miss a lot.
[02:13:00.640 --> 02:13:03.440]   And I, what's surfaced for me,
[02:13:03.440 --> 02:13:04.800]   I was just like a random comment
[02:13:04.800 --> 02:13:06.960]   by a person with no followers.
[02:13:06.960 --> 02:13:08.560]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - That's positive or negative.
[02:13:08.560 --> 02:13:09.200]   It's like, okay.
[02:13:09.200 --> 02:13:11.040]   - If it's a very good comment, it should happen,
[02:13:11.040 --> 02:13:13.680]   but it should probably look a little bit more like,
[02:13:13.680 --> 02:13:14.640]   do these people have followers?
[02:13:14.640 --> 02:13:17.040]   'Cause they're probably more engaged in the platform, right?
[02:13:17.040 --> 02:13:19.840]   - Oh no, if it's, I don't even care about having followers.
[02:13:19.840 --> 02:13:22.320]   If you're ranking by the quality of the comment, great.
[02:13:22.320 --> 02:13:24.800]   - Yeah. - But not just like randomly,
[02:13:24.800 --> 02:13:27.680]   like chronological, just a sea of comments.
[02:13:27.680 --> 02:13:28.640]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:13:28.640 --> 02:13:30.080]   It doesn't make sense. - Yeah.
[02:13:30.080 --> 02:13:32.720]   - Yeah, X could be very improved with that, I think.
[02:13:32.720 --> 02:13:36.320]   - One thing you espouse a lot, which I love,
[02:13:36.320 --> 02:13:37.840]   is the automation step.
[02:13:37.840 --> 02:13:40.000]   So like once you have a thing,
[02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.720]   once you have an idea and you build it,
[02:13:42.720 --> 02:13:44.720]   and it actually starts making money
[02:13:44.720 --> 02:13:46.320]   and it's making people happy,
[02:13:46.320 --> 02:13:47.920]   there's a community of people using it,
[02:13:47.920 --> 02:13:51.600]   you want to take the automation step
[02:13:51.600 --> 02:13:52.800]   of automating the things.
[02:13:52.800 --> 02:13:54.480]   You have to do as little work as possible
[02:13:54.480 --> 02:13:56.240]   for it to keep running indefinitely.
[02:13:56.240 --> 02:13:59.440]   Can you explain your philosophy there?
[02:13:59.440 --> 02:14:00.480]   What do you mean by automate?
[02:14:00.480 --> 02:14:03.040]   - Yeah, so the general theory of starters would be
[02:14:03.040 --> 02:14:05.440]   that when it starts, you start making money,
[02:14:05.440 --> 02:14:07.200]   you start hiring people to do stuff, right?
[02:14:07.200 --> 02:14:09.040]   Do stuff that you, like marketing, for example,
[02:14:09.040 --> 02:14:10.560]   stuff that you would do in the beginning yourself.
[02:14:10.560 --> 02:14:14.160]   And whatever, community management
[02:14:14.160 --> 02:14:16.400]   and organizing meetups for Nomad List, for example,
[02:14:16.400 --> 02:14:18.560]   that would be a job, for example.
[02:14:18.560 --> 02:14:21.760]   And I felt like I don't have the money for that
[02:14:21.760 --> 02:14:24.640]   and I don't really want to run like a big company
[02:14:24.640 --> 02:14:25.280]   with a lot of people
[02:14:25.280 --> 02:14:27.040]   'cause it's a lot of work managing these people.
[02:14:27.040 --> 02:14:29.600]   So I've always tried to like automate these things
[02:14:29.600 --> 02:14:30.640]   as much as possible.
[02:14:30.640 --> 02:14:35.200]   And this can literally be like for Nomad List,
[02:14:35.200 --> 02:14:36.240]   it's literally like a,
[02:14:36.240 --> 02:14:37.280]   it's not a different other starters,
[02:14:37.280 --> 02:14:38.080]   but it's like a webpage
[02:14:38.080 --> 02:14:39.280]   where you can organize your own meetup,
[02:14:39.280 --> 02:14:41.920]   set a schedule, a date, whatever.
[02:14:41.920 --> 02:14:44.160]   You can see how many Nomads will be there at that date.
[02:14:44.160 --> 02:14:45.520]   So you know, there will be actually
[02:14:45.520 --> 02:14:46.960]   enough Nomads to meet up, right?
[02:14:46.960 --> 02:14:49.440]   And then when it's done,
[02:14:49.440 --> 02:14:51.440]   it sends a tweet out on the Nomad List account.
[02:14:51.440 --> 02:14:52.800]   There's a meetup here.
[02:14:52.800 --> 02:14:54.800]   It sends a direct message to everybody in the city
[02:14:54.800 --> 02:14:57.120]   who are there, who are going to be there.
[02:14:57.120 --> 02:14:59.280]   And then people show up on a bar and there's a meetup
[02:14:59.280 --> 02:15:00.320]   and that's fully automated.
[02:15:00.320 --> 02:15:02.720]   And for me, it's like, it's not,
[02:15:02.720 --> 02:15:04.640]   it's so obvious to make this automatic.
[02:15:04.640 --> 02:15:07.360]   Why would you, why would you have somebody organize this?
[02:15:07.360 --> 02:15:10.080]   Like it makes more sense to automate it.
[02:15:10.080 --> 02:15:11.200]   And this with most of my things,
[02:15:11.200 --> 02:15:13.600]   like I figure out like how to do it with code.
[02:15:13.600 --> 02:15:15.920]   And I think, especially now with AI,
[02:15:15.920 --> 02:15:18.400]   like you can automate so much more stuff than before.
[02:15:18.400 --> 02:15:20.880]   'Cause AI understands things so well.
[02:15:20.880 --> 02:15:22.800]   Like before I would use if statements, right?
[02:15:22.800 --> 02:15:26.080]   Now you ask GPT, you put something in GPT for an API
[02:15:26.080 --> 02:15:28.560]   and it sends back like, this is good, this is bad.
[02:15:28.560 --> 02:15:32.400]   - Yeah, so you basically can now even automate
[02:15:32.400 --> 02:15:35.040]   sort of subjective type of things.
[02:15:35.040 --> 02:15:36.000]   - This is the difference now.
[02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:36.320]   - Yeah.
[02:15:36.320 --> 02:15:37.520]   - And that's very recent, right?
[02:15:37.520 --> 02:15:39.680]   - But it's still difficult though.
[02:15:39.680 --> 02:15:42.000]   I mean, that step of automation is difficult
[02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.400]   to figure out how to,
[02:15:44.400 --> 02:15:47.840]   is you're basically delegating everything to code.
[02:15:47.840 --> 02:15:50.080]   And it's not trivial to take that step
[02:15:50.080 --> 02:15:50.880]   for a lot of people.
[02:15:50.880 --> 02:15:52.880]   So when you say automate,
[02:15:52.880 --> 02:15:55.920]   are you talking about like Cron jobs?
[02:15:55.920 --> 02:15:57.360]   - Yes, man, a lot of Cron jobs.
[02:15:57.360 --> 02:15:58.560]   - A lot of Cron jobs.
[02:15:58.560 --> 02:16:02.240]   - It's like, I literally, I log into the server
[02:16:02.240 --> 02:16:05.040]   and I do like pseudo Cron tab dash E.
[02:16:05.040 --> 02:16:07.760]   And then I go into the editor and I write like hourly
[02:16:07.760 --> 02:16:12.800]   and then I write PHP, you know, do this thing dot PHP.
[02:16:12.800 --> 02:16:15.040]   And that's a script and that script does a thing
[02:16:15.040 --> 02:16:17.520]   and it does it then hourly, that's it.
[02:16:17.520 --> 02:16:18.880]   And that's how all my websites work.
[02:16:18.880 --> 02:16:21.120]   - Do you have a thing where it like emails you
[02:16:21.120 --> 02:16:21.920]   or something like this,
[02:16:21.920 --> 02:16:23.520]   or email somebody managing the thing
[02:16:23.520 --> 02:16:24.400]   if something goes wrong?
[02:16:24.400 --> 02:16:26.400]   - I have these webpages I make,
[02:16:26.400 --> 02:16:27.920]   they're called like health checks.
[02:16:27.920 --> 02:16:29.840]   So it's like healthcheck.php.
[02:16:29.840 --> 02:16:31.200]   And then it has like emojis,
[02:16:31.200 --> 02:16:33.840]   like it has like a green check mark if it's good
[02:16:33.840 --> 02:16:34.960]   and a red one if it's bad.
[02:16:34.960 --> 02:16:37.680]   And then it does like database queries, for example,
[02:16:37.680 --> 02:16:40.560]   like what's the internet speed in, for example, Amsterdam.
[02:16:40.560 --> 02:16:43.760]   Okay, it's a number, it's like 27 point megabits.
[02:16:43.760 --> 02:16:45.120]   So it's an accurate number.
[02:16:45.120 --> 02:16:46.080]   Okay, check, good.
[02:16:46.080 --> 02:16:46.800]   And then it goes to the next
[02:16:46.800 --> 02:16:48.400]   and it goes on all the data points.
[02:16:49.120 --> 02:16:51.120]   Did people sign up in the last 24 hours?
[02:16:51.120 --> 02:16:53.040]   It's important 'cause maybe the signup broke.
[02:16:53.040 --> 02:16:54.400]   Okay, check, somebody sign up.
[02:16:54.400 --> 02:16:57.680]   Then I have uptimerobot.com, which is like for uptime,
[02:16:57.680 --> 02:16:59.040]   but it can also check keywords.
[02:16:59.040 --> 02:17:02.720]   It checks for an emoji, which is like the red X,
[02:17:02.720 --> 02:17:04.000]   which is if something is bad.
[02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:07.200]   And so it opens that health check page every minute
[02:17:07.200 --> 02:17:08.480]   to check if something's bad.
[02:17:08.480 --> 02:17:10.960]   Then if it's bad, it sends a message to me on Telegram
[02:17:10.960 --> 02:17:12.960]   saying, "Hey, what's up?"
[02:17:12.960 --> 02:17:13.840]   Or it doesn't say, "Hey, what's up?"
[02:17:13.840 --> 02:17:15.120]   It sends me like an alert.
[02:17:15.120 --> 02:17:16.400]   - Hey, hey sweetie.
[02:17:16.400 --> 02:17:17.200]   - This thing is down.
[02:17:17.200 --> 02:17:17.680]   And then I check.
[02:17:17.680 --> 02:17:19.680]   So within a minute of something breaking,
[02:17:19.680 --> 02:17:22.720]   I know it and then I can open my laptop and fix it.
[02:17:22.720 --> 02:17:23.040]   - Yeah.
[02:17:23.040 --> 02:17:25.280]   - But the good thing is like the last few years,
[02:17:25.280 --> 02:17:26.720]   things don't break anymore.
[02:17:26.720 --> 02:17:29.360]   And like definitely 10 years ago when I started,
[02:17:29.360 --> 02:17:30.720]   everything was breaking all the time.
[02:17:30.720 --> 02:17:32.320]   And now it's like almost,
[02:17:32.320 --> 02:17:36.240]   last week was like 100.000% uptime.
[02:17:36.240 --> 02:17:39.360]   And these health checks are part of the uptime percentage.
[02:17:39.360 --> 02:17:41.200]   So it's like everything works.
[02:17:41.200 --> 02:17:42.640]   - You're actually making me realize
[02:17:42.640 --> 02:17:45.440]   I should have a page for myself,
[02:17:46.080 --> 02:17:49.760]   like one page that has all the health checks,
[02:17:49.760 --> 02:17:52.160]   just so I can go to it and see all the green check marks.
[02:17:52.160 --> 02:17:53.520]   - Yeah, it feels good to look at, you know.
[02:17:53.520 --> 02:17:54.720]   - It's just be like, "Okay."
[02:17:54.720 --> 02:17:55.360]   - Yeah, all right.
[02:17:55.360 --> 02:17:57.680]   - Like, "We're okay. Everything's okay."
[02:17:57.680 --> 02:17:58.320]   - Yeah.
[02:17:58.320 --> 02:18:00.800]   - And like you can see like when was the last time
[02:18:00.800 --> 02:18:04.400]   something wasn't okay and it'll say like, "Never."
[02:18:04.400 --> 02:18:06.720]   Or like meaning like you've checked.
[02:18:06.720 --> 02:18:09.600]   Since you've last cared to check,
[02:18:09.600 --> 02:18:10.720]   it has all been okay.
[02:18:10.720 --> 02:18:11.520]   - For sure.
[02:18:11.520 --> 02:18:13.440]   It used to send me the good health checks.
[02:18:13.440 --> 02:18:15.360]   Like, you know, it all works.
[02:18:15.360 --> 02:18:18.080]   - But it's been so often.
[02:18:18.080 --> 02:18:19.280]   - And I'm like, "This feels so good."
[02:18:19.280 --> 02:18:21.280]   But then I'm like, "Okay, obviously it's not gonna,
[02:18:21.280 --> 02:18:23.440]   "you need to hide the good ones and show only the bad ones."
[02:18:23.440 --> 02:18:24.320]   And now that's the case.
[02:18:24.320 --> 02:18:26.880]   - I need to integrate everything into one place.
[02:18:26.880 --> 02:18:28.000]   Automate like everything.
[02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:28.320]   - Yeah.
[02:18:28.320 --> 02:18:32.800]   - To have also just a large set of cron jobs.
[02:18:32.800 --> 02:18:34.560]   A lot of the publication of this podcast
[02:18:34.560 --> 02:18:37.840]   is done all, everything is just on automatically.
[02:18:37.840 --> 02:18:40.000]   It's all clipped up, all this kind of stuff.
[02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:41.120]   - Yeah.
[02:18:41.120 --> 02:18:42.800]   - But it'd be nice to automate even more.
[02:18:42.800 --> 02:18:43.520]   - Yeah.
[02:18:43.760 --> 02:18:45.440]   - Like a translation, all this kind of stuff
[02:18:45.440 --> 02:18:46.320]   would be nice to automate.
[02:18:46.320 --> 02:18:46.880]   - Yeah.
[02:18:46.880 --> 02:18:48.480]   Every JavaScript, every PHP error
[02:18:48.480 --> 02:18:50.080]   gets sent to my Telegram as well.
[02:18:50.080 --> 02:18:52.320]   So every user, whatever user it is,
[02:18:52.320 --> 02:18:53.840]   doesn't have to be page user.
[02:18:53.840 --> 02:18:54.960]   If they run into an error,
[02:18:54.960 --> 02:18:59.680]   the JavaScript sends the JavaScript error to the server
[02:18:59.680 --> 02:19:01.200]   and then it sends to my Telegram.
[02:19:01.200 --> 02:19:03.280]   From all my websites.
[02:19:03.280 --> 02:19:05.120]   - So you get like a message.
[02:19:05.120 --> 02:19:08.240]   - So I get like a uncaught variable error,
[02:19:08.240 --> 02:19:09.280]   whatever, blah, blah, blah.
[02:19:09.280 --> 02:19:10.400]   And then I'm like, "Okay, interesting."
[02:19:10.400 --> 02:19:11.920]   And then I go check it out.
[02:19:11.920 --> 02:19:13.600]   And that's like a way to get to zero errors
[02:19:13.600 --> 02:19:15.520]   'cause you get flooded with errors in the beginning.
[02:19:15.520 --> 02:19:17.760]   And now it's like nothing almost.
[02:19:17.760 --> 02:19:20.080]   - Oh, that's really cool.
[02:19:20.080 --> 02:19:20.560]   - But Matt--
[02:19:20.560 --> 02:19:21.440]   - That's really cool.
[02:19:21.440 --> 02:19:22.960]   - But this is the same stuff people,
[02:19:22.960 --> 02:19:26.880]   they pay like very big SaaS companies,
[02:19:26.880 --> 02:19:28.240]   like New Relic for, right?
[02:19:28.240 --> 02:19:29.760]   Like to manage the stuff.
[02:19:29.760 --> 02:19:31.360]   So you can do that too.
[02:19:31.360 --> 02:19:32.320]   You can use off the shelf.
[02:19:32.320 --> 02:19:33.840]   I like to build myself, it's easier.
[02:19:33.840 --> 02:19:34.800]   - Yeah, it's nice.
[02:19:34.800 --> 02:19:36.240]   It's nice to do that kind of automation.
[02:19:36.240 --> 02:19:38.320]   I'm starting to think of like,
[02:19:38.320 --> 02:19:40.160]   what are the things in my life I'm doing myself
[02:19:40.160 --> 02:19:41.120]   that could be automated?
[02:19:42.080 --> 02:19:43.920]   - You can ask your GPT, you know?
[02:19:43.920 --> 02:19:45.680]   Like give your daily, your day
[02:19:45.680 --> 02:19:47.360]   and then ask what parts you'd automate.
[02:19:47.360 --> 02:19:50.240]   - Well, one of the things I would love to automate more
[02:19:50.240 --> 02:19:51.840]   is my consumption on social media.
[02:19:51.840 --> 02:19:52.400]   - Yeah.
[02:19:52.400 --> 02:19:55.040]   - Both the output and the input.
[02:19:55.040 --> 02:19:56.320]   - Man, that's very interesting.
[02:19:56.320 --> 02:19:57.680]   I think there's some startups that do that.
[02:19:57.680 --> 02:20:01.440]   Like they summarize the cool shit happening on Twitter,
[02:20:01.440 --> 02:20:02.240]   you know, like with AI.
[02:20:02.240 --> 02:20:06.080]   I think the guy called SWYX or something,
[02:20:06.080 --> 02:20:08.880]   he does like a newsletter that's completely AI generated
[02:20:08.880 --> 02:20:10.800]   with the cool new stuff in AI.
[02:20:10.800 --> 02:20:12.960]   - Yeah, I mean, I would love to do that.
[02:20:12.960 --> 02:20:16.000]   But also like across Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn,
[02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:17.760]   all this kind of stuff.
[02:20:17.760 --> 02:20:19.360]   Just like, okay, can I,
[02:20:19.360 --> 02:20:21.920]   can you summarize the internet for me for today?
[02:20:21.920 --> 02:20:23.040]   - Summarizeinternet.com.
[02:20:23.040 --> 02:20:24.320]   - Yeah, .com.
[02:20:24.320 --> 02:20:29.360]   'Cause I feel like it pulls in way too much time,
[02:20:29.360 --> 02:20:31.120]   but also like, I don't like the effect
[02:20:31.120 --> 02:20:33.520]   it has some days on my psyche.
[02:20:33.520 --> 02:20:36.080]   - 'Cause of like haters or just general content?
[02:20:36.080 --> 02:20:36.880]   - Just general.
[02:20:36.880 --> 02:20:38.480]   Like, no, no, just general.
[02:20:38.480 --> 02:20:40.720]   Like for example, like TikTok is a good example
[02:20:40.720 --> 02:20:41.760]   of that for me.
[02:20:41.760 --> 02:20:44.640]   I sometimes just feel dumber after I use TikTok.
[02:20:44.640 --> 02:20:45.280]   I just feel like--
[02:20:45.280 --> 02:20:46.240]   - Yeah, I don't use it anymore.
[02:20:46.240 --> 02:20:47.680]   - Empty somehow.
[02:20:47.680 --> 02:20:49.680]   And I'm like uninspired.
[02:20:49.680 --> 02:20:50.400]   - Yeah.
[02:20:50.400 --> 02:20:52.320]   - It's funny in the moment I'm like,
[02:20:52.320 --> 02:20:54.240]   "Ha, look at that cat doing a funny thing."
[02:20:54.240 --> 02:20:55.680]   And then you're like,
[02:20:55.680 --> 02:20:58.000]   "Oh, look at that person dancing in a funny way
[02:20:58.000 --> 02:20:58.800]   "to that music."
[02:20:58.800 --> 02:21:01.840]   And then you're like, 10 minutes later,
[02:21:01.840 --> 02:21:03.840]   you're like, "I feel way dumber
[02:21:03.840 --> 02:21:06.480]   "and I don't really wanna do much for the rest of the day."
[02:21:06.560 --> 02:21:08.720]   - My girlfriend said, she saw me like watching
[02:21:08.720 --> 02:21:09.920]   some dumb video.
[02:21:09.920 --> 02:21:12.480]   She's like, "Dude, your face looks so dumb as well."
[02:21:12.480 --> 02:21:14.640]   Your whole face starts going like, "Oh, interesting."
[02:21:14.640 --> 02:21:15.680]   You know, so--
[02:21:15.680 --> 02:21:20.640]   - I mean, with social media, with X sometimes for me too,
[02:21:20.640 --> 02:21:23.920]   I think I'm probably naturally gravitating
[02:21:23.920 --> 02:21:24.880]   towards the drama.
[02:21:24.880 --> 02:21:26.560]   - Yeah, art wheel.
[02:21:26.560 --> 02:21:29.520]   - Yeah, and so following ad people,
[02:21:29.520 --> 02:21:31.840]   especially ad people that only post technical content
[02:21:31.840 --> 02:21:32.480]   has been really good.
[02:21:32.480 --> 02:21:34.240]   'Cause then I just look at them
[02:21:34.240 --> 02:21:36.320]   and then I go down rabbit holes
[02:21:36.320 --> 02:21:38.160]   of like learning new papers that have been published
[02:21:38.160 --> 02:21:44.160]   or good repos or just any kind of cool demonstration of stuff
[02:21:44.160 --> 02:21:46.080]   and the kind of things that they retweet.
[02:21:46.080 --> 02:21:47.920]   And that's the rabbit hole I go and I'm learning
[02:21:47.920 --> 02:21:49.760]   and I'm inspired, all that kind of stuff.
[02:21:49.760 --> 02:21:51.840]   But it's been tough.
[02:21:51.840 --> 02:21:52.640]   It's been tough to control.
[02:21:52.640 --> 02:21:53.200]   - It's difficult.
[02:21:53.200 --> 02:21:56.000]   You need to like manage your platforms, you know?
[02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:57.440]   I have a mute board list as well.
[02:21:57.440 --> 02:21:59.200]   So I mute like politics stuff
[02:21:59.200 --> 02:22:01.520]   'cause I don't really want it on my feet.
[02:22:01.520 --> 02:22:04.960]   And I think I've muted so much that now my feet is good.
[02:22:04.960 --> 02:22:06.720]   You know, I see like interesting stuff.
[02:22:06.720 --> 02:22:09.760]   But the fact that you need to modify,
[02:22:09.760 --> 02:22:11.520]   you need to like mod your app,
[02:22:11.520 --> 02:22:13.600]   your social media platform just to function
[02:22:13.600 --> 02:22:16.240]   and not be toxic for you, for your mental health, right?
[02:22:16.240 --> 02:22:16.880]   That's like a problem.
[02:22:16.880 --> 02:22:18.400]   Like it should be doing that for you.
[02:22:18.400 --> 02:22:20.480]   - It's some level of automation.
[02:22:20.480 --> 02:22:22.640]   That'd be interesting.
[02:22:22.640 --> 02:22:27.600]   I wish I could access X and Instagram through API easier.
[02:22:27.600 --> 02:22:31.040]   - You need to spend $42,000 a month, which my friends do.
[02:22:31.520 --> 02:22:33.520]   - No, but still, even if you do that,
[02:22:33.520 --> 02:22:35.600]   that you're not getting, I mean,
[02:22:35.600 --> 02:22:37.360]   there's limitations that don't make it easy
[02:22:37.360 --> 02:22:39.200]   to do like automate.
[02:22:39.200 --> 02:22:42.320]   'Cause the thing that they're trying to limit like abuse
[02:22:42.320 --> 02:22:44.560]   or for you to steal all the data from the app
[02:22:44.560 --> 02:22:47.040]   to then train an LLM or something like this.
[02:22:47.040 --> 02:22:49.440]   But if I just want to like figure out ways
[02:22:49.440 --> 02:22:52.560]   to automate my interaction with the X system
[02:22:52.560 --> 02:22:55.520]   or with Instagram, they don't make that easy.
[02:22:55.520 --> 02:22:57.120]   But I would love to sort of automate that
[02:22:57.120 --> 02:22:59.840]   and explore different ways to how to leverage LLMs
[02:22:59.840 --> 02:23:01.920]   to control the content I consume.
[02:23:01.920 --> 02:23:04.480]   And maybe publish that.
[02:23:04.480 --> 02:23:06.880]   Maybe they themselves can see how that could be used
[02:23:06.880 --> 02:23:07.920]   to improve their system.
[02:23:07.920 --> 02:23:11.200]   So, but there's not enough access.
[02:23:11.200 --> 02:23:13.680]   - Yes, you could screen cap your phone, right?
[02:23:13.680 --> 02:23:16.080]   It could be an app that watches your screen with you.
[02:23:16.080 --> 02:23:16.880]   - You could, yeah.
[02:23:16.880 --> 02:23:18.800]   - But I don't really know like what it would do.
[02:23:18.800 --> 02:23:20.720]   Like maybe it can hide stuff before you see it.
[02:23:20.720 --> 02:23:22.160]   You know, like you scroll down.
[02:23:22.160 --> 02:23:23.760]   - I have Chrome extensions.
[02:23:23.760 --> 02:23:25.600]   I write a lot of Chrome extensions
[02:23:25.600 --> 02:23:28.400]   that hide parts of different pages and so on.
[02:23:28.400 --> 02:23:31.040]   Like for example, for my own, on my main computer,
[02:23:31.040 --> 02:23:33.040]   I hide all views and likes and all that
[02:23:33.040 --> 02:23:36.800]   on YouTube content that I create.
[02:23:36.800 --> 02:23:38.560]   So that I don't-- - Smart doesn't affect you.
[02:23:38.560 --> 02:23:39.200]   - It doesn't, yeah.
[02:23:39.200 --> 02:23:40.320]   So you don't pay attention to it.
[02:23:40.320 --> 02:23:42.640]   I also hide parts.
[02:23:42.640 --> 02:23:46.240]   I have a mode for X where I hide most of everything.
[02:23:46.240 --> 02:23:48.640]   So like there's no, it's same with YouTube.
[02:23:48.640 --> 02:23:49.840]   - I have the same, I have this extension.
[02:23:49.840 --> 02:23:51.840]   - Like, well, I wrote my own 'cause it's easier.
[02:23:51.840 --> 02:23:52.880]   'Cause it keeps changing.
[02:23:52.880 --> 02:23:56.320]   It's like, it's not easy to keep it dynamically changing.
[02:23:56.320 --> 02:23:59.760]   But they're really good at like getting you to be distracted
[02:23:59.760 --> 02:24:01.520]   and like starting to-- - Related accounts.
[02:24:01.520 --> 02:24:03.440]   - Related stuff. - I don't want related.
[02:24:03.440 --> 02:24:05.920]   - And like 10 minutes later, you're like,
[02:24:05.920 --> 02:24:07.120]   or something that's trending.
[02:24:07.120 --> 02:24:09.600]   - I have a weird amount of friends addicted to YouTube
[02:24:09.600 --> 02:24:10.480]   and I'm not addicted.
[02:24:10.480 --> 02:24:12.640]   I think 'cause my attention span is too short for YouTube.
[02:24:12.640 --> 02:24:17.200]   But I have this extension to like YouTube on hook,
[02:24:17.200 --> 02:24:19.280]   which like it hides all the related stuff.
[02:24:19.280 --> 02:24:21.760]   I can just see the video and it's amazing.
[02:24:21.760 --> 02:24:24.640]   But sometimes I need to like,
[02:24:24.640 --> 02:24:27.280]   like I need to search a video how to do something.
[02:24:27.280 --> 02:24:30.560]   And then I go to YouTube and then I had these YouTube shorts.
[02:24:30.560 --> 02:24:31.920]   These YouTube shorts are like,
[02:24:31.920 --> 02:24:33.520]   they're like algorithmically designed
[02:24:33.520 --> 02:24:35.360]   to just make you tap them.
[02:24:35.360 --> 02:24:37.920]   And like I tap and then I'm like five minutes later
[02:24:37.920 --> 02:24:40.800]   with this face like, and you're just stuck.
[02:24:40.800 --> 02:24:41.760]   And it's like, what happened?
[02:24:41.760 --> 02:24:45.120]   I was gonna open, I was gonna play like the coffee mix,
[02:24:45.120 --> 02:24:47.360]   you know, like the music mix for drinking coffee together,
[02:24:47.360 --> 02:24:49.200]   like in the morning, like jazz.
[02:24:49.200 --> 02:24:50.880]   I didn't wanna go to shorts.
[02:24:50.880 --> 02:24:52.800]   So it's very difficult.
[02:24:52.800 --> 02:24:55.520]   - I love how we're actually highlighting
[02:24:55.520 --> 02:24:56.960]   all kinds of interesting problems
[02:24:56.960 --> 02:24:58.560]   that all could be solved at a startup.
[02:24:58.560 --> 02:25:01.120]   Okay, so what about the exit?
[02:25:01.120 --> 02:25:02.960]   When and how to exit?
[02:25:02.960 --> 02:25:04.640]   - Man, you shouldn't ask me
[02:25:04.640 --> 02:25:05.920]   'cause I never sold my company.
[02:25:05.920 --> 02:25:08.800]   - You've never, all the successful stuff you've done,
[02:25:08.800 --> 02:25:09.600]   you've never sold it.
[02:25:09.600 --> 02:25:11.120]   - Yeah, it's kind of sad, right?
[02:25:11.120 --> 02:25:14.320]   Like I've been in, so I've been in a lot of acquisition,
[02:25:14.320 --> 02:25:15.360]   like deals and stuff.
[02:25:15.360 --> 02:25:18.240]   And I learned a lot about finance people as well there,
[02:25:18.240 --> 02:25:20.880]   like manipulation and due diligence
[02:25:20.880 --> 02:25:22.400]   and then changing the valuation,
[02:25:22.400 --> 02:25:24.160]   like people change the valuation after.
[02:25:24.160 --> 02:25:28.640]   So a lot of people string you on to acquire you.
[02:25:28.640 --> 02:25:30.400]   And then it takes like six months.
[02:25:30.400 --> 02:25:32.320]   It's a classic, it takes six to 12 months.
[02:25:32.320 --> 02:25:33.280]   They wanna see everything.
[02:25:33.280 --> 02:25:36.240]   They wanna see your stripe and your code and whatever.
[02:25:36.240 --> 02:25:41.120]   And then in the end, they'll change the price to lower
[02:25:41.120 --> 02:25:42.960]   'cause you're already so invested.
[02:25:42.960 --> 02:25:45.040]   So it's like a negotiation tactic, right?
[02:25:45.040 --> 02:25:47.280]   I'm like, no, I don't wanna sell, right?
[02:25:47.280 --> 02:25:48.640]   And the problem with my companies is like,
[02:25:48.640 --> 02:25:51.360]   they make 90% profit margin.
[02:25:51.360 --> 02:25:55.280]   So the multiple, the companies get sold with multiples,
[02:25:55.280 --> 02:25:57.280]   kind of multiples of profit or revenue.
[02:25:57.280 --> 02:25:59.760]   And often the multiple is like three times,
[02:25:59.760 --> 02:26:03.120]   three times or four times or five times revenue or profit.
[02:26:03.120 --> 02:26:05.840]   So in my case, they're all automated.
[02:26:05.840 --> 02:26:07.680]   So I might as well wait three years
[02:26:07.680 --> 02:26:10.000]   and I get the same money as when I sell.
[02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000]   And then I can still sell the same company.
[02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:12.560]   You know what I mean?
[02:26:12.560 --> 02:26:14.240]   I can still sell for three, five times.
[02:26:14.240 --> 02:26:17.360]   So financially, it doesn't really make sense to sell.
[02:26:17.360 --> 02:26:19.680]   - Yeah. - Unless the price high enough.
[02:26:19.680 --> 02:26:22.080]   Like if the price gets to like six or seven or eight,
[02:26:22.080 --> 02:26:24.240]   I don't wanna wait six years for the money, you know?
[02:26:24.240 --> 02:26:26.240]   But if you give me three, like three years, nothing,
[02:26:26.240 --> 02:26:27.280]   like I can wait.
[02:26:27.280 --> 02:26:30.960]   - So that means they're really valuable stuff
[02:26:30.960 --> 02:26:33.760]   about the companies you create is not just the interface
[02:26:33.760 --> 02:26:36.160]   and the crowdsource content,
[02:26:36.160 --> 02:26:38.640]   but the people themselves, like the user base.
[02:26:38.640 --> 02:26:41.200]   - Yeah, well, NomadList, it's a community, yeah.
[02:26:41.200 --> 02:26:43.440]   - So I could see that being extremely valuable.
[02:26:43.440 --> 02:26:45.040]   I'm surprised it has not. - But NomadList is like,
[02:26:45.040 --> 02:26:45.680]   it's like my baby.
[02:26:45.680 --> 02:26:47.120]   It's like my first product I took off
[02:26:47.120 --> 02:26:48.960]   and I don't really know if I wanna sell it.
[02:26:48.960 --> 02:26:51.520]   It's like something you will be nice when you're old
[02:26:51.520 --> 02:26:52.640]   'cause you're still working on this.
[02:26:52.640 --> 02:26:55.840]   It has like a mission, which is like,
[02:26:55.840 --> 02:26:58.080]   people should travel anywhere
[02:26:58.080 --> 02:26:59.200]   and they can work from anywhere
[02:26:59.200 --> 02:27:00.960]   and they can meet different cultures.
[02:27:00.960 --> 02:27:03.040]   And that's a good way to make the world get better.
[02:27:03.040 --> 02:27:05.280]   If you go to China, live in China,
[02:27:05.280 --> 02:27:07.040]   you'll learn that there are nice people.
[02:27:07.040 --> 02:27:09.120]   And a lot of stuff you hear about China's propaganda,
[02:27:09.120 --> 02:27:10.160]   a lot of stuff is true as well.
[02:27:10.160 --> 02:27:12.960]   But it's more, you learn a lot from traveling.
[02:27:12.960 --> 02:27:15.600]   And I think that's why it's like a cool product
[02:27:15.600 --> 02:27:16.480]   to like not sell.
[02:27:16.480 --> 02:27:19.200]   AI products, I have less emotional feeling
[02:27:19.200 --> 02:27:22.400]   with AI products, like PhotEye, which I could sell, yeah.
[02:27:22.400 --> 02:27:25.120]   - Yeah, the thing you also mentioned is
[02:27:25.120 --> 02:27:28.320]   you have to price in the fact that you're going to miss
[02:27:28.320 --> 02:27:31.760]   the company you created. - And the meaning it gives you.
[02:27:31.760 --> 02:27:34.160]   There's a very famous like depression
[02:27:34.160 --> 02:27:35.840]   after a startup wanna sell their company.
[02:27:35.840 --> 02:27:39.040]   Like they're like, this was me, who am I?
[02:27:39.040 --> 02:27:40.880]   And they immediately start building another one.
[02:27:40.880 --> 02:27:42.400]   You know, they never can stop.
[02:27:42.400 --> 02:27:45.360]   So I think it's good to keep working.
[02:27:45.360 --> 02:27:47.600]   You know, until you die, just keep working on cool stuff.
[02:27:47.600 --> 02:27:49.920]   And you shouldn't retire.
[02:27:49.920 --> 02:27:52.000]   You know, I think retirement's bad, probably.
[02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.080]   - So you usually build this stuff solo
[02:27:54.080 --> 02:27:55.280]   and mostly work solo.
[02:27:55.280 --> 02:27:58.080]   What's the thinking behind that?
[02:27:58.080 --> 02:28:00.400]   - I think I'm not so good working with other people.
[02:28:00.400 --> 02:28:03.360]   Not like I'm crazy, but like I don't trust other people.
[02:28:03.360 --> 02:28:05.440]   - To clarify, you don't trust other people
[02:28:05.440 --> 02:28:06.320]   to do a great job.
[02:28:06.320 --> 02:28:10.800]   - Yeah, and I don't wanna have like this consensus meeting
[02:28:10.800 --> 02:28:13.200]   where we all like, you know, you have like a meeting
[02:28:13.200 --> 02:28:14.720]   with three people and then you kind of get
[02:28:14.720 --> 02:28:18.160]   this compromise results, which is very European.
[02:28:18.160 --> 02:28:20.240]   Like it's very, in Holland we call it polder model
[02:28:20.240 --> 02:28:22.720]   where you put people in a room and you only let them out
[02:28:22.720 --> 02:28:25.120]   when they agree on the compromise, right, in politics.
[02:28:25.120 --> 02:28:28.640]   And I don't think, I think it breeds like averageness.
[02:28:28.640 --> 02:28:30.320]   You know, you get an average idea, average company,
[02:28:30.320 --> 02:28:31.120]   average culture.
[02:28:31.120 --> 02:28:36.800]   You need to have like a leader or you need to be solo
[02:28:36.800 --> 02:28:39.680]   and just do it, you know, do it yourself, I think.
[02:28:39.680 --> 02:28:40.960]   And I trust some people.
[02:28:40.960 --> 02:28:42.720]   Like now I, like with my best friend, Andre,
[02:28:42.720 --> 02:28:44.160]   I'm making a new AI startup.
[02:28:44.160 --> 02:28:46.960]   But it's because we know each other very long
[02:28:46.960 --> 02:28:49.920]   and he's one of the few people I would build something with.
[02:28:49.920 --> 02:28:51.840]   And, but almost never, yeah.
[02:28:51.840 --> 02:28:53.680]   - So what does it take to be successful
[02:28:53.680 --> 02:28:55.840]   when you have more than one?
[02:28:55.840 --> 02:28:58.240]   Like how do you build together with Andre?
[02:28:58.240 --> 02:28:59.360]   How do you build together with other people?
[02:28:59.360 --> 02:29:02.320]   - So he codes, I shitpost on Twitter.
[02:29:02.320 --> 02:29:03.760]   Literally, like I promote it on Twitter.
[02:29:03.760 --> 02:29:06.320]   We set like product strategy.
[02:29:06.320 --> 02:29:08.320]   Like I said, this should be better, this should be better.
[02:29:08.320 --> 02:29:10.160]   But I think you need to have one person coding it.
[02:29:10.720 --> 02:29:11.600]   He codes in Ruby.
[02:29:11.600 --> 02:29:12.960]   So I was like, can I do Ruby?
[02:29:12.960 --> 02:29:13.680]   I'm in PHP.
[02:29:13.680 --> 02:29:16.400]   - So you literally, so you've, have you ever coded
[02:29:16.400 --> 02:29:18.640]   with another person for prolonged periods of time?
[02:29:18.640 --> 02:29:19.840]   - Never in my life.
[02:29:19.840 --> 02:29:25.680]   - What do you think is behind that?
[02:29:25.680 --> 02:29:28.720]   - I don't know, it was always just me sitting on my laptop.
[02:29:28.720 --> 02:29:29.840]   Like I said, like just coding.
[02:29:29.840 --> 02:29:32.000]   - No, like you've never had another developer
[02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:33.200]   who like rolls in and like.
[02:29:33.200 --> 02:29:34.880]   - I've had it once where we photoride,
[02:29:34.880 --> 02:29:36.320]   like there's an AI developer, Phillip.
[02:29:36.320 --> 02:29:38.800]   I hired him to do the, 'cause I can't write Python.
[02:29:38.800 --> 02:29:39.120]   - Yeah.
[02:29:39.120 --> 02:29:40.560]   - And AI stuff is Python.
[02:29:40.560 --> 02:29:43.280]   And I needed to get models to work and replicate and stuff.
[02:29:43.280 --> 02:29:45.520]   And it needs to improve photoride.
[02:29:45.520 --> 02:29:47.520]   And he helped me a lot for like 10 months.
[02:29:47.520 --> 02:29:49.920]   He worked and man, I was trying Python,
[02:29:49.920 --> 02:29:51.440]   working with NumPy and package manager.
[02:29:51.440 --> 02:29:53.360]   And it was too difficult for me to figure this shit out.
[02:29:53.360 --> 02:29:54.160]   And I didn't have time.
[02:29:54.160 --> 02:29:57.280]   Like I think 10 years ago, I would have time to like sit,
[02:29:57.280 --> 02:30:00.640]   you know, go do all nighters to figure this stuff out
[02:30:00.640 --> 02:30:01.600]   with Python.
[02:30:01.600 --> 02:30:04.560]   I don't have the, and I don't have the, it's not my thing.
[02:30:04.560 --> 02:30:05.520]   - It's not your thing.
[02:30:05.520 --> 02:30:06.640]   It's another programming language.
[02:30:06.640 --> 02:30:07.120]   I get it.
[02:30:07.120 --> 02:30:09.120]   AI, new thing, got it.
[02:30:09.120 --> 02:30:11.200]   But like, you never had a developer roll in,
[02:30:11.200 --> 02:30:14.880]   look at your PHP jQuery code and be, and yes.
[02:30:14.880 --> 02:30:16.960]   Like, you know, like in conversation or improv,
[02:30:16.960 --> 02:30:20.000]   they talk about yes and, like basically, all right.
[02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:21.040]   - I had for one week.
[02:30:21.040 --> 02:30:21.760]   - Understand.
[02:30:21.760 --> 02:30:22.720]   - And then it ended.
[02:30:22.720 --> 02:30:23.680]   - What happened?
[02:30:23.680 --> 02:30:25.520]   - Because he wanted to rewrite everything in the.
[02:30:25.520 --> 02:30:26.720]   - No, that's the wrong guy.
[02:30:26.720 --> 02:30:27.280]   - I know.
[02:30:27.280 --> 02:30:28.560]   - He wanted to rewrite in what?
[02:30:28.560 --> 02:30:30.800]   - He wanted to rewrite the, he said this jQuery,
[02:30:30.800 --> 02:30:31.760]   we can't do this.
[02:30:31.760 --> 02:30:32.640]   I'm like, okay.
[02:30:32.640 --> 02:30:35.040]   He's like, we need to rewrite everything in Vue, Vue.js.
[02:30:35.040 --> 02:30:36.160]   I'm like, are you sure?
[02:30:36.160 --> 02:30:38.320]   Can we just like, you know, like keep jQuery.
[02:30:38.320 --> 02:30:39.360]   He's like, no, man.
[02:30:39.360 --> 02:30:41.760]   Like, and we need to change a lot of stuff.
[02:30:41.760 --> 02:30:43.040]   And I'm like, okay.
[02:30:43.040 --> 02:30:45.120]   And I was kind of like feeling it like this, you know,
[02:30:45.120 --> 02:30:46.560]   we're going to clean up shit.
[02:30:46.560 --> 02:30:48.560]   But then after a week, it's not going to,
[02:30:48.560 --> 02:30:49.680]   it's going to take way too much time.
[02:30:49.680 --> 02:30:51.920]   - I think I like working with people where like,
[02:30:51.920 --> 02:30:56.800]   when I approach them, I pretend in my head
[02:30:56.800 --> 02:30:58.960]   that they're the smartest person who has ever existed.
[02:30:58.960 --> 02:30:59.520]   - Wow.
[02:30:59.520 --> 02:31:02.320]   - So I look at their code or I look at the stuff
[02:31:02.320 --> 02:31:05.200]   they've created and try to see the genius of their way.
[02:31:05.200 --> 02:31:07.600]   Like you really have to understand people.
[02:31:07.600 --> 02:31:09.680]   Like really notice them.
[02:31:09.680 --> 02:31:13.600]   Like, and then from that place, have a conversation
[02:31:13.600 --> 02:31:14.960]   about what is the better approach.
[02:31:14.960 --> 02:31:17.200]   - Yeah, but those are the top tier developers.
[02:31:17.200 --> 02:31:17.520]   - Yeah.
[02:31:17.520 --> 02:31:20.640]   - And those are the ones that are tech ambiguous.
[02:31:20.640 --> 02:31:23.360]   So they can work with, they can learn any tech stack
[02:31:23.360 --> 02:31:25.280]   and they can, and that's like really few.
[02:31:25.280 --> 02:31:26.560]   Like it's like top 5%.
[02:31:26.560 --> 02:31:27.280]   - Really? Damn.
[02:31:27.280 --> 02:31:29.280]   - 'Cause if you try higher devs, like no offense to devs,
[02:31:29.280 --> 02:31:32.160]   but most devs are not, man, most people in general jobs
[02:31:32.160 --> 02:31:33.520]   are not so good at their job.
[02:31:33.520 --> 02:31:34.800]   Like even doctors and stuff.
[02:31:34.800 --> 02:31:35.200]   - That's too sad.
[02:31:35.200 --> 02:31:37.440]   - When you realize this, people are very average.
[02:31:37.440 --> 02:31:38.400]   - Yeah.
[02:31:38.400 --> 02:31:41.040]   - Especially with dev, with coding, I think.
[02:31:41.040 --> 02:31:41.520]   So sorry.
[02:31:41.520 --> 02:31:43.920]   - I think that's a really important skill for a developer
[02:31:43.920 --> 02:31:47.280]   to roll in and like understand the musicality,
[02:31:47.280 --> 02:31:48.320]   the style of the-
[02:31:48.320 --> 02:31:48.880]   - That's it, man.
[02:31:48.880 --> 02:31:49.360]   - And like-
[02:31:49.360 --> 02:31:50.880]   - Empathy, it's like code empathy, right?
[02:31:50.880 --> 02:31:51.520]   - It's code empathy.
[02:31:51.520 --> 02:31:53.360]   - Yeah, it's a new word, but that's it.
[02:31:53.360 --> 02:31:55.920]   You need to understand like, go over the code,
[02:31:55.920 --> 02:31:56.960]   get a holistic view of it.
[02:31:56.960 --> 02:32:00.640]   And man, you can suggest we change stuff for sure.
[02:32:00.640 --> 02:32:03.360]   But, and look, jQuery is crazy.
[02:32:03.360 --> 02:32:04.720]   It's crazy I'm using jQuery.
[02:32:04.720 --> 02:32:05.280]   We can change that.
[02:32:05.280 --> 02:32:06.720]   - It's not crazy at all.
[02:32:06.720 --> 02:32:08.960]   jQuery is also beautiful and powerful.
[02:32:08.960 --> 02:32:10.800]   And PHP is beautiful and powerful,
[02:32:10.800 --> 02:32:12.080]   especially as you said recently,
[02:32:12.080 --> 02:32:17.120]   as the versions evolved,
[02:32:17.120 --> 02:32:19.120]   it's much more serious programming language now.
[02:32:19.120 --> 02:32:20.240]   It's super fast.
[02:32:20.240 --> 02:32:22.560]   Like PHP is really fast now.
[02:32:22.560 --> 02:32:23.040]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:32:23.040 --> 02:32:23.760]   - It's crazy.
[02:32:23.760 --> 02:32:24.240]   JavaScript-
[02:32:24.240 --> 02:32:25.200]   - Much faster than Ruby, yeah.
[02:32:25.200 --> 02:32:26.800]   - Really fast now.
[02:32:26.800 --> 02:32:29.280]   So if speed is something you care about, it's super fast.
[02:32:29.280 --> 02:32:32.320]   And like there's gigantic communities of people
[02:32:32.320 --> 02:32:33.680]   using those programming languages.
[02:32:33.680 --> 02:32:35.440]   And there's frameworks, if you like the framework.
[02:32:35.440 --> 02:32:37.680]   So whatever, it doesn't really matter what you use.
[02:32:37.680 --> 02:32:40.400]   But like, also you,
[02:32:40.400 --> 02:32:42.800]   if I was like a developer working with you,
[02:32:42.800 --> 02:32:44.560]   like you are extremely successful.
[02:32:44.560 --> 02:32:46.000]   You've shipped a lot.
[02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:50.560]   So like, if I roll in, I'm gonna be like,
[02:32:50.560 --> 02:32:52.560]   I don't assume you know nothing.
[02:32:52.560 --> 02:32:54.080]   I assume Peter's a genius.
[02:32:54.080 --> 02:32:55.760]   Like the smartest developer ever.
[02:32:55.760 --> 02:32:57.360]   And like, learn, learn from it.
[02:32:57.360 --> 02:33:01.040]   And yes, and like notice parts in the code
[02:33:01.040 --> 02:33:02.480]   where like, okay, okay, I got it.
[02:33:03.360 --> 02:33:04.720]   Here's how he's thinking.
[02:33:04.720 --> 02:33:10.320]   And now if I wanna add another, like a little feature,
[02:33:10.320 --> 02:33:13.760]   definitely needs to have emoji in front of it.
[02:33:13.760 --> 02:33:16.960]   And then like, just follow the same style and add it.
[02:33:16.960 --> 02:33:20.400]   And my goal is to make you happy, to make you smile.
[02:33:20.400 --> 02:33:23.200]   Like to make you like, ha ha, fuck, I get it.
[02:33:23.200 --> 02:33:25.600]   And now you're going to start respecting me
[02:33:25.600 --> 02:33:27.200]   and like trusting me.
[02:33:27.200 --> 02:33:29.440]   And like, you start working together in this way.
[02:33:29.440 --> 02:33:30.080]   I don't know.
[02:33:30.080 --> 02:33:32.720]   I don't know how hard it is to find developers.
[02:33:32.720 --> 02:33:33.440]   - No, I think they exist.
[02:33:33.440 --> 02:33:35.120]   I think you need to, I need to hire more people,
[02:33:35.120 --> 02:33:36.400]   need to try more people.
[02:33:36.400 --> 02:33:38.400]   But that costs a lot of my energy and time.
[02:33:38.400 --> 02:33:40.240]   But it's 100% possible.
[02:33:40.240 --> 02:33:41.280]   But do I want it?
[02:33:41.280 --> 02:33:41.920]   I don't know.
[02:33:41.920 --> 02:33:43.440]   Things kind of run fine for now.
[02:33:43.440 --> 02:33:45.920]   And I mean, like, okay, you could say like, okay,
[02:33:45.920 --> 02:33:47.360]   normally this looks kind of clunky.
[02:33:47.360 --> 02:33:48.560]   Like people say the design is kind of clunky.
[02:33:48.560 --> 02:33:49.520]   Okay, I'll improve the design.
[02:33:49.520 --> 02:33:52.160]   It's like next to my to-do list, for example, you know?
[02:33:52.160 --> 02:33:53.760]   Like I can, I'll get there eventually.
[02:33:53.760 --> 02:33:54.400]   - But it's true.
[02:33:54.400 --> 02:33:57.040]   I mean, you're also extremely good at what you do.
[02:33:57.040 --> 02:34:00.320]   Like, I'm just looking at the interfaces of like photo AI.
[02:34:00.320 --> 02:34:02.880]   Like you would Jake, like Jake, right?
[02:34:02.880 --> 02:34:04.240]   Like how amazing is Jake, right?
[02:34:04.240 --> 02:34:06.400]   But like you can, these cowboys are getting,
[02:34:06.400 --> 02:34:09.920]   these are, there's these cowboys.
[02:34:09.920 --> 02:34:11.600]   This is a lot.
[02:34:11.600 --> 02:34:13.040]   It's a lot.
[02:34:13.040 --> 02:34:15.120]   But I'm glad they're all wearing shirts.
[02:34:15.120 --> 02:34:17.680]   Anyway, the interface here is just really, really nice.
[02:34:17.680 --> 02:34:21.120]   Like I could tell, you know what you're doing.
[02:34:21.120 --> 02:34:25.040]   And with Nomad List, extremely nice, the interface.
[02:34:25.040 --> 02:34:25.680]   - Thank you, man.
[02:34:25.680 --> 02:34:26.560]   - And that's all you.
[02:34:26.560 --> 02:34:28.160]   - Yeah, that's everything is me.
[02:34:28.320 --> 02:34:31.040]   - So all of this and every little feature.
[02:34:31.040 --> 02:34:33.760]   - People say it looks kind of ADHD or ADD, you know?
[02:34:33.760 --> 02:34:38.000]   Like it's so much because it has so many things.
[02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:40.320]   And design these days is minimalist, right?
[02:34:40.320 --> 02:34:41.600]   - Right, right, I hear you.
[02:34:41.600 --> 02:34:45.840]   But this is a lot of information and it's useful information
[02:34:45.840 --> 02:34:47.680]   and it's delivered in a clean way
[02:34:47.680 --> 02:34:49.840]   while still stylish and fun to look at.
[02:34:49.840 --> 02:34:51.920]   So like minimalist design is about like
[02:34:51.920 --> 02:34:54.880]   when you want to convey no information whatsoever
[02:34:54.880 --> 02:34:55.520]   and look cool.
[02:34:55.520 --> 02:34:56.880]   - Yeah, it's very cool.
[02:34:56.880 --> 02:34:57.680]   It's pretentious, right?
[02:34:57.680 --> 02:35:00.880]   - Pretentious or not, the function is useless.
[02:35:00.880 --> 02:35:03.600]   This is about a lot of information delivered to you
[02:35:03.600 --> 02:35:07.200]   in a clean, and when it's clean, you can't be too sexy.
[02:35:07.200 --> 02:35:08.080]   So it's sexy enough.
[02:35:08.080 --> 02:35:10.480]   - Yeah, this is, I think, how my brain looks, you know?
[02:35:10.480 --> 02:35:12.160]   Like there's a lot of shit going on.
[02:35:12.160 --> 02:35:13.360]   It's like drawing bass music.
[02:35:13.360 --> 02:35:13.920]   It's like very...
[02:35:13.920 --> 02:35:17.120]   - Yeah, but it's still pretty.
[02:35:17.120 --> 02:35:18.640]   The spacing of everything is nice.
[02:35:18.640 --> 02:35:22.480]   The fonts are really nice, like very readable.
[02:35:22.480 --> 02:35:25.040]   - Yeah, I like it, you know, but I made it
[02:35:25.040 --> 02:35:26.480]   so I don't trust my own judgment.
[02:35:26.480 --> 02:35:27.920]   - No, this is really nice.
[02:35:27.920 --> 02:35:28.560]   - Thank you.
[02:35:28.560 --> 02:35:31.840]   - The emojis are somehow, like it's a style.
[02:35:31.840 --> 02:35:32.480]   It's a thing.
[02:35:32.480 --> 02:35:33.760]   - I need to pick the emoji.
[02:35:33.760 --> 02:35:35.520]   It takes a while to pick them, you know?
[02:35:35.520 --> 02:35:37.440]   - Like there's something about the emoji
[02:35:37.440 --> 02:35:41.920]   is a really nice, memorable, like placeholder for the idea.
[02:35:41.920 --> 02:35:42.480]   - Yeah.
[02:35:42.480 --> 02:35:44.880]   - Like if it was just text, it would actually be overwhelming
[02:35:44.880 --> 02:35:45.600]   if it was just text.
[02:35:45.600 --> 02:35:46.720]   The emoji really helps.
[02:35:46.720 --> 02:35:48.560]   It's a brilliant addition.
[02:35:48.560 --> 02:35:50.400]   Like some people might look at it,
[02:35:50.400 --> 02:35:51.520]   why do you have emojis everywhere?
[02:35:51.520 --> 02:35:52.960]   It's actually really, for me, it's really nice.
[02:35:52.960 --> 02:35:54.400]   - People tell me to remove the emojis.
[02:35:54.400 --> 02:35:56.080]   - Yeah, well, people don't know what they're talking about.
[02:35:56.080 --> 02:35:56.640]   - I'm sure.
[02:35:56.640 --> 02:36:00.240]   - And then the, I'm sure people will tell you a lot of things.
[02:36:00.240 --> 02:36:01.360]   This is really nice.
[02:36:01.360 --> 02:36:03.760]   And then using color is nice.
[02:36:03.760 --> 02:36:05.920]   Small font, but not too small.
[02:36:05.920 --> 02:36:08.880]   And obviously you have to show maps, which is really tricky.
[02:36:08.880 --> 02:36:09.380]   - Yeah.
[02:36:09.380 --> 02:36:14.800]   - Yeah, this is, no, this is really, really, really nice.
[02:36:14.800 --> 02:36:17.280]   And all of, I mean like, okay, like how this looks
[02:36:17.280 --> 02:36:19.360]   when you hover over it.
[02:36:19.360 --> 02:36:21.280]   - Yeah, it's easier transitions.
[02:36:21.280 --> 02:36:24.480]   - No, I understand that, but like, I'm sure there's,
[02:36:24.480 --> 02:36:25.920]   like, how long does it take you to figure out
[02:36:25.920 --> 02:36:26.960]   how you want it to look?
[02:36:26.960 --> 02:36:28.240]   Do you ever go down a rabbit hole
[02:36:28.240 --> 02:36:29.360]   where you spent like two weeks?
[02:36:29.360 --> 02:36:30.560]   - No, it's all iterative.
[02:36:30.560 --> 02:36:32.480]   It's like 10 years of, you know,
[02:36:32.480 --> 02:36:34.800]   add a CSS transition here or do this or.
[02:36:34.800 --> 02:36:37.200]   - Well, let's say like, see, these are all,
[02:36:37.200 --> 02:36:38.240]   these are rounded now.
[02:36:38.240 --> 02:36:38.740]   - Yeah.
[02:36:38.740 --> 02:36:41.040]   - If you wanted to like, round is probably the better way.
[02:36:41.040 --> 02:36:44.000]   But if you want it to be rectangular, like sharp corners,
[02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:44.560]   what would you do?
[02:36:44.560 --> 02:36:47.040]   - So I go to the index.css.
[02:36:47.040 --> 02:36:47.440]   - Yeah.
[02:36:47.440 --> 02:36:51.280]   - And I do command F and I search border radius 12px.
[02:36:51.280 --> 02:36:51.680]   - Yeah.
[02:36:51.680 --> 02:36:53.600]   - And then I replace with border radius zero.
[02:36:53.600 --> 02:36:57.680]   And then I do command enter and it's git deploys.
[02:36:57.680 --> 02:37:00.560]   It pushes to the git hub and then sends a web book
[02:37:00.560 --> 02:37:04.400]   and then deploys to my server and it's live in five seconds.
[02:37:04.400 --> 02:37:06.400]   - Are you often deployed to production?
[02:37:06.400 --> 02:37:08.240]   You don't have like a testing ground?
[02:37:08.240 --> 02:37:13.200]   - No, so I'm like famous for this
[02:37:13.200 --> 02:37:16.480]   'cause I'm too lazy to set up like a staging server
[02:37:16.480 --> 02:37:17.360]   on my laptop every time.
[02:37:17.360 --> 02:37:19.600]   So nowadays I just deploy to production.
[02:37:19.600 --> 02:37:20.240]   - Yeah.
[02:37:20.240 --> 02:37:22.800]   - And it's, man, I'm gonna get canceled for this, you know,
[02:37:22.800 --> 02:37:24.560]   but it works very well for me
[02:37:24.560 --> 02:37:26.800]   'cause I have a lot of, I have like PHP lint and JS lint.
[02:37:26.800 --> 02:37:29.040]   So it tells me when there's error, so I don't deploy.
[02:37:29.040 --> 02:37:33.760]   But my, literally, I have like 37,000 git commits
[02:37:33.760 --> 02:37:34.800]   in the last 12 months or something.
[02:37:34.800 --> 02:37:37.200]   So I make like small fix and then command enter
[02:37:37.200 --> 02:37:39.360]   and sends to git hub.
[02:37:39.360 --> 02:37:40.960]   Git hub sends a web book to my server.
[02:37:40.960 --> 02:37:44.480]   Web server pulls it, deploys to production and is there.
[02:37:44.480 --> 02:37:47.200]   - What's the latency of that from you pressing command?
[02:37:47.200 --> 02:37:49.280]   - One second, can be one to two seconds.
[02:37:49.280 --> 02:37:50.560]   - So you just make a change
[02:37:50.560 --> 02:37:51.920]   and then you're getting really good
[02:37:51.920 --> 02:37:53.280]   at like not making mistakes basically.
[02:37:53.280 --> 02:37:54.240]   - Man, you're a hundred percent, you're right.
[02:37:54.240 --> 02:37:55.280]   Like people are like, how can you do this?
[02:37:55.280 --> 02:37:57.120]   Well, you get good at not taking the server down, you know?
[02:37:57.120 --> 02:37:57.520]   - Yeah.
[02:37:57.520 --> 02:37:59.360]   - 'Cause you need to code more carefully.
[02:37:59.360 --> 02:38:02.720]   But it's, look, it's idiotic in any big company,
[02:38:02.720 --> 02:38:05.120]   but for me it works 'cause it makes me so fast.
[02:38:05.120 --> 02:38:08.080]   Like somebody will report a bug on Twitter
[02:38:08.080 --> 02:38:11.120]   and I kinda did do like a stopwatch,
[02:38:11.120 --> 02:38:12.480]   like how fast can I fix this bug?
[02:38:12.480 --> 02:38:14.880]   And then two minutes later, for example, it's fixed.
[02:38:14.880 --> 02:38:15.280]   - Yeah.
[02:38:15.280 --> 02:38:18.240]   - And it's fun 'cause it's annoying for me
[02:38:18.240 --> 02:38:20.000]   to work with companies where you report a bug
[02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:21.200]   and it takes like six months.
[02:38:21.200 --> 02:38:21.760]   - Yeah.
[02:38:21.760 --> 02:38:23.920]   - It's like horrible and it makes people really happy
[02:38:23.920 --> 02:38:27.760]   when you can really quickly solve their problems.
[02:38:27.760 --> 02:38:29.200]   So, but it's crazy.
[02:38:29.200 --> 02:38:30.560]   - I don't think it's crazy.
[02:38:30.560 --> 02:38:32.880]   I mean, there's, I'm sure there's a middle ground,
[02:38:32.880 --> 02:38:35.120]   but I think that whole thing
[02:38:35.120 --> 02:38:37.520]   where there's a phase of like testing
[02:38:37.520 --> 02:38:40.080]   and there's the staging and there's the development.
[02:38:40.080 --> 02:38:43.200]   And then there's like multiple tables and databases
[02:38:43.200 --> 02:38:44.640]   that you use for the state, like it's-
[02:38:44.640 --> 02:38:45.280]   - Filing.
[02:38:45.280 --> 02:38:46.320]   - It's a mess.
[02:38:46.320 --> 02:38:46.720]   - Yeah.
[02:38:46.800 --> 02:38:49.360]   - And there's different teams involved, it's not good.
[02:38:49.360 --> 02:38:51.600]   - I'm like a good funny extreme on the other side, you know?
[02:38:51.600 --> 02:38:54.400]   - But just a little bit safer, but not too much.
[02:38:54.400 --> 02:38:55.040]   It would be great.
[02:38:55.040 --> 02:38:56.240]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:38:56.240 --> 02:38:58.080]   - And I'm sure that's actually like how X,
[02:38:58.080 --> 02:39:00.240]   now how they're doing rapid improvement.
[02:39:00.240 --> 02:39:02.000]   - No, they do 'cause there's more bugs.
[02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:02.240]   - Yeah.
[02:39:02.240 --> 02:39:03.120]   - And people complain about like,
[02:39:03.120 --> 02:39:05.840]   oh, look, he bought this Twitter and now it's full of bugs.
[02:39:05.840 --> 02:39:08.240]   Dude, the shipping stuff, like things are happening now
[02:39:08.240 --> 02:39:10.320]   and it's a dynamic app now.
[02:39:10.320 --> 02:39:12.800]   - Yeah, the bug is actually a sign of a good thing happening.
[02:39:12.800 --> 02:39:12.960]   - Yes.
[02:39:12.960 --> 02:39:13.840]   - Bugs are the future
[02:39:13.840 --> 02:39:16.000]   because it shows that the team is actually building shit.
[02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:16.720]   - A hundred percent.
[02:39:16.720 --> 02:39:19.360]   - Well, one of the problems is like I see with YouTube,
[02:39:19.360 --> 02:39:22.160]   there's so much potential to build features,
[02:39:22.160 --> 02:39:26.000]   but I just see how long it takes.
[02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:28.960]   So I've gotten a chance to interact
[02:39:28.960 --> 02:39:30.080]   with many other teams,
[02:39:30.080 --> 02:39:34.880]   but one of the teams is MLA, multi-language audio.
[02:39:34.880 --> 02:39:35.600]   I don't know if you know this,
[02:39:35.600 --> 02:39:38.160]   but in YouTube you can have audio tracks
[02:39:38.160 --> 02:39:39.920]   in different languages for overdubbing.
[02:39:39.920 --> 02:39:42.880]   And there's a team and not many people are using it,
[02:39:43.520 --> 02:39:47.040]   but like every single feature they have to meet and agree.
[02:39:47.040 --> 02:39:49.120]   And like there's allocate resources,
[02:39:49.120 --> 02:39:51.040]   like engineers have to work on it,
[02:39:51.040 --> 02:39:52.240]   but I'm sure it's a pain in the ass
[02:39:52.240 --> 02:39:54.000]   for the engineers to get approval to like,
[02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:57.200]   'cause it has to not break the rest of the site,
[02:39:57.200 --> 02:39:58.000]   whatever they do.
[02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:01.520]   But like, if you don't have enough dictatorial,
[02:40:01.520 --> 02:40:04.720]   like top down, like we need this now,
[02:40:04.720 --> 02:40:07.360]   it's gonna take forever to do anything multi-language audio.
[02:40:07.360 --> 02:40:09.360]   But multi-language audio is a good example
[02:40:09.360 --> 02:40:11.920]   of a thing that seems niche right now,
[02:40:12.960 --> 02:40:15.840]   but it quite possibly could change the entire world.
[02:40:15.840 --> 02:40:19.440]   When you have, when I upload this conversation right here,
[02:40:19.440 --> 02:40:24.880]   if instantaneously it dubs it into 40 languages,
[02:40:24.880 --> 02:40:28.320]   and everybody can assume every single video
[02:40:28.320 --> 02:40:31.440]   can be watched and listened to in those different,
[02:40:31.440 --> 02:40:32.560]   it changes everything.
[02:40:32.560 --> 02:40:34.880]   And YouTube is extremely well-positioned
[02:40:34.880 --> 02:40:36.320]   to be the leader in this.
[02:40:36.320 --> 02:40:40.480]   They got the compute, they got the user base,
[02:40:40.480 --> 02:40:43.520]   they have the experience of how to do this.
[02:40:43.520 --> 02:40:45.600]   So like multi-language audio should be--
[02:40:45.600 --> 02:40:47.200]   - A high priority feature, right?
[02:40:47.200 --> 02:40:48.800]   - Yeah, that's high priority.
[02:40:48.800 --> 02:40:50.560]   Like that's, and it's a way,
[02:40:50.560 --> 02:40:52.000]   Google is obsessed with AI right now.
[02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:54.720]   They wanna show off that they could be dominant in AI.
[02:40:54.720 --> 02:40:56.160]   That's a way for Google to say like,
[02:40:56.160 --> 02:40:58.320]   we use the AI, like this is a way
[02:40:58.320 --> 02:41:01.360]   to break down the walls that language creates.
[02:41:01.360 --> 02:41:03.840]   - The preferred outcome for them is probably their career,
[02:41:03.840 --> 02:41:07.280]   not the overall result of the cool product, you know?
[02:41:07.280 --> 02:41:09.600]   - I think they're not like selfish or whatever.
[02:41:09.600 --> 02:41:10.800]   They wanna do good.
[02:41:10.800 --> 02:41:12.000]   There's something about the machine--
[02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:12.720]   - Organization, yeah.
[02:41:12.720 --> 02:41:13.840]   - Organizational stuff that's just--
[02:41:13.840 --> 02:41:15.360]   - I have this when I do report bugs
[02:41:15.360 --> 02:41:17.840]   on like big companies I work with.
[02:41:17.840 --> 02:41:19.680]   I get, I talk to a lot of different people on DM,
[02:41:19.680 --> 02:41:22.160]   and they're all really trying hard to do something.
[02:41:22.160 --> 02:41:23.040]   They're all really nice.
[02:41:23.040 --> 02:41:25.440]   And I'm the one being kind of asshole,
[02:41:25.440 --> 02:41:28.080]   'cause I'm like, guys, I'm talking to 20 people about this
[02:41:28.080 --> 02:41:29.360]   for six months and nothing's happening.
[02:41:29.360 --> 02:41:31.920]   They say, man, I know, but I'm trying my best.
[02:41:31.920 --> 02:41:33.840]   And yeah, so it's systemic.
[02:41:33.840 --> 02:41:36.720]   - Yeah, it requires, again,
[02:41:36.720 --> 02:41:38.160]   I don't know if there must be a nicer word,
[02:41:38.160 --> 02:41:40.160]   but like a dictatorial type of top-down,
[02:41:40.160 --> 02:41:43.600]   the CEO rolls in and just says like,
[02:41:43.600 --> 02:41:46.720]   for you to, it's like, MLA, get this done now.
[02:41:46.720 --> 02:41:47.920]   This is the highest priority.
[02:41:47.920 --> 02:41:50.400]   - I think big companies, especially in America,
[02:41:50.400 --> 02:41:51.440]   a lot of it is legal, right?
[02:41:51.440 --> 02:41:52.960]   You need to pass everything through legal.
[02:41:52.960 --> 02:41:53.440]   - Yeah.
[02:41:53.440 --> 02:41:55.280]   - And you can't, like, man, the things I do,
[02:41:55.280 --> 02:41:57.040]   I could never do that in a big corporation,
[02:41:57.040 --> 02:41:58.080]   'cause everything has to be,
[02:41:58.080 --> 02:42:00.880]   probably Git deploy has to go through legal.
[02:42:00.880 --> 02:42:03.120]   - Well, again, dictatorial.
[02:42:03.120 --> 02:42:05.840]   You basically say, Steve Jobs did this quite a lot.
[02:42:06.400 --> 02:42:08.640]   I've seen a lot of leaders do this.
[02:42:08.640 --> 02:42:11.840]   Ignore the lawyers, ignore comms, ignore PR,
[02:42:11.840 --> 02:42:14.480]   ignore everybody, give power to the engineers.
[02:42:14.480 --> 02:42:16.240]   Like, listen to the people on the ground,
[02:42:16.240 --> 02:42:18.400]   get this shit done and get it done by Friday.
[02:42:18.400 --> 02:42:18.880]   - Yeah.
[02:42:18.880 --> 02:42:19.600]   - That's it.
[02:42:19.600 --> 02:42:20.800]   - And the law can change.
[02:42:20.800 --> 02:42:22.960]   Like, for example, let's say you launch this AI dubbing
[02:42:22.960 --> 02:42:25.440]   and there's some legal problems with lawsuits.
[02:42:25.440 --> 02:42:26.720]   Okay, so the law changes.
[02:42:26.720 --> 02:42:27.600]   There will be appeals.
[02:42:27.600 --> 02:42:29.680]   There will be some Supreme Court thing, whatever.
[02:42:29.680 --> 02:42:30.560]   And the law changes.
[02:42:30.560 --> 02:42:32.800]   So just by shipping it, you change society.
[02:42:32.800 --> 02:42:34.000]   You change the legal framework.
[02:42:34.640 --> 02:42:35.920]   And by not shipping, being scared
[02:42:35.920 --> 02:42:37.040]   of the legal framework all the time,
[02:42:37.040 --> 02:42:38.080]   like you're not changing things.
[02:42:38.080 --> 02:42:42.000]   - Just out of curiosity, what IDE do you use?
[02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:44.080]   Let's talk about like your whole setup.
[02:42:44.080 --> 02:42:47.120]   Given how ultra productive you are,
[02:42:47.120 --> 02:42:50.160]   I mean, you often program in your underwear,
[02:42:50.160 --> 02:42:51.120]   slouching on the couch.
[02:42:51.120 --> 02:42:55.200]   Is there, does it matter to you in general?
[02:42:55.200 --> 02:42:56.640]   Is there like a specific IDE you use?
[02:42:56.640 --> 02:42:57.520]   Do you use VS Code?
[02:42:57.520 --> 02:42:58.560]   - Yeah, VS Code.
[02:42:58.560 --> 02:43:00.240]   Before I used Sublime Text,
[02:43:00.240 --> 02:43:01.680]   I don't think it matters a lot.
[02:43:01.680 --> 02:43:03.680]   I think I'm very skeptical of like tools
[02:43:03.680 --> 02:43:06.720]   when people think it, they say it matters, right?
[02:43:06.720 --> 02:43:07.520]   I don't think it matters.
[02:43:07.520 --> 02:43:10.720]   I think whatever tool you know very well,
[02:43:10.720 --> 02:43:12.080]   you can go very fast in.
[02:43:12.080 --> 02:43:13.840]   Like, you know, the shortcuts, for example, IDE,
[02:43:13.840 --> 02:43:16.480]   you know, like I love Sublime Text
[02:43:16.480 --> 02:43:18.160]   'cause I could use like multi-cursor.
[02:43:18.160 --> 02:43:19.520]   You know, you search something
[02:43:19.520 --> 02:43:22.800]   and I could like make mass replaces
[02:43:22.800 --> 02:43:24.720]   in a file with the cursor thing.
[02:43:24.720 --> 02:43:26.640]   And VS Code doesn't really have that as well.
[02:43:26.640 --> 02:43:27.520]   - It's actually interesting.
[02:43:27.520 --> 02:43:30.400]   Sublime is the first editor where I've learned that.
[02:43:30.400 --> 02:43:33.200]   And I think they just make that super easy.
[02:43:33.200 --> 02:43:34.400]   So like, what would that be called?
[02:43:34.400 --> 02:43:37.760]   Multi-edit, multi-cursor edit thing, whatever.
[02:43:37.760 --> 02:43:41.840]   I'm sure like almost every editor can do that.
[02:43:41.840 --> 02:43:43.600]   It's just probably hard to set up.
[02:43:43.600 --> 02:43:46.800]   - Yeah, VS Code's not so good at it, I think.
[02:43:46.800 --> 02:43:48.240]   Or at least I tried.
[02:43:48.240 --> 02:43:50.720]   But I would use that to like process data,
[02:43:50.720 --> 02:43:52.400]   like data sets, for example, from World Bank.
[02:43:52.400 --> 02:43:55.200]   I would just multi-cursor mass change everything.
[02:43:55.200 --> 02:44:00.000]   But yeah, VS Code, man, I was bullied into using VS Code
[02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:02.000]   'cause Twitter would always see my screenshots
[02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:04.160]   of Sublime Text and say, "Why are you still using Sublime Text?"
[02:44:04.160 --> 02:44:07.280]   Like, "Boomer, you need to use VS Code."
[02:44:07.280 --> 02:44:08.240]   And I'm like, "Okay, I'll try it."
[02:44:08.240 --> 02:44:10.800]   I got a new MacBook and then I never install,
[02:44:10.800 --> 02:44:12.720]   like, I never copy the old MacBook.
[02:44:12.720 --> 02:44:14.720]   I just make it fresh, you know, like a clean,
[02:44:14.720 --> 02:44:17.680]   like Format C, you know, Windows, like clean start.
[02:44:17.680 --> 02:44:19.040]   And I'm like, "Okay, I'll try VS Code."
[02:44:19.040 --> 02:44:21.040]   And it's stuck, you know, but I don't really care.
[02:44:21.040 --> 02:44:22.560]   Like, it's not so important for me.
[02:44:22.560 --> 02:44:24.800]   - Wow, you know the Format C reference, huh?
[02:44:24.800 --> 02:44:25.840]   - Dude, it was so good.
[02:44:25.840 --> 02:44:27.280]   You would install Windows
[02:44:27.280 --> 02:44:28.800]   and then after three or six months,
[02:44:28.800 --> 02:44:31.040]   it would start breaking and everything was like,
[02:44:31.040 --> 02:44:33.840]   it gets slow and you would restart,
[02:44:33.840 --> 02:44:37.440]   go to DOS, Format C, you would delete your hard drive
[02:44:37.440 --> 02:44:40.160]   and then install the Windows 95 again.
[02:44:40.160 --> 02:44:41.840]   It was so good times.
[02:44:41.840 --> 02:44:43.360]   And you would design everything like,
[02:44:43.360 --> 02:44:44.720]   now I'm gonna install it properly.
[02:44:44.720 --> 02:44:46.800]   Now I'm gonna design my desktop properly, you know, like.
[02:44:46.800 --> 02:44:48.240]   - Yeah, I don't know if it's peer pressure,
[02:44:48.240 --> 02:44:50.240]   but like I used Emacs for many, many years
[02:44:50.240 --> 02:44:52.800]   and I know, you know, I love Lisp.
[02:44:52.800 --> 02:44:55.920]   So a lot of the customization is done in Lisp.
[02:44:55.920 --> 02:44:57.360]   It's a programming language.
[02:44:57.360 --> 02:44:58.320]   Partially it was peer pressure,
[02:44:58.320 --> 02:45:00.240]   but part of it was realizing like,
[02:45:00.240 --> 02:45:01.520]   you need to keep learning stuff.
[02:45:01.520 --> 02:45:04.240]   Like the same issue with jQuery,
[02:45:04.240 --> 02:45:07.600]   like I still think I need to learn Node.js for example.
[02:45:07.600 --> 02:45:10.240]   Even though that's not my main thing
[02:45:10.240 --> 02:45:11.520]   or even close to the main thing,
[02:45:11.520 --> 02:45:14.240]   but I feel like you need to keep learning this stuff.
[02:45:14.240 --> 02:45:19.200]   And even if you don't choose to use it long-term,
[02:45:19.200 --> 02:45:20.480]   you need to give it a chance.
[02:45:20.480 --> 02:45:23.600]   So your understanding of the world expands.
[02:45:23.600 --> 02:45:25.920]   - Yeah, you wanna understand the new technological concepts
[02:45:25.920 --> 02:45:28.000]   and see if they can benefit you.
[02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:29.520]   You know, it would be stupid not to even try.
[02:45:29.520 --> 02:45:31.440]   - It's more about the concepts, I would say,
[02:45:31.440 --> 02:45:34.480]   than the actual tools, like expanding.
[02:45:34.480 --> 02:45:35.840]   And that can be a challenging thing.
[02:45:35.840 --> 02:45:38.000]   So going to VS Code and like really learning it,
[02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:39.600]   like all the shortcuts, all the extensions
[02:45:39.600 --> 02:45:41.120]   and actually installing different stuff
[02:45:41.120 --> 02:45:44.320]   and playing with it, that was a interesting challenge.
[02:45:44.320 --> 02:45:45.840]   It was uncomfortable at first.
[02:45:45.840 --> 02:45:46.800]   - Yeah, for me too, yeah.
[02:45:46.800 --> 02:45:48.160]   - Yeah, but you just dive in.
[02:45:48.160 --> 02:45:50.400]   - It's like neuroflex, like you keep your brain fresh,
[02:45:50.400 --> 02:45:51.840]   you know, like this kind of stuff.
[02:45:51.840 --> 02:45:52.880]   - I gotta do that more.
[02:45:52.880 --> 02:45:54.880]   Like, have you given React a chance?
[02:45:54.880 --> 02:45:57.520]   - No, but I wanna learn it.
[02:45:57.520 --> 02:45:59.520]   I understand the basics, right?
[02:45:59.520 --> 02:46:02.800]   I don't really know where to start.
[02:46:02.800 --> 02:46:06.320]   - But would you like, I guess you gotta use your own model,
[02:46:06.320 --> 02:46:08.960]   which is like build the thing using it.
[02:46:08.960 --> 02:46:11.040]   - No, man, so I kind of did that.
[02:46:11.040 --> 02:46:14.480]   Like the stuff I do in jQuery is essentially,
[02:46:14.480 --> 02:46:17.920]   a lot of it is like I start rebuilding
[02:46:17.920 --> 02:46:19.840]   whatever tech is already out there,
[02:46:19.840 --> 02:46:21.600]   not based on that, but just an accident.
[02:46:21.600 --> 02:46:23.360]   Like I keep coding long enough that I build the same,
[02:46:23.360 --> 02:46:25.840]   I start getting the same problems everybody else has
[02:46:25.840 --> 02:46:27.360]   and you start building the same frameworks kind of.
[02:46:27.360 --> 02:46:29.680]   So essentially I use my own kind of framework of--
[02:46:29.680 --> 02:46:31.280]   - So you basically build a framework from scratch
[02:46:31.280 --> 02:46:32.720]   that's your own, that you understand it.
[02:46:32.720 --> 02:46:34.240]   - Kind of, yeah, with AJAX calls.
[02:46:34.240 --> 02:46:35.840]   Essentially it's the same thing.
[02:46:35.840 --> 02:46:36.720]   Look, I don't have the time.
[02:46:36.720 --> 02:46:40.800]   I think saying you don't have the time is like always a lie
[02:46:40.800 --> 02:46:42.400]   'cause you just don't prioritize it enough.
[02:46:42.400 --> 02:46:45.920]   My priority is still like running the businesses
[02:46:45.920 --> 02:46:47.280]   and improving that and AI.
[02:46:47.280 --> 02:46:49.040]   I think learning AI is much more valuable now
[02:46:49.040 --> 02:46:51.520]   than learning a front-end framework.
[02:46:51.520 --> 02:46:52.000]   - Yeah.
[02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:53.360]   - Like it's just more impact.
[02:46:53.520 --> 02:46:55.120]   - I guess you should be just learning
[02:46:55.120 --> 02:46:57.840]   every single day a thing.
[02:46:57.840 --> 02:46:59.760]   - Yeah, you can learn a little bit every day,
[02:46:59.760 --> 02:47:01.200]   like a little bit of React
[02:47:01.200 --> 02:47:03.280]   or I think now like Next is very big.
[02:47:03.280 --> 02:47:05.600]   So learn a little bit of Next, you know.
[02:47:05.600 --> 02:47:07.520]   But I call them the military industrial complex.
[02:47:07.520 --> 02:47:10.800]   So if I, you need to know it anyway, so.
[02:47:10.800 --> 02:47:13.840]   - You gotta learn how to use the weapons of war
[02:47:13.840 --> 02:47:15.520]   and then you can be a peace maker.
[02:47:15.520 --> 02:47:16.160]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:47:16.160 --> 02:47:18.880]   - Yeah, I mean, but you gotta learn it
[02:47:18.880 --> 02:47:21.440]   in the same exact ways we were talking about,
[02:47:21.440 --> 02:47:24.160]   which is learn it by trying to build something with it
[02:47:24.160 --> 02:47:25.200]   and actually deploy it.
[02:47:25.200 --> 02:47:26.720]   - The frameworks are so complicated
[02:47:26.720 --> 02:47:28.160]   and it changes so fast.
[02:47:28.160 --> 02:47:30.640]   So it's like, where do I start, you know?
[02:47:30.640 --> 02:47:31.440]   And I guess it's the same thing
[02:47:31.440 --> 02:47:32.640]   when you're starting out making websites,
[02:47:32.640 --> 02:47:33.760]   like where do you start?
[02:47:33.760 --> 02:47:35.680]   Yeah, it's GPT-4, I guess.
[02:47:35.680 --> 02:47:38.880]   But it, yeah, it's just so dynamic.
[02:47:38.880 --> 02:47:40.080]   It changes so fast that I don't know
[02:47:40.080 --> 02:47:42.400]   if it would be a good idea for me to learn it, you know.
[02:47:42.400 --> 02:47:46.320]   Maybe some combination of like Vue, Next
[02:47:46.320 --> 02:47:48.160]   with PHP Laravel.
[02:47:48.160 --> 02:47:49.840]   Laravel is like a framework for PHP.
[02:47:50.400 --> 02:47:53.760]   I think that would be, it could benefit me, you know.
[02:47:53.760 --> 02:47:56.000]   Maybe Tailwind for CSS, like a styling engine.
[02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:58.240]   That stuff could probably save me time.
[02:47:58.240 --> 02:48:00.320]   - Yeah, but like you won't know
[02:48:00.320 --> 02:48:01.520]   until you really give it a try
[02:48:01.520 --> 02:48:03.280]   and it feels like you have to build,
[02:48:03.280 --> 02:48:05.360]   like if maybe I'm talking to myself,
[02:48:05.360 --> 02:48:09.040]   but like I should probably recode
[02:48:09.040 --> 02:48:12.800]   like my personal one page in Laravel or...
[02:48:12.800 --> 02:48:13.440]   - Yeah.
[02:48:13.440 --> 02:48:15.440]   - And even though it might not have
[02:48:15.440 --> 02:48:17.040]   almost any dynamic elements,
[02:48:17.040 --> 02:48:18.480]   maybe have one dynamic element,
[02:48:18.480 --> 02:48:21.440]   but it has to go end-to-end in that framework.
[02:48:21.440 --> 02:48:21.920]   - Yeah.
[02:48:21.920 --> 02:48:23.920]   - Or like end-to-end build in Node.js.
[02:48:23.920 --> 02:48:25.280]   Some of it is, I don't,
[02:48:25.280 --> 02:48:28.000]   figuring out how to even deploy the thing.
[02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:29.200]   - I have no idea.
[02:48:29.200 --> 02:48:31.440]   All I know is right now I would send it to GitHub
[02:48:31.440 --> 02:48:32.480]   and it sends it to my server.
[02:48:32.480 --> 02:48:34.560]   I don't know how to get JavaScript running.
[02:48:34.560 --> 02:48:35.520]   I have no clue.
[02:48:35.520 --> 02:48:36.000]   - Yeah.
[02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:39.280]   - So I guess I need like a pass,
[02:48:39.280 --> 02:48:40.800]   like a, like Versal, right?
[02:48:40.800 --> 02:48:44.400]   Or, you know, Heroku, kind of those kind of platforms.
[02:48:44.400 --> 02:48:46.960]   - I actually kind of just gave myself the idea
[02:48:47.520 --> 02:48:50.480]   of like, I kind of just want to build a single webpage,
[02:48:50.480 --> 02:48:55.120]   like one webpage that has like one dynamic element
[02:48:55.120 --> 02:48:57.360]   and just do it in every single,
[02:48:57.360 --> 02:48:59.120]   like in a lot of frameworks.
[02:48:59.120 --> 02:48:59.520]   Like just...
[02:48:59.520 --> 02:49:00.560]   - Ah, on the same page.
[02:49:00.560 --> 02:49:03.360]   - Same exact kind of page.
[02:49:03.360 --> 02:49:04.080]   - That's smart. That's a cool project.
[02:49:04.080 --> 02:49:04.240]   - Like...
[02:49:04.240 --> 02:49:05.680]   - In all these frameworks.
[02:49:05.680 --> 02:49:05.920]   - Yeah.
[02:49:05.920 --> 02:49:07.120]   - And you can see the differences.
[02:49:07.120 --> 02:49:07.600]   - Yeah.
[02:49:07.600 --> 02:49:08.560]   - That's interesting.
[02:49:08.560 --> 02:49:09.440]   - All it takes to do it.
[02:49:09.440 --> 02:49:10.240]   - Yeah, stopwatch.
[02:49:10.240 --> 02:49:12.320]   - I have to figure out actually
[02:49:12.320 --> 02:49:14.560]   something sufficiently complicated
[02:49:14.560 --> 02:49:15.920]   'cause it should probably do,
[02:49:16.640 --> 02:49:19.680]   it should probably do some kind of thing
[02:49:19.680 --> 02:49:21.520]   where it accesses the database
[02:49:21.520 --> 02:49:23.040]   and dynamically is changing stuff.
[02:49:23.040 --> 02:49:24.960]   - Some AI stuff, some LLM stuff.
[02:49:24.960 --> 02:49:27.280]   - Yeah, maybe some, it doesn't have to be AI alone,
[02:49:27.280 --> 02:49:29.840]   but maybe API call to something.
[02:49:29.840 --> 02:49:32.240]   - To replicate, for example, and then you have,
[02:49:32.240 --> 02:49:33.440]   yeah, that would be a very cool project.
[02:49:33.440 --> 02:49:34.720]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:49:34.720 --> 02:49:38.480]   And like time it and also report on my happiness.
[02:49:38.480 --> 02:49:38.960]   - Yeah.
[02:49:38.960 --> 02:49:40.800]   - I'm going to totally do this.
[02:49:40.800 --> 02:49:42.320]   - 'Cause nobody benchmarks this.
[02:49:42.320 --> 02:49:44.720]   Nobody's benchmarked developer happiness with frameworks.
[02:49:44.720 --> 02:49:44.960]   - Yeah.
[02:49:44.960 --> 02:49:46.640]   - Nobody's benchmarked the shipping time.
[02:49:46.640 --> 02:49:49.280]   - I like to just take like a month and do this.
[02:49:49.280 --> 02:49:50.480]   How many frameworks are there?
[02:49:50.480 --> 02:49:52.880]   There's how many, how many,
[02:49:52.880 --> 02:49:55.200]   there's like five main ways of doing it.
[02:49:55.200 --> 02:49:58.160]   So there's like, there's backend, frontend.
[02:49:58.160 --> 02:49:59.600]   - And this stuff confused me too.
[02:49:59.600 --> 02:50:01.760]   Like React now apparently has become backend.
[02:50:01.760 --> 02:50:02.160]   - Yeah.
[02:50:02.160 --> 02:50:04.080]   - Or something that used to be only frontend
[02:50:04.080 --> 02:50:06.320]   and you're forced to do now backend also, I don't know.
[02:50:06.320 --> 02:50:07.760]   - And then, but there's not really,
[02:50:07.760 --> 02:50:09.280]   you're not really forced to do anything.
[02:50:09.280 --> 02:50:12.400]   So like, according to the internet.
[02:50:12.400 --> 02:50:15.280]   So like, there's no, it's actually not trivial
[02:50:15.280 --> 02:50:17.520]   to find the canonical way of doing things.
[02:50:17.520 --> 02:50:19.840]   So like the standard vanilla, like you should,
[02:50:19.840 --> 02:50:21.120]   you go to the ice cream shop,
[02:50:21.120 --> 02:50:22.880]   there's like a million flavors.
[02:50:22.880 --> 02:50:24.080]   I want vanilla.
[02:50:24.080 --> 02:50:26.240]   If I've never had ice cream in my life,
[02:50:26.240 --> 02:50:30.080]   can we just like learn about ice cream?
[02:50:30.080 --> 02:50:30.720]   - Yeah.
[02:50:30.720 --> 02:50:32.160]   - I want vanilla.
[02:50:32.160 --> 02:50:35.360]   Nobody actually, sometimes they'll literally name it vanilla.
[02:50:35.360 --> 02:50:38.080]   But like, I want to know what's the basic way,
[02:50:38.080 --> 02:50:42.320]   but not like dumb, but like the standard canonical.
[02:50:42.320 --> 02:50:43.760]   - Yeah, I want to know the dominant way.
[02:50:43.760 --> 02:50:46.080]   Like 60% of developers do it like this.
[02:50:46.080 --> 02:50:46.560]   - Yeah.
[02:50:46.560 --> 02:50:47.840]   - It's hard to figure that out.
[02:50:47.840 --> 02:50:48.800]   You know, that's the problem.
[02:50:48.800 --> 02:50:51.760]   - Yeah, maybe LLMs can help.
[02:50:51.760 --> 02:50:54.560]   Maybe you should explicitly ask, what is the dominant?
[02:50:54.560 --> 02:50:55.920]   - 'Cause they usually know like the dominant.
[02:50:55.920 --> 02:50:57.520]   You know, they give answers
[02:50:57.520 --> 02:50:59.120]   that are like the most probable kind of.
[02:50:59.120 --> 02:50:59.520]   - Yeah.
[02:50:59.520 --> 02:51:01.360]   - So that makes sense to ask LLM.
[02:51:01.360 --> 02:51:04.720]   And I think honestly, maybe what would help
[02:51:04.720 --> 02:51:06.000]   is if you want to learn,
[02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:07.840]   or I would want to learn like a framework,
[02:51:07.840 --> 02:51:09.920]   hire somebody that already does it
[02:51:09.920 --> 02:51:12.960]   and just sit with them and make something together.
[02:51:12.960 --> 02:51:14.960]   Like I've never done that, but I've thought about it.
[02:51:14.960 --> 02:51:16.960]   So it would be a very fast way to, you know,
[02:51:16.960 --> 02:51:19.600]   take their knowledge, put it in my brain.
[02:51:19.600 --> 02:51:21.040]   - I've tried these kinds of things.
[02:51:21.040 --> 02:51:23.200]   What happens is, it depends what kind of,
[02:51:23.200 --> 02:51:24.960]   if they're like a world-class developer, yes.
[02:51:24.960 --> 02:51:29.040]   Oftentimes they themselves are used to that thing
[02:51:29.040 --> 02:51:32.240]   and they have not themselves explored in other options.
[02:51:32.240 --> 02:51:35.040]   So they have this dogmatic, like talking down to you.
[02:51:35.040 --> 02:51:35.520]   - Yeah.
[02:51:36.320 --> 02:51:38.000]   - Like this is the right way to do it.
[02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:38.320]   - Yeah.
[02:51:38.320 --> 02:51:39.280]   - It's like, no, no, no.
[02:51:39.280 --> 02:51:40.640]   We're just like exploring together.
[02:51:40.640 --> 02:51:42.720]   Okay, show me the cool thing you've tried.
[02:51:42.720 --> 02:51:47.920]   Which is like, it has to have open-mindedness to like,
[02:51:47.920 --> 02:51:53.440]   you know, Node.js is not the right way to do web development.
[02:51:53.440 --> 02:51:54.960]   It's like one way.
[02:51:54.960 --> 02:51:58.960]   And there's nothing wrong with the old LAMP,
[02:51:58.960 --> 02:52:02.960]   PHP, jQuery, vanilla JavaScript way.
[02:52:02.960 --> 02:52:04.480]   It just has its pros and cons.
[02:52:04.480 --> 02:52:06.080]   And like, you need to know what the pros and cons are.
[02:52:06.080 --> 02:52:06.720]   - Yeah, but those people exist.
[02:52:06.720 --> 02:52:07.920]   You could find those people probably.
[02:52:07.920 --> 02:52:08.800]   - Yeah.
[02:52:08.800 --> 02:52:10.480]   - Like if you want to learn AI,
[02:52:10.480 --> 02:52:12.240]   imagine you have Karpathy sitting next to you.
[02:52:12.240 --> 02:52:12.480]   - Yeah.
[02:52:12.480 --> 02:52:14.400]   - Teach you LLM, like he does his YouTube videos.
[02:52:14.400 --> 02:52:14.960]   It's amazing.
[02:52:14.960 --> 02:52:18.880]   He can teach it to like a five-year-old about how to make LLM.
[02:52:18.880 --> 02:52:19.760]   It's amazing.
[02:52:19.760 --> 02:52:21.440]   Like imagine this guy sitting next to you
[02:52:21.440 --> 02:52:23.360]   and just teaching you like, let's make LLM together.
[02:52:23.360 --> 02:52:25.600]   Like, holy shit, it would be amazing.
[02:52:25.600 --> 02:52:30.000]   - Yeah, I mean, well, Karpathy has its own style.
[02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:32.800]   And it's like, I'm not sure he's for everybody.
[02:52:32.800 --> 02:52:34.000]   But for example, five-year-old,
[02:52:34.000 --> 02:52:35.120]   it depends on the five-year-old.
[02:52:35.120 --> 02:52:35.440]   - Yeah.
[02:52:35.440 --> 02:52:37.520]   - But he's like super technical.
[02:52:37.520 --> 02:52:39.040]   - But he's amazing 'cause he's super technical.
[02:52:39.040 --> 02:52:42.400]   And he's the only one who can explain stuff in a simple way,
[02:52:42.400 --> 02:52:44.240]   which shows his complete genius.
[02:52:44.240 --> 02:52:44.640]   - Yes.
[02:52:44.640 --> 02:52:48.480]   - 'Cause if you can explain without jargon, you're like, wow.
[02:52:48.480 --> 02:52:49.920]   - And build it from scratch.
[02:52:49.920 --> 02:52:52.800]   - Yeah, it's like top tier, you know, like what a guy.
[02:52:52.800 --> 02:52:56.800]   - But he might be anti-framework 'cause he builds from scratch.
[02:52:56.800 --> 02:52:58.720]   - Exactly, yeah, actually probably is, yeah.
[02:52:58.720 --> 02:53:01.280]   - He's like Yubo for AI.
[02:53:01.280 --> 02:53:03.120]   - Yeah, so maybe learning a framework
[02:53:03.120 --> 02:53:04.400]   is a very bad idea for us, you know?
[02:53:04.400 --> 02:53:07.520]   Maybe we should stay in PHP and like Script Kitty.
[02:53:07.520 --> 02:53:10.560]   - But you have to, maybe by learning the framework,
[02:53:10.560 --> 02:53:14.320]   you learn what you want to yourself build from scratch.
[02:53:14.320 --> 02:53:15.520]   - Yeah, maybe you learn concepts,
[02:53:15.520 --> 02:53:16.800]   but you don't actually have to start using it
[02:53:16.800 --> 02:53:17.440]   for your life, right?
[02:53:17.440 --> 02:53:18.400]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:53:18.400 --> 02:53:21.280]   - And you're still a Mac guy, always a Mac guy.
[02:53:21.280 --> 02:53:24.160]   - Yeah, yeah, I switched to Mac in 2014
[02:53:24.160 --> 02:53:26.320]   'cause it was 'cause when I wanted to start traveling
[02:53:26.320 --> 02:53:28.080]   and my brother was like, dude, get a MacBook.
[02:53:28.080 --> 02:53:29.280]   It's like the standard now.
[02:53:29.280 --> 02:53:31.040]   I'm like, wow, I need to switch from Windows.
[02:53:31.040 --> 02:53:33.600]   And I had like three screens, you know, like Windows.
[02:53:33.600 --> 02:53:35.520]   I had this whole setup for music production.
[02:53:35.520 --> 02:53:39.200]   I had to sell everything and then I had a MacBook.
[02:53:39.200 --> 02:53:41.280]   And I remember opening up this MacBook box,
[02:53:41.280 --> 02:53:44.240]   like, ah, and it was so beautiful.
[02:53:44.240 --> 02:53:45.600]   It was like this aluminum.
[02:53:45.600 --> 02:53:48.160]   And then I opened it, I removed the screen protector thing.
[02:53:48.160 --> 02:53:49.680]   It's so beautiful.
[02:53:49.680 --> 02:53:51.440]   And I didn't touch it for three days.
[02:53:51.440 --> 02:53:52.960]   I was just like looking at it, really.
[02:53:52.960 --> 02:53:54.080]   And I was still on the Windows computer
[02:53:54.080 --> 02:53:56.320]   and then I went traveling with that.
[02:53:56.320 --> 02:53:59.200]   And all my great things started when I switched to Mac,
[02:53:59.200 --> 02:54:00.640]   which sounds very dogmatic, right?
[02:54:00.640 --> 02:54:01.760]   But-- - What great things
[02:54:01.760 --> 02:54:02.480]   are you talking about?
[02:54:02.480 --> 02:54:04.240]   - All the business started working out.
[02:54:04.240 --> 02:54:06.880]   Like I started traveling, I started building startups,
[02:54:06.880 --> 02:54:08.240]   I started making money.
[02:54:08.240 --> 02:54:09.680]   It all started when I switched to Mac.
[02:54:09.680 --> 02:54:15.200]   - Listen, I kinda, you're making me wanna switch to Mac.
[02:54:15.200 --> 02:54:18.880]   So I either use Linux inside Windows with WSL
[02:54:18.880 --> 02:54:21.120]   or just Ubuntu Linux.
[02:54:21.120 --> 02:54:24.640]   But Windows for most stuff like editing
[02:54:24.640 --> 02:54:27.440]   or any like Adobe products. - Yeah, like Adobe stuff, right?
[02:54:27.440 --> 02:54:28.160]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:54:28.160 --> 02:54:30.400]   Well, you could use, I guess you could do Mac stuff there.
[02:54:30.400 --> 02:54:32.080]   I wonder if I should switch.
[02:54:32.080 --> 02:54:33.200]   What do you miss about Windows?
[02:54:33.200 --> 02:54:34.320]   What was the pros and cons?
[02:54:34.320 --> 02:54:36.720]   - I think the Finder is horrible on Mac.
[02:54:36.720 --> 02:54:38.560]   Like it's like, it's-- - The what is horrible?
[02:54:38.560 --> 02:54:39.200]   - The Finder.
[02:54:39.200 --> 02:54:40.000]   Oh, you don't know the Finder?
[02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:41.040]   So there's the Windows Explorer?
[02:54:41.040 --> 02:54:41.520]   - Yeah.
[02:54:41.520 --> 02:54:43.840]   - Windows Explorer is amazing. - Thank you for talking about it.
[02:54:43.840 --> 02:54:44.800]   - Finder is strange, man.
[02:54:44.800 --> 02:54:45.680]   There's like strange things.
[02:54:45.680 --> 02:54:48.000]   This is bug where if you send,
[02:54:48.000 --> 02:54:50.000]   like attach a photo on WhatsApp or Telegram,
[02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:52.080]   it just selects the whole folder
[02:54:52.080 --> 02:54:54.160]   and you almost accidentally can click enter.
[02:54:54.160 --> 02:54:55.280]   And you send all your photos,
[02:54:55.280 --> 02:54:57.680]   all your files to this chat group.
[02:54:57.680 --> 02:54:58.880]   Happened to my girlfriend.
[02:54:58.880 --> 02:55:01.440]   She starts sending me photo, photo, photo, photo, photo.
[02:55:01.440 --> 02:55:04.800]   So Finder is very unusual, but it has Linux.
[02:55:04.800 --> 02:55:06.720]   Like the whole thing is like, it's Unix based, right?
[02:55:06.720 --> 02:55:07.680]   - So you use the command?
[02:55:07.680 --> 02:55:09.200]   - Yeah, all the time.
[02:55:09.200 --> 02:55:10.320]   Like all the time.
[02:55:10.320 --> 02:55:11.680]   And the cool thing is you can run,
[02:55:11.680 --> 02:55:14.560]   I think it's like Unix, like Debian or whatever.
[02:55:14.560 --> 02:55:17.680]   You can run most Linux stuff on macOS,
[02:55:17.680 --> 02:55:19.680]   which makes us very good for development.
[02:55:19.680 --> 02:55:21.840]   Like I have my Nginx server.
[02:55:21.840 --> 02:55:23.040]   You know, if I said,
[02:55:23.040 --> 02:55:25.200]   if I'm not lazy and set up my staging on my laptop,
[02:55:25.200 --> 02:55:26.400]   it's just the Nginx server,
[02:55:26.400 --> 02:55:29.440]   the same as I have on my cloud server, right?
[02:55:29.440 --> 02:55:31.040]   The same way the websites run.
[02:55:31.040 --> 02:55:32.800]   And I can use almost everything,
[02:55:32.800 --> 02:55:34.800]   the same config files, configuration files.
[02:55:34.800 --> 02:55:36.320]   And it just works.
[02:55:36.320 --> 02:55:38.320]   And that makes Mac a very good platform
[02:55:38.320 --> 02:55:39.840]   for Linux stuff, I think.
[02:55:39.840 --> 02:55:42.320]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:55:42.320 --> 02:55:44.880]   - Of course, real Ubuntu is like better, of course, but.
[02:55:44.880 --> 02:55:48.160]   - Yeah, I'm in this weird situation
[02:55:48.160 --> 02:55:53.120]   where I'm somewhat of a power user in Windows
[02:55:53.120 --> 02:55:54.960]   and let's say Android,
[02:55:54.960 --> 02:55:59.360]   and all the much smarter friends I have,
[02:55:59.360 --> 02:56:02.400]   all using Mac and iPhone.
[02:56:02.400 --> 02:56:02.880]   And it's like.
[02:56:02.880 --> 02:56:05.600]   - But you don't want to go through the peer pressure.
[02:56:05.600 --> 02:56:06.960]   - It's not peer pressure.
[02:56:06.960 --> 02:56:10.800]   It's like, like one of the reasons I want to have kids
[02:56:10.800 --> 02:56:12.160]   is that there's a lot of,
[02:56:12.160 --> 02:56:15.600]   like I would love to have kids as a baseline,
[02:56:15.600 --> 02:56:16.960]   but you know, there's like a concern,
[02:56:16.960 --> 02:56:18.320]   maybe there's going to be a trade-off
[02:56:18.320 --> 02:56:19.040]   or all this kind of stuff.
[02:56:19.040 --> 02:56:21.200]   But you see like these extremely successful,
[02:56:21.200 --> 02:56:23.200]   smart people who are friends of mine,
[02:56:23.200 --> 02:56:25.440]   who have kids and are really happy they have kids.
[02:56:25.440 --> 02:56:26.880]   So that's not peer pressure.
[02:56:26.880 --> 02:56:28.320]   That's just like a strong signal.
[02:56:28.320 --> 02:56:29.600]   - Yeah, that works for people.
[02:56:29.600 --> 02:56:30.320]   - That works for people.
[02:56:30.320 --> 02:56:30.640]   - Yeah.
[02:56:30.640 --> 02:56:31.760]   - And the same thing with Mac.
[02:56:31.760 --> 02:56:36.800]   It's like, I don't see fundamentally,
[02:56:36.800 --> 02:56:38.640]   I don't like closed systems.
[02:56:38.640 --> 02:56:41.760]   So like fundamentally, I like Windows more
[02:56:41.760 --> 02:56:43.200]   because there's much more freedom.
[02:56:43.200 --> 02:56:44.000]   Same with Android.
[02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:45.280]   There's much more freedom.
[02:56:45.280 --> 02:56:46.800]   It's much more customizable.
[02:56:46.800 --> 02:56:51.200]   But like all the cool kids,
[02:56:51.200 --> 02:56:53.760]   the smart kids are using Mac and iPhone.
[02:56:53.760 --> 02:56:55.840]   It's like, all right, I need to really,
[02:56:55.840 --> 02:56:57.440]   I need to give it a real chance,
[02:56:57.440 --> 02:56:58.800]   especially for development
[02:56:58.800 --> 02:57:00.880]   since more and more stuff is done in the cloud anyway.
[02:57:00.880 --> 02:57:01.280]   - Yeah.
[02:57:01.280 --> 02:57:04.080]   - Well, anyway, but it's funny to hear you say
[02:57:04.080 --> 02:57:05.280]   all the good stuff started happening.
[02:57:05.280 --> 02:57:06.800]   Maybe I'll be like that guy too.
[02:57:06.800 --> 02:57:08.560]   When I switched to Mac,
[02:57:08.560 --> 02:57:09.760]   all the good stuff started happening.
[02:57:09.760 --> 02:57:11.040]   - I think it's just about the hardware.
[02:57:11.040 --> 02:57:12.080]   It's not so much about the software.
[02:57:12.080 --> 02:57:13.920]   The hardware is so well built, right?
[02:57:13.920 --> 02:57:14.720]   The keyboard and--
[02:57:14.720 --> 02:57:16.400]   - Yeah, but look at the keyboard I use.
[02:57:16.400 --> 02:57:17.600]   - Yeah, it's pretty cool.
[02:57:17.600 --> 02:57:20.000]   - That's one word for it.
[02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:22.160]   What's your favorite place to work?
[02:57:22.160 --> 02:57:23.840]   - On the couch.
[02:57:23.840 --> 02:57:25.760]   - Does the couch matter?
[02:57:25.760 --> 02:57:27.680]   Is the couch your home or is it any couch?
[02:57:27.680 --> 02:57:30.720]   - No, like hotel couch also, like in the room, right?
[02:57:30.720 --> 02:57:31.280]   - In the room.
[02:57:31.280 --> 02:57:33.120]   - But I used to work like very ergonomically
[02:57:33.120 --> 02:57:34.320]   with like a standing desk.
[02:57:34.320 --> 02:57:34.800]   - Yeah.
[02:57:34.800 --> 02:57:36.080]   - And everything like perfect,
[02:57:36.080 --> 02:57:38.560]   like eye height, screen, blah, blah, blah.
[02:57:38.560 --> 02:57:41.600]   And I felt like, man, this has to do with lifting too.
[02:57:41.600 --> 02:57:42.640]   I started getting RSI,
[02:57:42.640 --> 02:57:45.120]   like repetitive strain injury, like tingling stuff.
[02:57:45.120 --> 02:57:46.800]   And it would go all the way on my back.
[02:57:46.800 --> 02:57:48.080]   And I was sitting in a coworking space,
[02:57:48.080 --> 02:57:52.320]   like 6 a.m., sun comes up and I'm working and I'm coding.
[02:57:52.320 --> 02:57:54.240]   And I hear like a sound or something.
[02:57:54.240 --> 02:57:57.200]   So I do like, I look left and my neck gets stuck.
[02:57:57.200 --> 02:57:59.920]   Like, and I'm like, wow, fuck.
[02:57:59.920 --> 02:58:03.360]   And I'm like, what's, am I dying?
[02:58:03.360 --> 02:58:04.960]   You know, and I thought I'm probably dying.
[02:58:04.960 --> 02:58:05.520]   - Yeah, probably dying.
[02:58:05.520 --> 02:58:07.040]   - So I don't wanna die in a coworking space.
[02:58:07.040 --> 02:58:10.240]   I'm gonna go home and die in like peace and honor.
[02:58:10.240 --> 02:58:10.560]   - Yeah.
[02:58:10.560 --> 02:58:13.920]   - So I closed my laptop and I put it in my backpack.
[02:58:13.920 --> 02:58:14.320]   - Yeah.
[02:58:14.320 --> 02:58:17.120]   - And I walked to the street, I got on my motorbike, went home.
[02:58:17.120 --> 02:58:22.000]   And I lied down on like a pillow, like with my legs up and stuff,
[02:58:22.000 --> 02:58:25.760]   to get rid of this, like, 'cause it was my whole back.
[02:58:25.760 --> 02:58:27.920]   And it was because I was working like this all the time.
[02:58:27.920 --> 02:58:28.160]   - Yeah.
[02:58:28.160 --> 02:58:31.280]   - So I started getting like a laptop stand,
[02:58:31.280 --> 02:58:33.040]   everything ergonomically correct.
[02:58:33.040 --> 02:58:35.600]   But then I started lifting.
[02:58:35.600 --> 02:58:39.360]   And since then, like, it seems like everything gets straightened out.
[02:58:39.360 --> 02:58:41.120]   Your posture kind of, you're more straight.
[02:58:41.680 --> 02:58:45.120]   And I never have RSI anymore, repetitive injury.
[02:58:45.120 --> 02:58:49.200]   I never have tingling anymore, no pains and stuff.
[02:58:49.200 --> 02:58:52.320]   So then I started working on the sofa and it's great.
[02:58:52.320 --> 02:58:58.080]   Like, it feels, you're close to the, I sit like this.
[02:58:58.080 --> 02:58:58.640]   - Yeah.
[02:58:58.640 --> 02:59:00.960]   - Legs together and then a pillow and then a laptop.
[02:59:00.960 --> 02:59:02.160]   And then I work.
[02:59:02.160 --> 02:59:03.520]   - Are you like leaning back?
[02:59:03.520 --> 02:59:07.440]   - I'm kind of like together, like legs and then--
[02:59:07.440 --> 02:59:09.040]   - Where's the mouse, you're using--
[02:59:09.040 --> 02:59:12.000]   - No, so everything's trackpad on the Mac OS, on the MacBook.
[02:59:12.000 --> 02:59:16.400]   I used to have the Logitech MX mouse, the perfect ergonomic mouse.
[02:59:16.400 --> 02:59:18.800]   - And you're just doing like this little thing with the thing.
[02:59:18.800 --> 02:59:19.120]   - Yes.
[02:59:19.120 --> 02:59:20.080]   - One screen.
[02:59:20.080 --> 02:59:21.200]   - One screen.
[02:59:21.200 --> 02:59:22.240]   And I used to have three screens.
[02:59:22.240 --> 02:59:24.000]   So I come from the, I know where people come from.
[02:59:24.000 --> 02:59:25.360]   I had all the stuff.
[02:59:25.360 --> 02:59:29.600]   But then I realized that having it all condensed in one laptop,
[02:59:29.600 --> 02:59:31.200]   it's a 16-inch MacBook, so it's quite big.
[02:59:31.200 --> 02:59:33.120]   But having it all in there is amazing
[02:59:33.120 --> 02:59:35.440]   'cause you're so close to the tools.
[02:59:35.440 --> 02:59:37.680]   You're so close to what's happening, you know?
[02:59:37.680 --> 02:59:39.200]   It's like working on a car or something.
[02:59:39.200 --> 02:59:43.280]   It's like, so like, man, if you have three screens,
[02:59:43.280 --> 02:59:46.000]   you look here, look there, you get also neck injury actually.
[02:59:46.000 --> 02:59:47.120]   So it's--
[02:59:47.120 --> 02:59:49.520]   - Well, I don't know, this sounds like you're part of a cult
[02:59:49.520 --> 02:59:51.280]   and you're just trying to convince me.
[02:59:51.280 --> 02:59:53.840]   But I mean, but it's good to hear
[02:59:53.840 --> 02:59:56.400]   that you can be ultra productive on a single screen.
[02:59:56.400 --> 02:59:57.360]   That's, I mean, that's crazy.
[02:59:57.360 --> 03:00:00.160]   - Command-Tab, you Alt-Tab, like Windows Alt-Tab,
[03:00:00.160 --> 03:00:01.840]   Mac OS Command-Tab, you can switch very fast.
[03:00:01.840 --> 03:00:05.360]   - So you have like one, the entire screen is taken up by VS Code,
[03:00:05.360 --> 03:00:06.720]   say you're looking at the code and then--
[03:00:06.720 --> 03:00:08.080]   - Yeah. - And then like,
[03:00:08.080 --> 03:00:10.480]   if you deploy like a website, you what, switch screens.
[03:00:10.480 --> 03:00:11.840]   - Command-Tab to Chrome.
[03:00:11.840 --> 03:00:13.200]   I used to have this swipe screen, you know,
[03:00:13.200 --> 03:00:16.400]   you could do like different screen spaces.
[03:00:16.400 --> 03:00:17.760]   - Yeah. - I was like,
[03:00:17.760 --> 03:00:18.800]   ah, it's too difficult.
[03:00:18.800 --> 03:00:21.760]   Let's just put it on one screen on the MacBook and then--
[03:00:21.760 --> 03:00:23.200]   - And you can be productive that way.
[03:00:23.200 --> 03:00:25.520]   - Yeah, very productive, yeah.
[03:00:25.520 --> 03:00:26.800]   More productive than before.
[03:00:26.800 --> 03:00:29.280]   - Interesting, because I have three screens
[03:00:29.280 --> 03:00:30.400]   and two of them are vertical.
[03:00:30.400 --> 03:00:33.840]   - Yeah, the code, right, yeah. - For the code, you can see a lot.
[03:00:33.840 --> 03:00:35.200]   - Yeah, no, man, I love it.
[03:00:35.200 --> 03:00:36.800]   Like I love seeing it with friends.
[03:00:36.800 --> 03:00:39.120]   Like they have amazing like battle stations, right, it's called.
[03:00:39.120 --> 03:00:39.760]   It's amazing.
[03:00:39.760 --> 03:00:41.680]   I want it, but I don't want it, right?
[03:00:41.680 --> 03:00:42.960]   Like-- - You like the constraints.
[03:00:42.960 --> 03:00:44.320]   - There's-- - That's it.
[03:00:44.320 --> 03:00:46.400]   - There's some aspect of the constraints,
[03:00:46.400 --> 03:00:48.480]   which like once you get good at it,
[03:00:48.480 --> 03:00:49.920]   you can focus your mind and you can--
[03:00:49.920 --> 03:00:51.920]   - Man, I'm suspicious of like more, you know?
[03:00:51.920 --> 03:00:53.120]   - Yeah. - Do we really need
[03:00:53.120 --> 03:00:53.600]   all this stuff?
[03:00:53.600 --> 03:00:55.120]   Like it might slow me down, actually.
[03:00:55.120 --> 03:00:56.160]   - It's a good way to put it.
[03:00:56.160 --> 03:00:57.840]   I'm suspicious of more.
[03:00:57.840 --> 03:01:01.600]   Me too, I'm suspicious of more in all ways.
[03:01:01.600 --> 03:01:03.040]   - Because you can defend more, right?
[03:01:03.040 --> 03:01:04.880]   You can defend, yeah, I'm a developer.
[03:01:04.880 --> 03:01:05.360]   I make money.
[03:01:05.360 --> 03:01:06.880]   I need to get more screens, right?
[03:01:06.880 --> 03:01:07.920]   I need to be more efficient.
[03:01:07.920 --> 03:01:11.120]   And then you read stuff about like Mythical Man Month,
[03:01:11.120 --> 03:01:12.880]   where like hiring more people
[03:01:12.880 --> 03:01:15.840]   slows down a software project that's famous.
[03:01:15.840 --> 03:01:18.960]   I think you can use that metaphor maybe for, you know, tools as well.
[03:01:18.960 --> 03:01:21.360]   And I see friends just with gear acquisition syndrome
[03:01:21.360 --> 03:01:24.560]   that buying so much stuff, but they're not that productive.
[03:01:24.560 --> 03:01:27.600]   They have the best, most beautiful battle stations,
[03:01:27.600 --> 03:01:28.960]   desktops, everything.
[03:01:28.960 --> 03:01:30.160]   They're not that productive.
[03:01:30.160 --> 03:01:31.200]   And it's also like kind of fun.
[03:01:31.200 --> 03:01:33.360]   Like it's all from my laptop in a backpack, right?
[03:01:33.360 --> 03:01:34.560]   It's kind of nomad, minimalist.
[03:01:34.560 --> 03:01:38.160]   - Take me through like the perfect ultra-productive day in your life.
[03:01:38.160 --> 03:01:43.120]   Like say like where you get a lot of shit done.
[03:01:43.120 --> 03:01:43.600]   - Yeah.
[03:01:43.600 --> 03:01:47.200]   - Are you, and it's all focused on getting shit done.
[03:01:47.200 --> 03:01:49.520]   When are you waking up?
[03:01:49.520 --> 03:01:50.480]   Is it a regular time?
[03:01:50.480 --> 03:01:52.160]   Super early, super late?
[03:01:52.160 --> 03:01:54.960]   - Yes, so I go to sleep like 2 a.m. usually, something like that.
[03:01:54.960 --> 03:02:00.000]   And before 4 a.m., but my girlfriend would go sleep midnight.
[03:02:00.000 --> 03:02:01.840]   So we did a compromise like 2 a.m., you know?
[03:02:02.400 --> 03:02:04.880]   So I wake up around 10, 11, more like 10.
[03:02:04.880 --> 03:02:08.480]   Shower, make coffee.
[03:02:08.480 --> 03:02:12.240]   I make coffee, like drip coffee, like the V60, you know, the filter.
[03:02:12.240 --> 03:02:14.240]   And I boil water and then put the coffee in.
[03:02:14.240 --> 03:02:18.080]   And then chill a little bit with my girlfriend
[03:02:18.080 --> 03:02:20.320]   and then open laptop, start coding.
[03:02:20.320 --> 03:02:22.400]   Check what's going on, like bugs or whatever.
[03:02:22.400 --> 03:02:25.840]   - How long are you, like how stretches of time
[03:02:25.840 --> 03:02:28.000]   are you able to just sit behind the computer coding?
[03:02:28.000 --> 03:02:30.240]   - So I used to need like really long stretches
[03:02:30.240 --> 03:02:32.480]   where I would do like all nighters and stuff to get shit done.
[03:02:32.480 --> 03:02:36.320]   But I've gotten trained to like have more interruptions
[03:02:36.320 --> 03:02:37.920]   where I can like-- - 'Cause you have to.
[03:02:37.920 --> 03:02:40.320]   - This is life, like there's a lot of distractions.
[03:02:40.320 --> 03:02:43.440]   Like your girlfriend asks stuff, people come over, whatever.
[03:02:43.440 --> 03:02:45.440]   So I'm very fast now.
[03:02:45.440 --> 03:02:47.520]   I can lock in and lock out quite fast.
[03:02:47.520 --> 03:02:49.600]   And I heard people, developers or entrepreneurs
[03:02:49.600 --> 03:02:50.720]   with kids have the same thing.
[03:02:50.720 --> 03:02:52.400]   Like before they're like, "Ah, I cannot work."
[03:02:52.400 --> 03:02:55.200]   But they get used to it and they get really productive
[03:02:55.200 --> 03:02:58.160]   in like short time because they only have like 20 minutes
[03:02:58.160 --> 03:02:59.520]   and then shit goes crazy again.
[03:03:00.080 --> 03:03:01.680]   So I'm not a constraint, right?
[03:03:01.680 --> 03:03:02.880]   - Yeah, that's funny.
[03:03:02.880 --> 03:03:05.520]   - So I think that works for me.
[03:03:05.520 --> 03:03:08.240]   But yeah, and then cook food and stuff,
[03:03:08.240 --> 03:03:10.640]   like have lunch, steak and chicken.
[03:03:10.640 --> 03:03:12.400]   - You eat a bunch of times a day.
[03:03:12.400 --> 03:03:14.480]   So you say coffee, what are you doing?
[03:03:14.480 --> 03:03:16.800]   - Yeah, so a few hours later, cook foods.
[03:03:16.800 --> 03:03:18.880]   We get like locally sourced, like meat and stuff
[03:03:18.880 --> 03:03:20.720]   and vegetables and cook that.
[03:03:20.720 --> 03:03:24.320]   And then second coffee and then go some more.
[03:03:24.320 --> 03:03:25.360]   Maybe go outside for lunch.
[03:03:25.360 --> 03:03:27.200]   Like you can mix fun stuff, you know?
[03:03:27.200 --> 03:03:28.720]   - How many hours are you saying
[03:03:28.720 --> 03:03:31.280]   a perfectly productive day are you doing programming?
[03:03:31.280 --> 03:03:32.640]   Like if you were like to kill it,
[03:03:32.640 --> 03:03:34.800]   are you doing like all day basically?
[03:03:34.800 --> 03:03:36.080]   - You mean like the special days
[03:03:36.080 --> 03:03:38.960]   where like girlfriend leaves to like Paris or something
[03:03:38.960 --> 03:03:41.920]   and you're alone for a week at home, which is amazing.
[03:03:41.920 --> 03:03:43.360]   You can just go, it's like,
[03:03:43.360 --> 03:03:45.120]   and you stay up all night and eat chocolate.
[03:03:45.120 --> 03:03:46.640]   - Yeah, eat chocolate.
[03:03:46.640 --> 03:03:48.160]   Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, okay.
[03:03:48.160 --> 03:03:49.760]   Let's remove girlfriend from picture,
[03:03:49.760 --> 03:03:51.440]   social life from picture.
[03:03:51.440 --> 03:03:52.160]   It's just you.
[03:03:52.160 --> 03:03:54.160]   - Man, then shit goes crazy.
[03:03:54.160 --> 03:03:55.920]   - Okay, yeah, 'cause when shit goes crazy.
[03:03:55.920 --> 03:03:56.800]   - Now shit goes crazy.
[03:03:56.880 --> 03:04:00.160]   - Okay, so let's rewind.
[03:04:00.160 --> 03:04:01.440]   Are you still waking up?
[03:04:01.440 --> 03:04:02.080]   There's coffee.
[03:04:02.080 --> 03:04:03.360]   There's no girlfriend to talk to.
[03:04:03.360 --> 03:04:09.280]   - And now we wake up like 1 p.m to 2 p.m.
[03:04:09.280 --> 03:04:13.280]   - 'Cause you went to bed at 6 a.m.
[03:04:13.280 --> 03:04:14.400]   - Yeah, 'cause I was coding.
[03:04:14.400 --> 03:04:17.680]   I was finding some new AI shit and I was studying it
[03:04:17.680 --> 03:04:18.560]   and it was amazing.
[03:04:18.560 --> 03:04:20.160]   And I cannot sleep 'cause it's too important.
[03:04:20.160 --> 03:04:20.880]   We need to stay awake.
[03:04:20.880 --> 03:04:21.920]   We need to see all of this.
[03:04:21.920 --> 03:04:23.200]   We need to make something now.
[03:04:24.080 --> 03:04:27.360]   But that's the times I do make like new stuff more.
[03:04:27.360 --> 03:04:31.120]   So I think, I have a friend, he actually books a hotel
[03:04:31.120 --> 03:04:33.920]   for like a week to like leave his, and he has a kid too.
[03:04:33.920 --> 03:04:35.440]   And his girlfriend and his kid stay in the house
[03:04:35.440 --> 03:04:36.720]   and he goes to another hotel.
[03:04:36.720 --> 03:04:38.480]   Sounds a little suspicious, right?
[03:04:38.480 --> 03:04:38.960]   Going to a hotel.
[03:04:38.960 --> 03:04:41.760]   But all he does is like writing or coding.
[03:04:41.760 --> 03:04:44.320]   He's a writer and he needs like this alone time,
[03:04:44.320 --> 03:04:45.040]   this silence.
[03:04:45.040 --> 03:04:47.760]   And I think for this flow state, it's true.
[03:04:47.760 --> 03:04:51.440]   I'm better maintaining stuff when there's a lot
[03:04:51.440 --> 03:04:53.120]   of disruptions than like creating new stuff.
[03:04:53.120 --> 03:04:55.280]   I need this, and it's common, it's flow state.
[03:04:55.280 --> 03:04:57.520]   It's this uninterrupted period of time.
[03:04:57.520 --> 03:05:00.480]   So yeah, I wake up like one, 2 p.m.
[03:05:00.480 --> 03:05:03.680]   Still coffee, shower, we still shower.
[03:05:03.680 --> 03:05:07.520]   And then just code like nonstop.
[03:05:07.520 --> 03:05:08.480]   Maybe my friend comes over.
[03:05:08.480 --> 03:05:10.720]   - Just some distraction.
[03:05:10.720 --> 03:05:12.800]   - Yeah, he also, Andre, he codes too.
[03:05:12.800 --> 03:05:14.400]   So he comes over, we code together.
[03:05:14.400 --> 03:05:17.360]   We listen, it starts going back to like the Bali days,
[03:05:17.360 --> 03:05:18.800]   you know, like coworking days.
[03:05:18.800 --> 03:05:20.480]   - So you're not really working with him,
[03:05:20.480 --> 03:05:21.680]   but you're just both working.
[03:05:21.680 --> 03:05:23.360]   - Because it's nice to have like a vibe
[03:05:23.360 --> 03:05:25.440]   where you both sit together on the couch
[03:05:25.440 --> 03:05:26.720]   and coding or something.
[03:05:26.720 --> 03:05:29.120]   And you actually, it's mostly silent or there's music,
[03:05:29.120 --> 03:05:31.040]   you know, and sometimes you ask something
[03:05:31.040 --> 03:05:33.600]   and, but generally like you're really locked in.
[03:05:33.600 --> 03:05:35.840]   - And what music are you listening to?
[03:05:35.840 --> 03:05:40.560]   - I think like techno, like YouTube techno.
[03:05:40.560 --> 03:05:44.480]   There's a channel called HOR with a umlaut,
[03:05:44.480 --> 03:05:46.480]   like H-O, like double dot.
[03:05:46.480 --> 03:05:48.640]   It's Berlin techno, whatever.
[03:05:48.640 --> 03:05:51.360]   It looks like they film it in like a toilet
[03:05:51.360 --> 03:05:52.800]   with like white tiles and stuff.
[03:05:52.800 --> 03:05:53.600]   And it's very cool.
[03:05:53.600 --> 03:05:55.840]   And they always have like very good,
[03:05:55.840 --> 03:05:57.280]   like kind of industrial, like.
[03:05:57.280 --> 03:05:59.040]   - Industrial, so fast paced, heavy.
[03:05:59.040 --> 03:06:00.560]   - Kind of aggressive, you know, like.
[03:06:00.560 --> 03:06:02.640]   - Yeah, that's not distracting to your brain?
[03:06:02.640 --> 03:06:04.000]   - No, it's amazing.
[03:06:04.000 --> 03:06:06.320]   Like I think distracting, man, jazz.
[03:06:06.320 --> 03:06:08.000]   Like I listen to coffee jazz with my girlfriend
[03:06:08.000 --> 03:06:09.200]   when I wake up and it's kind of like,
[03:06:09.200 --> 03:06:10.560]   this piano starts getting annoying.
[03:06:10.560 --> 03:06:14.080]   It's like, it's too many tones.
[03:06:14.080 --> 03:06:15.680]   It's like too many things going on.
[03:06:15.680 --> 03:06:17.360]   This industrial techno is like, you know,
[03:06:17.360 --> 03:06:18.800]   these African like rain dances,
[03:06:18.800 --> 03:06:22.800]   like it's this transcendental trance.
[03:06:22.800 --> 03:06:23.920]   - That's interesting.
[03:06:23.920 --> 03:06:29.600]   'Cause I actually mostly now listen to brown noise, noise.
[03:06:29.600 --> 03:06:30.400]   - Yeah, wow.
[03:06:30.400 --> 03:06:31.680]   - Like pretty loud.
[03:06:31.680 --> 03:06:32.160]   - Wow.
[03:06:32.160 --> 03:06:34.000]   - And one of the things you learn
[03:06:34.000 --> 03:06:35.840]   is your brain gets used to whatever.
[03:06:35.840 --> 03:06:36.800]   So I'm sure to techno,
[03:06:36.800 --> 03:06:38.400]   if I actually give it a real chance,
[03:06:38.400 --> 03:06:40.720]   my brain would get used to it.
[03:06:40.720 --> 03:06:43.200]   But like with noise, what happens?
[03:06:43.200 --> 03:06:44.320]   If something happens to your brain,
[03:06:44.320 --> 03:06:45.280]   I think there's a science to it,
[03:06:45.280 --> 03:06:46.080]   but I don't really care.
[03:06:46.720 --> 03:06:48.880]   You just have to be a scientist of one,
[03:06:48.880 --> 03:06:50.720]   like study yourself, your own brain.
[03:06:50.720 --> 03:06:53.040]   For me, it like, it does something.
[03:06:53.040 --> 03:06:55.200]   I discovered it right away
[03:06:55.200 --> 03:06:56.480]   when I tried it for the first time.
[03:06:56.480 --> 03:06:59.440]   After about like a couple of minutes,
[03:06:59.440 --> 03:07:06.000]   everything, every distraction just like disappears
[03:07:06.000 --> 03:07:12.080]   and it goes like, you can like hold focus on things
[03:07:12.080 --> 03:07:13.600]   like really well, it's weird.
[03:07:13.600 --> 03:07:17.120]   Like you can like really focus on a thing.
[03:07:17.120 --> 03:07:18.640]   It doesn't really matter what that is.
[03:07:18.640 --> 03:07:21.040]   I think that's what people achieve with like meditation.
[03:07:21.040 --> 03:07:23.760]   You can like focus on your breath, for example.
[03:07:23.760 --> 03:07:25.840]   - And it's just normal brown, it's not like binaural.
[03:07:25.840 --> 03:07:26.880]   - No.
[03:07:26.880 --> 03:07:27.760]   - It's just normal brown.
[03:07:27.760 --> 03:07:28.560]   - It's just like, shh.
[03:07:28.560 --> 03:07:29.680]   - Yeah.
[03:07:29.680 --> 03:07:31.520]   - White noise, I think it's the same.
[03:07:31.520 --> 03:07:33.040]   It's like fake noise, white noise.
[03:07:33.040 --> 03:07:36.720]   Brown noise, I think is when it's like bassier.
[03:07:36.720 --> 03:07:38.720]   - Yeah, it's more diffused, more dampened.
[03:07:38.720 --> 03:07:39.520]   - Dampened.
[03:07:39.520 --> 03:07:40.560]   - Yeah, I can see that.
[03:07:40.560 --> 03:07:41.440]   - No sharpness.
[03:07:41.440 --> 03:07:42.640]   - Yeah, sharp brightness.
[03:07:42.640 --> 03:07:44.240]   - Yeah, I can see that.
[03:07:44.240 --> 03:07:45.360]   And you use a headphone, right?
[03:07:45.360 --> 03:07:46.320]   - Yeah, headphones.
[03:07:46.320 --> 03:07:47.120]   - Yeah.
[03:07:47.120 --> 03:07:50.880]   - I actually like walk around in life often with brown noise.
[03:07:50.880 --> 03:07:53.360]   - Dude, that's like psychopath shit, but it's cool, you know?
[03:07:53.360 --> 03:07:54.720]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:07:54.720 --> 03:07:56.000]   When I murder people, it helps.
[03:07:56.000 --> 03:07:57.400]   - They're like, grrrr.
[03:07:57.400 --> 03:07:59.840]   - Yeah, it drowns out their screams.
[03:07:59.840 --> 03:08:01.280]   - Jesus Christ, yeah.
[03:08:01.280 --> 03:08:03.200]   - I said too much.
[03:08:03.200 --> 03:08:04.800]   - Man, I'm gonna try brown noise.
[03:08:04.800 --> 03:08:06.640]   - With a murder or for the coding, yeah?
[03:08:06.640 --> 03:08:07.360]   - For the coding, yeah.
[03:08:07.360 --> 03:08:07.920]   - Okay, good.
[03:08:07.920 --> 03:08:09.680]   Try it, try it.
[03:08:09.680 --> 03:08:11.040]   But you have to like with everything else,
[03:08:11.040 --> 03:08:12.320]   you give it a real chance.
[03:08:12.320 --> 03:08:17.920]   - Yeah, I find, I also, like I said, do techno-y type stuff,
[03:08:17.920 --> 03:08:20.560]   electronic music on top of the brown noise.
[03:08:20.560 --> 03:08:23.840]   But then control the speed
[03:08:23.840 --> 03:08:26.880]   because the faster it goes, the more anxiety.
[03:08:26.880 --> 03:08:28.560]   So if I really need to get shit done,
[03:08:28.560 --> 03:08:31.040]   especially with programming, I'll have a beat.
[03:08:31.040 --> 03:08:31.520]   - Yeah.
[03:08:31.520 --> 03:08:32.480]   - And it's great.
[03:08:32.480 --> 03:08:32.960]   It's cool.
[03:08:32.960 --> 03:08:35.120]   I say it's cool to play those little tricks with your mind
[03:08:35.120 --> 03:08:35.920]   to study yourself.
[03:08:35.920 --> 03:08:36.560]   - Yeah.
[03:08:36.560 --> 03:08:38.640]   - I usually don't like to have people around
[03:08:38.640 --> 03:08:41.360]   because when people, even if they're working,
[03:08:42.080 --> 03:08:43.600]   I don't know, I like people too much.
[03:08:43.600 --> 03:08:44.640]   They're like interesting.
[03:08:44.640 --> 03:08:46.640]   - Yeah, in coworking space,
[03:08:46.640 --> 03:08:47.840]   I would just start talking too much.
[03:08:47.840 --> 03:08:48.080]   - Yeah.
[03:08:48.080 --> 03:08:48.560]   - Yeah.
[03:08:48.560 --> 03:08:50.320]   - So there's a source of distraction.
[03:08:50.320 --> 03:08:52.320]   - Yeah, we would do, in the coworking space,
[03:08:52.320 --> 03:08:55.840]   we would do like a money pot, like a mug.
[03:08:55.840 --> 03:08:57.840]   So if you would work for 45 minutes
[03:08:57.840 --> 03:09:00.000]   and then if you would say one, like per word,
[03:09:00.000 --> 03:09:01.920]   you would get a fine, which is like $1.
[03:09:01.920 --> 03:09:04.160]   So you'd put $1 to say, "Hey, what's up?"
[03:09:04.160 --> 03:09:06.480]   So $3, you put in the mug.
[03:09:06.480 --> 03:09:09.520]   And then 15 minutes free time,
[03:09:09.520 --> 03:09:10.800]   like we can like party with everyone
[03:09:10.800 --> 03:09:13.600]   and 45 minutes again, I'm working and that worked.
[03:09:13.600 --> 03:09:15.520]   But you need to shut people up or they, you know.
[03:09:15.520 --> 03:09:21.760]   - I think there's an intimacy in being silent together.
[03:09:21.760 --> 03:09:22.480]   - Yeah.
[03:09:22.480 --> 03:09:24.800]   - That maybe I'm uncomfortable with,
[03:09:24.800 --> 03:09:30.000]   like, but you need to make yourself vulnerable
[03:09:30.000 --> 03:09:30.880]   and actually do it.
[03:09:30.880 --> 03:09:33.680]   Like with close friends to just sit there in silence
[03:09:33.680 --> 03:09:35.920]   for long periods of time and like doing a thing.
[03:09:35.920 --> 03:09:39.040]   - Dude, I watched this video of this podcast.
[03:09:39.040 --> 03:09:42.000]   It was like this Buddhism podcast with people meditating
[03:09:42.000 --> 03:09:43.680]   and they were interviewing each other or whatever
[03:09:43.680 --> 03:09:44.480]   and like a podcast.
[03:09:44.480 --> 03:09:48.240]   And suddenly after a question, it's like, "Yeah, yeah."
[03:09:48.240 --> 03:09:52.240]   And they were just silent for like three minutes.
[03:09:52.240 --> 03:09:54.960]   And then they said, "That was amazing.
[03:09:54.960 --> 03:09:56.000]   Yeah, that was amazing."
[03:09:56.000 --> 03:09:57.600]   I was like, "Wow, pretty cool, you know."
[03:09:57.600 --> 03:09:59.120]   - Elon's like that.
[03:09:59.120 --> 03:10:01.760]   And I really like that.
[03:10:01.760 --> 03:10:05.520]   When you'll ask a question, like, I don't know.
[03:10:05.520 --> 03:10:08.000]   "What's a perfectly productive day for you?"
[03:10:08.000 --> 03:10:09.280]   Like I just asked.
[03:10:09.280 --> 03:10:11.680]   And you just sit there for like 30 seconds thinking.
[03:10:11.680 --> 03:10:12.880]   - Yeah, he thinks.
[03:10:12.880 --> 03:10:16.160]   - Yeah, I don't know.
[03:10:16.160 --> 03:10:16.720]   - That's so cool.
[03:10:16.720 --> 03:10:20.480]   I wish I could think more about,
[03:10:20.480 --> 03:10:23.680]   but I wanna show you my heart, you know?
[03:10:23.680 --> 03:10:25.920]   I wanna go straight from my heart to my mouth
[03:10:25.920 --> 03:10:27.360]   to like saying the real thing.
[03:10:27.360 --> 03:10:28.640]   And the more I think,
[03:10:28.640 --> 03:10:31.680]   the more I start like filtering myself, right?
[03:10:31.680 --> 03:10:33.440]   And I wanna just throw it out there immediately.
[03:10:33.440 --> 03:10:35.360]   - I do that more with Tim.
[03:10:35.360 --> 03:10:36.880]   I think he has a lot of practice in that.
[03:10:36.880 --> 03:10:38.800]   I do that as well in a team setting
[03:10:38.800 --> 03:10:40.560]   when you're thinking, brainstorming.
[03:10:40.560 --> 03:10:43.360]   And you allow yourself to just like think in silence.
[03:10:43.360 --> 03:10:46.960]   'Cause even in meetings, people wanna talk.
[03:10:46.960 --> 03:10:51.200]   It's like, no, you think before you speak
[03:10:51.200 --> 03:10:53.040]   and just like, it's okay to be silent together.
[03:10:53.040 --> 03:10:55.600]   If you allow yourself the room to do that,
[03:10:55.600 --> 03:10:57.280]   you can actually come up with really good ideas.
[03:10:57.280 --> 03:10:59.520]   It's okay, this perfect day.
[03:10:59.520 --> 03:11:02.800]   How much caffeine are you consuming in this day?
[03:11:02.800 --> 03:11:03.600]   - Man, too much, right?
[03:11:03.600 --> 03:11:07.120]   'Cause normally like two cups of coffee,
[03:11:07.120 --> 03:11:09.920]   but on this perfect day, like we go to like four maybe.
[03:11:09.920 --> 03:11:12.240]   So we're starting to hit like the anxiety levels.
[03:11:12.240 --> 03:11:14.800]   - So four cups is a lot for you.
[03:11:14.800 --> 03:11:16.320]   - Well, I think my coffees are quite strong
[03:11:16.320 --> 03:11:16.880]   when I make them.
[03:11:16.880 --> 03:11:19.920]   It's like 20 grams of coffee powder in the V60.
[03:11:19.920 --> 03:11:23.840]   So like my friends call them like nuclear coffee
[03:11:23.840 --> 03:11:24.720]   'cause it's quite heavy.
[03:11:24.720 --> 03:11:25.360]   - Yeah, super strong.
[03:11:25.360 --> 03:11:26.000]   - It's quite strong.
[03:11:26.000 --> 03:11:29.600]   But it's nice to hit that anxiety level
[03:11:29.600 --> 03:11:31.600]   where you're like almost panic attack,
[03:11:31.600 --> 03:11:32.640]   but you're not there yet.
[03:11:32.640 --> 03:11:36.640]   So, but that's like, man, it's like super locked in
[03:11:36.640 --> 03:11:40.000]   just like, it's amazing.
[03:11:40.000 --> 03:11:42.960]   But I mean, there's a space for that in my life,
[03:11:42.960 --> 03:11:46.160]   but I think it's great for making new stuff.
[03:11:46.160 --> 03:11:46.640]   It's amazing.
[03:11:46.640 --> 03:11:48.480]   - Starting from scratch, creating a new thing.
[03:11:48.480 --> 03:11:51.120]   - Yes, I think girlfriends should let their guys
[03:11:51.120 --> 03:11:54.880]   go away for like two weeks every few,
[03:11:54.880 --> 03:11:58.080]   no, every year at least, maybe every quarter, I don't know.
[03:11:58.080 --> 03:12:01.520]   And just sit and make some shits without,
[03:12:02.400 --> 03:12:04.480]   they're amazing, but like no disturbances,
[03:12:04.480 --> 03:12:05.600]   just be alone.
[03:12:05.600 --> 03:12:09.360]   And then people can make something very, very amazing.
[03:12:09.360 --> 03:12:11.200]   - Just wearing cowboy hats in the mountains
[03:12:11.200 --> 03:12:11.760]   like we showed before.
[03:12:11.760 --> 03:12:12.560]   - Exactly, we can do that.
[03:12:12.560 --> 03:12:13.520]   - There's a movie about that.
[03:12:13.520 --> 03:12:14.240]   - With the laptops.
[03:12:14.240 --> 03:12:15.600]   - They didn't do much programming though.
[03:12:15.600 --> 03:12:17.040]   - Yeah, you can do a little bit of that.
[03:12:17.040 --> 03:12:17.520]   - Okay.
[03:12:17.520 --> 03:12:20.320]   - And then a little bit of shipping, you know, do both.
[03:12:20.320 --> 03:12:22.320]   - It's a different--
[03:12:22.320 --> 03:12:23.840]   - But they need to allow us to go, you know,
[03:12:23.840 --> 03:12:25.120]   you need like a man cave, right?
[03:12:25.120 --> 03:12:26.080]   - Yeah, to ship.
[03:12:26.080 --> 03:12:26.960]   - Yeah, to ship.
[03:12:26.960 --> 03:12:27.680]   - Get shit done.
[03:12:27.680 --> 03:12:29.600]   Yeah, it's a balance.
[03:12:29.600 --> 03:12:30.160]   Okay, cool.
[03:12:31.040 --> 03:12:32.960]   What about sleep, naps and all that?
[03:12:32.960 --> 03:12:33.920]   You're not sleeping much?
[03:12:33.920 --> 03:12:35.680]   - I don't do naps in a day.
[03:12:35.680 --> 03:12:37.120]   I think power naps are good, but I don't really,
[03:12:37.120 --> 03:12:38.640]   I'm never tired anymore in the day.
[03:12:38.640 --> 03:12:42.480]   And also because of gym, I'm not tired.
[03:12:42.480 --> 03:12:44.720]   I'm tired when I want to, you know, when it's night,
[03:12:44.720 --> 03:12:45.280]   I need to sleep.
[03:12:45.280 --> 03:12:46.720]   - Yeah, me, I love naps.
[03:12:46.720 --> 03:12:48.160]   I love naps, I don't care.
[03:12:48.160 --> 03:12:50.080]   I don't know, I don't know why.
[03:12:50.080 --> 03:12:51.760]   Brain shuts off, turns on.
[03:12:51.760 --> 03:12:53.520]   I don't know if it's healthy or not, it just works.
[03:12:53.520 --> 03:12:54.000]   - Yeah.
[03:12:54.000 --> 03:12:56.560]   - I think with anything, mental, physical,
[03:12:56.560 --> 03:12:58.240]   you have to be a student of your own body
[03:12:58.240 --> 03:13:00.560]   and like know what the limits are.
[03:13:00.560 --> 03:13:02.480]   Like you have to be skeptical taking advice
[03:13:02.480 --> 03:13:04.400]   from the internet in general,
[03:13:04.400 --> 03:13:07.520]   'cause a lot of the advice is just like a good baseline
[03:13:07.520 --> 03:13:09.520]   for the general population.
[03:13:09.520 --> 03:13:10.720]   - It's not personalized, yeah.
[03:13:10.720 --> 03:13:12.960]   - You have to become a student of your own,
[03:13:12.960 --> 03:13:15.680]   like of your own body, of your own self, of how you work.
[03:13:15.680 --> 03:13:19.600]   That's, I've done a lot of, like for me,
[03:13:19.600 --> 03:13:21.440]   fasting was an interesting one.
[03:13:21.440 --> 03:13:24.000]   'Cause I used to, you know, eat a bunch of meals a day,
[03:13:24.000 --> 03:13:25.280]   especially when I was lifting heavy.
[03:13:25.280 --> 03:13:27.040]   Like, 'cause everybody says that you have to eat
[03:13:27.040 --> 03:13:29.600]   kind of a lot, you know.
[03:13:30.400 --> 03:13:31.840]   Multiple meals a day.
[03:13:31.840 --> 03:13:34.800]   But I realized I can get much stronger,
[03:13:34.800 --> 03:13:38.000]   feel much better if I eat once or twice a day.
[03:13:38.000 --> 03:13:38.880]   - Yeah, me too, yeah.
[03:13:38.880 --> 03:13:39.440]   - It's crazy.
[03:13:39.440 --> 03:13:41.200]   - I never understood this small meal thing, yeah.
[03:13:41.200 --> 03:13:41.920]   Didn't work for me.
[03:13:41.920 --> 03:13:44.480]   - Well, let me just ask you, it'd be interesting
[03:13:44.480 --> 03:13:46.480]   if you can comment on some of the other products
[03:13:46.480 --> 03:13:47.520]   you've created.
[03:13:47.520 --> 03:13:49.520]   We talked about Nomad List, Interior AI,
[03:13:49.520 --> 03:13:51.200]   Photo AI, Therapist AI.
[03:13:51.200 --> 03:13:52.080]   What's Remote OK?
[03:13:52.080 --> 03:13:54.560]   - It's a job board for remote jobs.
[03:13:54.560 --> 03:13:57.040]   Because back then, like 10 years ago,
[03:13:57.040 --> 03:13:58.640]   there was job boards,
[03:13:58.640 --> 03:14:01.600]   but it was not really specifically remote job, job boards.
[03:14:01.600 --> 03:14:04.000]   So I made one, I made, like first on Nomad List,
[03:14:04.000 --> 03:14:05.920]   I made like Nomad Jobs, like a page.
[03:14:05.920 --> 03:14:07.520]   And a lot of companies started hiring
[03:14:07.520 --> 03:14:08.640]   and they pay for job posts.
[03:14:08.640 --> 03:14:10.640]   So I spin it off to Remote OK.
[03:14:10.640 --> 03:14:13.360]   And now it's like the number one or number two
[03:14:13.360 --> 03:14:14.640]   biggest remote job boards.
[03:14:14.640 --> 03:14:17.440]   And it's also fully automated.
[03:14:17.440 --> 03:14:19.040]   People just post a job and people apply.
[03:14:19.040 --> 03:14:20.320]   It has like profiles as well.
[03:14:20.320 --> 03:14:23.120]   Like, it's kind of like LinkedIn for remote work.
[03:14:23.120 --> 03:14:25.040]   - It's just focused on remote only.
[03:14:25.040 --> 03:14:28.080]   - Yeah, it's essentially like a simple job board.
[03:14:28.080 --> 03:14:29.840]   I discovered job boards are way more complicated
[03:14:29.840 --> 03:14:34.240]   than you think, but yeah, it's a job board for remote jobs.
[03:14:34.240 --> 03:14:37.440]   But the nice thing is you can charge a lot of money
[03:14:37.440 --> 03:14:38.240]   for job posts.
[03:14:38.240 --> 03:14:39.120]   Man, it's good money.
[03:14:39.120 --> 03:14:41.760]   B2B, you can charge, like you start with 299,
[03:14:41.760 --> 03:14:45.680]   but at the peak during when the Fed started printing money,
[03:14:45.680 --> 03:14:48.720]   like 2021, I was making like 140K a month
[03:14:48.720 --> 03:14:50.640]   with Remote OK with just job posts.
[03:14:50.640 --> 03:14:53.040]   And I started like adding crazy upsells,
[03:14:53.040 --> 03:14:55.280]   like rainbow colored job posts.
[03:14:55.280 --> 03:14:57.760]   You can add your background image, just upsells, man.
[03:14:57.760 --> 03:14:59.680]   And you charge $1,000 for an upsell.
[03:14:59.680 --> 03:15:00.560]   It was crazy.
[03:15:00.560 --> 03:15:03.440]   And all these companies just upsell, upsell.
[03:15:03.440 --> 03:15:04.320]   Yeah, we want everything.
[03:15:04.320 --> 03:15:07.840]   Job posts would cost $3,000, $4,000.
[03:15:07.840 --> 03:15:11.360]   And I was like, this is good business.
[03:15:11.360 --> 03:15:13.200]   And then the Fed stopped printing money
[03:15:13.200 --> 03:15:14.640]   and it all went down.
[03:15:14.640 --> 03:15:17.600]   And it went down to like 10K a month from 140.
[03:15:17.600 --> 03:15:19.040]   Now it's back.
[03:15:19.040 --> 03:15:20.400]   I think it's like 40.
[03:15:20.400 --> 03:15:21.280]   It was good times, you know?
[03:15:21.280 --> 03:15:24.960]   - I got to ask you about back to the digital nomad life.
[03:15:24.960 --> 03:15:25.440]   - Yeah.
[03:15:25.680 --> 03:15:28.400]   - You wrote a blog post on the reset.
[03:15:28.400 --> 03:15:31.680]   And in general, like just giving away everything,
[03:15:31.680 --> 03:15:32.800]   living a minimalist life.
[03:15:32.800 --> 03:15:33.440]   - Yeah.
[03:15:33.440 --> 03:15:35.120]   - What did it take to do that?
[03:15:35.120 --> 03:15:37.440]   Like to get rid of everything?
[03:15:37.440 --> 03:15:39.920]   - 10 years ago, it was like this trend in the blog.
[03:15:39.920 --> 03:15:41.040]   Back then blogs were so popular.
[03:15:41.040 --> 03:15:42.080]   It was like a blogosphere.
[03:15:42.080 --> 03:15:43.520]   And it was like the 100 things challenge.
[03:15:43.520 --> 03:15:44.800]   - What is that, the 100 things challenge?
[03:15:44.800 --> 03:15:45.600]   - I mean, it's ridiculous.
[03:15:45.600 --> 03:15:48.320]   But like you write down every object you have in your house
[03:15:48.320 --> 03:15:50.320]   and you count it, you make like a spreadsheet
[03:15:50.320 --> 03:15:52.480]   and you're like, okay, I have 500 things.
[03:15:52.480 --> 03:15:54.080]   You need to get it down to 100.
[03:15:54.080 --> 03:15:55.840]   Why, you know, this was just a trend.
[03:15:55.840 --> 03:15:56.400]   So I did it.
[03:15:56.400 --> 03:15:59.120]   I started like selling stuff, started throwing away stuff.
[03:15:59.120 --> 03:16:04.080]   And I did like MDMA and ecstasy like 2012 kind of.
[03:16:04.080 --> 03:16:07.680]   And after that trip, I felt so different.
[03:16:07.680 --> 03:16:10.080]   And I felt like I had to start throwing shit away.
[03:16:10.080 --> 03:16:11.520]   Like, I swear.
[03:16:11.520 --> 03:16:13.600]   And I started throwing shit away.
[03:16:13.600 --> 03:16:16.400]   And I felt that was like, it was almost like the drug
[03:16:16.400 --> 03:16:19.040]   sending me to a path of like, you need to throw your shit away.
[03:16:19.040 --> 03:16:21.120]   You need to start, you know, go on a journey.
[03:16:21.120 --> 03:16:22.080]   You need to get out of here.
[03:16:22.720 --> 03:16:26.400]   And that's what the MDMA did, I think, yeah.
[03:16:26.400 --> 03:16:28.720]   - How hard is it to get down to 100 items?
[03:16:28.720 --> 03:16:31.600]   - Well, you need to like sell your PC and stuff.
[03:16:31.600 --> 03:16:32.560]   You need to go on eBay.
[03:16:32.560 --> 03:16:34.640]   And then, man, going eBay selling all your stuff
[03:16:34.640 --> 03:16:36.800]   is very interesting 'cause you discover society.
[03:16:36.800 --> 03:16:38.640]   You meet the craziest people.
[03:16:38.640 --> 03:16:41.920]   You meet every range from rich to poor.
[03:16:41.920 --> 03:16:43.760]   Everybody comes to your house to buy stuff.
[03:16:43.760 --> 03:16:44.800]   It's so funny, so interesting.
[03:16:44.800 --> 03:16:45.840]   I recommend everybody do this.
[03:16:45.840 --> 03:16:47.760]   - Just to meet people that want your shit.
[03:16:47.760 --> 03:16:50.080]   - Yeah, it was so, like, I didn't know.
[03:16:50.640 --> 03:16:52.560]   I was living in Amsterdam and I didn't know.
[03:16:52.560 --> 03:16:54.320]   I have my own, you know, subculture or whatever.
[03:16:54.320 --> 03:16:56.160]   And I discovered the Dutch people,
[03:16:56.160 --> 03:16:57.840]   like as they are from eBay, you know?
[03:16:57.840 --> 03:16:58.720]   So I sold everything.
[03:16:58.720 --> 03:17:01.120]   - What's like the weirdest thing you had to sell
[03:17:01.120 --> 03:17:03.280]   and you had to find a buyer for?
[03:17:03.280 --> 03:17:05.120]   Not the weirdest, but like what's memorable?
[03:17:05.120 --> 03:17:07.600]   - So back then I was making music
[03:17:07.600 --> 03:17:10.560]   and we would make music videos with like a Canon 5D camera.
[03:17:10.560 --> 03:17:12.800]   Back then everybody was making films and music videos.
[03:17:12.800 --> 03:17:15.840]   And we bought it with my friends and stuff.
[03:17:15.840 --> 03:17:20.320]   And it was kind of like, I had to sell this thing too
[03:17:20.320 --> 03:17:21.600]   'cause it was like, it was very expensive,
[03:17:21.600 --> 03:17:22.880]   like 6K or something.
[03:17:22.880 --> 03:17:25.680]   And, but it meant that selling this meant
[03:17:25.680 --> 03:17:27.360]   that we wouldn't make music videos together anymore.
[03:17:27.360 --> 03:17:28.640]   I would leave Holland.
[03:17:28.640 --> 03:17:30.960]   This kind of like stuff we were working on would end.
[03:17:30.960 --> 03:17:33.120]   And I was kind of saying this music video stuff,
[03:17:33.120 --> 03:17:33.840]   we're not getting big.
[03:17:33.840 --> 03:17:35.440]   We're not getting famous in this or successful.
[03:17:35.440 --> 03:17:36.480]   We need to stop doing this.
[03:17:36.480 --> 03:17:38.720]   This music production also, it's not really working.
[03:17:38.720 --> 03:17:42.080]   And it was kind of like, felt very bad, you know,
[03:17:42.080 --> 03:17:44.480]   for my friends 'cause we would work together on this.
[03:17:44.480 --> 03:17:48.480]   And to sell this like camera that we'd make stuff with.
[03:17:48.480 --> 03:17:49.680]   - It was a hard goodbye.
[03:17:49.680 --> 03:17:51.360]   - It was just a camera, but it was like,
[03:17:51.360 --> 03:17:54.640]   it felt like, sorry guys, it doesn't work
[03:17:54.640 --> 03:17:55.600]   and I need to go, you know.
[03:17:55.600 --> 03:17:57.120]   - Who bought it?
[03:17:57.120 --> 03:17:57.680]   Do you remember?
[03:17:57.680 --> 03:18:03.120]   It was some guy who couldn't possibly understand the journey.
[03:18:03.120 --> 03:18:03.920]   - The motion of it.
[03:18:03.920 --> 03:18:07.120]   - Yeah, he just showed up, here's the money, thanks.
[03:18:07.120 --> 03:18:09.360]   - Yeah, but it was like, it was like cutting your life.
[03:18:09.360 --> 03:18:10.400]   Like this shit ends now.
[03:18:10.400 --> 03:18:11.840]   And now we kind of do new stuff.
[03:18:11.840 --> 03:18:13.120]   - I think it's beautiful.
[03:18:13.120 --> 03:18:14.720]   I did that twice in my life.
[03:18:14.720 --> 03:18:16.320]   I gave away everything, everything, everything.
[03:18:16.320 --> 03:18:19.520]   Like down to just pants, underwear.
[03:18:19.520 --> 03:18:20.320]   - Yeah. - Backpack.
[03:18:20.320 --> 03:18:24.000]   I think it's important to do.
[03:18:24.000 --> 03:18:26.000]   It shows you what's important.
[03:18:26.000 --> 03:18:28.000]   - Yeah, I think that's what I learned from it.
[03:18:28.000 --> 03:18:31.360]   Like you learn that you can live with very little objects
[03:18:31.360 --> 03:18:32.080]   for a little stuff.
[03:18:32.080 --> 03:18:34.800]   But there's a counter to it.
[03:18:34.800 --> 03:18:37.920]   Like you lean more on the stuff, on the services, right?
[03:18:37.920 --> 03:18:40.240]   Like for example, you don't need a car, you use Uber, right?
[03:18:40.240 --> 03:18:42.400]   Or you don't need kitchen stuff
[03:18:42.400 --> 03:18:44.720]   because you go to restaurants, you know, when you're traveling.
[03:18:44.720 --> 03:18:46.720]   So you lean more on other people's services,
[03:18:46.720 --> 03:18:48.480]   but you spend money on that as well, so that's good.
[03:18:48.480 --> 03:18:51.040]   - Yeah, but just letting go of material possessions,
[03:18:51.040 --> 03:18:53.200]   which it gives a kind of freedom
[03:18:53.200 --> 03:18:54.640]   to how you move about the world.
[03:18:54.640 --> 03:18:55.120]   - Yeah.
[03:18:55.120 --> 03:18:57.440]   - It gives you complete freedom to go into another city, to-
[03:18:57.440 --> 03:18:58.480]   - Yeah, with your backpack.
[03:18:58.480 --> 03:18:59.360]   - With a backpack.
[03:18:59.360 --> 03:19:01.440]   There's a kind of freedom to it.
[03:19:01.440 --> 03:19:03.360]   There's something about material possessions
[03:19:03.360 --> 03:19:04.640]   and having a place and all that,
[03:19:04.640 --> 03:19:05.920]   that ties you down a little bit.
[03:19:05.920 --> 03:19:07.760]   - Yeah. - I think spiritually.
[03:19:07.760 --> 03:19:09.520]   - Yeah. - It's good to take a leap
[03:19:09.520 --> 03:19:11.680]   out into the world, especially when you're younger to like-
[03:19:11.680 --> 03:19:14.240]   - Man, I recommend if you're 18, you get out of high school,
[03:19:14.240 --> 03:19:17.280]   do this, go travel and, you know,
[03:19:17.280 --> 03:19:18.560]   build some internet stuff, whatever.
[03:19:18.560 --> 03:19:21.760]   If you bring your laptop and it's an amazing experience.
[03:19:21.760 --> 03:19:24.160]   Five years ago, I would still go to university,
[03:19:24.160 --> 03:19:26.960]   but now I'm thinking like, no, maybe skip university.
[03:19:26.960 --> 03:19:28.960]   Just go first, like travel around a little bit,
[03:19:28.960 --> 03:19:30.320]   figure some stuff out.
[03:19:30.320 --> 03:19:32.320]   You can go back to university when you're 25.
[03:19:32.320 --> 03:19:34.400]   You can like, okay, now I learned,
[03:19:34.400 --> 03:19:36.080]   I've been successful in business.
[03:19:36.080 --> 03:19:36.880]   You have money at least.
[03:19:36.880 --> 03:19:38.640]   Now you can choose what you really wanna study, you know?
[03:19:38.640 --> 03:19:41.120]   Because people at 18, they go study
[03:19:41.120 --> 03:19:42.960]   what's probably good for the job market, right?
[03:19:42.960 --> 03:19:44.880]   So it probably makes more sense.
[03:19:44.880 --> 03:19:46.640]   Like, if you want that, go travel,
[03:19:46.640 --> 03:19:49.360]   build some businesses and go back to university if you want.
[03:19:49.360 --> 03:19:51.680]   - So one of the biggest uses of a university
[03:19:51.680 --> 03:19:52.480]   is the networking.
[03:19:52.480 --> 03:19:56.400]   You gain friends, you gain like, you meet people.
[03:19:56.400 --> 03:19:58.080]   It's a forcing function to meet people.
[03:19:58.080 --> 03:20:00.720]   But if you can meet people out into the world by traveling-
[03:20:00.720 --> 03:20:02.240]   - And you meet so many different cultures.
[03:20:02.240 --> 03:20:04.560]   - I mean, the problem for me is like,
[03:20:04.560 --> 03:20:06.400]   if I traveled at that young age,
[03:20:06.400 --> 03:20:09.280]   I'm attracted to people at the outskirts of the world.
[03:20:09.280 --> 03:20:10.000]   Like for me-
[03:20:10.000 --> 03:20:11.040]   - Like where?
[03:20:11.040 --> 03:20:12.640]   - No, not geographically.
[03:20:12.640 --> 03:20:13.920]   - Oh, like the subcultures.
[03:20:13.920 --> 03:20:17.520]   - The sub, yeah, like the weirdos, the darkness.
[03:20:17.520 --> 03:20:18.240]   - Yeah, me too.
[03:20:18.240 --> 03:20:21.440]   - But that might not be the best networking at 18 years old.
[03:20:21.440 --> 03:20:25.920]   - No, but man, if you're smart about it, you can stay safe.
[03:20:25.920 --> 03:20:28.240]   And I met so many weirdos from traveling.
[03:20:28.240 --> 03:20:29.760]   You meet, that's how travel works.
[03:20:29.760 --> 03:20:31.680]   If you really let loose, you meet the craziest people.
[03:20:31.680 --> 03:20:34.000]   And it's the most interesting people.
[03:20:34.000 --> 03:20:38.720]   And it's just, I cannot recommend it enough.
[03:20:38.720 --> 03:20:40.880]   - Well, see, the thing is, when you're 18,
[03:20:41.600 --> 03:20:44.720]   I feel like, depending on your personality,
[03:20:44.720 --> 03:20:47.680]   you have to learn both how to be a weirdo
[03:20:47.680 --> 03:20:48.880]   and how to be a normie.
[03:20:48.880 --> 03:20:52.800]   Like you still have to learn how to fit into society.
[03:20:52.800 --> 03:20:54.480]   Like for a person like me, for example,
[03:20:54.480 --> 03:20:55.520]   who's always an outcast,
[03:20:55.520 --> 03:20:59.120]   like there's always a danger for going full outcast.
[03:20:59.120 --> 03:20:59.600]   - Yeah.
[03:20:59.600 --> 03:21:00.880]   - And that's a harder life.
[03:21:00.880 --> 03:21:06.240]   If you go to like go full artist and full like darkness,
[03:21:06.240 --> 03:21:07.200]   it's just a harder life.
[03:21:07.200 --> 03:21:09.040]   - You can come back, you can come back to normie.
[03:21:09.040 --> 03:21:09.840]   - That's a skill.
[03:21:09.840 --> 03:21:12.960]   That's like, I think you have to learn how to fit
[03:21:12.960 --> 03:21:16.320]   into like polite society.
[03:21:16.320 --> 03:21:18.560]   - But I was very strange outcast as well.
[03:21:18.560 --> 03:21:21.360]   And I'm more adaptable to normie now.
[03:21:21.360 --> 03:21:22.320]   - You learned it, yeah.
[03:21:22.320 --> 03:21:24.640]   - After 30s, you know, you're like, yeah.
[03:21:24.640 --> 03:21:26.960]   - But I mean, it's a skill you have to learn.
[03:21:26.960 --> 03:21:27.440]   - Yeah.
[03:21:27.440 --> 03:21:31.520]   I feel, man, I feel also that you start as an outcast,
[03:21:31.520 --> 03:21:33.200]   but the more you work on yourself,
[03:21:33.200 --> 03:21:34.960]   the less like shit you have,
[03:21:34.960 --> 03:21:36.560]   you kind of start becoming more normie
[03:21:36.560 --> 03:21:38.960]   because you become more chill with yourself,
[03:21:38.960 --> 03:21:42.320]   more happy and it kind of makes you uninteresting, right?
[03:21:42.320 --> 03:21:43.680]   - Yes, yes.
[03:21:43.680 --> 03:21:45.760]   - Like the most, the crazy people
[03:21:45.760 --> 03:21:47.280]   are always the most interesting.
[03:21:47.280 --> 03:21:49.280]   If you've solved your internal struggles
[03:21:49.280 --> 03:21:50.560]   and your therapy and stuff,
[03:21:50.560 --> 03:21:53.440]   and you kind of become kind of, you know,
[03:21:53.440 --> 03:21:56.000]   it's not so interesting anymore, maybe.
[03:21:56.000 --> 03:21:58.320]   - You don't have to be broken to be interesting,
[03:21:58.320 --> 03:21:59.200]   I guess is what I'm saying.
[03:21:59.200 --> 03:21:59.520]   - Yeah.
[03:21:59.520 --> 03:22:03.120]   - What kind of things were left when you minimalized?
[03:22:03.120 --> 03:22:04.480]   - So the backpack.
[03:22:04.480 --> 03:22:05.040]   - Yeah.
[03:22:05.680 --> 03:22:09.920]   - MacBook, toothbrush, some clothes, underwear, socks.
[03:22:09.920 --> 03:22:13.280]   You don't need a lot of clothes in Asia 'cause it's hot.
[03:22:13.280 --> 03:22:16.160]   So you just wear swim pants, swim shorts.
[03:22:16.160 --> 03:22:17.360]   You walk around flip-flops.
[03:22:17.360 --> 03:22:20.160]   So very basic, T-shirt.
[03:22:20.160 --> 03:22:23.600]   And I would go to the laundromat and wash my stuff.
[03:22:23.600 --> 03:22:26.720]   And I think it was like 50 things or something, yeah.
[03:22:26.720 --> 03:22:28.160]   - Yeah, it's nice.
[03:22:28.160 --> 03:22:31.520]   There's, as I mentioned to you, there's the show Alone.
[03:22:31.520 --> 03:22:32.480]   - Yeah.
[03:22:32.480 --> 03:22:35.360]   - They really test you 'cause you only get 10 items
[03:22:35.360 --> 03:22:37.680]   and you have to survive out in the wilderness.
[03:22:37.680 --> 03:22:39.840]   And an ax, like everybody brings an ax.
[03:22:39.840 --> 03:22:44.320]   Some people also have a saw.
[03:22:44.320 --> 03:22:45.680]   - Wow.
[03:22:45.680 --> 03:22:47.760]   - But usually ax does the job.
[03:22:47.760 --> 03:22:49.680]   You basically have to, in order to build a shelter,
[03:22:49.680 --> 03:22:52.480]   you have to cut down and cut the trees and make, and like--
[03:22:52.480 --> 03:22:53.360]   - Learn in Minecraft.
[03:22:53.360 --> 03:22:57.680]   - Everything I learned about life, I learned in Minecraft, bro.
[03:22:58.880 --> 03:23:03.520]   Yeah, yeah, you could, it's nice to create those constraints
[03:23:03.520 --> 03:23:05.600]   for yourself to understand what matters to you
[03:23:05.600 --> 03:23:07.840]   and also how to be in this world.
[03:23:07.840 --> 03:23:11.840]   And one of the ways to do that is to live a minimalist life.
[03:23:11.840 --> 03:23:14.160]   But like some people, like I've met people
[03:23:14.160 --> 03:23:16.240]   that really enjoy material possessions
[03:23:16.240 --> 03:23:17.360]   and that brings them happiness.
[03:23:17.360 --> 03:23:18.880]   And that's a beautiful thing.
[03:23:18.880 --> 03:23:22.720]   Like for me, it doesn't, but people are different.
[03:23:22.720 --> 03:23:24.320]   - It gives me happiness for like two weeks.
[03:23:24.320 --> 03:23:25.040]   - Yeah.
[03:23:25.040 --> 03:23:27.840]   - I'm very quickly adapting to like a baseline.
[03:23:27.840 --> 03:23:30.880]   Hedonistic adaptation, very fast.
[03:23:30.880 --> 03:23:31.440]   - Yeah.
[03:23:31.440 --> 03:23:33.760]   - But man, if you look at the studies, most people,
[03:23:33.760 --> 03:23:38.160]   like get a new car, six months, get a new house, six months.
[03:23:38.160 --> 03:23:39.440]   You just feel the same.
[03:23:39.440 --> 03:23:41.040]   You're like, wow, should I buy all this stuff?
[03:23:41.040 --> 03:23:44.000]   Studying hedonistic adaptation
[03:23:44.000 --> 03:23:45.360]   made me think a lot about minimalism.
[03:23:45.360 --> 03:23:47.440]   - And so you don't even need to go
[03:23:47.440 --> 03:23:48.800]   through the whole journey of getting it.
[03:23:48.800 --> 03:23:53.360]   Just focus on the thing that's more permanent.
[03:23:53.360 --> 03:23:54.480]   - Yeah.
[03:23:54.480 --> 03:23:55.520]   - Like building shit.
[03:23:56.080 --> 03:23:58.160]   - Yeah, like people around you, like people you love,
[03:23:58.160 --> 03:24:01.280]   nice food, nice experiences, meaningful work.
[03:24:01.280 --> 03:24:03.760]   Those things, exercise, you know,
[03:24:03.760 --> 03:24:05.280]   those things make you happy, I think.
[03:24:05.280 --> 03:24:06.480]   Make me happy for sure.
[03:24:06.480 --> 03:24:09.920]   - You wrote a blog post, "Why I'm Unreachable
[03:24:09.920 --> 03:24:11.280]   and Maybe You Should Be Too."
[03:24:11.280 --> 03:24:13.680]   What's your strategy in communicating with people?
[03:24:13.680 --> 03:24:16.640]   - Yeah, so when I wrote that, I was getting so many DMs
[03:24:16.640 --> 03:24:19.840]   as you probably have, you have a million times more.
[03:24:19.840 --> 03:24:23.280]   But, and people were getting angry that I wasn't responding.
[03:24:23.280 --> 03:24:24.640]   And I was like, okay, I'll just close down
[03:24:24.640 --> 03:24:25.600]   these DMs completely.
[03:24:25.600 --> 03:24:28.160]   Then people got angry that I closed my DMs down,
[03:24:28.160 --> 03:24:30.640]   that I'm not like man of the people, you know.
[03:24:30.640 --> 03:24:31.760]   - Yeah, you've changed, man.
[03:24:31.760 --> 03:24:32.480]   - Yeah, you've changed.
[03:24:32.480 --> 03:24:33.600]   You got, you know, like this.
[03:24:33.600 --> 03:24:36.240]   And I'm like, I'll explain why.
[03:24:36.240 --> 03:24:39.600]   I just don't have the time in a day to, you know,
[03:24:39.600 --> 03:24:41.520]   answer every question.
[03:24:41.520 --> 03:24:44.240]   And also people send you like crazy shit, man.
[03:24:44.240 --> 03:24:46.320]   Like stalkers and like people write
[03:24:46.320 --> 03:24:48.000]   like their whole life story for you.
[03:24:48.000 --> 03:24:48.880]   And then ask you advice.
[03:24:48.880 --> 03:24:49.840]   Like, man, I have no idea.
[03:24:49.840 --> 03:24:50.560]   I'm not a therapist.
[03:24:50.560 --> 03:24:51.200]   I don't know.
[03:24:51.200 --> 03:24:51.920]   I don't know this stuff.
[03:24:51.920 --> 03:24:53.520]   - But also beautiful stuff.
[03:24:53.520 --> 03:24:55.040]   - No, absolutely, sure.
[03:24:55.040 --> 03:24:58.240]   - Like life story, I've posted a coffee form.
[03:24:58.240 --> 03:24:59.680]   Like if you wanted to have a coffee with me.
[03:24:59.680 --> 03:25:00.240]   - Nice.
[03:25:00.240 --> 03:25:03.440]   - And I've gotten an extremely large number of submissions.
[03:25:03.440 --> 03:25:04.720]   And when I look at them,
[03:25:04.720 --> 03:25:06.880]   there's just like beautiful people in there.
[03:25:06.880 --> 03:25:10.160]   Like beautiful human beings, really powerful stories.
[03:25:10.160 --> 03:25:11.200]   And like breaks my heart
[03:25:11.200 --> 03:25:13.600]   that I won't get to meet those people, you know, like.
[03:25:13.600 --> 03:25:16.320]   And so this part of it is just like,
[03:25:16.320 --> 03:25:19.920]   there's only so much bandwidth to truly see other humans
[03:25:19.920 --> 03:25:22.080]   and help them or like understand them
[03:25:22.080 --> 03:25:24.240]   or hear them or yeah, see them.
[03:25:24.240 --> 03:25:25.360]   - Yeah.
[03:25:25.360 --> 03:25:27.040]   I have this problem that I try,
[03:25:27.040 --> 03:25:29.040]   I wanna try help people and like also like,
[03:25:29.040 --> 03:25:30.960]   oh, let's make startups and whatever.
[03:25:30.960 --> 03:25:33.840]   And it's, I've learned over the years
[03:25:33.840 --> 03:25:37.440]   that generally for me, and it sounds maybe bad, right?
[03:25:37.440 --> 03:25:38.960]   But like I helped my friend Andre, for example,
[03:25:38.960 --> 03:25:40.640]   he was, he came up to me in the coworking space.
[03:25:40.640 --> 03:25:41.200]   That's how I met him.
[03:25:41.200 --> 03:25:42.080]   And he said, I wanna learn to code.
[03:25:42.080 --> 03:25:42.800]   I wanna do startups.
[03:25:42.800 --> 03:25:43.600]   How do I do it?
[03:25:43.600 --> 03:25:46.160]   And I said, okay, let's go install NGINX.
[03:25:46.160 --> 03:25:47.360]   Let's start coding.
[03:25:47.360 --> 03:25:50.800]   And he has this self energy that he actually,
[03:25:50.800 --> 03:25:54.480]   he doesn't need to be pushed.
[03:25:54.480 --> 03:25:56.320]   He just goes and he just goes and he asks questions.
[03:25:56.320 --> 03:25:57.840]   And he doesn't ask too many questions.
[03:25:57.840 --> 03:25:59.200]   He just goes, goes and learns it.
[03:25:59.200 --> 03:26:00.800]   And now he has a company and makes a lot of money,
[03:26:00.800 --> 03:26:02.720]   has his own startups.
[03:26:02.720 --> 03:26:05.600]   So, and the people that I had to kind of like,
[03:26:05.600 --> 03:26:08.160]   that asked me for help, but then I gave help.
[03:26:08.160 --> 03:26:10.320]   And then they started debating it, you know?
[03:26:10.320 --> 03:26:10.880]   - Yeah.
[03:26:10.880 --> 03:26:11.520]   - Do you have that?
[03:26:11.520 --> 03:26:13.040]   Like people ask you advice and they go against,
[03:26:13.040 --> 03:26:14.160]   you say, no, you're wrong.
[03:26:14.160 --> 03:26:16.560]   Because I'm like, okay, bro, I don't wanna debate.
[03:26:16.560 --> 03:26:18.160]   You asked me for advice, right?
[03:26:18.160 --> 03:26:22.960]   And the people need to push generally, it doesn't happen.
[03:26:22.960 --> 03:26:24.480]   You need to have this energy for yourself.
[03:26:24.480 --> 03:26:26.320]   - Well, they're searching, they're searching.
[03:26:26.320 --> 03:26:27.360]   They're trying to figure it out.
[03:26:27.360 --> 03:26:29.040]   But oftentimes their search,
[03:26:29.040 --> 03:26:32.880]   if they successfully find what they're looking for,
[03:26:32.880 --> 03:26:33.920]   it'll be within.
[03:26:33.920 --> 03:26:35.840]   It sounds very like spiritual, Sonny.
[03:26:35.840 --> 03:26:38.800]   But it's really like figuring that shit out on your own.
[03:26:38.800 --> 03:26:41.760]   But they're reaching, they're trying to ask the world
[03:26:41.760 --> 03:26:44.880]   around them, like, how do I live this life?
[03:26:44.880 --> 03:26:45.920]   How do I figure this out?
[03:26:45.920 --> 03:26:47.520]   But ultimately the answer is gonna be
[03:26:47.520 --> 03:26:49.360]   from them working on themselves.
[03:26:49.360 --> 03:26:51.920]   And like, literally, it's the stupid thing,
[03:26:51.920 --> 03:26:53.840]   but like Googling and doing like--
[03:26:53.840 --> 03:26:55.520]   - Yeah, so I think it's procrastination.
[03:26:55.520 --> 03:26:56.960]   I think sending messages to people
[03:26:56.960 --> 03:26:58.160]   is a lot of procrastination.
[03:26:58.160 --> 03:27:00.480]   Like, Lex, how do I become a successful podcaster?
[03:27:00.480 --> 03:27:03.840]   Bro, just, you know, start, like just go.
[03:27:03.840 --> 03:27:04.400]   - Yeah.
[03:27:04.400 --> 03:27:05.280]   - And--
[03:27:05.280 --> 03:27:06.560]   - Just go.
[03:27:06.560 --> 03:27:09.840]   - I would never ask you how to be a successful podcaster.
[03:27:09.840 --> 03:27:11.280]   Like I would just start it.
[03:27:11.280 --> 03:27:12.960]   And then I would copy your methods, you know?
[03:27:12.960 --> 03:27:14.560]   I would say, ah, this guy has a black background.
[03:27:14.560 --> 03:27:15.680]   We probably need this as well.
[03:27:15.680 --> 03:27:17.440]   - Yeah, try it, yeah, try it.
[03:27:17.440 --> 03:27:20.000]   And then you realize it's not about the black background.
[03:27:20.000 --> 03:27:20.800]   It's about something else.
[03:27:20.800 --> 03:27:22.800]   So you find your own voice, like keep trying stuff.
[03:27:22.800 --> 03:27:23.120]   - Exactly.
[03:27:23.120 --> 03:27:24.560]   - Imitation is a difficult thing.
[03:27:24.560 --> 03:27:27.680]   Like a lot of people copy and they don't move past it.
[03:27:27.680 --> 03:27:28.160]   - Yeah.
[03:27:28.160 --> 03:27:30.000]   - You should understand their methods
[03:27:30.000 --> 03:27:30.800]   and then move past it.
[03:27:30.800 --> 03:27:32.240]   Like find yourself, find your own voice.
[03:27:32.240 --> 03:27:34.720]   - Yeah, you imitate and then you put your own spin to it,
[03:27:34.720 --> 03:27:36.320]   you know, and that's like creative process.
[03:27:36.320 --> 03:27:37.920]   That's like, literally the whole,
[03:27:37.920 --> 03:27:39.520]   everybody always builds on the previous work.
[03:27:39.520 --> 03:27:40.000]   - Yeah.
[03:27:40.000 --> 03:27:41.040]   - You shouldn't get stuck.
[03:27:41.040 --> 03:27:43.840]   - 24 hours in a day, eight hours of sleep.
[03:27:43.840 --> 03:27:45.520]   You like break it down to a math equation.
[03:27:45.520 --> 03:27:48.720]   90 minutes of showering, clean up coffee.
[03:27:48.720 --> 03:27:51.840]   It just keeps whittling down to zero.
[03:27:51.840 --> 03:27:52.880]   - Man, it's not this specific,
[03:27:52.880 --> 03:27:55.600]   but I had to make like a, you know, an average or something.
[03:27:55.600 --> 03:27:58.080]   - Yeah, firefighting, I don't like that.
[03:27:58.080 --> 03:27:59.680]   One hours of groceries and errands.
[03:27:59.680 --> 03:28:02.480]   I've tried breaking down minute by minute
[03:28:02.480 --> 03:28:03.360]   what I do in a day.
[03:28:03.360 --> 03:28:03.920]   - Yeah.
[03:28:03.920 --> 03:28:06.080]   - Especially when my life was simpler.
[03:28:06.080 --> 03:28:07.680]   It's really refreshing to understand
[03:28:07.680 --> 03:28:08.800]   where you waste a lot of time.
[03:28:08.800 --> 03:28:09.280]   - Yeah.
[03:28:09.280 --> 03:28:12.320]   - And what you enjoy doing.
[03:28:12.320 --> 03:28:15.520]   Like how many minutes it takes to be happy
[03:28:15.520 --> 03:28:18.000]   doing the thing that makes you happy
[03:28:18.000 --> 03:28:19.680]   and how many minutes it takes to be productive.
[03:28:19.680 --> 03:28:21.600]   And you realize there's a lot of hours in the day
[03:28:21.600 --> 03:28:22.640]   if you spend it right.
[03:28:22.640 --> 03:28:24.320]   - Yeah, a lot of it is wasted, yeah.
[03:28:24.320 --> 03:28:28.720]   - For me, it's been the biggest battle for the longest time
[03:28:28.720 --> 03:28:30.160]   is finding stretches of time
[03:28:30.160 --> 03:28:32.960]   where I can deeply focus and do really, really deep work.
[03:28:32.960 --> 03:28:36.880]   Just like zoom in and completely focus,
[03:28:36.880 --> 03:28:38.480]   cutting away all the distractions.
[03:28:38.480 --> 03:28:39.440]   - Yeah, me too.
[03:28:39.440 --> 03:28:40.560]   - That's the battle.
[03:28:40.560 --> 03:28:41.200]   - Yeah.
[03:28:41.200 --> 03:28:43.120]   - It's unpleasant, it's extremely unpleasant.
[03:28:43.120 --> 03:28:45.120]   - We need to fly to an island, you know,
[03:28:45.120 --> 03:28:47.520]   make a man cave island where we can just,
[03:28:47.520 --> 03:28:49.920]   where we can just go out for a week, you know,
[03:28:49.920 --> 03:28:52.480]   and just get shit done, make new projects.
[03:28:52.480 --> 03:28:54.400]   - Yeah, yeah.
[03:28:54.400 --> 03:28:56.080]   - But man, they called me psychopath for this
[03:28:56.080 --> 03:28:58.320]   'cause it says like one hours of sex, hugs, love, you know?
[03:28:58.320 --> 03:29:00.560]   Man, I had to write something, you know?
[03:29:00.560 --> 03:29:02.720]   And they were like, oh, this guy's a psychopath.
[03:29:02.720 --> 03:29:04.960]   He plans his sex in a specific hour.
[03:29:04.960 --> 03:29:05.440]   - Hugs.
[03:29:05.440 --> 03:29:06.160]   - Bro, I don't.
[03:29:06.160 --> 03:29:07.840]   - You have a counter for hugs?
[03:29:07.840 --> 03:29:10.960]   - Yeah, exactly, like, yeah, like click, click, click.
[03:29:10.960 --> 03:29:15.120]   - It's just a numerical representation of what life is.
[03:29:15.120 --> 03:29:15.760]   - Yeah.
[03:29:15.760 --> 03:29:17.760]   - It's like one of those, like,
[03:29:17.760 --> 03:29:21.120]   when you draw out how many weeks you have in a life.
[03:29:21.120 --> 03:29:23.440]   - Oh, dude, this is like dark, yeah, man.
[03:29:23.440 --> 03:29:24.640]   Don't wanna look at that too much.
[03:29:24.640 --> 03:29:24.800]   - Holy shit.
[03:29:24.800 --> 03:29:25.440]   - Yeah, man.
[03:29:25.440 --> 03:29:27.280]   How many times you see your parents?
[03:29:27.280 --> 03:29:28.080]   Jesus, like, man.
[03:29:28.080 --> 03:29:28.400]   - Yeah.
[03:29:28.400 --> 03:29:29.280]   - It's scary, man.
[03:29:29.280 --> 03:29:30.400]   - That's right.
[03:29:30.400 --> 03:29:32.640]   It might be only, you know, a handful more times.
[03:29:32.640 --> 03:29:33.040]   - Yeah, man.
[03:29:33.040 --> 03:29:34.480]   - You just look at the math of it.
[03:29:34.480 --> 03:29:36.320]   If you see him once a year or twice a year.
[03:29:36.320 --> 03:29:37.360]   - Yeah, FaceTime today.
[03:29:37.360 --> 03:29:38.080]   - Yeah.
[03:29:38.080 --> 03:29:38.560]   - Yeah.
[03:29:38.640 --> 03:29:44.480]   I mean, that's like dark when you see somebody you like seeing,
[03:29:44.480 --> 03:29:47.600]   like a friend that's on the outskirts of your friend group.
[03:29:47.600 --> 03:29:49.600]   And then you realize like, well,
[03:29:49.600 --> 03:29:53.040]   wait, I haven't really seen him for like three years.
[03:29:53.040 --> 03:29:57.280]   So like, how many more times do we have that we see each other?
[03:29:57.280 --> 03:29:57.520]   Yeah.
[03:29:57.520 --> 03:30:00.480]   - Do you believe that like friends just slowly disappear
[03:30:00.480 --> 03:30:01.040]   from your life?
[03:30:01.040 --> 03:30:04.320]   Like they kind of, your friend group evolves, right?
[03:30:04.320 --> 03:30:05.360]   - It does, it does.
[03:30:05.360 --> 03:30:07.360]   - Like you don't want to, there's a problem with Facebook.
[03:30:07.360 --> 03:30:09.120]   You get all these old friends from school,
[03:30:09.120 --> 03:30:12.240]   like when you were 10 years old, back when Facebook started,
[03:30:12.240 --> 03:30:14.400]   like you don't really, you would add friend them.
[03:30:14.400 --> 03:30:16.240]   And then you're like, why are we in touch again?
[03:30:16.240 --> 03:30:17.200]   Just keep the memories there.
[03:30:17.200 --> 03:30:19.280]   You know, like it's a different life now.
[03:30:19.280 --> 03:30:21.520]   - Yeah, I have, you know, I don't know.
[03:30:21.520 --> 03:30:23.760]   That might be a guy thing or I don't know.
[03:30:23.760 --> 03:30:26.960]   There's certain friends I have that like we don't interact
[03:30:26.960 --> 03:30:28.480]   often, but we're still friends.
[03:30:28.480 --> 03:30:29.040]   - Yeah.
[03:30:29.040 --> 03:30:31.760]   - Like every time I see him,
[03:30:34.080 --> 03:30:35.920]   I think it's because we have a foundation
[03:30:35.920 --> 03:30:38.960]   of many shared experiences and many memories.
[03:30:38.960 --> 03:30:40.960]   I guess it's like, nothing has changed.
[03:30:40.960 --> 03:30:43.200]   Like we've been, almost like we've been talking every day,
[03:30:43.200 --> 03:30:44.560]   even if we haven't talked for a year.
[03:30:44.560 --> 03:30:46.880]   - Yeah, that's like, yeah, that's deep.
[03:30:46.880 --> 03:30:50.720]   - Yeah, so that, so I don't have to be interacting with them
[03:30:50.720 --> 03:30:52.000]   for them to be in a friend group.
[03:30:52.000 --> 03:30:54.400]   And then there's some people I interact with a lot.
[03:30:54.400 --> 03:30:58.080]   So it depends, but there's just this network
[03:30:58.080 --> 03:31:00.720]   of good human beings that can,
[03:31:02.240 --> 03:31:03.760]   I have like a real love for them.
[03:31:03.760 --> 03:31:06.480]   And I can always count on them.
[03:31:06.480 --> 03:31:07.920]   It's like, if any of them called me
[03:31:07.920 --> 03:31:11.280]   in the middle of the night, I'll get rid of a body.
[03:31:11.280 --> 03:31:12.880]   You know, I'm there.
[03:31:12.880 --> 03:31:16.800]   I like how that's a different definition of friendship,
[03:31:16.800 --> 03:31:18.560]   but it's true, it's true.
[03:31:18.560 --> 03:31:19.280]   - True friend.
[03:31:19.280 --> 03:31:22.400]   - You've become more and more famous recently.
[03:31:22.400 --> 03:31:23.920]   How's that affect you?
[03:31:23.920 --> 03:31:26.400]   - It's not recently, I think it's this gradual thing, right?
[03:31:26.400 --> 03:31:27.920]   Like it keeps going.
[03:31:28.880 --> 03:31:32.240]   And I also don't know why it keeps going.
[03:31:32.240 --> 03:31:35.040]   - Does that put pressure on you to,
[03:31:35.040 --> 03:31:36.720]   'cause you're pretty open on Twitter
[03:31:36.720 --> 03:31:39.680]   and you're just like basically building shit in the open.
[03:31:39.680 --> 03:31:40.240]   - Yeah.
[03:31:40.240 --> 03:31:44.400]   - And just not really caring if it's too technical,
[03:31:44.400 --> 03:31:46.720]   if there's any of this, just being out there.
[03:31:46.720 --> 03:31:48.480]   Does it put pressure on you as you become more popular
[03:31:48.480 --> 03:31:53.040]   to be a little bit more like collected and?
[03:31:53.040 --> 03:31:55.200]   - Man, I think the opposite, right?
[03:31:55.200 --> 03:31:59.360]   Like, 'cause the people I follow are interesting
[03:31:59.360 --> 03:32:00.640]   'cause they say whatever they think
[03:32:00.640 --> 03:32:02.080]   and they ship or whatever.
[03:32:02.080 --> 03:32:04.880]   It's so boring that people start tweeting
[03:32:04.880 --> 03:32:06.000]   only about one topic.
[03:32:06.000 --> 03:32:06.560]   - Yeah.
[03:32:06.560 --> 03:32:07.920]   - I don't know anything about their personal life.
[03:32:07.920 --> 03:32:08.880]   I wanna know about their personal life.
[03:32:08.880 --> 03:32:10.640]   Like you do podcasts, you ask about life stuff,
[03:32:10.640 --> 03:32:11.440]   of personality.
[03:32:11.440 --> 03:32:14.400]   That's the most interesting part of like business or sports.
[03:32:14.400 --> 03:32:16.560]   Like what's behind the sport, the athlete, right?
[03:32:16.560 --> 03:32:17.680]   Behind the entrepreneur.
[03:32:17.680 --> 03:32:18.480]   That's interesting stuff.
[03:32:18.480 --> 03:32:19.280]   - To be human.
[03:32:19.280 --> 03:32:21.280]   - Yeah, like you share that, you know,
[03:32:21.280 --> 03:32:23.600]   like I shared a tweet that went too far,
[03:32:23.600 --> 03:32:25.360]   but like we were cleaning the toilet
[03:32:25.360 --> 03:32:26.880]   'cause the toilet was clogged, you know?
[03:32:26.880 --> 03:32:28.320]   But like, it's just real stuff
[03:32:28.320 --> 03:32:29.920]   'cause Jensen Huang, the NVIDIA guy,
[03:32:29.920 --> 03:32:32.080]   he says he started cleaning toilets, you know?
[03:32:32.080 --> 03:32:32.560]   - That was cool.
[03:32:32.560 --> 03:32:36.240]   You tweeted something about the Denny's thing, I forget.
[03:32:36.240 --> 03:32:37.840]   - Yeah, it was recent.
[03:32:37.840 --> 03:32:40.720]   NVIDIA was started in a Denny diner table.
[03:32:40.720 --> 03:32:42.720]   - And you made it somehow profound.
[03:32:42.720 --> 03:32:44.160]   - You almost, yeah, this one, this one.
[03:32:44.160 --> 03:32:47.120]   - "NVIDIA, a $3 trillion company
[03:32:47.120 --> 03:32:50.000]   "was started in a Denny's, an American diner.
[03:32:50.000 --> 03:32:52.480]   "People need a third space to work on their laptops
[03:32:52.480 --> 03:32:54.880]   "to build the next billion or trillion dollar company."
[03:32:54.880 --> 03:32:56.240]   What's the first and second space?
[03:32:56.240 --> 03:32:57.920]   - The home, office.
[03:32:57.920 --> 03:32:59.440]   - And then the in-between, the island.
[03:32:59.440 --> 03:33:00.160]   - Yeah, I guess, yeah.
[03:33:00.160 --> 03:33:00.880]   - The island.
[03:33:00.880 --> 03:33:03.280]   - Yeah, you need a space to like congregate.
[03:33:03.280 --> 03:33:04.720]   Man, and I found history on this.
[03:33:04.720 --> 03:33:07.520]   So 400 years ago in the coffee houses of Europe,
[03:33:07.520 --> 03:33:12.640]   like the scientific revolution, the enlightenment happened
[03:33:12.640 --> 03:33:14.000]   because they would go to coffee houses,
[03:33:14.000 --> 03:33:16.000]   they would sit there, they would drink coffee
[03:33:16.000 --> 03:33:16.800]   and they would work.
[03:33:16.800 --> 03:33:18.320]   They would work, they would write
[03:33:18.320 --> 03:33:20.000]   or they would, and they would do debates
[03:33:20.000 --> 03:33:23.440]   and they would organize marine routes, right?
[03:33:23.440 --> 03:33:25.760]   They would do all this stuff in coffee houses in Europe,
[03:33:25.760 --> 03:33:28.160]   in France, in Austria, in UK, in Holland.
[03:33:28.160 --> 03:33:30.640]   So we would always be going to,
[03:33:30.640 --> 03:33:32.720]   we were always going to cafes to work
[03:33:32.720 --> 03:33:36.000]   and to have serendipitous conversations with other people
[03:33:36.000 --> 03:33:37.840]   and start businesses and stuff.
[03:33:37.840 --> 03:33:41.520]   And when I, like you asked me to come on here
[03:33:41.520 --> 03:33:42.480]   and we flew to America.
[03:33:42.480 --> 03:33:44.400]   And the first thing I realized was that,
[03:33:44.400 --> 03:33:47.440]   I've been to America before, but we were in this cafe
[03:33:47.440 --> 03:33:49.280]   and like, there's a lot of laptops.
[03:33:49.280 --> 03:33:50.400]   Everybody's working on something.
[03:33:50.400 --> 03:33:51.680]   And I made, I took this photo.
[03:33:51.680 --> 03:33:54.560]   And then when you're in Europe,
[03:33:54.560 --> 03:33:56.000]   like large parts of Europe now,
[03:33:56.000 --> 03:33:58.240]   you cannot use a laptop anymore.
[03:33:58.240 --> 03:34:01.040]   It's like no laptop, which I understand.
[03:34:01.040 --> 03:34:05.280]   - But that is to you a fundamental place to create shit,
[03:34:05.280 --> 03:34:06.240]   isn't it?
[03:34:06.240 --> 03:34:09.680]   Natural, organic co-working space of a coffee shop.
[03:34:09.680 --> 03:34:10.480]   - Well, for a lot of people.
[03:34:10.480 --> 03:34:12.400]   A lot of people have very small homes
[03:34:12.400 --> 03:34:14.720]   and co-working spaces are kind of boring.
[03:34:14.720 --> 03:34:17.040]   They're not very, they're private.
[03:34:17.040 --> 03:34:19.920]   They're not serendipitous, kind of boring.
[03:34:19.920 --> 03:34:22.560]   Cafes are amazing 'cause they,
[03:34:22.560 --> 03:34:24.000]   random people can come in and ask you,
[03:34:24.000 --> 03:34:24.640]   what are you working on?
[03:34:24.640 --> 03:34:26.880]   And not just laptops.
[03:34:26.880 --> 03:34:28.640]   People are also having conversations
[03:34:28.640 --> 03:34:30.560]   like they did 400 years ago, debates or whatever.
[03:34:30.560 --> 03:34:31.200]   Things are happening.
[03:34:31.200 --> 03:34:34.320]   And man, I understand the aesthetics of it.
[03:34:34.320 --> 03:34:36.560]   Like, it's like, oh, start a brawl.
[03:34:36.560 --> 03:34:38.400]   Shipping is a bullshit startup, you know?
[03:34:38.400 --> 03:34:41.120]   But there's something more there.
[03:34:41.120 --> 03:34:43.040]   Like there's people actually making stuff,
[03:34:43.040 --> 03:34:46.160]   making new companies that the society benefits from.
[03:34:46.160 --> 03:34:48.320]   Like we're benefiting from NVIDIA, I think.
[03:34:48.320 --> 03:34:51.280]   The US GDP for sure is benefiting from NVIDIA.
[03:34:51.280 --> 03:34:54.400]   European GDP could benefit if we build more companies.
[03:34:54.400 --> 03:34:57.040]   And I feel in Europe, there's this vibe.
[03:34:57.040 --> 03:34:59.360]   And this, you have to connect things,
[03:34:59.360 --> 03:35:01.440]   but not allowing laptops in cafes
[03:35:01.440 --> 03:35:03.200]   is kind of like part of the vibe, which is like,
[03:35:03.200 --> 03:35:05.040]   yeah, we're not really here to work.
[03:35:05.040 --> 03:35:06.320]   We're here to like enjoy life.
[03:35:06.320 --> 03:35:06.960]   I agree with this.
[03:35:06.960 --> 03:35:09.040]   Anthony Bourdain, like this tweet was quote
[03:35:09.040 --> 03:35:10.880]   to Anthony Bourdain photo with him
[03:35:10.880 --> 03:35:13.360]   with cigarettes and a coffee in France.
[03:35:13.360 --> 03:35:15.120]   And he said, this is what cafes are for.
[03:35:15.120 --> 03:35:15.760]   I agree.
[03:35:15.760 --> 03:35:18.000]   But there is some element of like entrepreneurship.
[03:35:18.000 --> 03:35:22.080]   Like you have to allow people to dream big
[03:35:22.080 --> 03:35:24.320]   and work their ass off towards that dream
[03:35:24.320 --> 03:35:26.960]   and then feel each other's energy as they interact with it.
[03:35:26.960 --> 03:35:28.960]   That's one of the things I liked in Silicon Valley
[03:35:28.960 --> 03:35:31.760]   when I was working there is like the cafes.
[03:35:31.760 --> 03:35:35.040]   There's a bunch of dreamers that you can make fun of them
[03:35:35.040 --> 03:35:36.720]   for like everybody thinks they're gonna build
[03:35:36.720 --> 03:35:38.320]   a trillion dollar company, but like-
[03:35:38.320 --> 03:35:39.040]   - Yeah, and it's awesome.
[03:35:39.040 --> 03:35:39.680]   Not everybody wins.
[03:35:39.680 --> 03:35:41.200]   90% of people will be bullshit.
[03:35:41.200 --> 03:35:42.640]   - But they're working their ass off.
[03:35:42.640 --> 03:35:43.920]   - Yeah, and they're doing something.
[03:35:43.920 --> 03:35:46.800]   And you need to pass this startup bro.
[03:35:46.800 --> 03:35:47.840]   Like, oh, it's startup on level.
[03:35:47.840 --> 03:35:48.320]   No, it's not.
[03:35:48.320 --> 03:35:49.680]   It's people making cool shit.
[03:35:49.680 --> 03:35:51.280]   And this will benefit you
[03:35:51.280 --> 03:35:53.680]   because this will create jobs for your country
[03:35:53.680 --> 03:35:54.480]   and your region.
[03:35:54.480 --> 03:35:58.320]   And I think in Europe, that's a big problem.
[03:35:58.320 --> 03:36:02.720]   Like we have a very anti-entrepreneurial mindset.
[03:36:02.720 --> 03:36:04.080]   - Dream big and build shit.
[03:36:04.080 --> 03:36:04.560]   - Yeah.
[03:36:04.560 --> 03:36:05.680]   - And this is really inspiring.
[03:36:05.680 --> 03:36:07.280]   This is pinned tweet of yours.
[03:36:07.280 --> 03:36:09.600]   All the projects that you've tried
[03:36:09.600 --> 03:36:11.600]   and the ones that succeeded.
[03:36:11.760 --> 03:36:13.520]   - That's very few.
[03:36:13.520 --> 03:36:14.480]   - Mute life.
[03:36:14.480 --> 03:36:18.640]   - It was for Twitter to mute, to share the mute list.
[03:36:18.640 --> 03:36:19.120]   - Yeah.
[03:36:19.120 --> 03:36:21.360]   - Your mute words.
[03:36:21.360 --> 03:36:25.200]   - Fire calculator, no more Google, maker rank.
[03:36:25.200 --> 03:36:27.040]   How much is my site project worth?
[03:36:27.040 --> 03:36:29.440]   Climate finder, ideas AI.
[03:36:29.440 --> 03:36:32.160]   - Airline list still runs, but it doesn't make money.
[03:36:32.160 --> 03:36:34.800]   Airline list like compares the safety of airlines
[03:36:34.800 --> 03:36:36.400]   'cause I was nervous to fly.
[03:36:36.400 --> 03:36:38.080]   So I was like, let's collect all the data
[03:36:38.080 --> 03:36:40.000]   on crashes for all the airplanes.
[03:36:40.000 --> 03:36:43.520]   - Bali sea cable, nice.
[03:36:43.520 --> 03:36:44.160]   That's awesome.
[03:36:44.160 --> 03:36:50.000]   Make village, Nomad gear, 3D and virtual reality dev.
[03:36:50.000 --> 03:36:52.960]   Play my inbox, like you mentioned.
[03:36:52.960 --> 03:36:54.160]   There's a lot of stuff.
[03:36:54.160 --> 03:36:54.480]   - Yeah, man.
[03:36:54.480 --> 03:36:56.560]   - I'm trying to find some embarrassing tweets of yours.
[03:36:56.560 --> 03:36:58.160]   - You can go to the highlights tab.
[03:36:58.160 --> 03:36:59.520]   It has all the like the good shit kind.
[03:36:59.520 --> 03:37:00.880]   - There you go.
[03:37:00.880 --> 03:37:02.080]   - This was Dubai.
[03:37:02.080 --> 03:37:04.640]   - POV, building an AI startup.
[03:37:04.640 --> 03:37:07.760]   Wow, you're a real influencer.
[03:37:07.760 --> 03:37:10.880]   - And if people copy this photo now
[03:37:10.880 --> 03:37:13.280]   and they change the screenshot, it becomes like a meme.
[03:37:13.280 --> 03:37:15.040]   Of course, you know.
[03:37:15.040 --> 03:37:16.960]   - This is good.
[03:37:16.960 --> 03:37:19.360]   - That's how Dubai looks, it's insane.
[03:37:19.360 --> 03:37:22.080]   - That's beautiful, architecture wise, it's crazy.
[03:37:22.080 --> 03:37:23.200]   The story behind these cities.
[03:37:23.200 --> 03:37:24.480]   - Yeah, the story behind, for sure.
[03:37:24.480 --> 03:37:26.800]   So this is about the European economy where like.
[03:37:26.800 --> 03:37:29.280]   - European economy landscape is ran by dinosaurs
[03:37:29.280 --> 03:37:33.920]   and today I studied it so I can produce you with my evidence.
[03:37:33.920 --> 03:37:37.520]   80% of top EU companies were founded before 1950.
[03:37:37.520 --> 03:37:42.400]   Only 36% of top US companies were founded before 1950.
[03:37:42.400 --> 03:37:45.040]   - Yeah, so the median founding of companies in US
[03:37:45.040 --> 03:37:48.000]   is something like 1960 and the median,
[03:37:48.000 --> 03:37:49.360]   the top companies, right?
[03:37:49.360 --> 03:37:52.640]   And the median in Europe is like 1900 or something.
[03:37:52.640 --> 03:37:53.200]   - Yeah.
[03:37:53.200 --> 03:37:56.400]   - So it's here, 1914 and 1963.
[03:37:56.400 --> 03:37:57.520]   So there's a 50 year difference.
[03:37:57.520 --> 03:38:01.440]   - It's a good representation of the very thing
[03:38:01.440 --> 03:38:03.840]   you were talking about, the difference in the cultures,
[03:38:03.840 --> 03:38:05.600]   entrepreneurial spirit of the peoples.
[03:38:05.600 --> 03:38:07.120]   - But Europe used to be entrepreneurial.
[03:38:07.120 --> 03:38:10.400]   Like there was companies founded in 1800, 1850, 1900.
[03:38:10.400 --> 03:38:14.240]   It flipped like around 1950 where America took the lead
[03:38:14.240 --> 03:38:18.000]   and I guess my point is like I hope that Europe gets back to,
[03:38:18.000 --> 03:38:19.600]   'cause I'm European, I hope that Europe gets back
[03:38:19.600 --> 03:38:21.520]   to being an entrepreneurial culture
[03:38:21.520 --> 03:38:23.360]   where they build big companies again.
[03:38:23.360 --> 03:38:27.040]   'Cause right now all the old dinosaur companies
[03:38:27.040 --> 03:38:29.520]   control the economies, they're lobbying with the government.
[03:38:29.520 --> 03:38:32.800]   Europe is also, they're infiltrated with the government
[03:38:32.800 --> 03:38:34.960]   where they create so much regulation.
[03:38:35.680 --> 03:38:37.200]   I think it's called regulatory capture, right?
[03:38:37.200 --> 03:38:40.400]   Where it's very hard for a newcomer to join
[03:38:40.400 --> 03:38:42.720]   and to enter an industry because there's too much regulation.
[03:38:42.720 --> 03:38:44.640]   So actually regulation is very good for big companies
[03:38:44.640 --> 03:38:47.200]   'cause they can follow it, I can't follow it, right?
[03:38:47.200 --> 03:38:49.040]   If I wanna start an AI startup in Europe now,
[03:38:49.040 --> 03:38:51.840]   I cannot because there's an AI regulation
[03:38:51.840 --> 03:38:54.000]   that makes it very complicated for me.
[03:38:54.000 --> 03:38:55.840]   I probably need to get like notaries involved,
[03:38:55.840 --> 03:38:57.520]   I need to get certificates, licenses.
[03:38:57.520 --> 03:39:00.960]   Whereas in America, I can just open my laptop,
[03:39:00.960 --> 03:39:05.040]   I can start an AI startup right now, mostly.
[03:39:06.000 --> 03:39:07.440]   - What do you think about EAC,
[03:39:07.440 --> 03:39:09.440]   Effective Accelerationist Movement?
[03:39:09.440 --> 03:39:12.160]   - Man, you had Beth Jaysus on, I love Beth Jaysus
[03:39:12.160 --> 03:39:13.760]   and he's amazing.
[03:39:13.760 --> 03:39:16.240]   And I think EAC is very needed
[03:39:16.240 --> 03:39:20.720]   to similarly create a more positive outlook on the future.
[03:39:20.720 --> 03:39:25.840]   Because people have been very pessimistic about society,
[03:39:25.840 --> 03:39:29.920]   about the future of society, climate change, all this stuff.
[03:39:29.920 --> 03:39:34.560]   EAC is a positive outlook on the future.
[03:39:34.560 --> 03:39:36.560]   It's like technology can make us,
[03:39:36.560 --> 03:39:37.680]   we need to spend more energy,
[03:39:37.680 --> 03:39:40.240]   we should find ways to of course get like clean energy,
[03:39:40.240 --> 03:39:43.600]   but we need to spend more energy to make cooler stuff
[03:39:43.600 --> 03:39:46.400]   and go into space and build more technology
[03:39:46.400 --> 03:39:48.320]   that can improve society.
[03:39:48.320 --> 03:39:50.400]   And we shouldn't shy away from technology.
[03:39:50.400 --> 03:39:52.720]   Technology can be the answer for many things.
[03:39:52.720 --> 03:39:56.000]   - Yeah, build more, don't spend so much time
[03:39:56.000 --> 03:39:58.800]   on fear mongering and cautiousness
[03:39:58.800 --> 03:40:00.240]   and all this kind of stuff.
[03:40:00.240 --> 03:40:02.000]   Some is okay, some is good,
[03:40:02.000 --> 03:40:04.720]   but most of the time should be spent on building
[03:40:04.720 --> 03:40:07.440]   and creating and doing so unapologetically.
[03:40:07.440 --> 03:40:12.400]   It's a refreshing reminder of what made United States great
[03:40:12.400 --> 03:40:14.960]   is all the builders, like you said, the entrepreneurs.
[03:40:14.960 --> 03:40:17.440]   We can't forget that in all the sort of discussions
[03:40:17.440 --> 03:40:19.200]   of how things could go wrong with technology
[03:40:19.200 --> 03:40:20.160]   and all this kind of stuff.
[03:40:20.160 --> 03:40:20.880]   - Yeah, it goes together.
[03:40:20.880 --> 03:40:21.440]   Look at China.
[03:40:21.440 --> 03:40:23.120]   China is now at the stage of like America,
[03:40:23.120 --> 03:40:24.720]   what, like 1900 or something?
[03:40:24.720 --> 03:40:27.280]   They're building rapidly, like insane.
[03:40:27.280 --> 03:40:29.760]   And obviously China has massive problems,
[03:40:29.760 --> 03:40:31.200]   but that comes with the whole thing.
[03:40:31.200 --> 03:40:32.640]   That comes with America in this beginning
[03:40:32.640 --> 03:40:33.760]   all the massive problems, right?
[03:40:33.760 --> 03:40:39.680]   But I think it's very dangerous for a country
[03:40:39.680 --> 03:40:40.880]   or a region like Europe to,
[03:40:40.880 --> 03:40:44.640]   you get to this point where you're kind of complacent,
[03:40:44.640 --> 03:40:45.440]   you're kind of comfortable.
[03:40:45.440 --> 03:40:48.560]   And then you can either go this
[03:40:48.560 --> 03:40:49.680]   or you can go this way, right?
[03:40:49.680 --> 03:40:51.280]   You're from here, you go like this,
[03:40:51.280 --> 03:40:52.720]   and then you can go this or this.
[03:40:52.720 --> 03:40:54.000]   I think you should go this way.
[03:40:54.000 --> 03:40:56.320]   - Go up.
[03:40:56.320 --> 03:40:57.040]   - Yeah, go up.
[03:40:57.040 --> 03:41:02.000]   And I think the problem is the mind culture.
[03:41:02.000 --> 03:41:03.840]   So EOC, I made EUOC,
[03:41:03.840 --> 03:41:05.200]   which is like the European kind of version.
[03:41:05.200 --> 03:41:07.520]   I made like hoodies and stuff.
[03:41:07.520 --> 03:41:08.880]   So a lot of people wear like this,
[03:41:08.880 --> 03:41:10.320]   this make Europe great again hat.
[03:41:10.320 --> 03:41:14.000]   I made it red first, but it became too like Trump.
[03:41:14.000 --> 03:41:16.400]   So now it's more like European blue, you know?
[03:41:16.400 --> 03:41:17.440]   Make Europe great again.
[03:41:17.440 --> 03:41:20.000]   - All right.
[03:41:20.000 --> 03:41:24.960]   Okay, so you had a incredible life.
[03:41:26.560 --> 03:41:28.320]   Very successful, built a lot of cool stuff.
[03:41:28.320 --> 03:41:29.920]   So what advice would you give to young people
[03:41:29.920 --> 03:41:30.960]   about how to do the same?
[03:41:30.960 --> 03:41:33.120]   - Man, I would listen to like,
[03:41:33.120 --> 03:41:35.280]   nobody just do what you think is good
[03:41:35.280 --> 03:41:36.800]   and follow your heart, right?
[03:41:36.800 --> 03:41:39.200]   Like everybody peer presses you
[03:41:39.200 --> 03:41:40.640]   into doing stuff you don't want to do.
[03:41:40.640 --> 03:41:43.200]   And like, they tell you like parents
[03:41:43.200 --> 03:41:45.360]   or family or society and tell you,
[03:41:45.360 --> 03:41:47.600]   but like, try your own thing, you know?
[03:41:47.600 --> 03:41:49.680]   'Cause it probably, it might work out.
[03:41:49.680 --> 03:41:51.280]   You can steer the ship, you know?
[03:41:51.280 --> 03:41:52.880]   It probably doesn't work out immediately.
[03:41:52.880 --> 03:41:56.080]   You probably go into very bad times like I did as well,
[03:41:56.080 --> 03:41:57.200]   relatively, right?
[03:41:57.200 --> 03:41:58.560]   But in the end, if you're smart about it,
[03:41:58.560 --> 03:41:59.920]   you can make things work
[03:41:59.920 --> 03:42:02.320]   and you can create your own little life of things
[03:42:02.320 --> 03:42:03.600]   as you did, as I did.
[03:42:03.600 --> 03:42:06.400]   And I think that should be more promoted,
[03:42:06.400 --> 03:42:07.440]   like do your own thing.
[03:42:07.440 --> 03:42:09.200]   There's space in economy and in society
[03:42:09.200 --> 03:42:11.440]   for do your own thing, you know?
[03:42:11.440 --> 03:42:13.440]   It's like little villages.
[03:42:13.440 --> 03:42:15.120]   Everybody would sell, I would sell bread.
[03:42:15.120 --> 03:42:16.080]   You would sell meat.
[03:42:16.080 --> 03:42:17.200]   Everybody can do their own little thing.
[03:42:17.200 --> 03:42:20.640]   You don't need to be a normie, as you say.
[03:42:20.640 --> 03:42:24.080]   You can be what you really want to be, you know?
[03:42:24.960 --> 03:42:28.160]   - And like, go all out doing that thing.
[03:42:28.160 --> 03:42:29.200]   - Yeah, you gotta go all out.
[03:42:29.200 --> 03:42:31.520]   'Cause if you do, if you're half-ass it,
[03:42:31.520 --> 03:42:32.960]   you cannot succeed.
[03:42:32.960 --> 03:42:36.560]   You need to go lean into the outcast stuff,
[03:42:36.560 --> 03:42:39.120]   lean into the being different
[03:42:39.120 --> 03:42:42.320]   and just doing whatever it is that you wanna do, right?
[03:42:42.320 --> 03:42:44.480]   - You gotta whole-ass it.
[03:42:44.480 --> 03:42:46.080]   - Yeah, whole-ass it, yeah.
[03:42:46.080 --> 03:42:47.680]   - This was an incredible conversation.
[03:42:47.680 --> 03:42:49.280]   It was an honor to finally meet you.
[03:42:49.280 --> 03:42:50.640]   - It was an honor to meet you, Lex.
[03:42:50.640 --> 03:42:52.880]   - To talk to you and keep doing your thing.
[03:42:52.880 --> 03:42:56.000]   Keep inspiring me and the world
[03:42:56.000 --> 03:42:57.520]   with all the cool stuff you're building.
[03:42:57.520 --> 03:42:58.240]   - Thank you, man.
[03:42:58.240 --> 03:43:00.720]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[03:43:00.720 --> 03:43:01.920]   with Peter Levels.

[03:43:08.000 --> 03:43:10.960]   from Drew Houston, Dropbox co-founder.
[03:43:10.960 --> 03:43:13.520]   By the way, I love Dropbox.
[03:43:13.520 --> 03:43:18.320]   Anyway, Drew said, "Don't worry about failure.
[03:43:18.320 --> 03:43:20.960]   "You only have to be right once."
[03:43:22.080 --> 03:43:23.200]   Thank you for listening.
[03:43:23.200 --> 03:43:25.200]   I hope to see you next time.
[03:43:25.200 --> 03:43:27.780]   (upbeat music)
[03:43:27.780 --> 03:43:30.360]   (upbeat music)
