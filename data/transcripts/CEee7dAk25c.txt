[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.840]   Hey guys, I got a little friend here.
[00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.380]   What?
[00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.240]   Yeah, I think I'm gonna start a new podcast.
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.360]   Is that a bulldog?
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.440]   And I'm gonna have a bulldog as my mascot.
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.440]   You bought a bulldog?
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.400]   Oh my god, you got my mascot.
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.480]   Yeah, I took over your mascot.
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.960]   Look at that, now you're actually likable, Sax.
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.320]   Sax, are you trying to improve your image?
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.080]   Sax is so unlikable that he has gotten a bulldog.
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.760]   Oh my god, Sax, show me his face again.
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.520]   Is it him or her?
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.020]   Him.
[00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.520]   What's his name?
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.800]   His name is Moose.
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.840]   Oh my god.
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.480]   Oh my god, you got a bulldog, he's so cute.
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.680]   It's me and my mascot, Jake.
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.120]   I'm going solo with my podcast.
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.960]   I'm gonna call it This Week in Technology.
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.120]   It already exists, it's Leo Laporte's podcast.
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.600]   Please don't start any more trademarkal updates.
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.920]   All right, everybody, it's an emergency podcast.
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.480]   Silicon Valley Bank has been taken over by the FDIC.
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.480]   Sorry, is this the Twist livestream?
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.760]   Am I on the Twist livestream?
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.760]   I mean, guys, if you couldn't just interrupt me while...
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:58.720]   I'm never gonna get through this.
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:59.760]   It's a lot to get through.
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.680]   The world needs to hear our opinions.

[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.520]   It is a huge day today in Silicon Valley.
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.120]   We haven't seen a Black Swan like event happen here in a long time, since 2008.
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.840]   I thought the last time was when you published the book Angel.
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:30.400]   Oh, God.
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.880]   We have to get to work, Chamath.
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.400]   I saved the jokes.
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.000]   I'm trying to give you a cold open.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.640]   We did that already.
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.040]   Here we go.
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.840]   Three, two...
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.440]   Okay, everybody.
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.000]   It's been a while.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.200]   36 hours here.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.920]   We're gonna get into Silicon Valley Bank imploding.
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.560]   The FDIC has shut down Silicon Valley Bank.
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.960]   And there's many different things we have to discuss with me today.
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.200]   As always, the dictator himself, Chamath Palihapitiya, the rain man, David Sacks,
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.440]   and the prince of panic attacks no more.
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.800]   His wires cleared.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.880]   David Freeburg, the sultan of science.
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:19.600]   Welcome, boys.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.600]   How is everybody, just to start this off, contextually, the last 24 hours,
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:33.920]   can you recall a time in our careers where it's felt this acute or insane or intense?
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.760]   2008 and COVID.
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.560]   And I think that this is right up there, could be two, probably three,
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.280]   in terms of the level of panic and concern.
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.200]   The problem is we're in the middle of it.
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.960]   We don't know what's going to happen this weekend.
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.320]   So there's a lot of anxiety right now, a lot of panic going on.
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:58.640]   And a lot of, unlike COVID and '08, really acute effects that many companies and investors are
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.880]   actively dealing with right now, like not just a few, thousands of companies that are really in a
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.800]   state of distress right now.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.480]   So it is potentially, from a Silicon Valley perspective, worse than '08 or COVID.
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.360]   Oh, for sure.
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.920]   For sure.
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.080]   I mean, this is basically a Lehman-sized event for Silicon Valley.
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.840]   Remember when Lehman Brothers went out, basically filed for bankruptcy in 2008,
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.280]   started the whole financial crisis.
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.680]   The federal authorities thought that the best plan for Lehman was to file for bankruptcy.
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.200]   They didn't try to save it.
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.440]   And that basically led to a cascade where the whole financial system almost collapsed.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.960]   I think that SVB, this is a Lehman-sized event for Silicon Valley.
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.360]   And there's two big things happening.
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.560]   One is the impact on the startup ecosystem.
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:50.080]   So you're seeing probably thousands of companies now cannot make payroll in the next few weeks
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:56.560]   because their money is trapped and tied up at Silicon Valley Bank, which is now under receivership.
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.160]   So if you wired your money out yesterday, you're good.
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.080]   And a lot of people managed to do that.
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.120]   But there are a lot of people who had wires in the hopper, didn't make it.
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.760]   Today, logged into the website, can't log in.
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:10.880]   Their money's just frozen.
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.240]   And we don't know when they're gonna be able to get their money out or how many cents in
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.360]   the dollar you're gonna get.
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:21.520]   So basically, the whole startup ecosystem is in peril.
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.240]   I think Gary Tann called it an extinction level event.
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.880]   Yes, exactly.
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:25.600]   That was a good term.
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.040]   And just to be really clear, this is not big tech at risk.
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.320]   I know there's a lot of people out there who don't like the idea of bailing out big tech.
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.080]   This is not Google.
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.040]   It's not Amazon.
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.320]   Those companies have plenty of cash.
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.880]   They're fine.
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.560]   This is small companies, companies with 10 to 100 employees.
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.840]   And you're looking at maybe thousands of them just being wiped out for no reason.
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.920]   They didn't do anything wrong because of this.
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.320]   This could have a very damaging effect on the startup economy and the whole United States
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.800]   economy.
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.000]   This is little tech.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.160]   These are the future companies that will keep the United States competitive versus China
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.000]   and the rest of the world.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.280]   And then the other big thing that's happening, and it's all happening in real time,
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.600]   is a regional banking crisis.
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:15.520]   Because when depositors see that their money was not safe at SVB, which was a top 20 bank,
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.480]   that as far as everyone knows, was in regulatory compliance.
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.000]   Nobody has said that SVB wasn't compliant.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.800]   As far as we know, they had a regulator's seal of approval.
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:31.680]   And now you find out your money was not safe and it's not FDIC insured above $250,000.
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.880]   So the conversations we're all seeing in our chat groups with leading investors is,
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.520]   why the hell would you keep your money anywhere but JP Morgan or a top four bank?
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:47.520]   And so I think that unless the Fed steps in here over the weekend, we're going to see
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:53.840]   potentially a run on the regional banking system, a cascade like we saw in 2008.
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.200]   Well, Sax, let's just take a step back before, because I think you're right,
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.280]   but we should talk about why that happens, the contagion drivers.
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:07.520]   And just so people know, Silicon Valley Bank is used by 50% of venture backed startups.
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.600]   And I would say the majority of venture firms also have their money there.
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:17.600]   So this morning, I got a note from a fund I'm an LPN, they have millions of dollars
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.520]   that they can access to invest in startups.
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:25.680]   So Chamath, there are many products and services that Silicon Valley provides.
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.640]   One is, you know, banking services to startups.
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.480]   Another is to venture capitalists.
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:36.160]   They do the mortgages for banker for venture capitalists, and for founders as well.
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.480]   They provide those kind of white glove services.
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:43.120]   But you also mentioned in our group chat, they also provide loans to GPS general partners,
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.280]   the people who run venture firms.
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.040]   So the impact could also hit there.
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.880]   Maybe you could explain what that is.
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.720]   And then we'll get into what happened here.
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.440]   Yeah, well, I think it's important, maybe actually just for
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.840]   Friedberg to just explain what's happening.
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.160]   But okay, can maybe maybe let me just do the lead in and then Friedberg can do the details.
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.320]   But for for those that are far away, and aren't even sure what's going on.
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:09.600]   The basic problem that we have right now is in the last 36 hours,
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:14.880]   a key part of the financial plumbing of Silicon Valley has basically been turned off.
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:21.840]   And as a result, billions of dollars of deposits have basically been frozen.
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.320]   It means that people can't pay their bills.
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:27.120]   It means that people can't access their deposits.
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.600]   It means that credit lines could be in default.
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.240]   It means that payroll can't be met.
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:36.080]   And so as a result, we have this potential contagion on our hands.
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:40.560]   But in order to understand it and unpack it, I think it's important to explain exactly
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.160]   how this came to pass.
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.920]   So let me just hand the ball to Friedberg.
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:46.480]   And then we can talk about some of the implications of which there are many.
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:50.960]   Yeah, before Friedberg starts with the why just the what that's happened as well.
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.880]   This all started on Wednesday evening, when Silicon Valley banks CEO published a letter
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:59.760]   to shareholders announcing that the bank was rebalancing its balance sheet by selling 10s
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:04.240]   of billions of dollars worth of mostly US securities, I'm sorry, treasuries.
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:08.480]   Then they announced they would raise some money and sell some shares in Silicon Valley Bank.
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:14.000]   Then the shares in Silicon Valley Bank is a publicly traded entity dropped 60% on Thursday,
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.080]   then another 60% on Friday.
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.800]   Of course, then the entire world got focused on this.
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:23.280]   And then every venture capitalist started telling or I would say the overwhelming majority
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:27.440]   of venture capitalists told their founders to get their money out of SCB.
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.440]   Then you had a classic run on the bank, a small number of venture capitalists gave advice to say,
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.040]   hey, we should support Silicon Valley Bank.
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:36.080]   I understand that, but it turned out to be really bad advice.
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:40.960]   And then trading was halted on Friday morning pending news.
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:46.320]   And then finally, the FDIC shut down Silicon Valley Bank at noon on Friday.
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:49.120]   And there's a lot of speculation of what will happen on the way over the weekend.
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:54.800]   But maybe you could walk us through technically, what happened to Silicon Valley Bank and why
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.480]   they had this cash shortfall.
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:00.000]   And this, we spend the run on the bank, basically, but what led up to this?
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.560]   The irony is, it really was and is prior to the quote run a financially solvent business.
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:07.920]   So I have a few slides.
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:11.840]   If you're on YouTube, you can see it that we pulled one slide that was kind of made
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:15.920]   by us and the other set that come from Silicon Valley Bank's actual presentations.
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:19.440]   But if you look at their balance sheet, this is from the end of the year 2022.
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:25.040]   You can kind of look at the stuff that they owe their liabilities, which is what they
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.280]   owe their customers that sits in deposits.
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:31.280]   Because when customers give you cash in a deposit, you owe them that money back.
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.120]   So that sits as a liability.
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.480]   And then they had some other debt.
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:40.320]   So in total, Silicon Valley Bank at the end of the year had about $195 billion in liabilities,
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:46.400]   173 billion of customer deposits that they owe to customers and 22 billion of other debt.
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:50.880]   And then they take those customer deposits and they invest it in a number of securities.
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:54.880]   And the way that a balance sheet business like this bank would operate is, you know,
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:58.720]   the customers have access to their cash anytime they want.
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:02.720]   But in order for the bank to make money, they make longer duration investments.
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:06.640]   And those longer duration investments give them the ability to earn money on those longer
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:10.720]   duration investments, more than they're paying the customers for the deposit.
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:14.880]   So if you look at their longer duration investments, they had about $208 billion
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:18.880]   of total assets sitting on the balance sheet.
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:24.880]   So compare that to the 195 billion that they owe customers and other debt holders.
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:30.880]   So, you know, the difference here between 208 and 195 is about $13 billion.
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:36.160]   That's kind of the net what people would call book value of Silicon Valley Bank at the end
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:36.960]   of the year.
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:41.360]   And of the 208 billion of assets that they had, 74 billion were loans, and they've got
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:43.600]   a breakdown of the loan portfolio here in a minute.
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:48.480]   91 billion were these hold to maturity securities, where they don't actually adjust the value
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:49.840]   of these on a quarterly basis.
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:54.640]   And 26 billion is what triggered this panic, which is available for sale securities, mostly
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:55.200]   treasuries.
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:00.800]   And what happened is Silicon Valley Banks deposits came in so quickly over the last
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:04.160]   couple of years that they went out and they bought a bunch of treasuries, you know, with
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:05.040]   the cash that they got.
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.880]   And the problem is that very quickly,
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:10.480]   Friedberg, it's actually NBS, they bought a bunch of NBS, 10 year duration NBS.
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:15.040]   And important to note of the 208 billion that they have the book value Friedberg, there
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:18.480]   was a whatever 10% if it's in cash or something.
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.000]   So they do have some cash there.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.440]   That's right.
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.320]   Yeah, sorry, it's a good point.
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:26.960]   If you go back, so like, you know, let's say that of the hundred of the 173 billion of
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:30.240]   customer deposits, you know, they've got 14 billion of cash.
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:34.480]   And then they've got all these treasury securities, they can sell call it 40 billion.
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:38.640]   So if 25% of customers said tomorrow, hey, we want our cash back.
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:42.240]   Theoretically, they could just dump those treasury securities, distribute the cash and
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.760]   give it all back to customers.
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:48.320]   The problem is if suddenly more than 25% want to get their cash back, well, now they have
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:48.880]   a problem.
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:51.920]   And that is effectively what triggers the run on the bank.
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:56.240]   As soon as some folks think that others might be pulling money out, then everyone rushes
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:58.400]   to be the first money out the door.
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.800]   And that's what triggers a classic run on the bank.
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:06.640]   There's a statistic, I think, in the 1920s, there were several 100 banks that had runs
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.800]   every year for almost the entire decade.
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:13.120]   And these this was like a regular kind of occurrence that happened in the 1920s that
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:16.880]   ushered in a lot of our modern securities laws that are meant to kind of create the
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:21.520]   necessary liquidity provisions, and how these banks are able to operate to make cash available
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:22.560]   to customers.
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:26.800]   But what happened is so much so by the way, freeberg that they made a movie, it's a wonderful
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:28.320]   life about bank run.
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:33.040]   So basically, one of the bigger problems that Silicon Valley Bank, they ran into two big
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:33.520]   problems.
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:39.840]   Number one is deposit decline, where VCs were not investing new money.
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:43.760]   And when they were not investing new money, and startups were burning more money than
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:46.640]   Silicon Valley had modeled, they would be burning because they thought everyone's going
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.400]   to reduce spend and reduce burn and they didn't.
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:54.240]   So deposits were going down, all these startups were burning money, no VCs were investing.
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:56.480]   So total deposits were on the decline.
[00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:00.800]   Meanwhile, their bond portfolio, the assets that they hold on the balance sheet, also
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.080]   declined in value.
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:06.480]   And I and I kind of just put a really simple illustration here on why, if you have $100
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:11.840]   kind of face value bond that earns 2%, which is basically, you know, where these treasuries
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:16.640]   were a year ago, and you and you hold that for 10 years, that 10 year bond yields $122.
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:22.640]   If the interest rate goes up to 5%, then that that that bond should yield $163.
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:27.120]   So the value of the first bond actually goes down by 25%.
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:32.240]   Because of the market conditions, that's how significant the value changes with just a
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.320]   3% change in the interest rates.
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:38.400]   And that's effectively what happened with that available for security segment of the
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:41.280]   Silicon Valley Bank portfolio balance sheet.
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:46.720]   They had this bond portfolio that suddenly got devalued, and they had declining deposits.
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:50.560]   So when deposits start to decline, you got to make sure you have enough assets sitting
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:51.200]   on the balance sheet.
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:53.520]   So they sold a bunch of them said we're going to raise more money.
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:57.040]   And at that point, everyone kind of perked their head up and said, Oh my gosh, what's
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:02.000]   crazy is in q4, by the way, seeking alpha this website, you guys know, they had actually
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.480]   done an analysis and said, is SVB about to blow up and they put together a bunch of slides
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:10.240]   that highlighted why this might be the case because they saw that deposits were declining,
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:14.880]   that their, their assets that they hold were basically declining in value because of the
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:17.600]   massive and very quick rise in interest rates.
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:21.600]   And that SVB had bought a bunch of bonds that were long, long durated bonds.
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.560]   So it led to a, you know, obviously a real short term problem.
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:29.360]   If you look at the rest of SVB is loan portfolio, there's also a question of how distressed
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:30.320]   that all is.
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:35.600]   So 10% of their 70 billion plus dollars of loans is in venture debt.
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.240]   And venture debt is very questionable in this market, right?
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:42.720]   Because historically, the way venture debt makes money is that they assume that VCs are
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:45.600]   going to keep funding the companies that they're providing debt to.
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:49.280]   And if the VC stopped funding the companies in the venture debt defaults, and so if you
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:53.200]   go to the last slide in this deck, you'll kind of see SVB performance on their venture
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.160]   debt portfolio.
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:54.960]   Yeah, so look at this.
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:59.520]   This is the performance results on just the warrants that they get on their venture debt.
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:04.560]   So when you when you issue venture debt, you take a write down, or you get paid back.
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:08.720]   And then you also get some warrants, you get some right to buy shares in the in the winners
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:10.400]   in the startups that work.
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:15.280]   And so the way that SVB is made money on their venture debt portfolio historically, is hopefully
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:18.400]   they get paid back on all their loans, some of them they don't.
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:21.600]   But then they'll make a bunch of money on selling their warrants or the companies going
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.040]   public or getting bought.
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:26.400]   And in Q4 of 2022, just fell off a cliff.
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:28.880]   And their venture debt portfolio really started to show distress.
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:29.360]   And that's 10%.
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.200]   Are these realized gains?
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.040]   Or these are marked to market gains?
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:35.200]   This is the net gains on their warrants.
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.480]   So they don't mark to market warrants.
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:39.280]   I think this is what they actually exercised and got out.
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:42.240]   So there was, there was obviously a ton of exits in 2021.
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:46.720]   So they made $560 million in profit on their warrants that they had in their venture debt
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:48.160]   portfolio in 2021.
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.880]   That number collapsed to 148 in 2022.
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:54.080]   And you better believe most of that was in the early part of 2022.
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:57.520]   So you know, they didn't do a quarterly breakdown on this.
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:59.840]   This was like their full year numbers.
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:04.480]   But their venture debt portfolio, which is another $7 billion of capital, also distressed,
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:07.520]   certainly wasn't going to perform as everyone had modeled.
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:10.640]   So when you kind of start to add this all up, and remember, you go back to the beginning,
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:15.840]   they only had $15 billion of true net book value, which is the difference between their
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:17.440]   assets and their liabilities.
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:20.320]   And so if you really start to adjust, what are those assets really worth?
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.640]   Are they really worth what they're holding them at the book at?
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:26.240]   And if people start to pull money out, and you got to sell them at a distressed price
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:30.640]   in order to give people their cash that they're owed on deposits, that's when you have a classic
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:31.840]   run on the bank problem.
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:33.760]   And then everyone tries to be the first out the door.
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:36.560]   And that's basically like what triggered this this week.
[00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:39.840]   Can I give you guys my little version of all of this?
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:40.960]   I think there are three buckets.
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:46.480]   But before I go into the three buckets, I just want to say to all of the employees at
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:53.280]   these companies, I think we the four of us are so truly sorry for what's going on, and
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.880]   what you guys are going through.
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:59.120]   And then to founders that are trying to navigate this, it must be unbelievably tough.
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:01.440]   There are a few founders in our portfolio.
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:05.520]   So, you know, from all of us, just know that we're thinking of you guys.
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:11.840]   And hopefully, everybody ends up on the other side of this by Monday or Tuesday, with not
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:12.720]   a lot of damage.
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:18.400]   So let's just put that out there as sort of like, goodwill and kind of good juju in the
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:19.280]   world for the next couple of days.
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:22.320]   This is going to be a really difficult weekend for people who are trying to navigate this.
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:23.200]   I think it's well said.
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:23.520]   Yeah.
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:28.800]   I mean, I've got founders who are in really, really tough shape right now trying to figure
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:30.160]   out how do I make payroll?
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.040]   And it's a big question.
[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:35.520]   Okay, so just putting a pin in that because we'll come back to it.
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:41.040]   I think that this whole debacle, I guess, is the maybe the best word.
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:47.760]   There's a little bit of blame that you can put at the feet of three different groups
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:48.560]   of actors.
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:51.120]   And I just want to get your guys's reaction to this.
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:58.400]   So group number one, and free bird just mentioned this is we, the four of us have been talking
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:02.000]   for the last 18 months about the impact of rising rates.
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:06.800]   And, you know, we talked a lot about, for example, like in our portfolio, my partners
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:13.200]   and I walked into every company and made them have at least enough money to get through
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.640]   mid 2025.
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:15.360]   Right?
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:16.960]   I've said this a bunch of times.
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:23.120]   And so that was about having very difficult conversations about making sure that you were
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:29.200]   husbanding cash so that you had enough to weather any storm that came on the horizon.
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:36.160]   But it turns out that there was some group of VCs and companies that just didn't get
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:40.640]   that memo and just kept spending like nothing had changed.
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:48.000]   But when other VCs have stopped giving you money, and you're continuing to spend like
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.120]   it was 2020.
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:52.080]   That's what caused this mismatch.
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.640]   And it was really the spark that lit the fuse.
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:19:00.480]   So I think it's a really sad commentary at some level about the lack of governance that
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:05.440]   we have inside of some of these companies, where folks are just not doing the job that
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:07.360]   they're supposed to at these board levels.
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:11.840]   I think people and we've talked about this, have made venture too much of a popularity
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:19.200]   contest where they are, you know, glad handing and smiling, and not doing the hard work of
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:20.320]   holding folks accountable.
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:25.920]   And so some handful of VCs and some handful of founders just didn't get this memo.
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:31.280]   And it made what could have been a slower train wreck faster unnecessarily.
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.520]   So I think that that's worth talking about.
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:40.560]   Then, I think if you look at what actually practically happened over the last year and
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:48.000]   a half at SVB was that they were so desirous of profits, that they basically had a duration
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:48.480]   mismatch.
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.160]   So what is that?
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:51.280]   Imagine you get a job.
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:58.400]   And you know, somebody is like, hey, freeberg, I'll pay you $100,000 monthly over some number
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:03.120]   of months, right in normal pay every two weeks, or I'll pay you 200,000, but you only get
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:03.920]   paid once a year.
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:08.400]   Well, the problem with that second thing is you still have monthly bills that you have
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.920]   to make up for before you get paid.
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:15.280]   And so most people wouldn't take that job, even if they paid you a lot more, because
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:19.520]   you have this durational mismatch, you have to pay rent every month, you have to pay bills
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:22.480]   on a monthly basis, your credit card bills, all these things.
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:27.680]   And so you need to match the timing of your cash flows.
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:34.880]   And so I think somewhere along the way, the risk folks at SVB just made a really large
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:36.240]   miscalculation.
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:42.240]   They basically went and bought 10 year risk in order to pay back money that could be called
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:44.320]   on a daily or weekly basis.
[00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:47.040]   That, obviously, in hindsight was not a good idea.
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:50.800]   But more importantly, they didn't adjust fast enough.
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:54.240]   Well, they can't because they have these market assets that were just getting clobbered in
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:56.240]   the head as rates got raised.
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:21:00.640]   And then the third, the third thing is around regulators, you know, after the great financial
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:03.920]   crisis, we went through a period where there was hundreds of bank failures.
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:07.840]   And then for the last decade, they've been virtually none, right?
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:09.680]   They've been like a few here or there.
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:11.760]   And the last one was just during COVID.
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:16.640]   And so the regulators, I think, have done a really good job with Dodd-Frank and all of
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:23.440]   these other things to clean up the banking laws and the reporting requirements and the
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:28.000]   capital structures so that runs on banks are more and more infrequent.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:34.400]   But they kept this crazy loophole around the accounting treatment of assets.
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:40.880]   And they allow these durational mismatches to appear in a bank's balance sheet.
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:47.440]   And so I think there's a piece here for the regulators, which is here's an opportunity
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:53.280]   that's glaring and obvious now and screaming about how we need to tighten some more of
[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:54.720]   the transparency that's required.
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:22:01.120]   It shouldn't be a group of armchair sleuths on seeking alpha that sniffed this out three
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:02.240]   months before it happened.
[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:06.320]   It should have actually been a regulator that said, hey, hold on a second, something is
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:07.680]   happening here that we don't like.
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.920]   And so we, I think, need to figure it out.
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:12.560]   But I think those are the three actors that are in play.
[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:14.560]   And they each share a bit of the blame here.
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:17.120]   Greg Friberg, Saks, what do you think?
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:20.560]   Who, who, who is to blame here most for this blow up?
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:25.280]   Or is this just the extravagant event of the rate hikes happening in such a short,
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:26.320]   compressed period of time?
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:31.920]   No, I mean, look, I think that SVB's risk management was terrible.
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:38.880]   Obviously, they signed up for these long dated securities when the market they serve is
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:43.360]   incredibly volatile, like Jamal says, duration mismatch, really good point.
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:49.840]   I would also say that there's a weird regulatory treatment where apparently if you buy these
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:55.440]   10 year bonds, these 10 year mortgage backed securities or 10 year treasuries, you don't
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:23:00.320]   have to recognize the loss until you sell them, which is just bizarre.
[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:04.480]   So in other words, they should have been marking the positions to market.
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:09.600]   And instead, they just were allowing these losses to accrue.
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:12.560]   I don't understand how the regulators can allow that kind of system.
[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:19.920]   I also don't understand how the regulators can allow a bank to take customer deposits
[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:24.320]   and loan them out to startups with this venture debt that we've been talking about on the
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:29.760]   show, where 10% of their portfolio is basically being loaned out to startups who have no credit.
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:30.560]   That's crazy.
[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:32.240]   We talked on the show a few months ago.
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:35.200]   Actually, it's a good time to play the clip here because what we saw and
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:40.720]   Sachs and I, you know, seeing at the Series A level, you have a lot of times founders
[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:43.680]   would get this basically free money in their minds.
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:47.280]   I raised 10, I get five in venture debt, I can extend my runway.
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:52.720]   But that money comes due and here's the clip for when Sachs and I were talking about it
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:53.920]   just a couple episodes ago.
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:24:00.160]   What I don't trust is whether the return models on venture debt that were created
[00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:04.960]   over the last five to 10 years will be a good predictor of what the returns will be in the
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:10.560]   next five, 10 years, when a lot of the mortality that should have happened in the past now
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:11.520]   happens in the future.
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:16.880]   Yeah, I mean, this is just four or five episodes ago, we kind of nailed it.
[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:17.920]   Startups have no collateral.
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:19.760]   They have no, there's no security for that loan.
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:20.960]   How does that make sense?
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:21.440]   No, not true.
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:24.160]   To make a loan to a creditless startup.
[00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:24.800]   Not true.
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:27.120]   Guys, look, I disagree with you on this point.
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:31.360]   Look, if you pull up the slide that breaks down, so let's talk about venture debt for
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:34.320]   a second, because I've actually invested in a venture debt fund, and I've seen the
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:40.160]   economics on it, the way that the the venture debt model typically works is the lender loans
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:41.600]   money to the startup.
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:46.400]   And what they underwrite is what the current VCs in the startup say they're going to do
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.240]   to support the company in the future.
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:52.640]   So their ability to get paid back in the future is largely predicated not on underwriting
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:55.360]   the company and the performance of the business or the assets they have.
[00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:59.040]   But it's underwrited by the fact that the VCs are committed to continuing to put money
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:01.040]   in and hopefully see that this thing has a big outcome.
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:02.000]   There is no commitment.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.040]   There is no commitment.
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:04.240]   I've seen hundreds of...
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:07.600]   But, hold on, let me just finish.
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:08.560]   I get it.
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:13.440]   But the asset as an asset class, we can make fun of it all we want.
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:14.880]   It's actually performed pretty well.
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:18.160]   These guys have generated typically 18% as an industry kind of returns.
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:19.120]   In a bull market.
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:21.120]   And yeah, you're right.
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:22.080]   It's the same as venture.
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:23.200]   We're in sold boats.
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:27.200]   And the way that they generate those returns is that they're loaning money to the startups.
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:29.760]   A bunch of those startups fail, they don't get paid back.
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:33.280]   And then the ones that succeed, they actually take warrants in the startups.
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:35.200]   So they have some equity upside in the startup.
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.320]   And that's the way the model works.
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:37.680]   We can make fun of it all we want.
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:39.440]   It actually works as an industry.
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:44.240]   Okay, so let me tell you why that broke is it goes back to the point you made earlier
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:48.960]   in the show, which is the lender has this expectation that the VCs are going to keep
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:49.360]   investing.
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:50.560]   Well, what if they don't?
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:54.640]   Now, we've been in a generally up into the right bull market since the last.
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:55.120]   That's right.
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:57.120]   14.
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:03.360]   I believe that the data for all these models is is skewed because it assumes, again, an
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:06.320]   environment in which companies keep raising up rounds.
[00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:11.360]   And as soon as you get into a crisis, in which that breaks, then the whole asset class breaks.
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:13.200]   And I think this was completely predictable.
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:18.720]   But even if you think that this asset class is legitimate, I don't understand why banking
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:21.200]   deposits could ever be used to fund it.
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:25.600]   If you want to be a venture debt fund, go out and raise money from LPS.
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:29.920]   Because what happens is when you raise it with customer deposits, you're creating systemic
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:30.800]   risk for the banking system.
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:30.960]   100%
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:31.760]   You are so right.
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:33.760]   And the regulator should never have allowed that.
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:39.840]   Even worse, under two assets are correlated, because you're you're loaning it to people
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:41.120]   who are depositing it.
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:46.800]   And in every other part of the private credit market, that is exactly what you do.
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:55.280]   What SAC said, you can't use customer deposits to do some CLO deal or to do like, you know,
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:56.720]   to back a PE play.
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:57.280]   Right.
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:59.920]   These are all LP capital that goes towards that.
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:05.440]   This is the only sliver, as far as I know, where you take customer deposits to create
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:09.200]   very risky loans, wrapped with warrant coverage.
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:11.440]   And by the way, this stuff is never free, right?
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:13.920]   So they make you keep your money there.
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:17.360]   They make you have enough money to cover the size of the loan in the first place.
[00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:20.960]   So it's not even that valuable, because if they gave you $8 million loan, you have to
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:23.040]   have $8 million always on deposit.
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:27.120]   Otherwise, you violate the otherwise, you know, you breach the loan.
[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:29.520]   So there is no free lunch in venture debt.
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:30.880]   There has never been.
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:35.840]   And I still think venture debt is very much like venture capital, which is most of these
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:36.800]   gains are on paper.
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:40.640]   Most of these gains haven't really been realized.
[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:44.800]   And now we're going to go through this sorting process when all of this stuff gets whacked.
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:50.240]   I do want, Saxxy, your reaction to this, though, which is the thing that started this was the
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:56.320]   fact that VCs, seeing the markets imploding, stopped giving companies money, but they didn't
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:59.360]   do enough work to help founders cut burn.
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:03.760]   As we said it themselves, the burn stayed the same.
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:05.360]   What is going on inside of these boards?
[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:10.320]   Well, I think that's crazy, because, listen, I mean, we started doing portfolio updates
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:16.240]   with our entire portfolio of founders in February last year, saying this is a regime change,
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:17.360]   you got to cut costs.
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:18.560]   We did another one in May.
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:20.880]   You can watch them both on YouTube, okay?
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:24.240]   And we were telling founders, cut your burn, do it now, don't wait.
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:29.280]   We were beating the drum on this so hard and in every board meeting and privately.
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:33.120]   And I like, you know, and it takes multiple times, frankly, to get through.
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:38.880]   I think your point, Chamath, about not wanting to be unpopular with the founder crowd, led
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:43.760]   some young capital allocators to maybe say, okay, yeah, let's try this ditch effort before
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.840]   we do, you know, another riff.
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:47.280]   Let's try this new product.
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:49.280]   Let's change our sales strategy.
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:51.120]   I don't think it's young versus old.
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:53.200]   I think it's experienced versus unexperienced.
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:53.840]   No, I think it's experienced.
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:54.640]   Okay, that's better.
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:55.680]   I think that's more accurate.
[00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:56.880]   I do think it's experienced versus unexperienced.
[00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:58.080]   I think there is an experience.
[00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:01.440]   Listen, if you've never lived through a bear market, you don't know how bad it can get.
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:05.200]   And tech is a boom bust cycle and the busts are really hard.
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:06.000]   Really hard.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:06.560]   Really hard.
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:10.720]   And if you've never lived through a regime change before, like there was in 2008, 2009,
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:13.440]   or in 2000, 2001 was the worst.
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:14.400]   2001 to 3.
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:16.320]   Then you're totally unprepared and you have no idea.
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:18.800]   And, you know, and I think experience does matter.
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:22.800]   And there aren't that many VCs around who lived through the dot-com crash.
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:24.720]   No, probably 85% of not.
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:28.560]   By the way, if you guys pull up just that slide on the loan portfolio at SVB, I just
[00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:30.800]   want to make the case, Saks, I hear you.
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:33.760]   It's a risky, it seems like a risky investment to make.
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:40.320]   But don't you guys agree that a balance sheet business like SVB or an insurance company,
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:44.560]   or any business that has, you know, some amount of money coming in that sits on the balance
[00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:48.800]   sheet, and then they invested for a period of time, there's a laddering of risk.
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:51.520]   And there's a laddering of duration that you have.
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:55.200]   And so if you look at Silicon Valley Bank from their from the update they did last week,
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:30:00.000]   that triggered all of this, if you look at SVB's loan portfolio, 70% are really these
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:07.600]   asset backed loans, which are 56% of the portfolio is like, you know, pre payments on LP commitments,
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:12.720]   and then 14% is private banking loans, which is loans against, you know, public securities
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:18.240]   that people have only 10% of the portfolio is venture debt, which is 7 billion.
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:23.280]   And, you know, look, if the asset historically is performed at an 18% kind of rate of return,
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:26.880]   what is the your venture debt portfolio going to look like in a distressed environment?
[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:28.400]   Is it negative 100%?
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:29.440]   Is it negative 50%?
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:30.640]   I get a 40% I get a 30%.
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:32.960]   I mean, you guys can have a point of view on this.
[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:39.120]   But look, I mean, for any business that's managing a large balance sheet of assets against,
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:44.160]   you know, a short kind of liability tree, they're going to have some riskier assets.
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:47.920]   I think, you know, the question is, was 10% too much of the loan portfolio?
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:50.080]   1% too much.
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:50.320]   Yeah.
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:55.920]   And to that, you know, one of the issues here that we saw qualitatively, and sax and I both
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:31:01.760]   saw qualitatively, is the standard for giving these and the size of them got lower and lower.
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:03.280]   In fact, the covenants went away.
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:06.800]   And this is what we kept having hundreds say to us, it has no covenant, they offer me no
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:09.440]   covenants, I don't have to have a certain amount of cash, I don't have a half a certain
[00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:10.320]   amount of revenue.
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:14.800]   Those covenants were there for a reason to filter out the people who can't afford the
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:15.840]   house, right.
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:18.320]   And this is exactly what happened in 2008.
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:23.440]   When people started giving those no recourse or no background check mortgages, remember
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:26.400]   those were like, you didn't have to do a background check to get a mortgage.
[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:30.320]   That's what happened in venture, they just gave these, I saw it firsthand, willy nilly,
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:32.000]   I begged founders to not take them.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:38.160]   And I only won that discussion sacks one out of five times because founders are like money,
[00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:41.840]   we're having this debate, but there's no indication and there were no losses in this
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:45.120]   portfolio to date that show that venture debts underperforming we're saying
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:49.680]   what's the expression performance is no guarantee a future performance.
[00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:55.600]   Obvious to us on this podcast, you guys are arguing about venture debt, when the real
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:59.680]   loss that happened at SVB, no, we understand that they bought a bunch of treasuries and
[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:01.600]   no one has rates went from 2% to 5%.
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:04.960]   Let me there's two things going on here.
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:08.640]   Okay, free bird when I see your chart, you talk about laddering this and laddering that
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:13.040]   and x percent in all this kind of stuff, I think about the smartest guys in the room.
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:15.200]   Okay, this is long term capital management.
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:20.560]   This is Enron, this is the 2008 bank failure, they think they can basically do financial
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:21.840]   engineering to make this work.
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:25.600]   You know why it doesn't work is because number one, they're not in fully liquid assets.
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:27.440]   Number two, they're not marking to market every day.
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:34.160]   If you're a deposit bank, you should be required to keep all of your assets in fully liquid
[00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:36.480]   securities that you mark to market every day.
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:37.840]   It's that simple.
[00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:38.880]   And what do they do?
[00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:46.800]   They put it in 10 year duration mortgage bonds, where the value got devastated with the rise
[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:49.200]   in interest rates, they didn't have to mark that to market.
[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:55.280]   And second, they put 10% of the portfolio in basically loans to creditless startups.
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:33:03.680]   So when there is a run on the bank, you have a what like roughly 30% gap between deposits
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:06.560]   and their actual the value of their portfolio.
[00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:09.280]   Yeah, and listen, that shouldn't be allowed.
[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:12.560]   And the reason it's allowed is frankly, I think regulators are completely asleep at
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:13.200]   the wheel.
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:14.240]   Where's Powell?
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:15.360]   Where's Yellen?
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:19.840]   Two days ago, two days ago, Powell was testifying in front of the banking committee.
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:23.360]   And they asked him, do you see any systemic risk in the banking system?
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:25.040]   Because of the rapid rise in interest rates?
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:27.200]   He said, No, no systemic risk.
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:28.000]   Sachs is right.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.320]   I agree that the rise in interest rates is the key driver here.
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:35.680]   It drove down venture investing, it drove down valuations.
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:39.920]   And it's driving down the value of long durated bond portfolios, which by the way, is the
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:43.760]   mainstay and the standard of how a lot of these businesses invest and operate.
[00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:46.320]   And it's caused distress and stress on the system.
[00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:49.200]   My biggest concern is the contagion effect that arises next.
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:52.880]   If you go in, and you continue to assume interest rates climb, and everyone's holding onto these
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:54.240]   bonds, and they're getting written down.
[00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:56.160]   Meanwhile, you owe people all this money in cash.
[00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:59.280]   And the other thing that's happening, if you hold cash today, you're likely want to
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:03.280]   higher interest rate to compete with treasuries, because you can invest in treasuries today.
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:04.080]   And make sure 5%
[00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:05.040]   Pause for a second here.
[00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:06.640]   I just want to make sure that the audience understands.
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:10.640]   And Yellen put out a statement today, Jake, I'll just to finish the thought that they're
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:12.400]   monitoring the situation.
[00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:12.800]   Yes.
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:14.640]   She's sitting there like a bump on a log.
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:15.680]   I mean, it's ridiculous.
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:17.440]   They need to be out front.
[00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:21.360]   They don't understand that this is a cascading situation.
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:29.600]   Either this weekend, they place SVB in the hands of a JP Morgan, they do basically a
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:32.000]   bearish or a long move.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.160]   They either do that this weekend, or this thing keeps cascading next week.
[00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:37.760]   And look, I could be wrong.
[00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:39.840]   Maybe they're working on it right now behind the scenes.
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:41.200]   If they are, kudos to them.
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:43.440]   They'll have an announcement before the market opens on Monday.
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:47.600]   But if they're not, and Yellen's just like, we're monitoring the situation.
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:49.920]   While three days ago, she was in Ukraine.
[00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:51.760]   This is incompetence at work.
[00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:52.960]   All right, hold on.
[00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:56.240]   We'll figure out a way for you to dump this into January 6 next.
[00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:56.880]   Take a playa.
[00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:59.680]   He connected Silicon Valley Bank to Ukraine.
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:01.360]   It was beautiful.
[00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:02.160]   The piece here that's important to understand.
[00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:04.240]   What is our Secretary of the Treasury doing in Ukraine?
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:04.880]   I mean, seriously.
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:05.520]   Take it easy.
[00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:06.240]   Take it easy.
[00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:08.400]   Here's what happened.
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:12.560]   Just so people understand, US Treasuries were at 102.
[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:14.560]   You get like a 2% a year.
[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:16.080]   They bought a bunch of those.
[00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:20.400]   That was actually when you think about it, you would say that's a safe bet.
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:22.880]   The problem is those are locked up for 10 years.
[00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:28.000]   And nobody anticipated on the Silicon Valley Bank team that the rate hike would happen so
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.760]   quickly, so violently.
[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:34.320]   Remember, we saw the 25, 25, 50, 50, 75, 75, all those increases.
[00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:41.600]   Now what happens to a 2% US Treasury when the interest rate goes up is they get devalued.
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:42.480]   They're not worth as much.
[00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:45.680]   So if you did need to sell them, you would have to sell them at a discount.
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:48.640]   If you held them to maturity, you would get that complete return.
[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:52.720]   And what happened here is they needed to sell these early.
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:55.920]   And they sold them early and they took a massive loss, billions of dollars.
[00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:57.360]   And that's what lit the fuse.
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:58.880]   That's the slide I showed, like the price basically goes down.
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:00.800]   I just want to make sure the audience understands that.
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:03.680]   If they had sold these earlier, or if they hadn't bought these.
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:04.640]   But hold on, hold on.
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:05.600]   They would have not had this problem.
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:05.840]   Wait, wait, wait.
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:06.400]   Go ahead, Shama.
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:11.120]   Now, why, why in that meeting did they have to decide to emergency sell?
[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:16.080]   It's because VCs stopped giving startups money.
[00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:20.000]   So startups couldn't deposit more money into the bank,
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.800]   but they kept spending at the same rate that they were spending.
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:24.960]   In other words, the deposits went down.
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:25.440]   Yeah.
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:28.560]   In the last 18 months, not enough folks read the memo.
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:30.480]   Yes.
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:34.560]   And by the way, the tragedy of that is let's just say that you did get the memo
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:38.000]   and you did make the hard cuts right now.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.440]   And let's say you're working on something and you can fill in the blank on the thing
[00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:42.320]   that you care about.
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:42.480]   Okay.
[00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:44.160]   So for the listeners, let's say it's climate change.
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:45.920]   Let's say it's breast cancer research, whatever it is.
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:49.520]   This had nothing to do with you four days ago.
[00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:51.680]   You had your money in the bank.
[00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:55.680]   You did everything you needed to do to go and, you know, figure out product market fit,
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:58.080]   you know, try to get to market, try to sell your product.
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:04.800]   And all of a sudden, because of some other set of folks and actors who couldn't get their act
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:10.640]   together, now you're on the precipice of bankruptcy in 3648 hours.
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:11.600]   That's crazy to me.
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:12.880]   This is the challenge, sex.
[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:17.840]   I think you could speak to this as well is we did all this portfolio management over the last year.
[00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:19.360]   These were the troubled companies.
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:22.960]   And then you have the companies, a large portion who did the right thing.
[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:28.240]   They had a big war chest and they had set the burn at the right pace.
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:34.000]   And now they, the other portion of our portfolio that had big war chest, they're now at risk.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.520]   So if you're a capital allocator right now, you're looking at a group of companies that
[00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:41.600]   you tried your best to save and they're, and they're ankled and they're wounded.
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:43.920]   And now the strong ones are wounded too.
[00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:46.240]   This is cataclysmic for Silicon Valley.
[00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:51.600]   If this does not get stopped this weekend, not only, and I don't want to be hysterical.
[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:51.920]   You're right.
[00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:53.760]   This is a meteor hitting the dinosaur.
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:55.120]   It's extinction level event.
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:58.160]   You're right, Jay Cal, listen, we have portfolio companies.
[00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:04.320]   That had tens or millions or more in Silicon Valley bank.
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:09.840]   And their account showed that their money was in the safest money market funds, money
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:15.520]   market funds with a publicly traded ticker symbol that were managed by BlackRock or Morgan
[00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:16.160]   Stanley.
[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:16.960]   Okay.
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:18.800]   That's what their accounts showed them they had.
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:22.880]   And then they're told all of a sudden, no, you're only protected up to $250,000.
[00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:29.200]   Everything above that, that your, your money market fund is just an asset of SVB, which
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:30.160]   is in receivership.
[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:31.440]   You get a certificate.
[00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:31.600]   Yeah.
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:32.480]   And you get a certificate.
[00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:33.440]   Do you see this announcement?
[00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:36.480]   By the way, I mean, the California regulator made things worse.
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:39.680]   The California regulator stepped in and they froze everything.
[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:41.440]   So our companies were in the process.
[00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:46.080]   We have companies that submitted a wire yesterday, by the way, we spent all day yesterday on
[00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:48.640]   the phone with our portfolio companies, trying to get them out.
[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:51.120]   We had wire requests that went in before the deadline.
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:53.200]   And for some reason, we're in a queue.
[00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:54.720]   They didn't get through and they didn't get out.
[00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:55.840]   They didn't get through.
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:39:00.160]   And then the California regulator steps in this morning and freezes everything.
[00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:01.120]   And what did they announce?
[00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:02.400]   They said, Oh, you're good.
[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:04.000]   You're good for your insured amounts.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.720]   How much is that $250,000 for your uninsured amounts, which is everything above 250.
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:11.200]   You're going to get a certificate, a certificate.
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:11.840]   What does that mean?
[00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:14.480]   That means you're a creditor in bankruptcy.
[00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:20.400]   So the mutual fund that you thought you owned was actually not hypothecated in your name.
[00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:22.800]   It was in SVB's name at BlackRock.
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:26.800]   And so our companies have been calling BlackRock and calling Morgan Stanley saying, Hey, do you
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:28.080]   have my money market fund?
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:30.320]   And they're like, No, sorry, that's SVB.
[00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:34.800]   So now they're sitting in a in a creditor line in bankruptcy.
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:35.840]   We got to explain this.
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:37.520]   These were called sweep accounts.
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:42.480]   So what Silicon Valley Bank did with some of these large portfolio holders, let's say
[00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:45.280]   Saks and a bunch of other VCs gave you 30 million bucks.
[00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:46.560]   Yes.
[00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:50.720]   And they would, they took your money and they said, you know what, just to be safe,
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:54.480]   we're going to take your money will automatically sweep it and distribute it across two other
[00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:55.200]   accounts.
[00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:56.880]   So we got this BlackRock over here for you.
[00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:57.200]   Great.
[00:39:57.200 --> 00:39:58.640]   We got this Morgan Stanley over here.
[00:39:58.640 --> 00:39:59.280]   Great.
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:05.040]   Whatever it is, you could only get to those through the Silicon Valley Bank interface.
[00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:07.520]   And so it was supposed to protect you.
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:08.640]   But there is no recourse.
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:10.720]   It seems those are frozen too.
[00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:12.960]   So the only thing you can do that's logical.
[00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:16.400]   And I had a mentor 30 years ago when I had the magazine and we started hitting millions
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:17.600]   of dollars in revenue.
[00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:19.360]   And he said, I said, How much money we have in the bank?
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:20.560]   He's like, which bank account?
[00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:23.440]   And he had four bank accounts, and he would load balance them.
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:25.120]   And he did it every Friday.
[00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:26.400]   God bless Elliot Cook.
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:28.000]   He did it every Friday for me.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:28.880]   And I've always done that.
[00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:31.120]   I've always had multiple bank accounts and load balance them.
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:34.720]   But in this case, Silicon Valley Bank did it through one interface.
[00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:37.920]   I have multiple startups today who did this exact thing, Saks.
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:43.040]   And they couldn't even log into Silicon Valley Bank today to even see where they're at.
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:44.400]   I mean, I think you can log in now.
[00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:48.400]   Everything got frozen and the California regulator froze them and they brought in the FDIC.
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:50.560]   So there's a couple of problems now with the working out of this.
[00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:53.520]   This is basically a bankruptcy process, a receivership process.
[00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:57.200]   It's that we've got all these companies that need to make payroll in the next few weeks,
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:57.520]   right?
[00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:00.800]   And so these processes don't work at startup time.
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:06.560]   If you could just figure out like over the weekend, okay, SVB lost 30 cents on the dollar,
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:09.520]   and everyone's just going to be prorated, and you're going to get 70 cents on the dollar,
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:13.840]   and you get your money on Monday, it would be a hit to the startup ecosystem,
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:15.600]   but people would recover and move on.
[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:18.160]   But the fact of the matter is, it's not going to be on Monday.
[00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:21.600]   It could take weeks or months to figure out how many cents on the dollar you have.
[00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:23.680]   Are they liquidating Silicon Valley Bank?
[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:24.880]   Are they selling the desk?
[00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:26.640]   Is everybody getting laid off?
[00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:28.400]   FDIC is going to liquidate everything.
[00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:29.840]   Well, you have two paths here.
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:33.040]   Path number one is if you actually try to sell these assets.
[00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:35.680]   But the problem is, who do you think the buyer is?
[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:43.120]   The buyer are the sharpest sharps on Wall Street, who will purposefully underbid these assets.
[00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:49.680]   And so that then takes you to path two, which is then the only other real solution is for the Fed
[00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:51.280]   to warehouse them and guarantee them.
[00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:56.640]   And that's an equivalent version of what they had to do during the great financial crisis,
[00:41:56.640 --> 00:42:00.080]   which was this thing called TARP, which is the Troubled Asset Relief Plan.
[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:05.760]   It was just a backstop and a mechanism so that these, at the time, those toxic assets,
[00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:10.480]   which were a bunch of mortgage-backed loans, could be cleared through the system over time,
[00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:13.440]   which effectively meant that the Fed basically warehoused that risk.
[00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:19.520]   So I think what we need to see now is, Saks, it could be 50 cents on the dollar.
[00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:23.120]   It could be 60 cents if you want immediate liquidity.
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:26.480]   You know, a friend in our group chat was mentioning that there was one claim,
[00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:34.640]   a company that had $100 million inside of SVB, was offered 60 cents on the dollar today for that
[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:38.080]   claim. Now, that's a really… From a third party.
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:43.440]   From a third party who said, "I will take you, I will give you 60 million today in return for
[00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:49.600]   that certificate, plus the 250,000 that says you're owed 100 million," because they're willing
[00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:54.320]   to take the risk that they'll get, you know, 80 million, right? And then they take the difference.
[00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:59.200]   Now, the point is that if you're seeing today that kind of a discount, that's not a good sign,
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:02.480]   I think. And it does speak to the fact that regulators have to step in.
[00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:04.640]   Now, here's the other reason why I think it's important.
[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:09.600]   I think what regulators, and I think the people, and there's a lot of them in Washington that
[00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:17.600]   listen to this, what this does is it torches years of US innovation. And you should not let that
[00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:24.800]   happen. There are companies working on really important things for the United States and for
[00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:31.920]   the rest of the world. And if the company fails because they can't make the product work, so be
[00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:36.240]   it. We take that risk every day. If the company fails because customers don't want to buy it,
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:42.560]   so be it. If the product fails because a better product comes out, so be it. But it shouldn't
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:50.480]   fail because we can't get money that is in a deposit. That should not be why we torch
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:54.080]   hundreds of startups and what they're working on, maybe thousands.
[00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:57.680]   >> Yeah, this would be a lost decade, a lost decade for Silicon Valley.
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:01.440]   >> J. Cal, first of all, do you guys want to talk about second and third order effects,
[00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:05.280]   just so folks really understand those? Because I think it's important to highlight
[00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:10.320]   why it's not just about a couple hundred tech bros in Silicon Valley not being able to make
[00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:15.040]   payroll, but there's important downstream consequences. For example, there are payment
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:21.280]   processing companies in Silicon Valley that use Silicon Valley Bank to store their capital and to
[00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:26.640]   move money around. There are payroll companies that do payroll for many businesses, not just tech
[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:31.440]   businesses, but many businesses in different parts of the economy that store their cash at Silicon
[00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:35.840]   Valley Bank and process money through Silicon Valley Bank. Today, it was announced that Rippling,
[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:40.000]   one of those companies, could not hit their payroll cycle today because they had money
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.360]   tied up at Silicon Valley Bank. Fortunately, they announced that they also have money at
[00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:48.480]   J.P. Morgan and other places, so they will be able to kind of get the payroll processed early
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:53.760]   next week and get everyone back on track. But this is hundreds and potentially thousands of companies
[00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:59.760]   that use their payroll software to process and pay their employees. And then there's all the
[00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:03.840]   payment processors. We don't know how many of them have what level of exposure and a lot of
[00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:09.040]   infrastructure companies that move money in and through Silicon Valley Bank. And so if they start
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:14.720]   to go down, and then payroll doesn't hit the air conditioning company that's using the tool in some,
[00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:19.840]   you know, in Arizona, and then, you know, the stripe service isn't able to process e commerce
[00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:23.760]   payments for a small business owner that runs a website, you can start to see how there can be
[00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:28.160]   very significant trickling effects. And more importantly, like we saw in a weight, perhaps to
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:34.240]   a different degree, but still a significant concern is the contagion of panic, where people
[00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:39.600]   say if there isn't reliability in the things that I thought were reliable before, I start to have
[00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:43.840]   real questions in the soundness of the system overall. And that's why it's so important to
[00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:48.480]   sack said to step in shore up the problem this weekend, I don't think it's about bidding 50
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:53.680]   cents or 60 cents on the dollar, every depositor needs to get paid 100% of their money. And that
[00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:58.080]   cash needs to be made available to them by early next week. And if that money is not available to
[00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:03.680]   them, within the first 48 or 72 hours of the end of this weekend, then we're gonna have a real
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:08.000]   crisis on our hands, because then you will see a lot of people trying to move money away from
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.960]   any institution that stores their money in some sort of security that's not 100% liquid like cash.
[00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:18.640]   And that's gonna, that's not that's gonna cause a massive run. And so some what has to happen,
[00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:24.400]   the only way this can happen is if someone takes over Silicon Valley Bank this weekend,
[00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:29.120]   and that the federal government, unfortunately, as much as I hate to say it, because I absolutely
[00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:33.360]   hate the federal government having a role in this stuff has to say, we will guarantee 100%
[00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:37.840]   of those deposits to the company that takes over the bank that takes over this portfolio,
[00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:42.400]   and says, let the portfolio of assets run its lifetime, see what you get paid, whatever the
[00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:46.960]   delta is, we'll make it up to you. But we need to make sure that there's cash here today for all of
[00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:50.400]   these depositors to get to my head something you want to say, if not, I have something I want to
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:59.760]   say. Yeah. The other big thing that SVB was, was an on ramp for a lot of investors, including many
[00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:04.880]   US investors to get money into China. And without commenting on whether that's right, wrong or
[00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:09.280]   indifferent. The point is that China has a very complicated capital market structure, which
[00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:16.400]   requires you to basically use an offshore bank, ie non domesticated Chinese bank, and to be able to
[00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:20.400]   get those dollars. And so what would happen is Chinese startups that raise money would raise
[00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:26.240]   money from US investors and abroad using these bank accounts. And so this issue now doesn't just
[00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:30.720]   touch the United States innovation economy, it also touches China's innovation economy, which,
[00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:36.160]   you know, creates actually a complicated set of trade offs for the US government and Treasury as
[00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:40.080]   they think about what they want to do in this heightening great power conflict that Saks talked
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:44.320]   about last week. And I want to just make a very important nuance point here. I know there is no
[00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:50.640]   bank that the public, specifically, you know, people who don't want to support, you know, rich
[00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:57.440]   people already like big tech or billionaires. The reason to backstop this with public money is
[00:47:57.440 --> 00:48:03.360]   because we have a roadmap for this. People don't know this widely, but tarp was just over $400
[00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:11.600]   billion. It actually returned a $15 billion profit to the American people. This would require maybe
[00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:20.160]   25 or $50 billion 10%, maybe 5-10% of the totality of tarp would be enough to cover what's happening
[00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:24.320]   here with Silicon Valley Bank and work this out. That's $50 billion for the people listening in
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:29.360]   Washington or for the people who will say, Hey, why are we, you know, bailing out big tech,
[00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:35.360]   you're bailing out small tech, as Chamath said, you're bailing out innovation on breast cancer on,
[00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:40.800]   you know, renewable energy. But most importantly, this can easily be structured
[00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:47.600]   so that the American people return 20%, 30%, maybe even double their money, you could structure this
[00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:52.640]   so it is senior to everything else. And is exactly what the government is supposed to do when there
[00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:58.000]   is a crisis. That doesn't mean the people who run Silicon Valley Bank should have their equity worth
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:03.280]   a lot, they should get wiped out. They didn't do their job properly. The equity, the people who
[00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:07.840]   ran the management team there, if they don't get anything, that's okay. They understand that. But
[00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:13.040]   the people who had their money at deposit to pay the salaries and to pay for this innovation,
[00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:18.880]   it is unconscionable that we wouldn't backstop it. And the guarantee you, the US government
[00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:24.400]   could get some warrants on those companies or warrants and ownership and Silicon Valley Bank
[00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:30.000]   and make at least 50 cents on the dollar, maybe even double. And that's the way this bailout
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:34.560]   should be structured. And it has to be done this weekend. You bring up a great idea. I think,
[00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:41.520]   I think if the US balance sheet does step in over the weekend, I'm going to say on behalf
[00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:49.680]   of the US taxpayer, you must get a piece of these companies. And the reason why is that that's the
[00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:56.400]   way to make it fair for everybody that's not in tech who's on the outside looking in. And if you
[00:49:56.400 --> 00:50:02.560]   look inside of Twitter, as an example, there's a lot of negative sentiment around even the idea of
[00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:08.480]   a bailout happening. And it's for this exact reason, because I think people believe that it
[00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:13.840]   will benefit just a small sliver of people, right? So to step in and to save these companies, Jason
[00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:19.360]   would still be, you know, really only helping, say, several hundred thousand or several, you know,
[00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:25.280]   and and the thing that that gets wrong, in my opinion, is that these companies, if they're,
[00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:30.160]   if they're allowed to germinate, should be building things that actually help everybody.
[00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:36.640]   And so including taxes, including and so if you can view it that way, and if you can view a share
[00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:43.120]   of it, now, obviously, look, we're very, we have a very deep incentive for that to happen. But I
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:47.600]   think it's important to present the other side of it. And the other side would say, this industry
[00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:55.680]   has a little bit run amok. It's not well regulated. You know, you guys push the
[00:50:55.680 --> 00:51:01.120]   boundaries and get away with a lot. And there haven't been a lot of consequences. You're saying
[00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:05.200]   the banking, the tech industry, no, no, I'm saying that the average person that's on the outside,
[00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:10.640]   looking into the tech industry can make that claim. And now they would be pointing at big tech.
[00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:14.720]   But the problem is, we all get swept in together under the same thing. And then what they would
[00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:20.480]   say is, I don't think it's right to step in. And I think that you have to give the US taxpayer an
[00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:24.880]   incentive if they are going to do it. And I think the the incentive should be that they should just
[00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:29.680]   get a share in all this innovation. If they take over the venture debt portfolio, then they would
[00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:33.600]   have that right, the venture debt portfolio comes with warrants, so they would have that I think
[00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:39.680]   there's a big risk here that precisely because tech is unpopular. And people I think are confusing
[00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:45.760]   big tech with small tech, that the government doesn't step in here and the the dominoes start
[00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:50.880]   falling and we start getting all the systemic risk playing out. Remember, the beneficiaries
[00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:56.000]   here aren't just these, the sort of current generation of tech companies, and everyone they
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:02.800]   do business with. It's also wherever the contagion goes next. And we're already seeing, I think
[00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:08.480]   multiple regional banks under pressure, their stock down people asking questions. We know people
[00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:14.480]   in our chat groups who are wiring money out as fast as they can. Just because why take a chance?
[00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:20.080]   You know, by the way, you have to understand that the game theory around these bank runs,
[00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:25.360]   people describe them as a panic, but that implies that it's irrational. It's not irrational. It's
[00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:30.560]   actually rational. And what this what this is really highlighted is that what you said earlier
[00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:36.720]   at the beginning, Saks, which is that the regulatory oversight is actually extremely pristine
[00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:43.840]   at the biggest banks. But the smaller and smaller you get, there's a level of opacity. And
[00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:48.880]   lack of regulatory follow through that allows us to build to the Wall Street Journal right now is
[00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:54.000]   reporting that US banks have 620 billion of unrealized losses just on treasuries.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:58.560]   I don't know what the unrealized losses are on these long dated mortgage backed securities.
[00:52:58.560 --> 00:53:05.920]   Like I said, I have no idea why regulators allow banks to hold these bonds at their book value
[00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:08.480]   instead of marking them to market every day. That's crazy.
[00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:13.280]   And on the equity side, you have to do it. Buffett talks about this all the time. The equity side,
[00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:17.360]   you have to mark to market the equity portfolio at the end of every quarter.
[00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:21.920]   And he sees these wild swings and he complains about it. But it's the right thing to do for
[00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:26.080]   exactly this reason, right? So think about the game theory here. Okay, the banking system,
[00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:32.080]   the bank regulators have created this opacity in the system. You've got all these assets are being
[00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:36.640]   held by these banks that are not marked to market. So nobody really knows what the true
[00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:40.800]   level of exposure is. So what's the response? Why take a chance? Let's move your money to JP
[00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:45.200]   Morgan. So I think there's a chance that if the federal government doesn't step in here,
[00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:49.440]   the whole regional banking system could be decimated and just be left with four too big
[00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:53.680]   to fail banks. How's that benefit? Anybody that doesn't benefit the little guy,
[00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:58.080]   this guy's there's a there's a pretty good set of regulatory disclosures that happen. But I do
[00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:02.640]   think that the real question is, you know, are the ratios right? Do they should they really be
[00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:08.560]   allowed to invest in these types of assets with depositor capital? And if so, with what percent
[00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:12.480]   of the depositor capital should they be allowed to do it? And maybe, you know, that seems to be
[00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:17.600]   where the biggest, you know, issue is we've come a long way. I mean, I just pulled up the statistic.
[00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:25.600]   It's insane. There were 505 banks that failed. In 1921, failures continue to rise in the early 20s,
[00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:33.360]   and averaged 680 banks per year failed between 1923 and 1929. So obviously, you're coming out
[00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:37.520]   of a wait, there was a lot of controversy around, hey, banks can't make money anymore. It's too
[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:41.440]   restrictive, the disclosures and so on. The disclosures are actually quite good. You know,
[00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:45.920]   you guys can go to these these sites that regulate the banks, you can go to the SEC site,
[00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:50.400]   you can get a very detailed schedule of every asset held by every one of these banks. It's good
[00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:55.600]   transparency, I would argue, but should they be allowed to invest in securities that are effectively
[00:54:55.600 --> 00:55:01.440]   not fully liquid, that are risky that are long dated with short dated deposits, right? It seems
[00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:05.280]   it's a fundamental question about what banks are supposed to be doing in a world of computers that
[00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:10.800]   can calculate everything. The idea that you can't solve duration matching doesn't seem like one of
[00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:16.000]   those problems that's intractable in 2023. I mean, if people can make an AI version of the podcast,
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:21.840]   they could do that. Yeah. I mean, freeburger also like take this, I think venture debt's
[00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:26.960]   the most extreme example. How do you mark to market a loan to a series a startup? I mean,
[00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:29.360]   that just 100% depends on whether you're gonna raise the street.
[00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:33.600]   I actually I'm a believer, you can underwrite anything I think you can under for the right
[00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:36.800]   interest rate for the right premium, you can underwrite insurance, you can underwrite loans.
[00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:40.480]   I mean, there's a lot of ways that you could kind of do you mark that to market on a daily basis.
[00:55:41.120 --> 00:55:45.360]   You're right. No, you cannot. You're right. Absolutely. Yeah. And so from a reporting
[00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:49.520]   perspective, it how does that solve the problem? No, that's why they've got different. They've
[00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:53.360]   got different tiers of regulatory capital guys. And so you know, there are rules around what the
[00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:58.160]   ratios need to be and where you need to fall. And so they bucket this stuff up differently, right?
[00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:03.760]   If you're a bank, and you want to buy securities, you want to invest in something that's not
[00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:08.800]   liquid and mark to market every day, you should have to package it up in some period of time and
[00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:14.640]   sell it. If you're going to make a loan to a, you know, to a venture backed startup, package those
[00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:18.720]   up and syndicate that and sell it as a security. And if you can't do that, you probably shouldn't
[00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:23.040]   be investing in the asset class anyway. Same thing with like, you know, mortgage, these mortgages
[00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:27.680]   already get packaged up and sold, right? So I just doesn't make sense to me that like customer
[00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:33.760]   deposits, that's what we're talking about, which you assume should always be 100% safe, right?
[00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:38.080]   This is not a source of capital where anyone's ever expecting to lose money. If you want to
[00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:44.640]   use risk capital to get some sort of outsized return, go raise that from LPS. But to like take
[00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:50.720]   customer deposits and use it on on risky non liquid investments. Yeah, it makes sense.
[00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:57.680]   There's one thing I could I could just help people frame this. The aggregate amount of dollars in
[00:56:57.680 --> 00:57:03.280]   these bank accounts, I would estimate equals 10% of the value of the startups they represent.
[00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:08.400]   Would we all agree on that? It's about 10% of the value of those startups, maybe 20.
[00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:11.360]   If you were what, how do you how do you calculate?
[00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:16.000]   About the startups who recently did a round of funding, they diluted 10%.
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:22.400]   That represents all of their treasury or half of their treasury. So if that cash for the startup
[00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:26.640]   portion of this equals 10% of the value of startups, I can guarantee you those startups
[00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:32.240]   with access to that capital again, Monday, will be able to outperform the backstop that the
[00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:38.000]   government would provide. This sounds like Enron math to me. No. Okay, if you want to start up to
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:42.240]   take any of your startups, they have 30 million. We don't have time. Listen, we don't have time
[00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:47.760]   here for the government to figure out how to be a partner in or an investor in all these startups.
[00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:53.760]   I'm sorry, we don't step in or they don't. If they don't step in, you'll have systemic failure.
[00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:58.160]   No, no, but do the math with me here. Of one of the companies pick one of the companies that has
[00:57:58.160 --> 00:58:01.920]   20 you have a company that has 20 million there are 30 million there. What does that represent?
[00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:04.400]   If you were to take their valuation from last year, when they raised that money,
[00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:08.800]   I didn't have it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter who's the depositor. It does not matter.
[00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:16.720]   It matters for people to understand how much value is going to be lost. And how easily recoverable it
[00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:21.280]   is if these companies are allowed in aggregate to deploy that capital. That's the point you're not
[00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:27.840]   getting or I'm not explaining to properly. If allowed to deploy that it's going to return a
[00:58:27.840 --> 00:58:34.880]   multiple and a venture multiple 2345 x but if we destroy that money, these companies are going out
[00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:39.920]   of business next month. That money is their money. That's their deposit. I agree with you. I'm trying
[00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:44.400]   to create a framing here for people to understand exactly how much value is going to be better
[00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:50.160]   framing is that when you put your money in a FDIC insured bank and you put it in a customer deposit
[00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:54.080]   that's supposed to be completely safe, that's paying you a couple of percent interest. And
[00:58:54.080 --> 00:58:59.040]   that is reflected even as a money market fund on your account. You do not expect that money to be
[00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:06.800]   turned around by the bank and put in risk. No sense. Raise the FDIC. Banks should not work that way.
[00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:11.280]   Okay. Look, I think it's crazy that you could set up a bank account, okay, because you just want to
[00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:16.400]   write checks. And you could lose that money because the bankers decided to loan it to some startup.
[00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:21.280]   That's insane. Or the bankers decided to buy a 10 year mortgage backed security who doesn't
[00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:24.560]   understand interest rate risk. That's not the way the system is supposed to work. And you've
[00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:28.960]   got all these people on Twitter pushing back no bailouts or whatever. That's the depositor's money.
[00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:32.720]   I agree. No bailout for SVB. They should lose everything. All those executives,
[00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:36.800]   their stock options are worthless. All the stockholders of that company, their shares
[00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:41.120]   are worthless. But the question is, should depositors lose money in these banks? They
[00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:44.880]   just thought they were signing for a checking account. I mean, are you kidding me? And if you
[00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:51.600]   let that happen, there will be a cascade here because the logical consequence will be everybody's
[00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:56.000]   going to say, put my money in JP Morgan or Wells Fargo or Bank of America, there'll be four banks,
[00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:58.320]   that's it. And all the regional banks are going to shut down.
[00:59:58.320 --> 01:00:04.560]   10s of 1000s of highly paid workers, and not just tech workers are going to be out of
[01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:10.000]   jobs, and they don't have jobs waiting for them at Amazon, or Google to bail them out. And this is
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:17.040]   the start of a contagion if it doesn't get stopped. What do they do wrong? Nothing. They used what is
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:21.440]   considered one of the most reputable banks in the world. They used a top 20 bank that the regulators
[01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:27.040]   said was in compliance. So did they do something wrong? Or were the regulators asleep at the wheel?
[01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:32.080]   I don't know. Some way I think it's this is Biden's fault or Zelensky's.
[01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:37.520]   It's Biden or Zelensky's fault. What do you guys think this means for VC?
[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:44.240]   It is a chilling effect. I talked with some LPs in the last two days in the VC world. I'll give
[01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:51.760]   you a couple anecdotes. I have a friend runs a fund. He looked at his portfolio, they have $270
[01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:59.440]   million or sorry, $350 million tied up at Silicon Valley Bank. They need $27 million for cash for
[01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:06.720]   the next 30 days. So he's called his LPs and he's trying to get his LPs to front him money to wire
[01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:12.240]   money so that he can front his company's money so they can actually pay their operating expenses and
[01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:17.200]   cover their payroll. And then I spoke with a couple of LPs in the last 48 hours. They have
[01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:23.120]   gotten dozens of calls from various venture funds. Everyone is asking the same question, can we do a
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:27.600]   capital call? Can we get money delivered early? Can we use that money to support our companies?
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:34.160]   Because their cash is stuck. Coming out of this, the uncertainty that this creates in the investment
[01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:39.680]   environment, I think it's going to have a real chilling effect, not just with the GPS and their,
[01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:45.200]   you know, proclivity to sign term sheets right now and wire new money over, but also with the LPs,
[01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:49.600]   as they're making capital commitments and actually following through with with capital commitments
[01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:54.080]   that have already been made. Given, you know, where's the capital actually going to land up?
[01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:58.080]   That was never a question mark before. It was never anything that anyone even considered
[01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:03.360]   that capital could be disappeared or locked up or tied up. And the fact that this is adding this
[01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:08.720]   unique friction in the market is a layer on top of an already distressed and challenged
[01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:16.640]   environment for fundraising for GPS for LPS. And it seems to be exactly the icing on the cake we
[01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:22.160]   did not need right now. No matter how this gets resolved. I think private markets and VC could
[01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:27.040]   seize I think you're going to see people pull term sheets, maybe half as many fundings are
[01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:31.440]   going to occur as people try to do triage. Another VC friend of mine just sent me a text,
[01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:36.800]   he can't make payroll next week. He has a fun small VC fund, his VC fund, their employees
[01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:43.520]   cannot he cannot pay his employees on Monday, Lord. And so, yes, I do think funds could shut down.
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:50.320]   Coming out of this it I think that companies that were call it, you know, 75% distressed
[01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:54.480]   are done for now, no one's going to step in and bridge them and fund them. It's going to
[01:02:54.480 --> 01:03:00.000]   accelerate a lot of shutdowns, because people are now cash is king now cash is Kinger, right? It's
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:04.480]   like a big shift. I think that was really well said. I think you're right about all that. Jay,
[01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:09.280]   how you tweeted that you think this is a cause of 68 freeze and dealmaking activity. I think
[01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:13.680]   that's more or less right. You're right. Because you know, all the VCs out there have to think
[01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:17.360]   about shoring up their existing portfolios. Exactly. What if you got companies that are
[01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:21.200]   now in distress, they're perfectly good companies. You got to focus on maybe you're going to make
[01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:25.200]   winners, you're picking one or two winners, you know, you're and you're going to focus on that,
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:28.000]   you're going to say, you know what, the rest of them could be good, but I can't,
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:34.400]   it's going to be a tough decision. I have three open deals right now. That we're doing, I now have
[01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:39.280]   to figure out how to get those deals done. And I have four companies that are in this payroll
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:46.240]   situation in a major way. So now I've got capital. And I've got to, and we're not personally affected
[01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:52.480]   by the Silicon Valley Bank thing, thank God. But now we have to do triage the known winners in your
[01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:58.000]   portfolio that did nothing wrong. Or do you make the next three investments or four investments,
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:03.360]   and I'm going to make good on those three investments. But next month, maybe not. Maybe
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:07.200]   next month, I'm taking off and I'm focusing on the portfolio. And I think that's what's
[01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:14.480]   going to happen writ large. We're in triage mode now, full on triage mode. If this doesn't get
[01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:20.480]   resolved, if they can't get those, Jim, what do you think? This dark, I had a meeting three weeks
[01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:28.800]   ago with a US LP. And you know, you guys know how I run this business here. But it's there's,
[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:33.680]   there's like a lot of risk management, you know, we think about this stuff a lot. And
[01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:39.600]   the message that came back to me was, I don't think risk management is worthwhile in venture,
[01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:45.840]   I didn't understand where that was coming from. Because if you're investing your money across
[01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:51.280]   a very risky asset class, you have to be always thinking about how you could lose money.
[01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:56.480]   And I think that venture has always romantically been described as like buying lottery tickets.
[01:04:56.480 --> 01:05:02.960]   And so it doesn't matter if you lose. But when you have that kind of attitude, you just become
[01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:07.600]   super complacent. And you don't think about left tail risk, you only think about right tail
[01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:13.120]   outcomes. And this is an example of like left tail risk that came out of nowhere that could
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:21.360]   wipe out entire portfolios. So you had, you know, folks invest into funds that spent a few years,
[01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:29.920]   probably 2019 2020 2021, really misallocating money, right, writing ginormous checks into
[01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:35.920]   companies that valuations that didn't make sense, who then went and burned it. And now what little
[01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:40.800]   cash they had left may also be gone, which means those valuations are even more impaired, which
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:45.520]   means that the LPs that gave them the money are even more underwater. And that cycle, I think,
[01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:52.000]   is really terrible. That'll take a so maybe this is the wake up call, where now risk management is
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:56.160]   actually in vogue and cool. And it's important to know this stuff. I don't know, we have breaking
[01:05:56.160 --> 01:06:00.160]   news. While we're taping this, the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation of the
[01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:05.280]   state of California has published findings on SVB, we'll pull it up on the screen for the besties to
[01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:11.360]   respond to on March 8 2023. The bank announced a loss of approximately 1.8 billion from the sale of
[01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:17.680]   investments. We've talked about that already. On March 8 2023, the banks holding company announced
[01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:22.320]   it was conducting a capital raise despite the bank being in sound financial condition prior to March
[01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:30.240]   9 2023. Investors and deposits reacted by initiating withdrawals of $42 billion in deposits.
[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:35.600]   So that would be over 20% I think of the of the total deposits from the bank on March 9,
[01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:42.080]   or even more 2023 causing a run on the bank. As of the close of business on March 9, the bank had a
[01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:47.680]   negative cash balance of approximately 958 million. Despite attempts from the bank, with the
[01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:52.000]   assistance of regulators to transfer collateral from various sources, the bank did not meet
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:57.280]   its cash letter with the Federal Reserve. The precipitous deposit withdrawal has caused the
[01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:00.880]   bank to be incapable of paying its obligations as they come due. Right. And the bank is now
[01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:10.080]   in some beginning $42 billion withdrawals is 25% of total deposits. But 42 billion is greater than
[01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:16.000]   the 14 billion of cash they had on hand, and the 26 billion of liquid securities that they had.
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:20.240]   So you add those two up together, you're at 40 billion. And then to get more cash,
[01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:24.160]   they're gonna have to sell a bunch of loan portfolios. And selling loan portfolios,
[01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:27.040]   you got to package them up, it takes weeks or months to do that, and they're going to be sold
[01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:33.440]   at distressed prices. So this is where a classic run on the bank problem actually causes a decline
[01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:38.080]   in the asset value of the business and the assets that they own. Because if you have to go and turn
[01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:42.000]   around and sell those assets in the market, super fast, you're going to take a huge loss. You guys
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:48.080]   remember that movie, Margin Call with Demi Moore, and what's his name, and they make this plan to
[01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:53.920]   go and mark and they're like, we gotta sell. Swayze. No, not Patrick Swayze. No, the Jeremy
[01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:57.920]   Irons, Jeremy Irons, he plays the best character. He's like the chairman of the bank. And they're
[01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:01.840]   like, we have to sell all this, but we're going to take a huge loss. And they make this big trade
[01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:05.520]   that happens at the beginning of the morning. But that's what happens when you have to sell a lot of
[01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:10.160]   assets very fast. As you guys know, you end up selling them at a discount. So the rate at which
[01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:15.680]   deposits are coming out of the bank can actually impact the asset value held at the bank. And
[01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:19.840]   that's fundamentally what a run on the bank causes. And the irony is, as they point out,
[01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:24.320]   the company was fundamentally financially sound, they had enough assets marked at the current
[01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:28.720]   market value or whatever, to meet all of their obligations. But the rate at which assets started
[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:33.920]   to get pulled out is what drove those that drove the company, the bank into distress. And if you
[01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:41.040]   think about it, it's an ironic point of view on Silicon Valley. Because Silicon Valley operates
[01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:47.360]   with such we all joke about what a herd mentality and what an incredibly tied and deep network
[01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:53.120]   Silicon Valley is. We all got dozens and hundreds of texts and messages from friends, colleagues,
[01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:58.960]   co workers yesterday, all relaying the news about what they were going to do. And as soon as that
[01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:04.880]   happened, that's how tightly intertwined Silicon Valley is. Within 24 hours, every CEO and every
[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:10.720]   venture capitalist was on a chat group or on a message group with other people in the valley.
[01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:15.680]   And once there was any indication of panic, the entire market flipped. And you guys saw this,
[01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:19.120]   we all saw this within 24 hours, the beginning of the day yesterday, it was like it, they'll get
[01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:22.880]   through it, it'll be fine. They just took a little markdown on their portfolio, they got plenty of
[01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:26.960]   assets. But then it's like, well, founders fund said we should probably get out. Okay, well,
[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:30.320]   founders fund is getting out, maybe we should get out before everyone else does. Well, we got to get
[01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:33.440]   up before everyone else does. Let's go now. I'm getting out right now. I'm telling my best friend,
[01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:36.720]   I'm getting out right now. And then everyone tells their second best friend. And then all of a sudden,
[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:40.080]   the whole valley knows it. And then the whole valley is running for the door. And this is a
[01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:44.880]   really interesting and unique scenario. It's not like the classic consumer run on the bank.
[01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:50.960]   Where you're trying to pull cash out. It's the Silicon Valley 24 hour cycle of we all got to do
[01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:54.880]   it because everyone else is doing like what we're seeing with investing cycles in Silicon Valley,
[01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:59.200]   where everyone chases and these bubbles emerge. The reverse I think happened yesterday,
[01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:03.360]   where the herd mentality drove us all to rush for the door as quickly as possible. You know,
[01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:09.040]   I'm not sure that that might be why it's not as much of a contagion, you know, as you might expect
[01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:14.080]   elsewhere, because places other kind of regional banks don't have the same sort of intertwined
[01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:17.840]   in this, as we saw with all the depositors here in Silicon Valley Bank, I don't know.
[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:25.440]   This is where I think that describing what happens to panic kind of misses the
[01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:31.680]   fundamental rationality of the response. So true, by the way. Yeah. So it does seem like a panic.
[01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:36.000]   But that doesn't mean that each individual decision makers motivation is panic. I actually
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:43.200]   think it's a rational upside downside calculation. I mean, this is all game theory. So if you think
[01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:47.200]   that there's a risk of other people pulling out their assets, and in fact, you're hearing
[01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:52.880]   that they are, you don't want to wait and be the last one to leave. And so you think about it,
[01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:59.840]   there's no penalty or downside to taking your money out. Right? So the downside of taking
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:04.240]   your funds out immediately is zero. And the upside is you might save 100% of your money.
[01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:10.560]   So it's a rational decision when confidence is lost to take out your money. And in fact,
[01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:15.120]   it was rational. There were a bunch of VCs, not a lot, but some of them tweeting yesterday,
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:18.880]   that, you know, SVB has been a great player in the ecosystem for 30 years,
[01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:23.120]   we should show our support right now by not taking our money out. Well, guess what,
[01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:27.680]   what happened to them? They got stuck. And now their money is frozen. And they're not sure
[01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:31.280]   whether they're gonna get, you know, pennies on the dollar or not. Whereas the people who
[01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:35.680]   rushed for the exits yesterday got their money out. It's prisoner's dilemma. It is a prisoner's
[01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:42.880]   dilemma. But here's the thing. It's not even about anymore, whether the institution is solvent.
[01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:49.040]   It's about whether there's confidence. And I think there is a risk now of contagion spreading
[01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:54.000]   to these other regional banks, because people aren't sure. And there's already huge cash outflows
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:58.000]   leaving these other banks, because why take a chance? The game theory of it is,
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:03.520]   move your money out until this is over. And if you're okay with, you know, moving it back
[01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:07.760]   in a few weeks, if it turns out not to be around the bank, that's fine. So, a lot of this can be
[01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:12.560]   self-fulfilling. You have to remember that runs on the bank, Friedberg, you said this 100 years ago,
[01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:18.160]   were extremely common. Every decade, there would be a giant financial panic, and there'd be a run
[01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:22.320]   on the bank, run on many banks. And the only way that the federal government stopped it was by
[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:28.640]   introducing FDIC. And they said to depositors, your money is safe. And at that time, $250,000
[01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:33.440]   was enough. The problem we have is that with these business banks, $250,000 is not enough.
[01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:38.480]   So, all of a sudden, there's going to be a crisis of confidence. If you think a business bank can
[01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:42.720]   go under, again, you're just going to leave all these regional banks, you're going to go to the
[01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:48.720]   top four, and that's going to be it. So, I think that the situation right now is really dynamic.
[01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:56.560]   And if the Fed does nothing and just says, "Oh, you know, these depositors should have known
[01:12:56.560 --> 01:13:03.280]   better," you know, the losses on them, then I think the rational reaction for depositors at all
[01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:07.520]   of these other banks would be just to leave. Because I don't think depositors are in a good
[01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:14.320]   position to assess the liquidity and creditworthiness of a bank. I just don't think they
[01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:18.640]   are. I think stockholders are. They're the people who should lose all their money if the bank goes
[01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:24.560]   under, but not depositors. Any advice or takeaways for founders and capital allocators going forward?
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:27.680]   Obviously, have your money in multiple bank accounts.
[01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:32.480]   I sent you guys a list that was just published of all of the funds that custody at SVB,
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:39.120]   and it's unbelievable, the list. It's every single major VC in Silicon Valley.
[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:40.400]   Wow. Where'd you get this?
[01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:41.200]   I have my ways.
[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:46.560]   Oh, extracted from SEC filings. Got it. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. This is amazing. Wow.
[01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:47.520]   Holy shit.
[01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:48.560]   I mean, everybody's in there.
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:49.280]   [crosstalk 00:10:50]
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:56.160]   Excel, 500, Sequoia. We're going pretty fast here, but yeah. Trying to get a fund.
[01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:59.360]   I mean, this is my point. By the way, all these guys-
[01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:04.240]   I feel very fortunate that we were out. A few months ago, when we were talking about venture
[01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:09.200]   debt on the pod, I didn't believe that SVB should be in this business. So I told-
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:10.800]   Oh, look, there's Kraft. There's Kraft.
[01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:15.040]   No. Well, hold on. I'll tell you. Does it say how much money we got in there?
[01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:16.800]   Yeah. Go to the right.
[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:20.640]   I'll tell you what happened is, so after the conversation we had on the show about venture
[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:24.720]   debt, I'm like, "I don't really like that SVB is in this business." So I told my guys,
[01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:28.720]   "Set up an account somewhere else." So we did that. So we moved our firm accounts over,
[01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:34.560]   and we were just using SVB to make warehouse loans or whatever. So I thought they were just
[01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:41.120]   a lender to us. So yesterday, when all this stuff went down, I said to our guys, "We're out of there."
[01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:45.520]   They're like, "Well, actually, we had about $45 million that we were about to distribute to LPs."
[01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:49.680]   And I'm like, "Whoa, that's crazy." So we were able to sweep that to
[01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:55.200]   an account we used to make in-kind distributions. And then we got on the phone, and we called as
[01:14:55.200 --> 01:15:00.240]   many portfolio companies as we could to get them out. And we got a huge number of them out. But
[01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:03.520]   unfortunately, some of them didn't get out. Here's the thing that I think people in Washington don't
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:08.400]   understand. We're doing this with the next set of banks. The triage is still happening.
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:15.040]   Guys, I will tell you, look, Sax, I appreciate the siren call, but I think the only way that
[01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:20.080]   what you're saying, because you're saying that triggers the next siren call and the
[01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:24.080]   contagion spreads, I'm not blaming you. I'm just saying it's a reality. And you're right.
[01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:28.880]   The game theory optimal way to play this as a depositor is to move your money out and get it
[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:32.400]   somewhere that it's completely safe. And you know, you have your cash secured or buy a security in a
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:36.800]   brokerage account where it's totally safe, and it's registered with a securities exchange or
[01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:44.800]   something. But in the meantime, for this to get resolved, there has to be a bear hug solution
[01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:50.480]   offered up this weekend. I'll say it again. Yeah. In order to stop the next set of siren calls,
[01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:56.320]   to drive the next siren call, listen, this is the thing I hate about the run on the bank
[01:15:56.320 --> 01:16:01.440]   conversation is that if you warn people that there's a possible run on the bank happening,
[01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:05.520]   you're actually creating the run on the bank. That's why it's so pernicious when these things
[01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:10.960]   get started. And yesterday, we were calling all of our portfolio companies, because we were warning
[01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:15.200]   them because our obligation was to them. But we weren't, you know, I don't think we were putting
[01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:20.640]   out like a siren to the world. And by the afternoon, it was really clear that if they listened and got
[01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:24.160]   their money out, they were in much better shape than ones who didn't listen. So this is the
[01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:29.280]   pernicious thing is that every individual actor has to do what's in their best interest. And
[01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:34.800]   we're not trying to start a run. Sorry, hold on. But we know things we know,
[01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:40.320]   that people are very close to us big players are withdrawing their money from other banks right now.
[01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:48.480]   So let me just finish my point. My point is, what you're saying makes a ton of sense. And
[01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:54.480]   it's gonna cause this, as you described, kind of pernicious escalatory problem. And the only way
[01:16:54.480 --> 01:17:00.800]   to stop it is a bear hug, which may not cost the taxpayer anything. If the Fed or some federal
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:05.840]   agency stepped in and said, we are going to backstop all of these banks with all of these
[01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:11.280]   deposits with cash, and we're going to guarantee it today. And here's a $500 billion facility.
[01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:16.720]   And just by saying that, everyone stops trying to pull their money out. And you don't actually
[01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:20.960]   need to backstop it with any money. It's, it's, it's already started. So,
[01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:25.920]   Nick, if you just the link that I sent you in the in the group chat, can you just throw that link up
[01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:31.120]   there? I think this is the best proxy for what Saks is talking about. So sort of, I think,
[01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:37.600]   very unemotionally, how would we know that there is a contagion that's afoot, you would look at the
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:43.520]   equity layer of all these regional banks. So what is this, this is the iShares regional banks ETF.
[01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:49.600]   And what you start to see is this decay, and go to the one week view, Nick, please,
[01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:54.640]   it just starts to fall off of a cliff. And so why is this happening? Well, it's happening because
[01:17:54.640 --> 01:18:02.000]   the equity tier of these banks are now increasingly worried that their equity will get wiped out.
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:07.520]   And so that's why they're selling. And so the I think what David said is already afoot,
[01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:13.520]   unfortunately, it starts at SVB, but forget the name for a second and take Silicon Valley out of
[01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:19.440]   it. This is a top 20 bank that now is in the receivership of, you know, the authorities.
[01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:24.560]   And so there does need to be something that needs to happen in really short order, because
[01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:29.520]   what's to prevent bank number 35. Let me just say it again, if a federal agency comes in,
[01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:34.000]   if the Fed comes in and says, you know what, we're going to backstop all of these banks.
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:38.080]   And we're going to put $500 billion behind it. And we're going to guarantee that all these deposits
[01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:43.360]   are going to be made whole. It stops the panic at that point. And you don't even have to put up any
[01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:47.760]   money. Because as soon as it's a first derivative problem, it's a feedback loop. As soon as you stop
[01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:51.760]   people from doing the withdrawals, the whole market subsides, you don't actually need to
[01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:55.040]   unplug it. And I think that's what needs to happen this weekend. That's what should happen
[01:18:55.040 --> 01:19:00.720]   plug it today is they number one need to go get Silicon Valley Bank handed over to a big balance
[01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:03.920]   sheet and guarantee that balance sheet that they're going to make money by taking this thing
[01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:07.840]   on. And number two, they got to make a statement, we got another 500 Billy for you. Where's the
[01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:11.600]   president? Where's the Allen? Well, they'll make a profit on it, too. So I mean, they don't need
[01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:17.600]   to use any money to do it. Right? The thing that's missing in our system is that there's no FDIC for
[01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:23.120]   $25 million accounts. What like 250 is not an effective amount. That's a personal account.
[01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:27.520]   It's for a small business. Businesses need confidence in our economy and our banking
[01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:32.560]   system, or the whole thing starts to unspool. So what the quid pro quo should be is you can get a
[01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:38.640]   25 million FDIC business banking account, and the bank is highly restricted in what it can do with
[01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:43.760]   that money. You can't put that money in fugazi venture debt, you can't put that money in laddered
[01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:49.280]   10 year bonds that don't get marked to market. It's only highly liquid, secure, mark to market
[01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:54.880]   assets. And the downside of that for the bank is they'll make less money and pass on less interest
[01:19:54.880 --> 01:20:00.480]   to the business, the depositor, the shareholders. So what? That's the way it should work.
[01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:05.120]   How are stable coins looking like a better option right now? I mean, the crypto guys right now are
[01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:08.720]   like, what did you say? They're not, J Cal. They're not. It was a joke.
[01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:12.480]   Nothing can revive the crypto market as we're seeing today, even in a run on the bank,
[01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:16.320]   which is exactly what everybody was afraid of in a Bitcoin world. That thing is down 10%.
[01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:22.240]   So I just want to recap whenever whenever liquidity, whatever the reason for that
[01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:27.680]   Chamath is just that what we've seen is that liquidity is all correlated. So when people
[01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:32.080]   are panicking about the state of their finances, and worried about getting access to their cash,
[01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:36.720]   the first thing they dump is crypto, because it is very liquid. So everyone is trying to free up
[01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:40.880]   cash right now. I just want to be clear as the end of the show here, we were dancing around,
[01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:46.560]   is this going to be a contagion? And I think what we know, and what we're seeing is
[01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:51.600]   the the next dominoes are already falling. And so
[01:20:51.600 --> 01:20:55.440]   I'll be a contagion. It cannot be a contagion. We have to stop it. That's
[01:20:55.440 --> 01:21:00.160]   the point. That's your feeling. And I agree with you. But I just want to make sure people
[01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:05.520]   understand we started this. We didn't want to go there. You know, I think with some reticent
[01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:10.240]   reticence to going there. Let's let's put it this way. If you if anybody,
[01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:17.200]   if you have initiated a wire in the last 24 hours, you are worried about contagion. Yes,
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:21.120]   if you're in DC, and you have any ability management matters, and if you have any
[01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:26.080]   risk management, influence what's going to happen this weekend, we strongly advise
[01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:32.880]   unplanned someone comes in and bear hugs the market this weekend and says, we will not let
[01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:39.120]   contagion happen with a very big slug of capital to support it, that will likely not even be needed
[01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:42.720]   to support it. Because once you say that the contagion will start got a comma.
[01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:48.000]   Yeah, free freeberg, we're gonna know on Monday, whether these regulators have in the administration
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:52.720]   know what they're doing at all. The other black swan problem is that this weekend,
[01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:57.680]   we will find out what some of the unintended second and third order consequences are going to be
[01:21:57.680 --> 01:22:03.040]   of SVB being in receivership. This weekend, we talked a little bit about the pipes problem.
[01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:07.280]   But there may be several other businesses and other other institutions and companies that we don't
[01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:12.640]   know about that may trigger another set of cascading effects that are unrelated to a banking
[01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:16.800]   problem, but could drive some more significant business and economic problems that we're going
[01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:21.600]   to kind of probably end up talking about next week. So you know, this weekend, I think with
[01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:27.840]   payroll, but there are other things that this money goes towards, you know, mortgages or rents.
[01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:32.320]   So the cascading effect of this if people stop paying their rents, if people stop paying mortgages,
[01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:34.320]   I mean, real estate. Yeah.
[01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:40.560]   Listen, Biden, Biden visited Kiev instead of East Palestine. Yellen visited Kiev instead
[01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:43.440]   of Silicon Valley. Do these people know what's going on here?
[01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:44.000]   Come home.
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:48.880]   They promised more financial assistance for Ukraine. And they're saying they're monitoring
[01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:54.320]   the situation here. We're in the process of what could be a run of banking failure.
[01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:54.880]   What's the bill for Ukraine this month? Yeah.
[01:22:54.880 --> 01:22:57.440]   Get on the case.
[01:22:57.440 --> 01:23:00.720]   The bill for Ukraine this month versus this bailout is, you know,
[01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:04.400]   probably the same. So I think we have to really think this through, folks.
[01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:06.720]   Yeah, you're gonna get
[01:23:06.720 --> 01:23:09.280]   Well, no, on Monday, where these people have a clue or not.
[01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:14.000]   No, they have to be on TV tonight or tomorrow. This this has to be a presser on Sunday.
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:18.000]   Hold on. I think I think a lot of these guys do know what they're doing. So let me just say it
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:24.400]   to them in language they understand. Folks, when you look at the equity tier of these regional banks,
[01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:31.200]   people are liquidating the equity tier, because they know that that is the first domino to fall.
[01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:37.520]   If banks go into receivership, please act accordingly. You can see it in the ETFs.
[01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:41.760]   You can see it in the trade flows. This is not a Silicon Valley problem anymore.
[01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:48.080]   It is a regional bank problem. And it will get worse unless you do something to make it better.
[01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:51.600]   Right. And I and Jake, I just use the word bail. I don't like that word because
[01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:53.200]   No, not a bailout, backstop.
[01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:57.920]   There were big, you know, too big to fail banks in 2008. In the financial crisis,
[01:23:57.920 --> 01:24:01.440]   who did get bailed out, those people should have lost the value of their stock.
[01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:03.760]   Okay, that was wrong. That's not what we're talking about here.
[01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:04.000]   Depositors.
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:07.680]   SGB is wiped out already. What we're talking about is protecting depositors.
[01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:11.760]   These are people who trusted that when they put their money in a top 20 bank,
[01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:16.960]   that our regulatory system is compliant, that they will not lose their money. When it says on
[01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:22.480]   their computer screen that my money is in a BlackRock or a Morgan Stanley mutual fund,
[01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:27.360]   or money market fund, rather, the safest instrument there is, that that money is
[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:32.480]   where it's supposed to be. And if regulators allow that bank to put their money in stupid
[01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:37.200]   assets that are not marked to market, and that's why they shut down, that is not a good reason
[01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:39.360]   for depositors to not get their money.
[01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:39.680]   100%.
[01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:43.120]   We're taking care of depositors here and not bailing out stockholders.
[01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:48.400]   Yes. This is not for the executives at the banks. It's for the depositors who did nothing wrong,
[01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:52.320]   and nor did their employees and their customers and the innovation that they're working on. All
[01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:56.720]   right. This has been a great all-in podcast. Sorry we didn't have time to talk about the
[01:24:56.720 --> 01:25:02.000]   shaman, QAnon shaman. I know that's a passion project for Hugh Sachs,
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:06.320]   but you can announce your Kickstarter for him and your GoFundMe for the QAnon shaman.
[01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:07.760]   For you, the shaman.
[01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:11.200]   For the shaman. But where's the bulldog? Give me that bulldog one more time.
[01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:18.160]   The shaman is an intersection of three, of a very interesting Venn diagram. He is
[01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:26.800]   very athletically fit, incredibly hairy, and oddly tattooed. That's a trifecta that you rarely see.
[01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:28.480]   You rarely see that.
[01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:32.960]   Also cultural appropriation. So yeah, we have to keep that in mind. And conspiracy theories. I
[01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:39.120]   mean, this guy's got it all. Are we going to play poker this weekend and just, like as the meteor is
[01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:39.520]   coming towards Silicon Valley?
[01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:45.520]   It's kind of sad. He's kind of an odd, seriously, the shaman, what's his name? Jake?
[01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:47.360]   He doesn't seem like he's all that.
[01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:53.120]   No, he's a guy who has diagnosed mental illness, but he's completely non-violent. He's completely
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:58.080]   non-violent. He actually believes in the philosophy of Mahatma Gandhi of no violence towards any
[01:25:58.080 --> 01:25:59.760]   creatures.
[01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:00.960]   He's a vegetarian.
[01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:01.440]   Yeah.
[01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:03.120]   He, you know, he's a bit of an odd duck.
[01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:05.040]   He's a Freiburg of QAnon.
[01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:10.240]   And he didn't assault anyone. He just wandered through the capital, apparently getting a tour
[01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:13.440]   from police officers who were just guiding him through it.
[01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:14.080]   He's the January 6th Freiburg.
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:17.600]   And he got four years, hold on a second, he got four years in jail for that because
[01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:23.120]   he became the face of an insurrection because he just looks so weird with the Viking horns
[01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:24.160]   and the face paint or whatever.
[01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:28.400]   He also made some threats to the politicians too, but yeah, I mean, it does seem like it
[01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:32.160]   might not be the appropriate sentence. He wrote a note saying, "We're coming for you." I think on,
[01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:36.800]   you have to look into the case, but he was sentenced by a Republican judge from Texas,
[01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:39.760]   and he had made threats, written threats and put them on the desks of folks.
[01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:43.680]   And he was one of the first people into the building. So I think they got him for that.
[01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:46.320]   But I agree with you. There is some compassion.
[01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:50.000]   That's how he got into the building. If he didn't break a door down or didn't smash a window,
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:53.520]   if he damaged property, that's one thing. If he assaulted someone, that's one thing. But if he
[01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:57.840]   just wandered through the capital, I think four years is kind of excessive. And I think the reason
[01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:02.640]   why the guy got four years is because of his mental illness. He's not able to defend himself
[01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:05.920]   the way that he should be. This is just a fundamental civil liberties issue. If you
[01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:09.920]   have any compassion at all, you shouldn't let a guy like that get scapegoated.
[01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:15.200]   There's 400 people who, of the thousands of people who broke in, who were violent and who
[01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:21.680]   got sentences of some degree, they were all settled, like, plea bargained, including his,
[01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:26.560]   they didn't go to trial. And if, you know, I think we can all agree, the violence that occurred that
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:32.080]   day is, you know, should be punished and the nonviolent stuff should be a speeding ticket,
[01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:33.320]   you know, we don't need to –
[01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:38.000]   I think three categories, Jason. I think violence, the assault on cops and so forth,
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:38.640]   punished most severely.
[01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:39.600]   Full extent of the law.
[01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:40.080]   Yeah.
[01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:41.680]   Then damage of property and then –
[01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:42.640]   Full extent of the law.
[01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:46.560]   People who just trespassed or wandered through who may not even have known
[01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:47.440]   they were trespassing.
[01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:48.000]   Probation.
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.720]   That's not, that's not jail time. That's not a felony.
[01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:54.160]   Yeah, I mean, we want to promote peaceful protests. If they had come
[01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:59.120]   with guitars and sang Kumbaya and We Shall Overcome, we'd be having a different discussion
[01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:02.480]   here. Instead, they beat cops, you know, and you can't beat cops up. Sorry.
[01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:03.680]   Those ones go to jail.
[01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:07.360]   Yeah, period. Full stop. We're in agreement. Okay, everybody, this has been another amazing
[01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:12.160]   all-in podcast. Sorry we couldn't get to all the news, but we felt that this required
[01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:20.240]   a big unpacking for the sultan of science, the dictator, and the Rain Man. I am the
[01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:23.520]   undisputed world's greatest moderator. We'll see you next time on the all-in podcast.
[01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:24.320]   Not this week.
[01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:26.480]   Not this week.

[01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:05.840]   It's like this like sexual tension that they just need to release somehow.
