[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.480]   Eric Mason is a church planter who lives and ministers
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.200]   in the heart of Philadelphia.
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.040]   There he is the co-founder and lead pastor
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.680]   of Epiphany Fellowship.
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.880]   He's a husband and father and he's the author
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.800]   of the book, "Manhood Restored,
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.700]   How the Gospel Makes Men Whole."
[00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.380]   In that book, on page 53, Mason writes this, quote,
[00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.360]   "Think about it.
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.480]   The very fact that Jesus came to earth
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.080]   is evidence of his willingness to stare sin in the eye.
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.000]   In Jesus Christ, God became human.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.040]   He chose to live in the world that man had destroyed.
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.480]   He faced fatigue, sweat, hunger, and even rejection.
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.700]   He faced the self-righteous sin of religious people.
[00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.520]   He faced the self-preserving sin
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.920]   of his closest friends who abandoned him.
[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.660]   He faced being misunderstood by his family,
[00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.500]   mocked by society, maligned by the crowds,
[00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.680]   and even stolen from by the soldiers.
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.800]   That's just a small sampling of the rest of the sin
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.520]   that he took upon his shoulders at the cross,
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.280]   and yet he went on.
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.560]   This is manliness at its best,
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.720]   courage at its greatest," end quote.
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.240]   As we will hear from Mason later,
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.480]   the topic of defining masculinity is opening new doors
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.360]   for gospel outreach among non-Christians
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.720]   in his neighborhood, and I asked him to explain how
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.060]   and to talk more about how Christ models masculinity.
[00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.260]   But first I asked him about his own father,
[00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.220]   and I asked him why he wrote his book, "Manhood Restored."
[00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.180]   - You know, actually, I was gonna write on something else,
[00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.740]   and it was interesting.
[00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.180]   I was gonna write on another subject.
[00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.660]   I was gonna write on either urban missions
[00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:43.660]   or something like that,
[00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.340]   or 'cause people had been encouraging me to do that.
[00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.980]   And when I got with BNH and Lifeway,
[00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.020]   and they began, they just interviewed me.
[00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.100]   They brought me down to Nashville
[00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.260]   and just started interviewing me about different things.
[00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.540]   It was on my heart, and I don't know how the Holy Spirit did
[00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.700]   it, but basically it came out that manhood was something
[00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.060]   that I needed to write on within the next two years
[00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.540]   or whatever, and so, and as I began to dive into it,
[00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.160]   I really began to realize that I spent the majority
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.780]   of my ministry of almost the last 20 years discipling men,
[00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.700]   and realized that God had graced me with a few insights
[00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.700]   on just manhood, and my desire was to write really a book
[00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.060]   that reflected who Jesus Christ is and what he's done for us
[00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.940]   so it wouldn't be a book that just, you know,
[00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.900]   kind of beat men up.
[00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.380]   And then on the other extreme, it wouldn't be a book
[00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.500]   that didn't deal with the sinfulness of man,
[00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.300]   but then I wanted to offer biblical solutions.
[00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.260]   I wanted it to be a Bible-saturated book,
[00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.260]   Jesus-saturated book, but contemporary to the culture
[00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.020]   that we're in, and as I dove into things,
[00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.500]   it seemed to strike a chord with me.
[00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.860]   - So tell us a little bit about your own father.
[00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.460]   You mention him and his story in the book.
[00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.180]   Give us an abbreviated version here.
[00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.380]   - Yeah, well, my father was, you know,
[00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.500]   he was raised in Jim Crow South.
[00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.260]   He went to World War II at 16 years old.
[00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.780]   He lied about his age, and they let him lie about his age
[00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.980]   because that's how bad he wanted to get out of Jim Crow South.
[00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.820]   We figured going to World War II would have been better
[00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.580]   than being in Jim Crow South,
[00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.860]   and so he went to World War II,
[00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.820]   ended up going into the Army.
[00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.780]   I can't remember which war.
[00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.140]   He was 91st Infantry in the 24th Infantry,
[00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.100]   but basically he was a Buffalo soldier,
[00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.060]   those legendary infantry grunts from, you know,
[00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.580]   the Army during World War II,
[00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.340]   and obviously he was a probably,
[00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.740]   he's pretty much a decorated soldier
[00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.380]   'cause he got a Purple Heart in each war,
[00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.380]   but because of the impact of them coming back
[00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.460]   and not being received as equals,
[00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.700]   most of the African American men along with him
[00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:55.940]   that came back from the war
[00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.640]   and came back to Jim Crow America,
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.020]   I mean, he went back to Jim Crow South and came North,
[00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.060]   and they threw their Purple Hearts in the trash.
[00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.420]   - Oh my. - Matter of fact,
[00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.300]   we're in the midst of talking to him
[00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.140]   about getting it reissued, so.
[00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.340]   - This is an amazing story.
[00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:17.340]   So how did all of this background affect him as a father?
[00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.700]   - Yeah, well, my father was a 100% disabled veteran,
[00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.940]   so they don't give you 100% disability for nothing.
[00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.980]   And he was, I mean, he was 100% disability.
[00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.940]   I mean, he's 90, he'll be 90 this year,
[00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.940]   so he's been 100% disabled since his 20s or 30s.
[00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.980]   And so my father, his father left him at a very young age,
[00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.060]   like when he was six months old,
[00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.260]   I can't remember exactly when,
[00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.140]   and it really had, I mean, to this day,
[00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.660]   if you bring up my dad's dad to him,
[00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.940]   he has a deep sense of bitterness and brokenness
[00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.280]   about his dad leaving and him rarely seeing him
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.960]   and his lack of involvement in his life.
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.180]   And that impacted the way he raised us
[00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.020]   because it didn't necessarily drive him
[00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.020]   to be a different type of father in a sense of,
[00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.020]   I guess he thought he was a different type of father
[00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.960]   because he was physically there.
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.340]   And that doesn't mean he was, I mean,
[00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:11.580]   he wasn't the worst father,
[00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.100]   but there wasn't for him just a model.
[00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.220]   So he had no idea how to lead us
[00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.940]   and develop us into young men and that type of thing.
[00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.820]   And so, I mean, he was an alcoholic most of my life
[00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.420]   until about 30 years ago.
[00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.820]   And then, well, the beginning of my life,
[00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.540]   not most of my life, but beginning of my life,
[00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:36.240]   until about 20, 30, a little over 30 years ago.
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.740]   And so he's doing a lot better.
[00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.820]   He loves the Lord now,
[00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.320]   has a relationship with Christ now,
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.580]   but it was very, very difficult growing up under a man
[00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.000]   that really didn't understand all of his life
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.460]   why he was just extremely angry at life.
[00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:56.460]   And it was, yeah, so he's a lot better now though.
[00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.860]   But that's pretty much the house I was raised in.
[00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.620]   - Man, thank you for sharing the story with us.
[00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.860]   Every generation has models of manhood,
[00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.720]   even today, some good, some poor examples.
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.060]   What you do in "Manhood Restored"
[00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.500]   is that you point to Jesus.
[00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.000]   You write this quote,
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.860]   "Jesus and Jesus alone has exemplified manhood," end quote.
[00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.220]   How would you explain this point to someone
[00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:20.780]   who doesn't think of Christ
[00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:25.160]   as necessarily a model of masculinity?
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.760]   - Yeah, I think that it's really, really helpful
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.540]   because actually, I wrote the book
[00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.540]   with my neighborhood in mind
[00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:37.240]   because I live in a mostly Islamic neighborhood,
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.540]   a black Orthodox Muslim neighborhood.
[00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:43.540]   And most of the men, drug dealers,
[00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:44.980]   most of the men around here,
[00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.980]   if they claim any religion, it would be Islam.
[00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:50.580]   I mean, period, I mean, probably 90%.
[00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:55.020]   So I wrote it because I've dialogued with many of them.
[00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.380]   They know me and I've dialogued with them
[00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:02.520]   and I'm pretty straightforward about who Christ is with them.
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.540]   And one of the things that I wanted to do
[00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:09.180]   is I really wrote the book as an apologetic to them in mind
[00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:10.020]   so that they could,
[00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:12.620]   'cause they don't view Christianity or Jesus
[00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:14.580]   in a very, very masculine way.
[00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:16.540]   And so because of that,
[00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:20.620]   I wanted to show off his godliness, his holiness,
[00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:24.660]   in his humanity, even though he's 100% God.
[00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:29.660]   I wanted to emphasize the 100% man that he is
[00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:32.300]   and begin to extract principles from it
[00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:36.140]   that men can relate to and that men can't relate to.
[00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:37.460]   Because I think there's some ways
[00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:40.420]   in which Christ is so otherworldly
[00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:43.420]   that it will upgrade their view of what manhood is.
[00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:47.340]   And so that's really how I kind of explain it
[00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:48.380]   because I wanted to,
[00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:50.980]   that's why I picked characteristics of manhood
[00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:55.500]   so that I did everything from sensitivity to zealous,
[00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:57.740]   so they could show two sides of the same coin
[00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:58.980]   so that the man could see,
[00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:02.660]   Jesus is zealous or jealous in a good way.
[00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:04.380]   Like every man gets jealous,
[00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:07.300]   but let's explain what his jealousy is all about.
[00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:09.300]   And then on the other hand though,
[00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:10.820]   I said he's sensitive,
[00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:12.780]   but let's explain, let's redefine,
[00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:16.780]   let's show how he redefined sensitivity
[00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:19.940]   from a heavenly perspective and also a manly perspective.
[00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:22.020]   And so, and what's been interesting
[00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:23.060]   is that's one of the things
[00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:25.420]   that I keep hearing from men reoccurringly.
[00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:28.740]   And there's so many men even now that I'm meeting
[00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:30.260]   when I go places or whatever,
[00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:31.100]   that are saying, "Man, hey,
[00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:33.340]   I can give this to my unbelieving friends.
[00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:35.740]   I've been waiting for a tool that I can use
[00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:38.140]   to be kind of common ground with my unsaved friend."
[00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:40.420]   And so that's, you know,
[00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:44.620]   and so more so that's pretty much how I begin to engage,
[00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:46.900]   even I engage in non-Christians a lot,
[00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.060]   especially Muslims about,
[00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:50.500]   because they believe in Tanakh
[00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.420]   and because they believe in Tanakh,
[00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:53.580]   AKA Old Testament,
[00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:57.100]   I utilize Christ-centered principles
[00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:00.660]   of showing Jesus off and how it either typifies
[00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:01.980]   or through a longitudinal theme,
[00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:03.700]   redemptive historical theme,
[00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:05.980]   and use that as a connecting ground for them.
[00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:06.940]   That's the technical way,
[00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:10.820]   but man who restored is really a practical way
[00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:12.060]   that I take Old Testament,
[00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:13.940]   even though I use a lot of New Testament too,
[00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:16.340]   to kind of relate and communicate Jesus
[00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:20.580]   to Muslims and other people who wouldn't necessarily,
[00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:21.500]   'cause in the Northeast,
[00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:24.140]   it's a lot of religious education up here,
[00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:26.340]   which because all of the Ivy leagues up here,
[00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:27.900]   so this is post-post-Christian,
[00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:29.420]   like America's post-Christian,
[00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:30.900]   but up here because all the Ivy leagues
[00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:31.820]   and everything's here,
[00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:34.420]   it's even impacted how people on the street think
[00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:36.700]   because some of that intellectualism
[00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:39.580]   has gotten to even just a regular person
[00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:41.260]   who's able to give an apologetic for it.
[00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.020]   So the book, that's why I wrote it.
[00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:44.940]   - That was Eric Mason
[00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:47.780]   and a clip from my 2013 conversation with him
[00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:49.980]   about his book, "Manhood Restored."
[00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:52.500]   And tomorrow we will resume that conversation
[00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:53.820]   and we'll talk about the local church
[00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:57.300]   and how it helps to envision fathers and men.
[00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:58.780]   For more on this podcast,

[00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:20.500]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
