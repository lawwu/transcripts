[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.560]   Alright Jesse, the fans have been asking, I'm going to load up the website here, they've
[00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.840]   been asking about my experience with my Remarkable 2 tablet.
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.600]   I'm going to load it up.
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.920]   Yes they have.
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.840]   Now let's see here, I'm loading up the website here.
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.800]   So for those who are watching, again this is youtube.com/calnewportmedia, this is episode
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.120]   258 or at thedeeplife.com, episode 258.
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.640]   Let's load up this homepage for those who are watching so we can remember.
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.160]   Alright, meet Remarkable, the paper tablet.
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:42.560]   And as we watched this video before, we see a very well-dressed contemplative woman holding
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.440]   her Remarkable.
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.120]   Here's some pictures of it, as close to paper as it gets.
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:56.080]   So as you can see in this image here, the Remarkable, for those who don't know, is an
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.960]   electronic notebook.
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.280]   It's a one page that you can write on.
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.600]   It's a Kindle style e-ink, so you write on this page and you see what you're writing
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.600]   like handwriting.
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.020]   I'm showing some of this on the screen right now.
[00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.800]   And you can have endless pages, essentially, and endless notebooks, all in this one thing
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.360]   you hold, all of it being backed up to the cloud as well.
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.120]   Alright, so what has my experience been with the Remarkable?
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.440]   The headline is, "I really like it."
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.880]   I'm really liking my Remarkable 2, and here's why.
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.080]   I had a lot of notebooks in my life.
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.960]   Because I have so many different things I do, these each had their own notebook.
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:48.000]   So I had a notebook, for example, for my moleskin, for keeping track of just my general life
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.160]   thoughts, the pursuit to have a deeper life.
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.320]   I would have notebooks for theory.
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.080]   I'm working on computer science papers, I need notebooks to work on ideas, mathematical
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.120]   equations, this or that.
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.160]   I would have multiple notebooks like this.
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:09.680]   I would have notebooks for planning around the business, the media company we run here.
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.120]   Thinking through what's our strategy, what's happening, what's our vision for the future.
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:22.080]   I'd have notebooks to keep track of my specific, what's the specific strategic plan I'm working
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.840]   on for a particular part of my life, and I want to keep notes on it.
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.840]   I'll have a notebook for that as well.
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.960]   I'd have notebooks for book ideas, and then a notebook for each particular book I was
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:33.960]   working on.
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.200]   And then just a scratch notebook, because I need to just keep track of ideas.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.960]   I'm at a meeting, I'm sketching out a plan.
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.600]   A lot of different notebooks were in my life, and I was constantly grabbing different notebooks
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.200]   and using some for other purposes.
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.760]   The remarkable solved that problem.
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.960]   I just have a lot of notebooks.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.480]   I counted, there's nine I've started so far.
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.840]   They're all on the same device.
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.400]   So I can use a stylus, go over, select any notebook I want, start taking notes.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.840]   And it's just there.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.440]   And then if I want to do something else, I can switch over to that notebook, and it's
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.440]   right there.
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.640]   So I've really been enjoying that.
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.800]   It really has been solving the problem.
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:18.040]   Basically the only paper notebook that this has not replaced is time block planning.
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.040]   And I tried this.
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.480]   I was like, "Hey, I wonder if I could just build time block plans for a market."
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.480]   Well, I didn't like it.
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.160]   So that was the one place where I wanted spiral binding, like the new time block planner has.
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.520]   I wanted something tactile that I could write in and see next to me and lie flat next to
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.080]   me and work on throughout the day as I was working on other things.
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.200]   That's the only real paper notebook that's left in my life right now is my time block
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.200]   planner.
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.440]   I really do need that to be analog and with me in all places, but I've had no problem
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.920]   moving my work notebooks, my planning notebooks, even my Moleskine notebooks.
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.000]   All that's worked well, moving to the remarkable.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.440]   Now let me talk a little bit about how I function with it.
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.580]   The writing I think is great.
[00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.960]   It took me a little while to get used to it.
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:01.960]   Like what's the right pressure?
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.840]   I used the fine liner at narrow, but once I got used to it, it really, for me, feels
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.040]   very much like a notebook writing on paper.
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.920]   My handwriting is the same as writing on paper.
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:13.920]   It's really identical.
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:14.920]   I really like that.
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.700]   I really like that experience.
[00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.840]   I've learned to use the highlighter a lot as well.
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.200]   So I like that I can highlight to emphasize things.
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.800]   I can highlight text.
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.400]   So just from an operational point, that's been great.
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.720]   It has endless scrolling.
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.200]   So you can make your page, you can scroll it down as long as you need, and then you
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.840]   can add pages.
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:35.840]   So you can scroll.
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.120]   If a particular page you want to put more on it, you can just keep writing longer and
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.420]   longer and then it's very easy just to jump to a new page.
[00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.760]   One thing I found myself doing is editing notebooks, which I can't do with paper notebooks,
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.900]   but I do like to do this here.
[00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:54.800]   So for example, I have a notebook where I'm working on the deep life stack, the ideas
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.360]   around the deep life stack, and my particular iteration through the deep life stack right
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.360]   now.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.260]   And one of the things I did was I had an early version of it on a new page, a better version
[00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.160]   of it than a couple of pages with a lot of notes on it.
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.960]   In that case, I actually went back and deleted some of the older pages and consolidated and
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.960]   rewrote like, okay, here's the right way to do the stack right now.
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.320]   I've tried a bunch of versions.
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.340]   I deleted those and added a page and rewrote it right.
[00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:29.000]   So I find myself doing that sometimes with planning notebooks is going back and deleting
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.440]   pages and re-summarizing them as I get better ideas around it.
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.520]   So that's an interesting twist I didn't expect myself to do.
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.180]   The backing up features work great.
[00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:45.200]   So the way it works is you have an app on your computer that if you open it, it mimics
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.460]   exactly the navigation of your Remarkable.
[00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.120]   And if you go to any of the notebooks in that navigation, all your pages, you can just read
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.000]   it all on your computer and you can export any of those pages to PDF.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.520]   I've done that sometimes to print some things.
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.320]   So can you, when you go on the desktop, can you go in there and type in there?
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.320]   No.
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:09.840]   So all you can do is see backups and you can read what you wrote in the notebook.
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.080]   So you can't type in Remarkable either, right?
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.080]   Or is it all just right?
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.360]   Well, I'll get to that in a second because you can, and I'll tell you my experience with
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.360]   that.
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.000]   But the way that app works, the desktop app works, it just shows you it's a backup of
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   all of your notes.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.160]   And so the main useful thing for that is, A, if you lose your Remarkable, you have all
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.160]   your notes.
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.000]   If you buy a new Remarkable, I'm sure you can transfer it over, but you can print those
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   things.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.480]   Now, if there is something else you, so I haven't used these features yet, though, it's
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.440]   activated.
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:46.080]   It does now have integration with Google Drive and with Dropbox because you can bring files.
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.080]   I haven't done this yet, but I want to do more of this.
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.840]   You can bring PDFs onto the Remarkable, read them on the Remarkable, mark them up on the
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.000]   Remarkable.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.720]   And so this is a place where you can be more interactive, is you can hook up a particular
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:03.160]   folder on the Remarkable with, let's say, a Dropbox folder.
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.840]   And now if you just put a document, like a PDF file into that Dropbox folder, it will
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:11.440]   automatically appear on your Remarkable.
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:16.720]   And if on your Remarkable, you write it, you annotate it, an annotated version of that
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.400]   document shows up in your Dropbox folder.
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.880]   So that's kind of cool.
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:23.080]   Same with Google Drive as well.
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:27.080]   So that's kind of cool if you're, for example, need to edit some papers or something, you
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:31.960]   can just throw papers or articles into a Dropbox and then you're on a train somewhere.
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.680]   They've all synced up onto your Remarkable, so you can read them and mark them up.
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:40.320]   And then later, all that annotation is resynchronized back up with your Dropbox.
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:44.080]   So at home on your computer, you can print things out with the marks and stuff like that.
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:48.160]   So I think that's a nice feature.
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.920]   But really the thing is, you can't -- so we're going to talk about shortcomings.
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:55.000]   I have three things to mention.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.940]   This really is about using the notebook.
[00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:02.580]   So you can see the stuff you did on your computer, but you can't -- you're not really supposed
[00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:03.840]   to be -- it doesn't go back and forth.
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:07.840]   You can't update things on your computer and have that show up on your Remarkable.
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:12.960]   If you annotate a PDF file that syncs back to your Dropbox, it's going to be a new version
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.880]   of the file with the annotations.
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:19.600]   Because it's its own proprietary world of marking and drawing and stuff like that, that
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.780]   the computer doesn't speak.
[00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:27.000]   I got the fancy folio that has this really cool built-in keyboard.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.400]   So you can type on it.
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:37.880]   So it's actually the case can become like a Surface thing where a keyboard comes out
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:38.880]   and it's up like a screen.
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.160]   You can type on it.
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:42.160]   I'm not been using it.
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:45.020]   I used it a little bit, but the typing experience is not great because you don't have a lot
[00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:47.320]   of control over where the text is going to go.
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.560]   You can't do much with the text once it's on there.
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:53.820]   Now, any time you want on a Remarkable page, you can put in a text cursor and type either
[00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:56.080]   on an on-screen keyboard or with the built-in keyboard.
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:00.000]   I don't like doing it because I don't really know how -- I don't know how to move the text
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.760]   around.
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.280]   There's weird things about deleting the text.
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:08.080]   What I've been doing is really dealing with just handwriting.
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.720]   This is my paper notebook.
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.320]   I just have 20 paper notebooks in one form.
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.520]   That's how I've been personally using it.
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:17.400]   I have not been using the typing because, you know, it's not a word processor.
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.000]   It's like the text is going right over here and you can't do anything with it once you
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   type it.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   It kind of makes me nervous.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.520]   So I don't know if I would pay for the keyboard folio, or if you do, you would have to have
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:26.920]   a better use case for it.
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:29.440]   So that's the second downside.
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:33.200]   The third downside is it's just really expensive.
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:38.720]   Once you buy the Remarkable, you buy the fancy folio, you buy the nicer stylus for it, I
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:44.080]   was in $500 plus, which is a lot of money.
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:49.500]   Now I could kind of justify it because, well, I talk about it on the show and it fits the
[00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.520]   type of things we do.
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.640]   It is really expensive.
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.920]   So that would be the other downside.
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:59.820]   But in the end, so far, I've been doing this for a couple months now, as a replacement
[00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:04.760]   for my stack of random notebooks, it has been successful.
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:07.680]   And I think I'm probably capturing more notes than I otherwise would.
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.280]   And I love the experience of using it.
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:12.760]   And as long as I think of it as just these are notebooks that I write in with a pen,
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:13.760]   and that's it.
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.440]   And I don't care too much about the computer integration.
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:16.840]   And I don't try to do writing on it.
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.920]   I just think of it as notebooks.
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.480]   I've been very happy with the experience.
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:25.120]   I love single purpose application gadgets, things to do one thing, and they do that one
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.280]   thing really well.
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:27.560]   There's no distraction when you're on there.
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.280]   There's no internet when you're on there.
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:33.320]   There's just, this is me writing in a notebook.
[00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:38.280]   And so I'll count myself as a remarkable two fan.
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:43.680]   But with those caveats that it's just for writing, and it's expensive.
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.920]   It's expensive as all get out.
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:47.480]   Can you carry it around in your pocket?
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:52.800]   No, it's the size of like a normal eight, eight and a half by 11 piece of paper.
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:56.800]   So I guess my only question is before when you had kind of that life notebook for the
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:00.880]   moleskins that you carry around your pocket, how do you capture those thoughts if you're
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:01.880]   I didn't.
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:05.520]   I mean, you could, you could put a moleskin in your pocket, but I want it right because
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:08.040]   then you would have a big thing in your pocket.
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:09.800]   So I was a bigger one for some reason.
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.080]   I thought it was a little one.
[00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:14.560]   It was a little one, but I don't, the little ones I don't like having in my pocket still
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:19.960]   like it fits in your pocket, but it's weird to have, you know, it's like having a big
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:21.800]   wallet in your pocket still.
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.160]   I wouldn't walk around with that in my pocket.
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.080]   I don't like having things in my pocket.
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:27.880]   So I, my, my moleskin was small, but I kept it in my bag.
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:28.880]   Okay.
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:32.080]   So it'd be in the, it would be in the front pocket of my backpack.
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:35.800]   So this thing's just, yeah, this is the size of like a composition notebook.
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:39.440]   So it's the size of a normal piece of paper and maybe like a half inch thick.
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.880]   It's heavy, which I actually kind of like about it.
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:42.880]   It's actually kind of heavy.
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:43.880]   It's very substantial.
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:49.000]   But so that hasn't been a problem because I, I, I want it, I want it moleskin in my
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   pocket.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.540]   I would always moleskin in my, my bag anyway.
[00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:55.960]   So now I just throw this thing, throw this thing into my bag.
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:56.960]   That's the other downside.
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:58.220]   These are small things.
[00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:02.320]   The stylus like magnets onto the side, which is cool.
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:05.880]   So it just sticks onto it, but you can't put in your bag that way because it'll get knocked
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:08.240]   off, maybe injured.
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:13.000]   So like you, you keep the stylus separate, like in my backpack, it'll be with my, my
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.440]   pins and the thing will be in the back.
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.360]   These are, these are minor points, but I'm a big fan.
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:21.520]   I think it's a beautifully engineered product for notebook heads.
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:27.440]   If you keep a lot of notebooks, you know, worth considering.
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:30.440]   We messed up the, we should have asked him to be a sponsor, Jesse, because I had to give
[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.280]   it a really, really good endorsement.
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.480]   We should do more of that.
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:38.040]   Find things I love and then work backwards and ask the people to be like, you really
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:39.360]   need a sponsor.
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:44.680]   I've discovered a lot of things I love from sponsors approaches in us, but that'd be cool.
[00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:47.160]   We should, we should, we should tell remarkable, like, look, I love your thing.
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:48.800]   So you should be our sponsor.
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:49.800]   And also we need 20 remarkables.
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:53.560]   I want to just give them out like candy.
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:56.920]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.280]   (upbeat music)
