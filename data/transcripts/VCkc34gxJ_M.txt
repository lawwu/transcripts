[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.560]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:12.960]   Paul's epistle to the Galatians in chapter 6 and verse 14, the 14th verse in the 6th
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.760]   chapter of Paul's epistle to the Galatians.
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:27.480]   But God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.160]   the world is crucified unto me and I unto the world.
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:39.760]   We come back to a third consideration of this great and most wonderful statement.
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.200]   The apostle here is nailing his colors to the mast, if you like.
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:51.360]   He's making a great declaration of his own personal position.
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.720]   He's contrasting himself with certain false teachers who glory and make their boast in
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:04.000]   the flesh, interested in themselves and in their own success and the use they can make
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.760]   of other people.
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.840]   The apostle says, God forbid that I should be interested in or glory in anything like
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:11.840]   that.
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:20.920]   I glory in nothing, I boast in nothing, save in the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.320]   Well now, in other words, as we've seen, he is telling us here and reminding us that
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.360]   the preaching of the cross is, after all, the very essential message of the Christian
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.680]   faith and of the Christian gospel.
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.360]   Now I'm calling attention to this because of this present modern misunderstanding.
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.040]   There's always been misunderstanding about this.
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.600]   The apostle, as I've pointed out and as you see again, had to write this epistle to the
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.040]   Galatians in the first century because there was misunderstanding about the cross.
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.280]   There's nothing new in this modern apostasy.
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.120]   There's nothing new in this modern heresy.
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.200]   That's what makes it so pathetic that people think it's new, that it's up to date for people
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.840]   to deny this message of the cross and to deny the Christian gospel.
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.800]   It's as old as Christianity itself.
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.880]   Our Lord had to battle against opposition, and the apostles, his first disciples and
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:23.160]   preachers, they in the same way had to battle against misrepresentations of the truth.
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.640]   And so we are compelled to do this at the present time.
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.720]   And my proposition is this, the cross of Christ, the death of our Lord upon the cross, is the
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.600]   very heart and centre and nerve of the Christian message.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:45.920]   Not only that, as we've seen, it is the one thing that tests us all, and we've got to
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:46.920]   face it.
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.320]   You see, the cross belongs to history.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.920]   It isn't a theory, it isn't an idea.
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.640]   It isn't just a message about self-sacrifice.
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.320]   It's more than that.
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.320]   Here is this great historic event.
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:07.580]   This person, Jesus of Nazareth, was literally taken and condemned and nailed to a cross
[00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.360]   between two thieves on a little hill called Calvary.
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:18.440]   And there we are confronted by this historical fact, this historical event.
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.880]   And what I'm trying to say is this, that we, all of us, are in relationship to that.
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.880]   And that it judges us, every one of us.
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:33.960]   The whole message of the New Testament is to tell us that finally, what decides what
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:42.000]   we are in this world and in the world to come, is our reaction to this cross.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.800]   Now this is what makes it of such tremendous importance.
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:54.760]   Our eternal destiny depends upon the view we take of the death of Jesus of Nazareth
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.520]   upon the cross on Calvary's hill.
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.360]   That's what the Apostle said, that's what all the first preachers said, that's what
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.040]   he said himself.
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.600]   That has been the message of the Christian Church throughout the centuries.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.320]   When she has truly been functioning as the Christian Church, there has been this unbroken
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:16.160]   message in spite of heretics and errors and all sorts of apostasies which have kept on
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.120]   recurring and reappearing throughout the running centuries, there has been this continuous
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.680]   testimony to the cross of Christ.
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.160]   And that is why I'm calling your attention to it tonight.
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:33.920]   Now we've seen this, there are only two ultimate positions with regard to the cross.
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:39.880]   It is either an offense to us, it is either something that we hate, something that we
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:48.640]   ridicule, something on which we pour scorn, as being an insult to us, or else we glory
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:49.640]   in it.
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:55.760]   Now the Apostle didn't merely admire the cross, he glories in it, he boasts of it.
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:56.760]   Why?
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.120]   Because he says it's everything to him.
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.680]   It's changed his life, it's done many things for him, but apart from that, the thing itself,
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:09.760]   he says, is the most wonderful, the most glorious thing which he's ever seen and ever known.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:17.000]   There is to him nothing in the whole wide world that compares with the glory of the
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.560]   cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:28.080]   So now then, it is in order to help us all to see what our position is relative to this
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:33.160]   cross, that I'm continuing once more to call your attention to it.
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.480]   And I'm putting it in this way.
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.680]   Why does the Christian boast of it?
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:43.480]   Why must the Christian say that the cross of Christ, the death of this Son of God upon
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:51.040]   the cross, is to him the most momentous, the most vital of all facts, that there's nothing
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:56.080]   that compares with it, and that it is to him tonight the most significant thing in the
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.080]   universe?
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.120]   Now, I'm putting that quite deliberately.
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.800]   The Christian is a man who says, "I don't care what's happened, I don't care what may
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:11.280]   happen, nothing can happen, I don't care what it is, if the bombs are let off, anything
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:17.920]   you like, nothing can ever approach in significance to me.
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:26.320]   What happened there on the cross on Calvary's Hill when Jesus of Nazareth died and was buried
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:32.400]   in a grave and rose again and went back to the glory everlasting?"
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.640]   Why does he say this?
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:37.320]   Why does the Christian make his boast in the cross and glory in it?
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.280]   Well, now we're answering that question.
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:44.240]   My first answer last Sunday night was this, that he glories in it because of what he sees
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:50.920]   in it, as a spectacle without going any further it is incomparable.
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.360]   I quoted those lines of Isaac Watts.
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:59.400]   We sang them at the end last Sunday night, "When I survey the wondrous cross."
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:00.400]   Well why does he glory?
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:07.760]   Well, for this reason, the Prince of Glory died upon that cross.
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:13.360]   Now there is a spectacle by the side of which anything that you can think of in history
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:18.200]   or anything that you can imagine simply pales into insignificance.
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:23.560]   God dying, the author of life expiring.
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:29.000]   He who has all power and can hold up the very universe and is doing so, dying in weakness.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.400]   There's never been anything like it.
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:40.320]   "When I survey the wondrous cross in which the Prince of Glory died, my riches gained,
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:48.360]   I count but loss and poor contempt on all my pride."
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.360]   Now then, that's it.
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:57.280]   You see, this spectacle, the Son of God dying and all the love and mercy and compassion,
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:03.560]   the blood and the love flow mingling down, all that we saw when we looked at this fact
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:08.560]   that it is the Lord of Glory, the Son of God who dies in that way for us.
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:14.360]   But now we must proceed because you can't say a thing like that and stop at that and
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.880]   leave it at that.
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.240]   You've got to ask a question.
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:22.320]   Why did he do that?
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:23.920]   You're quite entitled to put it like that.
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:28.720]   You say if that is true, well why did that ever happen?
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:33.000]   Well I say, quite right, you're asking a good question and there's only one way of answering
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   it.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.880]   Let's look again at the cross.
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.240]   Let's survey it once more.
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:42.600]   You see, when a man like the Apostle Paul, glory is in the cross, you can be quite sure,
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:47.240]   my friend, that it is the biggest and the deepest and the profoundest thing, I say,
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.880]   in the whole universe.
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.840]   You know, a casual glance at the cross isn't enough.
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:55.880]   The saints of the centuries have been surveying it, they've been looking upon it, they've
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:59.960]   been gazing upon it, they've been meditating upon it, and the more they look at it, the
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.400]   more they see in it.
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.520]   The writers of the hymns have done the same thing.
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:07.760]   There has been nothing in the whole of human history that has produced such magnificent
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:11.860]   poetry as this cross of Christ.
[00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:16.480]   But they've looked at it, they've surveyed it, they haven't just said, oh yes, I know
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:20.600]   Jesus died, he was a pacifist and he died and gone on, or they haven't said like some
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:24.760]   of us perhaps, Christian people, evangelical people, oh yes I believe in the cross, I believe
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:29.360]   Christ died for me, and on you go, oh my dear friend, if that's it, you've not seen it,
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.500]   you've got to stop and look, survey.
[00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:36.880]   Put everything else on one side and look at it and don't stop looking at it until you've
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:46.080]   seen some of these profundities, or what Thomas Carlyle described in another connection, infinities
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:51.160]   and immensities, in this glorious cross.
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:56.600]   So I ask a question, why, why this, why did this happen?
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:01.840]   Why did it ever happen if you say the Son of God died, the Prince of Glory died, why?
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:04.320]   Well now then, let's look at the answer.
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:08.720]   We've got it all here in the scriptures, I'm not going to draw on my imagination, I'm not
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:14.240]   inventing any answers, you know my dear friends, the more you know your Bible, the easier preaching
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:15.240]   becomes.
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:20.680]   I pity the poor man who's in difficulties about what to preach Sunday after Sunday, hope
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:24.760]   something striking will happen in the news so that he can preach a topical sermon, oh,
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:28.880]   what a tragedy, what a tragedy.
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:33.160]   All I've got to do is to hold before you what the scriptures tell us about this, because
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.880]   I know nothing apart from what I find here.
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:39.120]   I'm as ignorant as everybody else about these matters.
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:42.680]   If I hadn't got the scriptures, I couldn't preach.
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:46.360]   I'm simply here to hold before you what the scriptures themselves say, and this is what
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:48.520]   they say.
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:49.520]   Why is he there?
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:54.160]   Well, the first thing they say is, that isn't merely the action of men, oh, but you say
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:58.420]   it's men who are hammering in those nails, I agree.
[00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:03.520]   But you see, if you merely say men did that, you're a very superficial observer.
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.480]   Why did men do it?
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.140]   What made them do it?
[00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:09.660]   Is there nothing behind men?
[00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:13.680]   You see, the whole trouble in the world today is that we're all looking at everything superficially.
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:17.880]   We're just looking at an action, then we set up a royal commission to look into, and we
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:22.280]   have a little superficial report, it makes no difference, nothing's any different, why?
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:27.440]   Well, we're superficial in our diagnosis, we're not able to see the depths of things,
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.520]   but it's the same here.
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:33.880]   Why do I say that it wasn't merely the action of men?
[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:36.800]   Why am I repeating that it wasn't merely an accident?
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:42.920]   Well, my answer is, of course, that it was something that had been prophesied.
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:46.680]   Why did I read that 53rd chapter of Isaiah's prophecy at the beginning?
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:52.200]   I had only one reason, it is an exact prophecy of what happened there, on the cross on Calvary's
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.200]   Hill.
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:59.240]   I might equally well have read the 22nd Psalm to you, that's another perfect prophecy of
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:02.240]   the death of our Lord upon the cross on Calvary's Hill.
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:07.020]   It is prophesied many times in the Old Testament, indeed.
[00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:10.920]   If you go back to books like Leviticus and books like that, which people say they find
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:14.880]   utterly boring and they can't understand, well, if you only know how to read them you'll
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.560]   find they're all pointing to this.
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:21.600]   Or if you go back to Exodus and the exodus of the children of Israel from the captivity
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:27.320]   of Egypt, why did they have to kill that lamb, that Paschal Lamb, as we call him, that night
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:30.200]   and post the blood on the doorposts and the lintels?
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.560]   It's just a prophecy of this.
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:34.160]   Everything there is prophesying this.
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:39.520]   Very well, there's a great fact, and then you see that 53rd of Isaiah put it so plainly
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:48.240]   as a lamb to the slaughter, as a sheep led, there it is, there's nothing surprising.
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:53.740]   He wasn't taken by surprise, it was all prophesied long ago.
[00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:58.360]   But then, of course, we're not dependent upon the prophecies of the Old Testament only.
[00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:02.800]   Our Lord himself made certain very specific statements about this.
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:07.600]   You remember in talking to that great man Nicodemus, you've got the history in the third
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:15.600]   chapter of John's Gospel, he put it like this to him, he said, "As the serpent was lifted
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:25.520]   up in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whosoever believeth
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:30.200]   in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:36.360]   Now, there's a prophecy of his death upon the cross quite early on in his ministry.
[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:40.880]   He said, "You remember that old story, in your history as a people, the children of
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:46.040]   Israel, snakes began to bite people, and they were killed as a result.
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:50.200]   And the cure was this, a brazen serpent was set up on a pole and lifted up, and everybody
[00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:55.080]   who looked at the brazen serpent was healed."
[00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:58.360]   He says, "That was a prophecy of me.
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:07.800]   As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up on
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:16.440]   a tree, on a pole, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting
[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:17.440]   life."
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.840]   He wasn't taken by surprise.
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:23.120]   When they took him and crucified him, he told them that it was coming.
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:24.120]   He goes on repeating this.
[00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:27.960]   I mustn't keep you with this evidence, but it is a vital part of this message.
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:33.760]   There he is, you'll read about it in the twelfth chapter of John's Gospel.
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:37.120]   Suddenly he comes to the end, as it were, and he's ready.
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:40.800]   "The hour," he says this, "come!"
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:41.800]   The hour!
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:43.960]   What's he talking about?
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:46.040]   He's talking about his death.
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:52.060]   In a few moments he says, "And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men
[00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:53.060]   unto me."
[00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:55.040]   You remember the context?
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:59.240]   Some Greeks had come along, and they'd approached some of our Lord's disciples, and they said,
[00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:00.240]   "We would see Jesus.
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.040]   We'd like to have a word with him.
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:03.760]   We'd like to talk with this new teacher.
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:06.840]   We've been hearing about him, and we want to know what he's got to say."
[00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:12.120]   You know, this kind of intellectual curiosity, and indeed another more general kind of curiosity
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:16.640]   in a wonderful teacher that's just appeared, and our Lord wouldn't see them.
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:21.880]   He sent back a message saying that he couldn't see them, and then he explains it by saying,
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:28.400]   "So far I am only for the Jews, but when I'm lifted up," and John comments in his
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:32.760]   account by saying this speaky, referring to the manner of death which he should die.
[00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:38.080]   He says, "When I am lifted up, then I will draw all men unto me," which means not every
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:39.860]   single individual that's ever lived.
[00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:45.400]   It means men of all nations, not only Jews, but Greeks and anybody else, all nations,
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:48.480]   men from all nations, "I will draw unto myself.
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:53.000]   When I die, I shall be a universal savior in that sense."
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.640]   He knew it was coming, and he repeats that on many other occasions.
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:01.480]   You remember there was a specific occasion when he turned to his disciples and he said
[00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:04.400]   they had been asking for certain privileges.
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:12.120]   He said, "Now, I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how am I straightened until it be
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:13.120]   accomplished?"
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:15.800]   He is referring to his death.
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:16.800]   Well, there you are.
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:20.280]   There's evidence, and I could go on giving you evidence for a considerable length of
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:26.800]   time, showing you that this is no accident, this is no mere action on the part of men.
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:31.080]   There's something more here, there's a mystery, there's something behind it.
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.080]   What is it?
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:37.360]   Well, now, let's listen to the Apostle Peter.
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:43.480]   On the day of Pentecost at Jerusalem, after the Holy Ghost had come down upon the infant
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:48.640]   church, people came together from all directions, astonished and amazed because they heard these
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:52.440]   simple and lettered men talking in languages which they could understand.
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:56.800]   Every man heard them telling in their own languages the wonderful works of God.
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:57.960]   And they said, "What is this?"
[00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:58.960]   Some thought they were drunk.
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:16:59.960]   "What is this?"
[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:04.400]   And then Peter begins to preach, and he gives them the answer.
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:12.400]   He says, "You know, this is something that has been done to us by Jesus of Nazareth."
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:16.080]   This is the first sermon really preached at the auspices of the Christian church, and
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:18.560]   here, therefore, is the full explanation.
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:21.240]   And Peter then goes on to say something like this to them.
[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:25.480]   "You men of Israel," he said, "hear these words.
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:31.760]   Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs which
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:40.880]   God did by him in the midst of you, as you yourselves also know," listen, "him, being
[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:52.480]   delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, you have taken, and by wicked hands,"
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:56.760]   which can be better translated like this, "by the hands of wicked men, because the
[00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:03.400]   Jews had used the Romans to do it, have crucified and slain."
[00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:05.600]   But you notice what Peter says?
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:15.440]   "Him, Jesus of Nazareth, Jesus Christ, him, being delivered by the determinate counsel
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:24.120]   and foreknowledge of God, you have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain."
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:32.680]   Yes, says Peter, it was your hands that did it, but it was God who determined it.
[00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:39.000]   And God determined it not now, but before time, the predeterminate counsel and foreknowledge
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   of God.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.560]   This is something, he says, that God determined in eternity, which you have actually done
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:48.000]   with your own hands, now in time.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   Now this is so important that it was repeated on another occasion.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.080]   In the fourth chapter of the book of the Acts of the Apostles, we find a wonderful prayer
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:00.480]   meeting being held by the early Christian church.
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:05.760]   Two of their company, Peter and John, had been arrested, they'd been put on trial,
[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:09.760]   and they had been prohibited to do any further preaching or teaching in the name of this
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:11.440]   Jesus.
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:14.400]   The authorities had said to them, "Look here, we're letting you off this time, but
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:18.600]   if you go on doing this, well then we'll not only arrest you, but we will deal with
[00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:19.600]   you."
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:20.720]   And they were threatening them with death.
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:25.520]   They straightly charged them that they should do no more of this.
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:29.440]   And then we find the apostles going back to their own company, to the church, and they
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:35.120]   all begin to pray, and this is what they say in their prayer.
[00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:40.080]   Having quoted the second psalm, they say, "Of a truth against thy holy child Jesus,
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:47.040]   whom thou hast anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:56.560]   of Israel, were gathered together, for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:59.440]   before to be done."
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:04.360]   They're repeating what Peter had said in his sermon on the day of Pentecost, and what
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:07.680]   is said on both occasions is this.
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:14.960]   It was actually, of course, physically, materially, the hands of men who killed him.
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:17.920]   But it was God who had purposed this.
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:24.840]   They were simply carrying out in time what God had predetermined upon before the very
[00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:29.360]   foundation of the world.
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:34.520]   Now this is the most important thing that you and I can ever consider.
[00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:39.880]   You see what it means, you see what is being said.
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:45.120]   And you see what light this throws upon all those burnt offerings and sacrifices in the
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.120]   Old Testament.
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:51.880]   I was reminding you just now that the Paschal Lamb and all the burnt offerings and sacrifices
[00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:57.120]   were just prophecies of the coming of the day when the Son of God was going to be crucified.
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.520]   Now you see how all that could happen.
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:05.440]   God had decided on this before men was ever created, so he was easily able to prophesy
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:06.440]   it.
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:10.360]   He knew, he decided before time, that this was going to be the way in which men should
[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:11.360]   be saved.
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:12.720]   God, you see, is omniscient.
[00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:14.000]   God knows everything.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.600]   God knows the end from the beginning.
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:19.560]   There is nothing outside the knowledge of God, and God knew that man was going to fall
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:21.160]   before he ever made him.
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:28.720]   And God has decided upon a plan of salvation before men was ever even made.
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:32.200]   Now this is the whole of the preaching of the New Testament.
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:36.800]   The Apostle Paul, in writing to the Corinthians, puts it like this.
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:40.720]   He says he's got a wisdom to preach to them, how be it we speak wisdom among them that
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:45.760]   are perfect, yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world that come
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:46.760]   to naught.
[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:53.400]   But, he says, we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom which
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:57.960]   God ordained before the world unto our glory.
[00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:59.160]   That's it.
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:02.440]   That's the very thing that I'm trying to put before you.
[00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:03.440]   What does it mean?
[00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:06.840]   Well, it means this, and this is the most glorious good news that's ever come into
[00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:07.880]   the world.
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:11.600]   This is why the Apostle Paul glories in the cross of Christ.
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:15.600]   Here we are, miserable sinners, every one of us, yes, every one of us.
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:20.320]   There's not a person in this congregation who isn't a miserable sinner.
[00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:24.240]   The whole of the human race is in this condition.
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:28.120]   Everybody who's ever been born since the fall of Adam has been born in sin, shapen
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:29.360]   in iniquity.
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:31.080]   Life has been a misery for that reason.
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:32.400]   Life's been a trial.
[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:34.200]   Life's a matter of disappointments.
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:37.480]   Life's a matter of a man doing things he doesn't want to do, and failing to do what
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:38.640]   he wants to do.
[00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:39.640]   Life is a struggle.
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:44.880]   It's a moral problem, and a moral failure, and a moral difficulty to every one of us.
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:48.160]   And here we are, civilization has been trying to put it right.
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:52.840]   Men have concocted their schemes, planned their utopias, passed their acts of Parliament,
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:54.480]   and we are none the better.
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:59.400]   We are as bad as we've ever been, more educated but not more moral.
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:03.920]   Knowing much that our forefathers didn't know, but still not knowing how not to sin,
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:08.200]   and how to live a clean, a wholesome, a pure, and a chaste life.
[00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:12.980]   Here we are in the same old human predicament.
[00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:16.260]   And do you know the message of this gospel?
[00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:18.040]   Do you know why Paul gloried in it?
[00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:25.540]   It's for this reason, that he has come to see that God has got a plan for this miserable,
[00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:29.520]   wretched, failing, sinful world.
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:35.600]   And it's a plan that he had planned before the very foundation of the world itself.
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:39.240]   I know of nothing so wonderful in the whole world tonight.
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:42.000]   You see, that's why I don't preach topical sermons to you.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.280]   I've got something to tell you that's worth listening to.
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:46.600]   Topical sermons, what value are they?
[00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:51.440]   My comments upon the news, my comments on politics, what's the value of them?
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:54.120]   Everything goes around in the same old miserable failure.
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:58.840]   I'm here to tell you something that only this gospel can tell you, that the almighty and
[00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:02.040]   everlasting God is concerned about this.
[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:06.680]   It's his world, and he's going to put it right.
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:09.040]   And he's putting it right in his own way.
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:14.760]   He's concerned about our deliverance and about our redemption.
[00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:21.000]   The plan and the purpose of God, him being delivered by the predeterminate counsel and
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:31.040]   foreknowledge of God, you have taken and by wicked hands have crucified and have killed.
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:33.640]   But you didn't know what you were doing.
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:38.720]   You didn't realize that this was a part of God's great and eternal plan and purpose
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:40.660]   of salvation and of redemption.
[00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:43.880]   You see, the cross is the center of God's plan.
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:47.040]   It's the center of God's way of saving the world.
[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:51.160]   That's why the apostle puts it again to the Corinthians in that first epistle, in the
[00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:56.880]   first chapter, which I read last Sunday night, "We preach Christ crucified unto the Jews
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:59.840]   a stumbling block and unto the Greeks foolishness.
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:06.720]   But unto us which are saved, Christ, the power of God and the wisdom of God, here it is in
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:09.120]   its essence, this cross of Christ.
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:14.680]   It's the very center and heart of God's eternal plan and purpose."
[00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:21.120]   So I want to put it to you like this this evening, that the apostle gloried in the cross
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:29.000]   and every true Christian glories in it because it is the greatest display and exposition
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:34.480]   of the character of the everlasting God.
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:37.480]   That's what you see when you survey this cross.
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:41.000]   You don't merely see that glorious person, you look behind it.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.620]   It isn't only the Son that's involved in the cross, the Father is involved, He's there.
[00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:49.520]   Have you ever seen Him there?
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:53.640]   Is there anything higher or more wonderful than to see something of the glory of the
[00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:57.720]   everlasting God?
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:00.720]   It's on the cross on Calvary's Hill.
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:07.280]   You see its most wonderful and amazing display that the world has ever known.
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:14.640]   My dear friends, all our troubles ultimately emanate from the fact of our ignorance of
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:18.080]   God.
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:22.600]   That's the real trouble in the world tonight, men and women don't know God.
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:24.520]   There are some who say they're not interested.
[00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:29.940]   There are others who are equally bad, who simply put up their own ideas of God.
[00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:35.360]   These men who speculate philosophically about God, these are the popular writers of today.
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:39.640]   God is depth, not up there, not out of depth, and so on.
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:44.040]   That's sheer speculation, they've got no authority whatsoever.
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:49.200]   It is simply what they think, that is sheer ignorance of God.
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:54.600]   No, no, we cannot know God unless He reveals Himself to us.
[00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:55.600]   Why?
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:27:02.840]   Because God is, oh and what He is, what do we know, do we know ourselves?
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:06.260]   Does your psychology really explain you to yourself?
[00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:09.820]   Does all your modern knowledge really help you to know yourself and your neighbor?
[00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:12.500]   Does it really give you an understanding of life and of death?
[00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:14.020]   Of course it doesn't.
[00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:19.700]   Our ignorance is appalling and the more we learn, the more we see our own ignorance.
[00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:30.820]   How can a man know God, immortal, invisible, God only wise, in light, inaccessible, hid
[00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:33.620]   from our eyes?
[00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:38.460]   What's the use of your jodrell bank when you're looking into infinity and eternity?
[00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:46.780]   No, no, send up your astronauts, let them look with all the power that they can commend.
[00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:57.220]   They cannot possibly see Him in light, ineffable, immortal, invisible, God only wise, in light,
[00:27:57.220 --> 00:28:03.800]   inaccessible, hid from our eyes, most blessed, most glorious, the ancient of days, pavilioned
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:06.920]   in splendor and girded with praise.
[00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:07.920]   Do you think you can see?
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:10.620]   Of course you can't.
[00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:17.460]   We are incapacitated at the very beginning before we make any attempt.
[00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:19.700]   We see parts and portions.
[00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:22.460]   In creation you can see something of Him.
[00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:26.600]   As the apostle puts it in the first chapter of the epistle to the Romans, by examining
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:32.300]   nature and creation you can see something of His eternal power and Godhead, His creatorhood,
[00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:33.300]   as it were.
[00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:38.620]   You see the marks of His fingers and you know that God, as Sir James Jeans put it, is the
[00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:44.500]   great scientist, the mastermind and mathematician.
[00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:51.020]   You see it in the symmetry and the balance and all the form and the perfection.
[00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:56.020]   You see it in the seasons, we've been singing that harvest hymn, and in the seasons you
[00:28:56.020 --> 00:29:01.440]   can see Him, spring, summer, autumn, winter, and His gifts to men and all His kindness
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:02.440]   and goodness.
[00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:07.260]   Yes, but you see, you only see a part of it, you only see God's power, God's greatness,
[00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:09.620]   God the creator.
[00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:15.180]   And then you can see something of this in history.
[00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:18.900]   Read the history of the nations and especially the Jews, you see something of the hand of
[00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:21.460]   God as the Lord of history.
[00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:26.960]   And then you see it also in providence, in His providential dealings with us.
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:30.520]   But you see, when you've seen it all, you've seen so little about God.
[00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:34.180]   You see that there's great power, there's great ability, there's great order, but
[00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:40.300]   oh, you don't know God as Father, you don't know God in His heart, you don't know God
[00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:42.500]   in all the glory of His fullness.
[00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:48.300]   Oh, John has put it, I think, perfectly to us in the prologue of his Gospel when he says,
[00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:52.700]   "No man hath seen God at any time.
[00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:58.420]   The only begotten who is in the bosom of the Father, He hath declared Him.
[00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:00.740]   No man hath seen God.
[00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:06.260]   No man can see God and live, God being what He is, it's impossible.
[00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:07.260]   And what do we know?
[00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:09.140]   We can know nothing except to be revealed."
[00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:12.940]   And this is the message of this Gospel, that God in His infinite grace and kindness has
[00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:19.020]   revealed Himself, not only in nature and creation, not only in providence, not only in history,
[00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:27.980]   but oh, beyond it all, in His Son, who came from the eternal bosom to teach us about Him
[00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:37.740]   and to tell us about Him and supremely, on the cross on Calvary's hill.
[00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:40.980]   That is why it's so glorious.
[00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:41.980]   Everything is leading up to this.
[00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:47.860]   There are hints and suggestions, but here it bursts upon us in all the blaze of everlasting
[00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:55.140]   glory, God really revealing His heart to us.
[00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:59.620]   Now our Lord again Himself had said that this was the case.
[00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:08.260]   He put it like this, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
[00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:16.860]   No man cometh unto the Father," which means no man can come unto the Father, "but by
[00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:17.860]   me."
[00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:30.820]   Yes, God the Creator, God the Almighty, God the controller of history, but God as Father,
[00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:41.220]   you'll never know Him except by Jesus Christ and in particular by His death upon the cross
[00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:43.140]   on Calvary's hill.
[00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:47.660]   If you want to know God, if you want to know the everlasting and eternal God, this is the
[00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:48.660]   way.
[00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:49.660]   This is the only way.
[00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:50.660]   Look there.
[00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:57.420]   Gaze, meditate, survey the wondrous cross, and then you'll see something of Him.
[00:31:57.420 --> 00:31:58.420]   What do you see?
[00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:02.840]   Well, let me but summarize it for you.
[00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:05.980]   The first thing you will see is the grace of God.
[00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:06.980]   What's grace?
[00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:09.540]   Now it's a great word in the Bible, isn't it?
[00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:12.780]   The word grace, the grace of God.
[00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:13.780]   What is grace?
[00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:18.380]   Grace is most simply defined in these words.
[00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:25.820]   It is favor shown to people who don't deserve any favor at all, that's grace.
[00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:31.360]   And you know this message is that any one of us is saved and put right for eternity
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:38.860]   solely and entirely by the grace of God.
[00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:45.740]   Everything in ourselves, by grace are we saved through faith, and that not of yourselves.
[00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:48.300]   It is the gift of God.
[00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:51.540]   My friend, isn't it about time we all admitted it?
[00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:54.540]   Do what you like, you'll never save yourself.
[00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:57.340]   You'll never save yourself from the world, the flesh, the devil.
[00:32:57.340 --> 00:32:59.460]   You'll never save yourself from your own misery.
[00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:03.300]   You'll still less save yourself from the law of God and judgment and hell.
[00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:04.300]   You can't do it.
[00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:05.300]   Try.
[00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:06.300]   Men have tried it throughout the centuries.
[00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:07.940]   They've all admitted failure.
[00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:12.020]   But the labors of my hands can fulfill thy laws demands.
[00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:13.020]   Could my zeal?
[00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:14.020]   No, respite no.
[00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:15.780]   Could my tears forever flow?
[00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:20.660]   All for sin could not atone.
[00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:24.540]   And the best and the most honest souls the world has ever known have been the ones who've
[00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:29.500]   tried that route most assiduously and have been most ready at the end to confess their
[00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:30.500]   failure.
[00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:33.480]   No, no, there is only one hope for us tonight.
[00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:37.500]   It is the grace of God, which means.
[00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:47.900]   That in spite of our being what we are, God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten
[00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:49.300]   son.
[00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:51.620]   He did it in spite of us.
[00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:53.220]   We deserve nothing but hell.
[00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:55.700]   None of us tonight deserves anything but hell.
[00:33:55.700 --> 00:34:00.860]   If you think you deserve heaven, take it from me, you're not a Christian.
[00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:05.180]   Now that's a very good definition of a Christian.
[00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:11.540]   Any man who thinks that he deserves heaven is not a Christian.
[00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:19.300]   But any man who knows that he deserves hell is a Christian.
[00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:24.700]   Out goes all your righteousness, it's all by grace and entirely the mercy and the compassion
[00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:26.700]   and the grace of God.
[00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:33.980]   My friends, it is God who in spite of us, in spite of the world being what it is, sent
[00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:42.260]   his own son into this world and then sent him to the cross by the predeterminate counsel
[00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:47.140]   and for knowledge of God, he went to the cross.
[00:34:47.140 --> 00:34:48.140]   Why?
[00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:51.300]   Now, here's the question.
[00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:52.300]   Why?
[00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:55.460]   You say, "All right, I like this idea of grace.
[00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:59.520]   I'm glad to hear you saying that God still loves us in spite of all our unworthiness
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:00.520]   and sinfulness."
[00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:01.520]   That's wonderful.
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:02.900]   But why the cross then?
[00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:05.380]   Why doesn't God in his love just forgive us?
[00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:06.380]   Why?
[00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:11.940]   Look again at the cross, my friend, take another survey, examine it again with greater depth
[00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:17.140]   and profundity, and having seen the grace and the mercy and the compassion and the kindness
[00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:23.020]   of God, look again and this is what you'll see.
[00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:34.140]   You'll see the righteousness of God, you'll see the justice of God, you'll see the holiness
[00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:41.420]   of God, and it's the place of all places in the universe where these attributes of
[00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:44.980]   God can be seen most plainly.
[00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:49.420]   God has revealed something of his righteousness and his justice and his holiness in the law
[00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:54.300]   that he gave to the children of Israel.
[00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:57.260]   The Ten Commandments proclaim the righteousness and the justice and the holiness of God, oh
[00:35:57.260 --> 00:36:01.500]   yes, and his punishments of the children of Israel, they display the same thing.
[00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:06.820]   But if you really want to know anything about righteousness and justice and utter absolute
[00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:14.420]   holiness, you'll have to survey the wondrous cross and there you'll see it.
[00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:21.300]   For what the cross tells us is this, that God hates sin.
[00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:23.360]   God hates it.
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:26.620]   God is the eternal antithesis to sin.
[00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:31.700]   God abominates sin with the whole intensity of his divine and perfect and holy nature.
[00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:35.380]   God not only hates sin, God can't tolerate sin.
[00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:39.020]   God cannot compromise with sin, that's what we want of course.
[00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:41.100]   We want God to compromise with sin.
[00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:44.540]   We want a God who says, "All right, I know you've done this or that, but it's all right,
[00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:45.540]   slip into heaven."
[00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:47.100]   You know, God can't do that.
[00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:48.100]   God can't compromise.
[00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:52.580]   There is no compromise between light and darkness, good and evil, they're eternal opposites.
[00:36:52.580 --> 00:37:01.220]   And God, because he's God, he revolts against sin, he hates it, he abominates it.
[00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:05.380]   And God must punish sin.
[00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:10.240]   That is what the Bible means when it tells us that the wrath of God is against all sin
[00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:11.240]   and unrighteousness.
[00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:18.260]   "The wrath of God," says the Apostle Paul to the Romans, "is revealed from heaven against
[00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:28.780]   all ungodliness and all unrighteousness of men that hold down these things in ungodliness,
[00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:32.640]   hold down the truth in unrighteousness."
[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:35.420]   My friend, God is so holy, who can imagine this?
[00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:39.940]   We are so imperfect, we are so impure, our minds are so polluted, you and I can't think
[00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:43.700]   of absolute purity, absolute righteousness, absolute holiness.
[00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:49.780]   We may talk about these things, but we can't imagine them, but God is all that.
[00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:52.940]   And because he's all that, he can have no dealings with sin.
[00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:54.180]   And he's told us that.
[00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:57.380]   He has said that he will punish sin, that he must punish sin.
[00:37:57.380 --> 00:37:58.380]   Why?
[00:37:58.380 --> 00:37:59.380]   Well, because sin is what it is.
[00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:01.500]   It is rebellion against God.
[00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:05.440]   Don't think of sin merely in terms of actions, that's what we're all telling to do at the
[00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:06.440]   present time.
[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:12.060]   The newspapers are placarding certain actions in their mock self-righteousness.
[00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:14.320]   But that isn't what is meant by sin.
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:17.820]   Sin is not merely a matter of actions, sin is a matter of attitude.
[00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:23.460]   And what makes sin sin is this, is that it is rebellion against God, it is disobedience
[00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:29.040]   of God, it is trampling upon the sanctities of God, it is unrighteousness, it is transgression
[00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:34.680]   of God's law, indeed it's worse, it is a hatred of God.
[00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:39.820]   The natural mind is not merely a mind that makes a man do things that he shouldn't do.
[00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:49.020]   The natural mind is enmity against God, is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed
[00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:51.340]   can be, that's it.
[00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:57.060]   And it is because man in sin is such that he regards even the gospel as foolishness.
[00:38:57.060 --> 00:39:02.100]   The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness
[00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:08.960]   unto him, neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.
[00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:13.620]   This is sin, this is the trouble with men, that he's so steeped in sin and so perverted
[00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:18.660]   by it, that when God does the most glorious thing even God can do, the natural man laughs
[00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:23.260]   at it as foolishness and dismisses it with derision.
[00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:27.540]   That's why God hates sin, it's because it hates him.
[00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:32.620]   It is enmity against God, is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.
[00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:39.620]   Now then, the cross tells us that, because you see it's because of that the cross is
[00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:40.620]   necessary.
[00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:49.700]   Here is the problem, how can such a God possibly forgive any man?
[00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:55.700]   How can there be any hope of heaven for any one of us, for we've all sinned?
[00:39:55.700 --> 00:40:01.540]   We are all by nature the children of wrath, says Paul to the Ephesians, even as others.
[00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:06.500]   We are all naturally God-haters, and if you haven't realized that, you haven't known
[00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:10.020]   these things very deeply, my friend, don't come and tell me, "You know, I've always
[00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:11.020]   loved God."
[00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:12.020]   You haven't.
[00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:16.020]   You were born in sin, shapen in iniquity, and if you think you've always believed in
[00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:21.600]   God, it's because you've had a God of your own creation, not the God of the Bible.
[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:28.340]   This is a universal statement, and so here's the problem.
[00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:36.900]   How can this holy righteous God possibly forgive anybody at all, and remain what he is?
[00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:41.240]   And what I see in the cross is this, God's way of solving the problem.
[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:44.940]   So I see the wisdom of God.
[00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:48.220]   If you want to know anything about the wisdom of God, look at the cross.
[00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:53.580]   Here is God's solution to the problem that he saw before he created the world, that man
[00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:56.380]   was going to sin, and yet God wants to forgive him.
[00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:57.380]   How can he?
[00:40:57.380 --> 00:41:02.820]   God, in his eternal wisdom, thought out the way and the plan.
[00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:13.020]   O loving wisdom of our God, when all was sin and shame, a second Adam to the fight, end
[00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:15.980]   to the conflict came.
[00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:19.940]   You know if you want to know anything about the eternal wisdom of God, look at the cross.
[00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:23.220]   That's why Paul says it is the wisdom of God, and the power of God.
[00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:27.540]   There you see the mind of the eternal, solving the eternal problem.
[00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:32.540]   How can God be just, and at the same time, forgive anybody?
[00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:41.780]   How can he bring these things together, righteousness and mercy, holiness and love, is it possible?
[00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:44.820]   And the answer is on the cross.
[00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:47.380]   And what you see there is eternal wisdom.
[00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:49.580]   This is why Paul glories in the cross.
[00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:52.020]   He's seen things there that he'd never seen anywhere else.
[00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:55.540]   He was a wonderful Pharisee, he was a very good man, a moral religious man, he studied
[00:41:55.540 --> 00:42:00.260]   the scriptures, he thought he knew all about God, but here he discovers he knows nothing.
[00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:02.500]   All his knowledge has become nothing to him.
[00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:11.140]   It's here he sees the wisdom of God, providing, making a way whereby God can remain God and
[00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:14.380]   yet forgive a sinner.
[00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:19.180]   So I see there the wisdom of God, as well as the grace of God and the purpose of God,
[00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:25.020]   and the mercy and the compassion of God, but I see another thing.
[00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:37.120]   I see the immutability of God, which means that God doesn't change and cannot change.
[00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:41.260]   You see the God of these moderns is a God not worth worshipping.
[00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:44.660]   He's a God who changes and accommodates and you never know what he's going to do next.
[00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:49.140]   He changes every century according to the scientific knowledge and philosophical speculation.
[00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:50.140]   That's not God.
[00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:54.660]   God, said the Fathers of the Bible, says he is immutable, he's unchangeable.
[00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:57.780]   He doesn't change, he cannot change, he cannot deny himself.
[00:42:57.780 --> 00:43:02.940]   He is what he says he is.
[00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:06.580]   And if there is one place in all history and in the whole of the universe where you see
[00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:11.180]   the immutability and the unchangeableness of God, more clearly than anywhere else, it
[00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:12.500]   is on the cross on Calvary's hill.
[00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:13.500]   There is his own Son.
[00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:14.500]   Is he going to change?
[00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:15.500]   Is he going to modify?
[00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:16.500]   No, no.
[00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:22.060]   He says what he is and he does it.
[00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:26.100]   He says that he's going to punish sin.
[00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:30.900]   And when even his own Son makes himself our representative as sinners, he carries out
[00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:31.900]   his word.
[00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:32.900]   He doesn't modify it.
[00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:38.300]   Even though it's his own Son, the immutability of God and the absolute perfection of all
[00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:43.300]   his ways.
[00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:50.620]   But that leads me to the last thing, the most wonderful thing of all, which is the love
[00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:54.340]   of God to us.
[00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:58.300]   It's not surprising that this apostle should say to the Romans, "God commendeth his love
[00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:05.820]   toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."
[00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:09.020]   How do you see the love of God on the cross on Calvary's hill?
[00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:18.020]   "Oh," says the modern man, "I see it in this way, that though men murdered the Son
[00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:23.300]   of God, rejected him and murdered him, God in his love still says, 'All right, I still
[00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:28.140]   forgive you, though you've done that to my son, I still forgive you.'"
[00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:33.460]   All right, my friends, that's a part of it, but you know it's the smallest part of it.
[00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:35.940]   That's not the real love of God.
[00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:41.900]   I have reminded you already that God wasn't a passive spectator of the death of his Son.
[00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:46.980]   That's how the moderns put it, that God looked on in heaven, down upon it all, he saw men
[00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:50.820]   killing his own son, and he says, "All right, I'll still forgive you."
[00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:56.380]   But God was passive, God was inactive, God was responding passively to what men did.
[00:44:56.380 --> 00:44:59.380]   Oh, how important we think we are.
[00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:04.760]   You know it isn't we who did that, it's God, the predetermined counsel and foreknowledge
[00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:07.820]   of God.
[00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:13.980]   If you really want to know what the love of God means, listen to this.
[00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:19.060]   What the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son
[00:45:19.060 --> 00:45:28.100]   in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh.
[00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:34.380]   God condemned sin in the flesh of his own Son.
[00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:37.140]   This is the love of God.
[00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:41.660]   That's why I read to you that 53rd of Isaiah at the beginning, that wonderful prophecy
[00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:43.540]   of what happened on Calvary's hill.
[00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:46.820]   You notice how he goes on repeating it?
[00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:54.540]   "Surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows, yet we did esteem him stricken,
[00:45:54.540 --> 00:46:00.640]   smitten of God, and afflicted.
[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:06.020]   It pleased the Lord to bruise him; he hath put him to grief."
[00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:13.260]   These are the terms, and they are nothing but a plain, simple, accurate, factual description
[00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:16.500]   of what happened on that cross on Calvary's hill.
[00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:24.380]   Listen to Paul summing it all up, "He, God, hath made him the Son to be sin for us."
[00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:26.740]   Do you realize what I'm saying?
[00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:30.780]   Men and women, this is the whole trouble of the world, it's damned in its blindness.
[00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:39.980]   God hath made his own Son to be sin for us, though he knew no sin, in order that he might
[00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:48.060]   be able to forgive us, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.
[00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:49.060]   What does it mean?
[00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:55.180]   Well, let me give you another quotation from this apostle Paul, who so glories in the cross,
[00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:58.940]   and this is why he glories.
[00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:10.460]   In Romans 8, verse 32, he puts it in these words, "He, God, that spared not his own
[00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:16.620]   Son, but delivered him up for us all."
[00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:21.220]   Oh, that's a wonderful description of what happened on the cross.
[00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:28.900]   "God, in his great love to us, delivered up his only begotten dearly beloved Son,
[00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:32.260]   who had never disobeyed him and had never done any harm to anybody.
[00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:38.180]   He delivered him up for us to the death of the cross."
[00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:41.420]   But do you notice what he adds?
[00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:47.620]   "He that spared not his own Son."
[00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:48.620]   What does he mean by that?
[00:47:48.620 --> 00:47:49.620]   He means this.
[00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:57.540]   "God had made it very plain and clear that he was going to punish sin by pouring out
[00:47:57.540 --> 00:48:02.700]   upon sinners the vials of his wrath."
[00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:06.140]   He was going to punish sin in this way, that men should die.
[00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:11.940]   The wages of sin is death, and God pours out his wrath upon sin, and it means death and
[00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:17.060]   destruction endlessly.
[00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:24.260]   And what we are told there by the apostle is this, that after he had laid our sins upon
[00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:32.420]   his own Son on that cross on Calvary's Hill, he didn't spare him any of the punishment.
[00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:35.380]   He didn't say, "Because he's my Son, I'll modify the punishment.
[00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:36.620]   I'll hold a little bit back.
[00:48:36.620 --> 00:48:38.300]   I can't do that to my own Son.
[00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:39.860]   I can't regard him as a sinner.
[00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:40.860]   I can't smite him.
[00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:41.860]   I can't strike him."
[00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:42.860]   He didn't say that.
[00:48:42.860 --> 00:48:45.140]   "He did everything," he said he'd do.
[00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:46.420]   He didn't keep anything back.
[00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:50.420]   He spared not his own Son, though he's his own dearly beloved Son.
[00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:51.540]   He keeps nothing back.
[00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:58.780]   He pours out all his divine wrath upon sin, upon his own dearly beloved Son.
[00:48:58.780 --> 00:49:04.100]   So you see the Son crying out in his agony, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken
[00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:05.100]   me?"
[00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:09.580]   And he literally died of a broken heart, so that when they struck him in the spear, out
[00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:11.300]   came water and blood.
[00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:16.340]   The heart had burst, and the blood had clotted, and there it was, serum and blood clot, because
[00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:22.420]   his heart was literally ruptured by the agony of the wrath of God upon him, and the separation
[00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:27.260]   from the face of his Father.
[00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:31.180]   That's the love of God.
[00:49:31.180 --> 00:49:35.500]   That's the love of God to you, my friend, a sinner.
[00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:38.820]   Not that he looks on passively and says, "I forgive you, though you've done this
[00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:39.820]   to my Son."
[00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:44.180]   No, no, he does that to the Son himself.
[00:49:44.180 --> 00:49:47.860]   He does to the Son what you and I could never do to the Son.
[00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:55.620]   He pours out his eternal wrath upon him, and hides his face from him, his own dearly beloved,
[00:49:55.620 --> 00:49:58.580]   only begotten Son.
[00:49:58.580 --> 00:50:05.960]   And he did it in order that you should not receive that punishment and go to hell and
[00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:13.540]   spend an eternity in the misery, the torment, and the unhappiness of hell.
[00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:18.140]   That's the love of God, and that's the wonder and the marvel and the glory of the
[00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:19.140]   cross.
[00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:27.860]   God doing that to his own Son in order that he might not have to do it to you and to me.
[00:50:27.860 --> 00:50:32.900]   And in order that the message of the cross might be preached, which is this, "Believe
[00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:38.060]   on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved.
[00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:43.940]   Believe that he died your death, bore your punishment, suffered in your place, that the
[00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:47.380]   chastisement of your peace was upon him.
[00:50:47.380 --> 00:50:52.340]   Believe that, and you are immediately forgiven."
[00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:55.860]   That's the glory of the cross.
[00:50:55.860 --> 00:51:03.740]   God's wisdom devising the way, God's love carrying it out, even though it means that,
[00:51:03.740 --> 00:51:11.020]   and the Son willingly and readily submitting himself to it in order that you and I might
[00:51:11.020 --> 00:51:16.400]   be forgiven and might become the children of God.
[00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:24.140]   Oh, when I survey the wondrous cross on which the Prince of Glory died, was put to death
[00:51:24.140 --> 00:51:30.740]   by his own father, my riches gained, I count but loss and poor contempt and all my pride.
[00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:36.740]   All my self-righteousness, all the nonsense, then I see these things, God the Eternal in
[00:51:36.740 --> 00:51:43.660]   all the glory of his Father's heart, giving his own Son up to such a death for me.
[00:51:43.660 --> 00:51:50.340]   And indeed I therefore see in that cross the harmony of all the divine attributes.
[00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:52.660]   I see holiness and love.
[00:51:52.660 --> 00:51:58.700]   I see mercy and truth met together, righteousness and peace have kissed each other.
[00:51:58.700 --> 00:52:06.020]   I see all the eternal attributes of the everlasting God, all of them displaying themselves at
[00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:07.300]   the same time.
[00:52:07.300 --> 00:52:11.980]   No contradiction between the righteousness, the justice, and the love and the mercy and
[00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:21.380]   the compassion, they're all there, and they're all there in the plenitude of the Godhead.
[00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:26.940]   There's only one thing to say when you've seen things like that.
[00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:44.740]   And it is this, God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:52:44.740 --> 00:53:00.700]   It is there I know God as he is and as my Father, and I see his glorious character vindicated
[00:53:00.700 --> 00:53:05.180]   to the last iota, and therefore I trust my soul to him.
[00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:15.820]   I rest upon his word, the unchanging, everlasting God.
[00:53:15.820 --> 00:53:21.940]   Do you react like that to the cross, my friend?
[00:53:21.940 --> 00:53:33.180]   Have you seen these things in the cross, the Son, the Father, and the Holy Ghost sustaining
[00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:34.740]   the Son?
[00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:44.820]   He offered himself through the eternal Spirit on our behalf to God.
[00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:50.660]   Oh yes, this is what decides whether you're a Christian or not.
[00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:52.820]   Don't tell me about your good works, I'm not interested.
[00:53:52.820 --> 00:53:56.340]   Don't tell me you're a church member, I'm not a bit interested.
[00:53:56.340 --> 00:53:58.700]   Are you glorying in this?
[00:53:58.700 --> 00:54:00.980]   Is this everything to you?
[00:54:00.980 --> 00:54:03.380]   Is this life to you?
[00:54:03.380 --> 00:54:09.140]   Are you ready to die rather than deny this glorious message?
[00:54:09.140 --> 00:54:12.420]   That's what a Christian is.
[00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:17.140]   And unless we glory in the cross, we haven't seen it.
[00:54:17.140 --> 00:54:20.020]   And if we haven't seen it, we don't really believe it.
[00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:23.520]   And if we don't believe it, we are yet in our sins.
[00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:30.700]   And should we die like that, we will go to judgment and we will go to hell, my friend.
[00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:39.180]   Your eternal, everlasting destiny depends upon this one thing.
[00:54:39.180 --> 00:54:47.780]   Have you seen that God there has provided the only way whereby you can be forgiven and
[00:54:47.780 --> 00:54:54.700]   become a child of God and go on to inherit the glories of eternal bliss?
[00:54:54.700 --> 00:55:07.500]   May God have mercy upon all and by his Spirit open our eyes to see the glory of the cross.
[00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:10.820]   Amen.
[00:55:10.820 --> 00:55:15.300]   The closing hymn is hymn number 69, the 69th hymn.
[00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:32.500]   O love of God, how strong and true, eternal and yet ever new, hymn number 69.
[00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:53.740]   O love of God, how strong and true, eternal and yet ever new,
[00:55:53.740 --> 00:56:11.620]   hymn number 69, the 69th hymn.
[00:56:11.620 --> 00:56:23.100]   O love of God, how strong and true, eternal and yet ever new,
[00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:27.060]   hymn number 69, the 69th hymn.
[00:56:27.060 --> 00:56:34.540]   O love of God, how strong and true, eternal and yet ever new,
[00:56:34.540 --> 00:56:45.380]   hymn number 69, the 69th hymn.
[00:56:45.380 --> 00:56:52.940]   O love of God, how strong and true, eternal and yet ever new,
[00:56:52.940 --> 00:57:01.260]   hymn number 69, the 69th hymn.
[00:57:01.260 --> 00:57:19.020]   May we be filled with hope in Jesus Christ our Savior Lord.
[00:57:19.020 --> 00:57:34.620]   May we be blessed in His beauty forevermore through all our days.
[00:57:34.620 --> 00:57:52.140]   May we be blessed in His beauty forevermore through all our days.
[00:57:52.140 --> 00:58:06.060]   Amen.
[00:58:06.060 --> 00:58:09.980]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
