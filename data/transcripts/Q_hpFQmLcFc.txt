[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.080]   May grace and peace be multiplied to each of you this afternoon in the knowledge of
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.200]   God and of Jesus our Lord.
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:18.320]   Again, what a blessing, privilege, and joy it is for us to be together for this Shepherd's
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.680]   Conference.
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.680]   Let me publicly thank Dr. MacArthur for the invitation to open up God's Word with you.
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.600]   Let's begin with a word of prayer.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.820]   God, thank you for the blessings of this day, for all that we have already experienced and
[00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.140]   encountered under the teaching of your Word and in the fellowship of the saints.
[00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:44.640]   We pray again that you would renew our strength, focus our attention, and ready our hearts
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.040]   to receive with gentleness the implanted Word that is able to save our souls.
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:57.840]   I pray that you would open our eyes that we may behold wonderful things from your Word.
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:06.200]   Give us understanding and we will keep your Word and observe it with our whole hearts.
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:12.120]   Grant me physical strength and spiritual energy to speak your Word with faithfulness and clarity
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:21.160]   and liberty, guide my thoughts, guard my heart, govern my words so that everything I say would
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.200]   be consistent with sound doctrine, and as the seed of the Word is planted and watered,
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.920]   we know that only you can give the increase.
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.240]   So we reserve for you the highest praise and full credit for the fruit that shall come
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.360]   from this time, in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:46.400]   Would you take your copy of God's Word and be turning with me to Colossians chapter 4?
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:56.160]   My assignment this hour is to address the subject that truth triumphs through believing
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.280]   prayer.
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:10.940]   And I want to press that case by meditating with you on two verses in Colossians chapter
[00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.340]   4.
[00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.980]   I want to spend our entire time there.
[00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:34.020]   Colossians 4 verses 12 and 13, "Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ Jesus
[00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:42.940]   greets you, always struggling on your behalf in his prayers, that you may stand mature
[00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.420]   and fully assured in all the will of God.
[00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:55.780]   For I bear him witness that he has worked hard for you and for those in Laodicea and
[00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:56.780]   in Herapolis."
[00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.420]   Amen.
[00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:17.100]   Before electricity, there were pump organs, where literally air would be pumped into the
[00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.540]   organ to bring forth the sound of music.
[00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:32.180]   One occasion, a famous musician performed a sold-out concert on one of these pump organs.
[00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:38.500]   Backstage after the concert, he bumped into the young man who had been pumping the organ
[00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:47.540]   from behind as he played, and the young man said, "We had a great show tonight, didn't
[00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:53.260]   we?
[00:03:53.260 --> 00:04:00.580]   We did not have anything," barked the offended maestro.
[00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:08.060]   "I had a great show tonight."
[00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:20.940]   The next night, the maestro strolled on stage, sat at the organ, and began to play.
[00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.660]   Nothing happened.
[00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:31.060]   He kept tickling the keys, expecting that at any moment the sound of music would spew
[00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.340]   forth to no avail.
[00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:44.220]   Angrily, he got up from the organ and walked around to the back and screamed, "What's going
[00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.100]   on back here?"
[00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:59.220]   The young man said, "It looks like you are not having a good show tonight."
[00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:04.140]   That musician's arrogant disposition was not the attitude of the Apostle Paul.
[00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:11.060]   It should not be the attitude of any man of God.
[00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:18.020]   The Apostle Paul was the apostle to the Gentiles, the gospel globetrotter, the writer of half
[00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:28.980]   of the New Testament, but Paul did not have a one-man show philosophy of ministry.
[00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:37.980]   Paul had many friends in the faith who partnered with him to proclaim the gospel, defend the
[00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.940]   truth, and build up the church.
[00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:46.780]   I've got to work hard not to get stuck there.
[00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:52.460]   Let me pause to double-click that for you as I move on.
[00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:58.340]   Brothers, you need friends in the faith.
[00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:05.100]   There are many pastors who are falling away, yes, unfortunately, because of moral failure
[00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:11.020]   and financial impropriety and doctrinal compromise, but there are a lot of pastors who are on
[00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:16.980]   the verge of giving up because they feel like they are all by themselves.
[00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:21.460]   One of the blessings of our times together this week, friends, is not just the great
[00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:31.020]   preaching and the wonderful singing and the free books, but it's to be gathered with kindred
[00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:35.780]   spirits who are pressing on in the truth.
[00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:42.460]   Friend, go home knowing you are not in this battle by yourself.
[00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:48.780]   You need to cultivate friends in the faith.
[00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:57.060]   Ecclesiastes says it well, verses 9 through 12, and I'll move on, "Two are better than
[00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:00.860]   one, because they have a good reward for their toil.
[00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:05.540]   For if they fall, one will lift up his fellow.
[00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:11.260]   But woe to him who is alone when he falls and has not another to lift him up.
[00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:16.900]   Again, if two lie together, they keep warm, but how can one keep warm alone?
[00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:22.980]   And though a man might prevail against one who is alone, two will withstand him.
[00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:27.300]   A threefold cord is not quickly broken."
[00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:35.860]   Paul had friends in the faith, and on many occasions he ends his letters by giving a
[00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:42.680]   shout-out to these ministerial colleagues.
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:49.100]   This is what you find in these final greetings of Paul's letter to the Colossians.
[00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:54.460]   In verses 7 through 18, there are some 11 people that Paul mentions by name.
[00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:57.580]   This extended list falls into two categories.
[00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:05.660]   Verses 7 through 11 mention his Jewish partners, verses 12 through 17 mention his Gentile partners.
[00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:13.980]   And the list itself affirms for us Colossians chapter 3, verse 11, "Here there is not Greek
[00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:24.060]   and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, scythian, slave, or free, but Christ is all
[00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:29.940]   and in all."
[00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:40.700]   This list of diverse ministerial colleagues teaches us that Paul was not caught up in
[00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:46.060]   cliques and tribes and sects in the church.
[00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:53.780]   Jew or Gentile was all the same to Paul as long as Christ was exalted.
[00:08:53.780 --> 00:09:01.820]   And so we find here a reminder that what we have in Jesus is infinitely greater, brothers,
[00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:06.100]   than those secondary differences that would pull us apart.
[00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:12.300]   Paul here gives his list of ministerial colleagues a shout-out, and of all of the names he mentions,
[00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:18.980]   the one that stands out in this list is Epaphras.
[00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:24.620]   I am tempted to call Epaphras a major player in a minor role, but to describe him that
[00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:32.100]   way would be to dishonor his life and labor and legacy.
[00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:36.880]   Sure he may be a minor player in the sense that Epaphras is only mentioned three times
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:42.220]   in five verses in the New Testament.
[00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:47.460]   But what we find in those limited references is of great impact and import, and without
[00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:54.980]   trying to hold the suspense, what is featured here about Epaphras is simply that he was
[00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:59.740]   a man of prayer.
[00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:05.220]   The Edmund Hebert comments, "Epaphras holds the unique distinction among all the friends
[00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:15.540]   and co-workers of Paul of being the only one whom Paul explicitly commends for his intensive
[00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:20.740]   prayer ministry."
[00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:26.460]   This does not suggest that all Epaphras did was pray, and it did not suggest that Paul's
[00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:38.200]   other colleagues did not pray, but Epaphras stood out in his devotion to believing prayer.
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:44.460]   He was a warrior at prayer, a champion of prayer.
[00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:48.780]   Go up to Colossians chapter 4 verse 2, "And all of the saints are exhorted to continue
[00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:55.460]   steadfastly in prayer, being watchful in it in all thanksgiving."
[00:10:55.460 --> 00:11:07.420]   Now in verses 12 and 13, we see that Epaphras exemplified and embodied this call to prayer.
[00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:15.260]   From what we can gather from the background, Epaphras traveled some 1,000 miles from Colossae
[00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:20.820]   to Rome to visit the Apostle Paul, who was under house arrest in Rome.
[00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:29.620]   And we do not know if Epaphras and the Colossians were ever reunited, but as Paul wrote this
[00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:39.220]   letter to the Colossians, he wanted the saints to know that Epaphras continued to minister
[00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:44.660]   on their behalf even in his absence.
[00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:53.200]   It was an exemplary ministry of intercessory prayer.
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:57.980]   And so, brothers, I want us to just consider this example of prayer.
[00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:08.700]   Yes, we have been hearing, and we will continue to hear over the course of this conference.
[00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:16.660]   Pastors who believe truth triumphs are fateful preachers.
[00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:22.940]   But I want to add to that conversation that pastors who believe truth triumphs are also
[00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:28.180]   to be prayer warriors.
[00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:31.660]   Refraining prayer, we cease to fight.
[00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:38.020]   Prayer keeps the Christian's armor bright, and Satan trembles when he sees the weakest
[00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:43.300]   saint upon his knees.
[00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:49.380]   Christian soldiers fight on their knees.
[00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:58.620]   And we see that here in the example of Epaphras.
[00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:06.060]   Herbert Lockyer asked, "Can we say that we are the true successors of this devoted servant
[00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:10.260]   of Christ?"
[00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:18.580]   That's the question I want to weigh on us as we consider what Epaphras teaches us about
[00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:22.740]   the triumph of truth through believing prayer.
[00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:28.980]   Let me walk you through these two verses under three headings.
[00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:34.500]   What does Epaphras teach us about intercessory prayer?
[00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:39.580]   I want to begin with the servanthood of Epaphras.
[00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:50.260]   Epaphras is a shortened form of the name Epaphroditus, but we are not to confuse this messenger from
[00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:55.180]   Colossae with that messenger from Philippi.
[00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:59.980]   Epaphras was, as Paul will say in a moment, one of you.
[00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:04.820]   He was a part of the Colossian congregation.
[00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:13.880]   He, as I mentioned, traveled to Rome to get Paul's counsel about doctrinal trouble that
[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:17.540]   has arisen in the church at Colossae.
[00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:21.460]   And he is with Paul when Paul is writing this letter back to the church.
[00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:27.240]   And at some point, he says to Paul, "Please send the church my greetings," and that's
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:30.820]   basically what you have here in verse 12.
[00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:36.260]   Paul is extending greetings to the saints from Epaphras, but what we have here is much
[00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:40.020]   more than that.
[00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:50.520]   Beyond what Paul says to the church from Epaphras is what he says to the church here about Epaphras.
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:59.640]   He affirms Epaphras' devotion to the church and his devotion to Christ.
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:02.600]   Note both of them in this verse.
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:08.320]   On one hand, he says of Epaphras, "He is devoted to the church."
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:14.740]   Epaphras, he describes as "one of you."
[00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:15.740]   What a phrase.
[00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:20.120]   He also describes Onesimus that way in verse 9.
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:24.920]   He is "one of you."
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:31.340]   That is, he is either a native or a resident of Colossae, but he is saying more than that.
[00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:39.340]   He is saying more than the fact that Colossae was his hometown.
[00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:45.880]   This letter is not written, we must remember, to the city of Colossae.
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:53.580]   It is written, chapter 1, verse 2, "To the saints and faithful brothers in Christ at
[00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:54.580]   Colossae."
[00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:58.880]   And by saying that he is "one of you," that is what he means.
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:07.340]   He is saying that Epaphras is a saint in Christ Jesus, and he is a faithful brother in Christ
[00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:11.480]   Jesus.
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:20.360]   What Paul says of the Colossians in chapter 1, verse 4, was also true of Epaphras, that
[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:30.480]   his conversion was demonstrated by his faith in Christ Jesus and his love for all the saints.
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:35.520]   He is "one of you," says Paul.
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:39.160]   He is a part of you.
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:46.560]   And even though he is not present with you, his heart is with you.
[00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:54.360]   He's not there, but what you are facing, what you are enduring, what you are suffering,
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:17:02.120]   he is so joined in heart with you that what you are going through, he is going through,
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:14.720]   which makes it natural and necessary for him to pray for you.
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:19.480]   So let me just stop here and ask, brothers, what's your attitude toward the church God
[00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:24.080]   has called you to serve?
[00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:29.080]   Is there a bond of love and fellowship and faith?
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:36.400]   And you're not just over them in the Lord, you're one of them.
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:40.480]   Remember in Philippians chapter 1, we know Philippians chapter 1, verse 6, where Paul
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:44.680]   says, "I am sure of this, that he who has begun a good work in you will complete it
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:51.760]   at the day of Jesus Christ."
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:18:00.720]   But that highly doctrinal theological truth affected Paul's pastoral attitude toward the
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:01.720]   church.
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:07.480]   In Philippians chapter 1, verses 7 and 8, he goes on to say, "It is only right for me
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:15.480]   to think or feel this way about you, because I hold you in my heart, for you are all partakers
[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:21.760]   of grace with me, both in my imprisonment and my confirmation and defense of the gospel,
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:33.960]   for God is my witness, how I long for you with the affection of Christ Jesus."
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:41.640]   One of my favorite hymns was written by John Fawcett, who is considered one of the great
[00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:45.700]   preachers of his time, but pastor to a very small church, his entire ministry.
[00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:53.280]   He had an opportunity to go somewhere else, he endeavored to go somewhere else.
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:58.080]   He noted in his journal the reason why, he said, "Because my family is growing quicker
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:59.080]   than my salary."
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:14.280]   And he was invited to a major pulpit, but on his final Sunday, he walked down the aisle
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:20.120]   into a waiting carriage, the congregation followed him, and as they said their goodbyes,
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:26.120]   his wife tearfully said, "I can't leave them."
[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:28.720]   And he said, "Neither can I."
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:32.960]   And instead of pulling off, they commanded that the wagons be unloaded, and he stayed
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:38.560]   there the rest of his ministry.
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:47.800]   Historians speculate about what he was thinking, but I think the big clue is that right after,
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:20:05.640]   I believe the next Sunday, he preached from Luke 12, 15, "Be on guard against all covetousness,
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:11.360]   for a man's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions."
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:15.160]   And in that sermon, he read a poem that he had just written for the church, which was
[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:24.920]   later set to music, "Blessed be the ties that bind our hearts in Christian love.
[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:28.480]   The fellowship of kindred minds is likened to that above."
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:35.960]   Epaphras is described here as one of you, expressing his devotion to Christ, but not
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:42.640]   only is there here, Mark, devotion to the church that is, but also devotion to Christ.
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:47.320]   Most likely, Epaphras is the founding pastor of the church at Colossae.
[00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:52.720]   Chapter 1, verse 7 tells us that they heard the word of truth through Epaphras.
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:59.700]   But at some point, false teachers had infiltrated this young congregation, and their heretical
[00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:08.000]   claims rejected the sovereignty, supremacy, and sufficiency of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.740]   whatever exactly this so-called Colossian heresy was.
[00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:21.000]   The danger of it was not that it was being presented to the saints in replacement of
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:27.800]   Christ, but that it was being presented alongside of Christ as if Christ was not enough.
[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:36.280]   Colossians 2, 1, Paul says, "We've never met each other face to face, but this report from
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:44.920]   Epaphras so burdened his heart that he wrote this letter back to them."
[00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:50.480]   And it would be Tychicus who would deliver this letter to the Colossians, not Epaphras.
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:56.880]   Epaphras remained with Paul in Rome.
[00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:00.080]   Why did he remain with Paul in Rome?
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:03.200]   I don't know if he had a choice.
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:11.760]   Philemon 23 says he is a fellow prisoner of Christ.
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:17.480]   Very likely, he took this risk to come to Rome to get Paul's counsel.
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:25.120]   His association with Paul got him in trouble as well.
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:31.000]   And yet it apparently to him was a risk worth taking, because Paul says, "This Epaphras,
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:36.400]   who is one of you, is also a servant of Christ Jesus."
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:39.560]   He is a slave of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:52.920]   He is a bond servant who belongs to his master and is compelled to obey his master.
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:23:01.800]   And here the term is used to describe Epaphras' willing submission, total commitment and joyful
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:07.240]   obedience to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:13.480]   And so what Paul will say about Epaphras' incessant prayer was not a commitment to prayer,
[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:25.780]   it was a commitment to Christ that expressed itself in a commitment to his church, which
[00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:30.400]   demonstrated itself to a commitment to prayer.
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:39.060]   Remember, brothers, you cannot have a high view of Christ and a low view of the church
[00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:48.680]   at the same time, and a high view of the church will be reflected not merely in our preaching,
[00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:57.340]   but also in our prayers.
[00:23:57.340 --> 00:24:05.360]   We should not just preach as faithful servants of Christ, we should pray as faithful servants
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:08.080]   of Christ.
[00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:13.400]   And after these notes about the servanthood of Epaphras, I think the meat of the matter
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:21.040]   is secondly the struggle of Epaphras.
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:26.880]   Epaphras says, verse 12, "Who is one of you, a servant of Christ Jesus?
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:28.520]   He greets you."
[00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:35.780]   Again, this is basically what you have in the text, but don't minimize what's going
[00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:36.780]   on here.
[00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:41.440]   It's more than, you know, "Yeah, before I close, I want y'all to know Epaphras said
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:45.080]   'What's up?'"
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:52.200]   The word is a strong word, it means "to welcome, to receive, to embrace."
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:25:11.180]   But how could Epaphras embrace the church when he was not present?
[00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:20.620]   Verse 12 answers, "He's always struggling on your behalf in his prayers that you may
[00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:27.540]   stand mature and fully assured in all the will of God."
[00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:33.180]   What a statement.
[00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:38.460]   I want to lean into this statement.
[00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:45.060]   I want you to, on one hand, see the manner of pastoral intercession, and on the other
[00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:50.580]   hand, the motive of pastoral intercession.
[00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:59.540]   Note the manner of pastoral intercession being exemplified here.
[00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:02.460]   Paul first tells us how Epaphras prayed.
[00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:06.740]   He prayed continually, fervently, and selflessly.
[00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:13.340]   First, he prayed continually.
[00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:21.340]   He is always struggling on your behalf in his prayers.
[00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:30.260]   Always doesn't mean that his life was just one unbroken statement of formal prayers.
[00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:39.960]   It is a reference to the regular and repeated prayer life of Epaphras.
[00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:47.420]   It's very likely these two men, Paul and Epaphras, are imprisoned together.
[00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:53.660]   And from their time together, Paul says, "I can tell you.
[00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:59.020]   He's always praying for you."
[00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:08.260]   Brothers, are there people who are part of your regular day-to-day life who never hear
[00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:12.020]   you pray?
[00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:16.500]   I'm not talking about those assigned times in public worship where it is ours to offer
[00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:17.500]   pastoral prayer.
[00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:21.860]   I mean as a mark of your life as a man of God.
[00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:29.980]   Do the people in your life hear you in prayer?
[00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:34.020]   And do they hear you pray enough so that those who live with you could say, as Paul apparently
[00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:41.480]   was able to say here, "I can tell you, I live, I'm with this guy."
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:52.440]   And he is regularly, continuously, ceaselessly praying.
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:54.940]   He's struggling in his prayers.
[00:27:54.940 --> 00:28:00.940]   The language there reminds us that he was praying all kinds of prayers.
[00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:13.500]   Kinds of adoration, confession, thanksgiving, supplication, and intercession.
[00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:16.660]   There are many reasons, brothers, for us to be concerned about what's going on in the
[00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:27.220]   church today and what's going on in the world around us today, but we must not be anxious
[00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:31.660]   about those things.
[00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:37.020]   And Philippians chapter 4 verses 6 and 7 applies to us just as much as it applies to the saints
[00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:39.780]   to which we preach those verses to.
[00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:51.960]   The way to be anxious about nothing is to be prayerful about everything.
[00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:56.900]   He prayed continually, and then he prayed fervently.
[00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:57.900]   What a term here.
[00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:08.420]   He is always struggling on your behalf in his prayers, wrestling, conflicting, fighting
[00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:10.220]   for you in his prayers.
[00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:14.000]   It's the word from which we get our word "agony."
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.980]   It speaks of military combat or athletic competition.
[00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:25.660]   It's the word, a variation of it is used in Luke chapter 22 verse 44 to describe the agony
[00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:30.660]   of Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane.
[00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:36.480]   Paul uses it in Colossians chapter 1 verse 29.
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:42.660]   We know verse 28, "Him we proclaim, warning everyone and teaching everyone in all wisdom
[00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:45.620]   that we may present everyone mature in Christ."
[00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:54.560]   But then he says in verse 29, "For this reason, I toil, struggling with all his energy that
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:59.540]   he powerfully works in me."
[00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:03.380]   The language is used in chapter 2 verse 1 as well.
[00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:07.180]   It's used in Colossians 1 29 for his preaching.
[00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:12.860]   I believe it is used in chapter 2 verse 1 for his prayers, for I want you to know how
[00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:18.340]   great a struggle I have for you and for those that lay out to see you and for all who have
[00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:21.460]   not seen me face to face.
[00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:27.940]   And basically now he's affirming that he and Epaphras are kindred spirits.
[00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:38.780]   He says in verse 12, "He is always struggling on your behalf in his prayers."
[00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:42.620]   These men were struggling.
[00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:50.220]   It's a picture of stress and strain and struggle in prayer.
[00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:55.380]   This passage has been living with me these opening months of the year.
[00:30:55.380 --> 00:31:05.380]   There are those of us in this room who struggle at prayer.
[00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:09.540]   So who of us can be said, "They're always struggling in prayer for the saints."
[00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:23.140]   Laboring, wrestling, struggling in prayer on the behalf of the people of God to which
[00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:27.540]   we have been called.
[00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:29.820]   Mark it down, brothers.
[00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:31.660]   This is the proper spirit of prayer.
[00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:39.380]   Your prayers will mean nothing to God until they mean everything to you.
[00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:44.420]   James 5:16 says it this way, "The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth
[00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:47.580]   much."
[00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:50.580]   Prayer shouldn't be this take it or leave it thing.
[00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:55.780]   Prayer should not be approached as some burdensome duty, it should be approached as a wonderful
[00:31:55.780 --> 00:32:01.420]   privilege.
[00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:07.140]   We should labor in it, wrestle in it, for the sake of the truth.
[00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:11.220]   This prayer advertises our dependence upon God.
[00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:13.100]   He prayed continually, fervently.
[00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:14.780]   He also prayed selflessly.
[00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:18.940]   It's one thing to struggle for yourself in your prayers, but he is struggling for others
[00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:21.540]   in his prayers.
[00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:26.380]   He's struggling for the church in his prayers.
[00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:30.940]   Most likely he is in a difficult situation himself along with the Apostle Paul, but there
[00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:38.220]   is some holy sense of self-forgetfulness that allows him to concentrate his labors in prayer
[00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:41.620]   for the sake of the saints.
[00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:48.940]   There was a time when the farmers and their families would regularly pray, "Lord, hear
[00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:51.620]   not the prayers of a traveling man."
[00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:56.140]   Do you get it?
[00:32:56.140 --> 00:33:00.420]   Hear not the prayers of a traveling man.
[00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:04.920]   The farmers would pray that because a traveling man walking through the village, walking through
[00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:12.740]   the town, would pray for sunshine because he doesn't walk in the rain.
[00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:19.620]   And he would pray for sunshine with no concern that without the rain, the harvest wouldn't
[00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:29.220]   come that was needed for that community to survive.
[00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:36.500]   Local pastors are to pray like a family man, not a traveling man.
[00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:45.860]   Yes, James 4, 2, you have not because you do not ask, James 4, 3, but when you ask,
[00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:56.660]   you don't get it because you ask wrongly to spend it on your own passions.
[00:33:56.660 --> 00:34:02.620]   And so we see the manner of intercessory prayer, but the heart of this I want you to see is
[00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:10.300]   the motive of intercessory prayer.
[00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:13.740]   After telling us how he prays, he tells us what he prays.
[00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:19.020]   And by what he prays, this is not a prayer report like you find in chapter 1.
[00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:24.060]   This is not a statement of the content of his prayers as much as it is a statement of
[00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:30.180]   the concern of his prayers.
[00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:36.520]   And what you will see here is, again, what is modeled in chapter 1, that the consuming
[00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:47.860]   concern of Epaphras' prayer for the saints is not material or financial or circumstantial.
[00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:54.580]   He prays with spiritual priorities.
[00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:58.740]   Paul says as it were, "I'm listening to him pray," and I can tell you, he's always struggling
[00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:07.140]   on your behalf in his prayers, and the obvious concern of his prayers is that you may stand
[00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:17.420]   mature and fully assured in all the will of God.
[00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:24.780]   So he was praying for their stability, their maturity, and their certainty.
[00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:33.440]   First he was praying for their stability, that you stand, that you literally stand firm
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:41.620]   with all of the error and confusion and untruth of the false teachers that would lead them
[00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:45.300]   astray in their belief and in their behavior.
[00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:57.540]   He says that Epaphras is praying for you, that you stand firm, that you stand your ground,
[00:35:57.540 --> 00:36:05.300]   that you are unmoved from the foundation of the truth upon which you stand.
[00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:13.540]   Indeed, truth indeed triumphs through proclamation, saints, but here again we're reminded how truth
[00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:24.320]   triumphs through prayer, because we can't do the Lord's work in our own strength.
[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:29.220]   Ephesians 6, "Be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might.
[00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:33.860]   Put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the
[00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:38.980]   devil, for we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against
[00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:44.340]   the authorities, against the cosmic powers of this present darkness, against spiritual
[00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:48.740]   forces of evil in the heavenly places.
[00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:52.500]   Therefore take up the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day
[00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:56.140]   and having done all to stand firm."
[00:36:56.140 --> 00:37:02.060]   So he prays for their stability, and then he prays for their maturity, that you stand
[00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:08.460]   perfect, that you stand complete, that you stand mature.
[00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:13.980]   Of course, this is not a reference to sinless perfection.
[00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:22.860]   It is a reference to spiritual maturity.
[00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:27.820]   Second Peter 3:18 commands, "But grow in the grace and knowledge of the Lord Jesus
[00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:28.820]   Christ."
[00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:38.500]   Authentic Christians are growing Christians, and we should constantly be praying that our
[00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:54.260]   people would mature in the faith, mature in godliness, mature in Christlikeness.
[00:37:54.260 --> 00:38:02.820]   Colossians chapter 1 verse 28, as I already mentioned, Paul says, "Him we proclaim," warning
[00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:10.480]   everyone and teaching everyone that everyone is significant, unlike those false teachers.
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:22.420]   He does not believe that the truth is for a select few.
[00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:30.140]   But the goal is not just to get lost people saved, it is to get lost people saved, absolutely.
[00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:39.580]   But Paul did not want the church to be a nursery that caters to immature, carnal-minded babies
[00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:47.220]   who refuse to grow up.
[00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:49.900]   He doesn't say we want to present saved people.
[00:38:49.900 --> 00:39:00.800]   We want to present, he says, everyone mature in Christ, growing in Christ.
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:12.420]   My son H.B. III, that's his name, my daddy did it to me, I did it to him.
[00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:20.700]   I was gone on a trip, I was gone on a trip, I wasn't to be gone from Los Angeles to Atlanta
[00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:24.820]   for 24 hours.
[00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:35.580]   And he showed up two months premature.
[00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:39.980]   I found out when I sat down in the pulpit in Atlanta, I caught the first flight home,
[00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:52.500]   rushed to check on my wife and to see my baby boy.
[00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:59.820]   And my son, premature son, I was so happy he was mine, he was the most beautiful thing
[00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:00.820]   I'd ever seen.
[00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:06.180]   It was cords and all kinds of stuff, but he was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen.
[00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:16.260]   And we took that baby home, pale white.
[00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:21.180]   And he stayed that way for a while.
[00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:30.060]   And I said, Miss Charles, I said, Miss Charles, Miss Charles, this cat better get some color
[00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:44.700]   on him real soon or we got something to talk about.
[00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:56.140]   I love him all the more now, not just because he's mine, but because he looks like me.
[00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:58.380]   He acts like me.
[00:40:58.380 --> 00:41:01.300]   He wants to be with me.
[00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:02.940]   He got his own job and money.
[00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:10.740]   He calls me now not to ask for anything, just to tell me he loves his old man.
[00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:15.380]   Saints, this is what God wants for the church.
[00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:24.100]   Yes, God loves those who are born again because they're his.
[00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:33.540]   But we must preach in such a way and we must pray in such a way that the church is growing,
[00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:40.800]   Ephesians 4, into the fullness of the measure of the stature of Christ.
[00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:46.220]   So he prays for their stability, their maturity, and their certainty.
[00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:59.160]   He prays that they would be fully assured, fully persuaded, fully convinced.
[00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:04.520]   Is this not what's desperately needed in these days for our local churches?
[00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:09.260]   Our people need to know what they believe and they need to know why they believe what
[00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:11.820]   they believe.
[00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:20.060]   Yes, we should preach to that end, but we should pray to that end, that they would be
[00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:23.580]   fully assured in all the will of God.
[00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:30.220]   I believe this phrase "all the will of God" is a synonym here for the gospel.
[00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:38.980]   All the will of God is a statement about the sufficiency of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:46.480]   He is affirming that Colossians 2 verse 3, that in Christ are hidden all the treasures
[00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:50.220]   of wisdom and knowledge.
[00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:53.060]   You don't have to go looking around for the will of God.
[00:42:53.060 --> 00:43:00.640]   All you need to know about God's will is found in Jesus.
[00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:03.020]   We should pray like that.
[00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:09.060]   That's how Paul prays in chapter 1 verse 9, "And so from the day we heard, we have not
[00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:14.560]   ceased to pray for you, asking that you may be filled with the knowledge of His will in
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:20.900]   all spiritual wisdom and understanding, so that you may walk in a manner worthy of the
[00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:26.980]   Lord, fully pleasing to Him, bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge
[00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:33.540]   of God."
[00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:36.700]   Quickly let me note thoroughly for you verse 13.
[00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:41.100]   We've seen the servanthood of Epaphras, we've seen the struggle of Epaphras, may I show
[00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:45.760]   you the sacrifice of Epaphras.
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:50.200]   Verse 12 is a greeting from Epaphras to the Colossians.
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:59.820]   Verse 13 is a commendation of Epaphras from Paul.
[00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:03.820]   I bear him witness.
[00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:08.860]   This is a solemn declaration that Paul uses to introduce important things he says, but
[00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:18.100]   here he uses it to introduce the commendation of his brother pastor.
[00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:31.660]   Just in case you question what I said in verse 12, you could call me to the witness stand,
[00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:40.700]   and I can witness that he has worked hard for you and for those in Laodicea and in Herapolis.
[00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:46.660]   This is still a statement about his prayer.
[00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:49.460]   He sacrificed for the local church and for the global church.
[00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:52.460]   Let me show you that quickly.
[00:44:52.460 --> 00:45:00.780]   I can bear him witness, he says, how much he sacrificed for the local church that he
[00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:02.620]   is a part of and serves.
[00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:05.660]   He has worked hard for you.
[00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:14.900]   It's a reference to great toil and strenuous labor that results in severe pain.
[00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:23.020]   He may have been with Paul under house arrest in Rome, so this may not refer, however, to
[00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:30.620]   any physical pain, but no doubt I believe it refers to mental and emotional and spiritual
[00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:38.460]   toil in prayer for the sake of the saints.
[00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:40.220]   You've heard it said, "Give till it hurts."
[00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:49.180]   Have you ever heard it said, "Pray till it hurts."
[00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:54.580]   There are many people abandoning the church, claiming "church hurt."
[00:45:54.580 --> 00:46:00.380]   Paul here redefines "church hurt."
[00:46:00.380 --> 00:46:06.460]   He intentionally suffered severe pain and intercessory prayer on your behalf.
[00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:17.820]   He knelt long so that you may stand firm.
[00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:18.820]   I need to rush on.
[00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:22.100]   There's a lot to criticize in our churches, there's a lot to criticize in the culture
[00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:26.900]   around our church, but I just want to ask you, brothers, are you praying as much as
[00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:35.940]   you are criticizing?
[00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:42.040]   It's cheap work to criticize.
[00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:55.060]   It's hard work to pray.
[00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:57.860]   A dry city finally allowed liquor.
[00:46:57.860 --> 00:47:03.700]   A man quickly built a bar there, and the church couldn't do anything legally about it, but
[00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:10.020]   they decided to have an all-night prayer meeting, asking God to intervene about this bar that
[00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:12.260]   had opened up in their town.
[00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:19.940]   And after that all-night prayer meeting, a few days later, a storm occurred and lightning
[00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:27.860]   struck that bar and it burned down.
[00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:39.140]   The bar owner, hearing about the prayer meeting, sued the church.
[00:47:39.140 --> 00:47:46.460]   The church got a lawyer who diligently argued that there's no direct correlation between
[00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:52.540]   that prayer meeting and that fire.
[00:47:52.540 --> 00:47:56.500]   The judge said, "I'll give my verdict under advisement."
[00:47:56.500 --> 00:48:03.860]   After hearing both sides, he says, "But before I give the verdict, what is obvious is that
[00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:17.580]   apparently this bar owner believes in prayer more than this local church."
[00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:26.600]   Do you really believe, brothers, that God still hears and answers prayer?
[00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:30.740]   Then labor hard in believing prayer for your local church, and not just—I'm wrapping
[00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:36.660]   up now—He not only sacrificed for the local church, He also sacrificed—I love this—for
[00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:39.580]   the global church, if I may say it this way.
[00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:47.780]   He's worked hard not just for you, but for the other churches in the Licus Valley, for
[00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:53.460]   the church at Laodicea, and for the church at Hierapolis.
[00:48:53.460 --> 00:48:57.800]   Paul wrote this letter to the church at Colossae.
[00:48:57.800 --> 00:49:07.740]   Verse 16 tells us that he wrote a letter to the church at Laodicea that he wanted read
[00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:10.500]   in Colossae.
[00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:17.220]   Here is the only reference to the church at Hierapolis in the New Testament.
[00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:22.500]   We don't know what was in that letter of Paul to the Laodiceans, but we do know about another
[00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:29.860]   email they got in Revelation chapter 3, where they are rebuked and warned to repent of their
[00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:33.100]   lukewarmness.
[00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:39.880]   It is possible that Epaphras started all three of these churches.
[00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:47.180]   We can't say that for sure, but we can say with certainty that he labored in prayer for
[00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:51.660]   all of these churches.
[00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:53.660]   He was a part of the church at Colossae.
[00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:55.420]   He's one of you.
[00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:59.460]   Hear me, brothers.
[00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:11.620]   And he did not view his church to be in competition with other local churches.
[00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:16.700]   Like Paul, 2 Corinthians 11, 28, he had anxiety, concern for all the churches.
[00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:22.140]   I just want to close reminding us of that, brothers.
[00:50:22.140 --> 00:50:24.660]   We're not in competition with each other.
[00:50:24.660 --> 00:50:27.740]   We're on the same team.
[00:50:27.740 --> 00:50:41.260]   And as corrupt as our society is, we need every church to be as healthy as it can be.
[00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:48.820]   The world at its worst needs the church at its best.
[00:50:48.820 --> 00:51:03.820]   And so with confidence that truth triumphs, may we preach courageously and pray continually.
[00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:14.260]   May we preach mightily and pray militantly.
[00:51:14.260 --> 00:51:24.780]   May we preach steadfastly and pray strategically.
[00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:29.140]   What a friend we have in Jesus.
[00:51:29.140 --> 00:51:33.940]   All our sins and griefs to bear.
[00:51:33.940 --> 00:51:40.580]   What a privilege it is to carry everything to God in prayer.
[00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:45.940]   Oh, what peace we often forfeit.
[00:51:45.940 --> 00:51:52.580]   Oh, what needless pains we bear.
[00:51:52.580 --> 00:52:05.020]   All because we do not carry everything to God in prayer.
[00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:11.140]   Thank you for your Word, Lord.
[00:52:11.140 --> 00:52:20.860]   I pray that as a result of our time together here this week, you will help us to go home
[00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:24.460]   and preach the Word.
[00:52:24.460 --> 00:52:29.900]   Being ready in season and out of season, rebuking, reproving, and exhorting with complete patience
[00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:31.540]   and teaching.
[00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:42.120]   But Lord, may we also go home to always be struggling on the behalf of the saints in
[00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:50.140]   our prayers that they may stand mature and fully assured in all the will of God.
[00:52:50.140 --> 00:52:52.420]   To the praise of your glory, amen.
[00:52:52.420 --> 00:52:53.420]   Amen.
[00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:54.420]   Amen.
[00:52:54.420 --> 00:52:54.420]   Amen.
[00:52:54.420 --> 00:53:04.420]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
