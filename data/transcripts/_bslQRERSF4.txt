[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.280]   - All right, the next question is about your reading habits
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.960]   and a lot of people are interested in that sort of thing.
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.760]   And this has a twist, so we'll hear what it says.
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.000]   - Hi Cal, this is Emily
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.740]   and I'm a grad student in molecular biology.
[00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:17.860]   I have a problem with reading
[00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.520]   that I've never heard you discuss.
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.160]   I read obsessively and I have since I was a child.
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.920]   I enjoy this, but if I'm not careful,
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.560]   it harms the rest of my life.
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.740]   I don't sleep enough, I neglect responsibilities,
[00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.100]   I even miss work.
[00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.120]   Even if I manage to put a book down halfway through,
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.000]   thoughts of it can distract me for hours.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.060]   In order to focus on finishing my PhD,
[00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.600]   I've seriously restricted my reading for pleasure.
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.000]   This year, the majority of my reading
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.560]   has been either books I've read before
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.600]   or books that I find a bit dull,
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.940]   which allows me to stop reading when appropriate.
[00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.480]   On rare occasions, I'll take a Saturday
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.020]   to devour something new,
[00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.500]   but mostly I see this restriction
[00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.100]   as temporary but necessary.
[00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.000]   Your usual advice of carving out time
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.020]   for reading every day sounds dangerous for me.
[00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.640]   So I'm curious if you have any tips
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.000]   or alternate approaches to manage my experience.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.840]   Thanks.
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.540]   - Well, Emily, it's a good question.
[00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.580]   Just as a brief aside before I get to your question,
[00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.200]   when we were having like a little bit of a delay
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.760]   just there getting the call to work,
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.640]   it was reminding me, Jesse, of last week,
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.760]   the avalanche of technical errors
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.320]   that the listener did not realize was occurring.
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.160]   - That was funny.
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.880]   I made a list and I told several people about it
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.160]   like over the weekend, it was funny.
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.240]   - Yeah, Jesse made a list because thing after thing,
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.640]   we record these live, thing after thing was going wrong
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.200]   and it was so many things going wrong
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.700]   that Jesse started writing them down.
[00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.400]   But like, let's see if I had this straight.
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.460]   I was like asking you, so at some point,
[00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.860]   I was asking you about Blinkist, one of our sponsors,
[00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.520]   and you were trying to log in the Blinkist and-
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.360]   - That was so funny.
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.500]   So you're asking me what Blinks I read
[00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.840]   and you're like, log in to Blinkist
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.540]   and tell me what you see on the homepage.
[00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.240]   So I go to Blinkist.com,
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.320]   but it's like, enter your login information.
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.240]   So I like, 'cause I logged in on another computer.
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.560]   So I had to like go to my password document, look that up.
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.840]   But then as soon as that's happening,
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.800]   like this laptop isn't great.
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.360]   Sometimes like the browser's crashed, it crashed.
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.240]   You're still asking me, I'm trying to like play it off.
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.080]   I like seeing-
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.440]   - And by the way, the browser is needed for playing the calls
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.220]   so like the browser crashing now has like a big implication
[00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.920]   because now he can't play more calls.
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.880]   So yeah, and I'm talking to him at this time.
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.280]   - Yeah, so I'm trying to like play it off,
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.440]   tell you what Blinkist I was reading.
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.640]   Like I was trying to think about the one that I was reading,
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.000]   but I'm entering this so I could get it in.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.520]   - Yeah, and then at some point
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.320]   you're stuck in a captcha, right?
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.760]   - Yeah, oh yeah, I forgot about that.
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:32.600]   - Vertical rivers.
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.320]   - So I get in there like, yeah,
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.840]   identify 10 vertical rivers.
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.880]   I was telling my buddy who does like online stuff
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.200]   and he's like, I had the same thing that day.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.880]   - So all this is going on.
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.200]   He has to get the next question queued up.
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.760]   He's trying to talk to me on camera
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.640]   and he has to identify vertical rivers
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.560]   from a large picture of,
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.720]   a large array of images of vertical rivers.
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.960]   So anyways, that's why we pay you $250,000 a month
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.000]   because this is,
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.400]   that's why you get all that sweet, sweet
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.040]   athletic greens money because it's a hard job.
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.320]   - And then when we came in, you were kind of in a rush,
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.240]   but I couldn't do anything because the mouse had died.
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.120]   - The mouse died and the soundboard broke.
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.000]   Remember the soundboard was giving static,
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.280]   like just a loud, large, loud static.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.000]   And yeah, man, that was not our day.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.840]   So we're doing pretty well.
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.040]   All we had was like one delayed call so far.
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.560]   So we're doing pretty well.
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.920]   All right, Emily, let's get to your question though.
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.080]   It's completely fine.
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.680]   What you're describing is completely fine.
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.200]   You're finding the types of books you're reading
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.680]   lead to compulsive reading.
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.800]   So you're doing less so that you can focus on other things.
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.640]   That's fine.
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.360]   Don't read every day if it's creating that compulsion.
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.000]   And I think you've already landed on three solutions.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.080]   One, titrating your reading to the situation.
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.360]   So you're up to your ears and working on a dissertation.
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.920]   So maybe you're reading less stuff
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.640]   that's unrelated to the dissertation.
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.760]   That's fine.
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.080]   Two, have a reading day.
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.680]   So if you like to do compulsive reading
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.760]   where you dive into something,
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.960]   you're like, yeah, I look forward to Saturdays
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.320]   and I go somewhere cool, like a coffee shop to start.
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.320]   And then I go hiking and read and I can devour a whole book
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.840]   and it's part of a really enriching, meaningful ritual.
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.480]   I think that's great.
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.560]   And then three, be careful about your book selection.
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.440]   Right?
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.560]   Because reading is reading, reading is good.
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.080]   It's your mind having to engage
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.280]   with complex thought structures.
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.040]   So yeah, read the boringer books.
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.680]   If it's novels that really catch your attention,
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.360]   then like, okay, I'm going to read a long history
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.880]   of World War I or something like that.
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.040]   So that you can still maybe have some of this exercise,
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.660]   but to be very careful about what you choose,
[00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.020]   I think is fine.
[00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.120]   This is much more minor than what you're talking about,
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.080]   but I do not like, for example, apocalyptic fiction.
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.480]   My brain gets too into it and gets concerned.
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.360]   It presses anxiety buttons or this or that.
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.840]   I don't like that.
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.800]   So I just don't read those type of books.
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.240]   I don't read, I'm not going to read World War Z.
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.540]   I don't want to read apocalyptic tales of, you know,
[00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.800]   the earth becoming uninhabitable and everyone died.
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.240]   Maybe it's just hitting a little bit too close
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.080]   to home these days.
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.360]   So I avoid those types of books.
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.720]   Julie was really pushing on me like,
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:12.840]   oh, you should read Station Eleven.
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.040]   I was like, I can't read Station Eleven right now.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.440]   I can't read a book about a viral pandemic
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.360]   that kills most of the people on earth.
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.800]   Like, I don't want to read that right now.
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.320]   Just like with the stuff going on in Europe right now,
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.880]   I'm not going to read, you know, On the Beach,
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.940]   Neville shoots On the Beach, for example.
[00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.960]   Although it's kind of a cool book.
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.320]   Have you heard of that book, Jesse?
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.160]   - No.
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.760]   - There's a nuclear war and it follows,
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.660]   there's a crew on a submarine.
[00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.040]   So like, they're alive, obviously,
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.480]   because they were underwater in a submarine.
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.460]   And they're like going around trying to find,
[00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.040]   they end up in Australia,
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.440]   'cause like the whole world's been destroyed.
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.200]   And they kind of end up in Australia
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.520]   because the nuclear winter cloud hasn't come there,
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.340]   but they know the nuclear winter cloud is on its way.
[00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.840]   And it's like, they're trying to just find civilization.
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.920]   I found the beginning of Seveneves too apocalyptic.
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.680]   I was like, oh, I had to get through that pretty quickly.
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.200]   I don't like that whole, the hard rain is coming.
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.120]   And I'll tell you the flaw in that,
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.900]   plot flaw is it was symbolic,
[00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.500]   but they had this orchestra playing
[00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.380]   in like Canterbury Cathedral
[00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.280]   as the hard rain was about to come.
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.940]   Like, we're gonna play this concert
[00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:25.580]   and we're just gonna die as we play it.
[00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:29.340]   So like, we go out like celebrating humanity's greatest art
[00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.100]   as the hard rain comes.
[00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:31.940]   I don't buy it.
[00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:33.700]   They're all gonna be with their families, right?
[00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.180]   I don't think they're gonna be like, sorry, family.
[00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.020]   Like, I'm gonna spend my last time like rehearsing
[00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.880]   and playing in an orchestra with people.
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:40.780]   So I thought that was a flaw.
[00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:42.020]   But anyways, the point is Emily,
[00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.960]   I can't read apocalyptic fiction and it's small,
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.100]   but I don't read it.
[00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.380]   So read the stuff that's working for you right now.
[00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.340]   Titrate, absolutely.
[00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.060]   Have a reading day.
[00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:53.900]   All of that's good.
[00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:55.080]   You're working on dissertation.
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.380]   You don't have to worry about your brain
[00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.700]   not getting worked out right now, right?
[00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.940]   It's like when you're training for a marathon,
[00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:05.020]   it's okay to let your Peloton habit go lax for a while.
[00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:06.300]   You're getting enough of that.
[00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.100]   So do not think of my daily reading
[00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:12.700]   or this many books a month as gospel you have to follow.
[00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.580]   Build the thing that makes sense for you.
[00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:18.160]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.740]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:22.420]   (upbeat music)
